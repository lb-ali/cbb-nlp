_MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE_  
  

Louisville - 71  
UConn - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll transition immediately to the Louisville Cardinals, head
coach Rick Pitino, student athletes Russ Smith and Montrezl Harrell. Coach,
your comments on today's game.  
COACH PITINO: We're super excited to win our third straight championship, to
win a regular season championship and a tournament championship back‑to‑back
is not easy. You have to have special players and these two epitomize exactly
that. We played great defense tonight for most of the night. We didn't have it
offensively. You general can tell when we play well because we have 17 to 25
assists. We weren't passing the ball like we have been. We had a great run in
February, a great run in Marchand everybody knows about the press and
everybody knows about talent, but what's made us special is our passing and
tonight we didn't have the passing, the passing wasn't there.  
That was the greatest thing I told the guys in winning the championship. You
learned the most valuable lesson why you didn't click for forty minutes
offensively because the passing wasn't there with only 11 assists. But these
two guys were spectacular, Montrezl is similar to Gorgui, he came in a very
good athlete and he will leave us someday as a very good basketball because
his passing and shooting skills may be the smartest player on the team in
terms of a scouting report, certainly no words to describe Russ Smith. He just
is having a spectacular senior year.  
  
Q. Andy Katz said on TV that you said you thought you guys deserved a 1
seed. Is that what you said and do you think it will happen?  
COACH PITINO: Well, I judge it from the eye test. Now, understand something,
every analyst has an agenda, every coach has an agenda. I think it because I
was there at SMU in the ugliest environment in 39 years, I was there at
Cincinnati in the most hostile environment. I've been there with a run through
March, I know what the guys have been through.  
Do I think we should be, yes, do I think we will be, no. That being said, if
you ask me who is the best college basketball player in America, I would say
Russ Smith if you ask me who is the best power forward I would say Montrezl
Harrell, so I have an extremely biased opinion, but I'm impressed with our
guys and what they have done to win a regular season, the conference
tournament, the way we have done it in the fashion we have done it fits the
eye test. I can't talk about the strength of the league. If you want to blame
anybody blame football, don't blame us.  
  
Q. Coach, what is it that you tell your team going into Marchfor them to get
on high street because y'all have done it the past two years, the beginning or
middle of Februaryyou all get hot and carry it into Marchand on into April.  
COACH PITINO: Well, I think it's recruiting quality people, and then the older
guys convinced Terry Rozier and Chris Jones, look at the transformation in
Chris Jones in less than a year from buying into what Louisville is all about.
It's all about winning, playing for the name on the front and we always take
the philosophy if you play for the name on the front the name on the back gets
rewarded. That's been our theme. I think our guys understand it. We did not
pass the ball well tonight but outside of that, we understand why you play the
game and we play extremely hard for all the right reasons, and Russ comes in
and immediately grabs a freshman and I remember going back two years ago in
the Big East Championship, he's screaming at me from the foul line, "I've
never won a championship, I've never won a championship!" Now look at him, not
only does he have multiple MVP's, multiple College All‑Americans, National
Championship, back‑to‑back final fours, his legacy is pretty incredible, all
coming from a guy who just scored a lot of points in high school, but didn't
win anything, didn't even win a scratch ticket.  
  
Q. Rick, you won these three games by a total of 100 points, and there was a
time ‑out with will 11 minutes left up by 17 and you are laying into your guys
pretty hard. Tim Henderson talked about how guys are afraid of getting
screamed at when you are up 50 or 60 points. What is that attitude and what
are you trying to convey?   
COACH PITINO: I'm not personalizing my voice, I'm telling them that regardless
of the score, the game must be played a certain way because if we would have
passed the ball tonight like we did in a close, hard‑fought game we would have
lost the game. So you're preparing and trying to be fundamentally sound all
the time. It's not a‑‑ like I told Russ, it was one on four and I said let's
take the ball out and run our back screen action and use clock. We weren't
going to lose that game but I want our guys if we're in a tight game to
understand what we take and don't take.  
  
Q. Why do you think your teams tend to peak this time of the year?  
COACH PITINO: I think it's a system of recruiting the right people. It takes a
while to do that, by the way. My best team did not get to a Final Four, got to
an Elite Eight, because‑‑ even with the team that lost to Moorehead State
totally bought into the name on the front. These guys buy into it totally and
the team that lost in the Elite Eight didn't, that's why we got beat by a good
Michigan State team.  
So it's our philosophy, we know we can lose, we respect everybody, we are a
humble group, these guys buy into that name on the front. That's why I'm so
hard on them in the time outs, because they didn't pass the ball tonight. Luke
Hancock was off, wasn't playing well. He took bad shots to try and play well
rather than pass the ball, use his teammates, get the ball back, he would have
had a good night so even the wise people learned a valuable lesson tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, you have had a Hall of Fame career, you flirted in 2011 with
coaching the Puerto Rican team. Seeing your future coaching the National Team,
U.S. National Team or another team to further your trophy case?  
COACH PITINO: I wanted to coach the Puerto Rican national team very much.
Unfortunately they changed the date as well as the place. It was supposed to
be played in Puerto Rico and they moved it to Brazil and they changed the date
to when school started. I was looking forward to it because it was something I
had not done. If the situation arises again and they would like to have me, I
would love to do it.  
  
Q. Russ, besides the national championships, the conference championships,
and the individual awards, what else do you feel like you have accomplished
during your four years at Louisville?  
RUSS SMITH: I feel like I've accomplished meeting a bunch of new people,
making a lot of connections, getting an education, and living out a college
athlete's life. I have a lot of fun being Louisville and it's probably one of
the best places ever. I always invite my friends to come and just stay with
me.  
Just the whole college experience is fun and my teammates. Besides the
individual awards and the accolades, I remember I went through that whole time
last year about what I wanted to do, even though I had almost done everything
a college athlete on the court could have done. There was some things I was
missing, being a senior on campus, my teammates, helping new freshmen grow so
a bunch of maturity points that I wanted to get better in helped me a lot.  
  
Q. Montrezl, you guys have won, starting with SMU, the last five games,
averaging 30 per game. What have you guys done to accomplish this stretch?  
MONTREZL HARRELL: We take it one game at a time and we buy into Coach's game
plan. We try to focus on the defensive end because we know if we get a
defensive start that's going to lead to our offensive break. Look at our
scouting report, paying attention to every little thing to win the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you very much.

### [DeAndre Daniels](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26735)

### [Shabazz Napier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22172)

### [Kevin Ollie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24199)

  
_MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE_  
  

Louisville - 71  
UConn - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We can get started with UConn, head coach, Kevin Ollie, student
athletes Shabazz Napier and DeAndre Daniels. Coach?  
COACH OLLIE: The first half we came out and established ourselves, we got down
about 14 and anytime you spot a team like Louisville 14 points it's hard to
come back. We did some good things in the second half. I was proud of our guys
that we kept fighting. Now we go into the next tournament. We want to win a
national championship. I still believe in this team, we got to clean things up
but I like our execution in the second half and we got to show heart and
compete and that's what I like and hopefully it carries over to the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. Shabazz, seemed like you had a difficult time doing what getting things
done on offense, was it just that you couldn't find your rhythm?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: The first half we didn't play as well as we should have, we
didn't move the ball the right way, we didn't knock down open shots. We just
didn't find our rhythm.  
They did play great defense but once we got into the middle, guys were open
for shots and we couldn't knock 'em down and we gave up too much offensive
rebounds in the beginning of the game. It took away from our offense.  
  
Q. Shabazz, you guys went 3 ‑0 against Memphis, Louisville went 3‑0 against
you, all of the teams that have been ranked, what do you make of that?   
SHABAZZ NAPIER: Just competitive games. Sometimes it goes that way. The saying
is you can't beat a team three times in a row but at the end of the day it's
anybody's game. It's a new day. They came out and established what they were
doing and we wasn't able to do what we wanted to do offensively and
defensively, but credit to Louisville they played great.  
  
Q. Kevin, I know you're not into moral victories, but playing so much better
than you did a week ago. You take some positives out of that obviously and you
didn't let it get away from you like it did last week?  
COACH OLLIE: No, I'm not into moral victories, but I did like how we responded
the second half, just with the ball movement we had, getting Amida going, he
had 14 points, most of them came in the second half. He started to establish
himself. That's how you beat the zone, you get it at the high post and you
make plays. Our guards started passing it in there and we started making
shots. That's what we're going to need to do going forward so we will be able
to play with a match‑up zone. You never know what's going to happen in the
NCAA Tournament. Every coach comes with something new. I thought our ballwas
great and we started making shoots. We got 10 assists. Six in the second half,
we got four in the first half, and that's improvement. We're going to go back
and see who we going to play on Sunday. Then my coaching staff is going to
have a great game plan and I know our guys are going to follow it and we're
going to go deep into this tournament. That's our goal.  
  
Q. What was the difference between last week and today?  
COACH OLLIE: They won the game. If you win by 10 or lose by‑‑ you win the
game. Wasn't no difference. We had that game by 7 at Louisville and didn't get
it done. It's a game of runs. We try to keep them at bay as much as possible
but at the end of the day you gotta rebound and can't give up 16 offensive
rebounds and expect to win. I thought our defense was great in the second half
where we held them down to 32% and shot 50%. That's something we are going to
look at on the tape and try to keep improving. I liked the ball movement and
the competitive spirit. We could have gave in, but this team is not like that.
We fought all year and I think they're going to fight in the NCAA Tournament.
I'm proud of them. We didn't come down here just to win a semifinals game. We
came down here to win a championship. It didn't happen but I think our guys
gave it their all and they play with their hearts and that's all I ask of
these guys each and every day.  
  
Q. Kevin, anything can happen over the next few weeks, I know you're only
concerned about your own team but does it seem like Louisville is playing
better than anyone else in the country at this point?  
COACH OLLIE: Yeah, Louisville is playing great basketball. They won the
championship last year, they went to the Final Four the year before, and they
got pretty much their whole team back. They're an experienced bunch, they play
hard and they're well coached. But you know how this tournament is one game
elimination, somebody can get hot and hopefully that team will be us and we
will get hot and play together.  
  
Q. How do you guys feel heading into Selection Sunday and the tournament
about how you're playing?  
DeANDREA DANIELS: Well, we feel good just coming in, how we battled this the
second half. We played the right way and shared the ball and we played UConn
basketball. It's time to put it behind and you say move forward and prepare
for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Shabazz, do you think you guys got better from a week ago to ‑‑ through
the three games this week?   
SHABAZZ NAPIER: Yeah, I think there is always room for improvement. After you
lose by 30 points you got to look at yourself and figure out how can you help
the team. I think we definitely played well against Memphis and we played well
against a Cincinnati team but definitely we're improving as a team and we just
got to get over that hump. Once we do, I think we should be fine.  
  
Q. Shabazz, after not being allowed to play in the NCAA Tournament or any
postseason last season, how much have you been look forward to Selection
Sunday and seeing UConn on television tomorrow night?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: I really haven't had time to look for it. Now I do since I'm‑‑
tomorrow is Sunday, but I'm definitely happy. It's a great thing to hopefully
see your name being called and with your teammates and see everybody smiling
and knowing that we have a chance at hoisting another trophy, but I haven't
thought about it because I was thinking about the games ahead of myself. Now
since we just finished this one, you know, we have time to look at it.  
  
Q. Coach, on your roster you have four players that were not born in the
United States and one that's with Puerto Rican descent. Do you look for
players that are maybe overlooked in other teams?  
COACH OLLIE: You know, I look at basketball players. I don't really care about
their descent, I want them to play for UConn and play with pride and bleed
Husky blue. Really doesn't matter to me as long as they play hard and defend
well, I don't care where they come from. We do look at first and foremost
character and we look at guys that understand team work and we look for guys
that don't mind rooting for their teammates.  
After that, you know, we let their talent speak for themselves. But they gotta
play the right way. If they are not playing the right way, they're not going
to play and we're going to get somebody else.  
  
Q. Kevin, this is the last time you will play Louisville for the foreseeable
future. Are you disappointed? Would you like another shot at them? They have
had your number a little bit lately.  
COACH OLLIE: I just play who is on the schedule. We would have liked to have
won this championship game but if Memphis was in the championship game, don't
matter to me. I just make sure we worry about us and that's our main goal. I
wish them the best of luck in the ACC and this American conference is going to
be great. I like what Tulsa is doing, they made it into the NCAA Tournament
and congratulations to Danny Manning and this conference is going to be great.
We are going to continue to hopefully be at the top of this league and keep it
going. We are just going to play the right way and hopefully have everybody
come in and do the same thing and make this league very viable, but I like
what Memphis is doing and SMU is doing and this conference is going to be
great.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, we appreciate your time. Thank you very much.

_MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE_  
  

Louisville - 94  
Houston - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We will get started with the University of Louisville, Head
Coach Rick Pitino, Student Athletes Russ Smith and Luke Hancock. Coach we'll
start with you and get your comments on the evening?  
COACH PITINO: We weren't sharp defensively tonight and when you're not sharp
defensively, you need a great offensive performance and certainly we got that
from Russ, he was brilliant, penetrating, passing, getting in the lane
shooting the ball, he's done it all his senior year with everything that you
could possibly ask of a basketball player in terms of ‑‑ just you know he
deserves to be the ‑‑ I think he's made four or five first team college
All‑Americans, you saw why tonight.  
A great story a skinny, scrawny kid from Brooklyn to a big, strong, tough,
42‑point scorer is an amazing performance.  
  
Q. Rick, Russ had 42 tonight and the school record is 45. Were you aware of
that when you pulled him out?  
COACH PITINO: I was aware afterwards but, really, it's more important that he
doesn't get hurt and we have a chance, than records. He sort of has enough
records right now, and if he did get to 45 he would never pass the ball the
rest of the year so it's a good thing he didn't get the record! (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. Russ, I know you did some interning and broadcasting. If you were a
reporter what would you ask yourself and what would your answer be?  
RUSS SMITH: I would ask myself, what did I eat before the game, or how did the
court feel, how did I feel in warm‑up and I would say I had a good breakfast
this morning, I had a pretty good pre‑game meal, I took a nice nap and that
turned out to be good and as far as the warm‑up line that was great, the rims
looked good and I had a little bounce in my step.  
COACH PITINO: (Snoring noise)  
  
Q. What do you eat?  
RUSS SMITH: Wow I ate a lot! From pasta to chicken, to corn, to asparagus.  
  
Q. Coach, somewhat difficult to answer but if you could a primer for
tomorrow if it's Cincinnati, if it's UConn, how it stacks up for you?  
COACH PITINO: You know two very different teams, one great defensive team, one
great offensive team. One has more offensive weapons, the other has‑‑ they've
a young man that can kill you from the foul line using screens, so two
different teams, both outstanding.  
You know, I have my feeling who is going to win, but I'm not going to say. It
will be an exciting time. You know, we didn't play great defense tonight for
the first time in a long time. We didn't get our defensive numbers but
offensively we were brilliant in passing the basketball and looking for each
other and he was just unbelievable.  
  
Q. Russ, this time a year ago you were deliberating whether you were going
to go pro, you made a difficult decision. Have you had any second thoughts
about that? Having gone through this, becoming an All ‑American and having
another shot at the Final Four what's your perspective on that decision now?
  
RUSS SMITH: Honestly, it never was about, you know, just being nervous about
coming back. It was more so was it the right decision at the time, last year.
Because I didn't want to make a bad decision and come back. But as far as my
game itself, my teammates, the love was there. I was always going to put the
work in. I go to the gym every night and whatever I need to improve on and
Coach insists on I try to do it.  
As far as a player I have tremendous confidence in myself to get better.
Returning back for my senior year I wasn't nervous about performing because I
knew I could perform, and I'm really happy with the decision I made. I've made
a lot of connections, I got a chance to intern, I got a chance to do football
games and just be a college student for the final time, hangout with my
teammates, finish the year out with my guys I came in with, finish the year
out with Coach P. And plus meet new freshman, Terry and Anton, they're great
guys and I'm happy I returned for my senior year.  
  
Q. Coach, are you surprised that this game got away from Houston the way it
did considering your team had your way with them during the season and because
of the upset?  
COACH PITINO: I thought Houston had a very good game plane they pushed the
pace before we could set up our pressure. Guys like Luke and Russ are very
clever basketball players, even Russ stole a page out of Luke tonight with a
ball fake and a shot and made all three free throws. They're very smart
basketball team, great defensively, but Houston‑‑ we're playing very good
basketball right now, our last four games have been terrific so we're playing
very good basketball and we've had an outstanding February, playing well in
March and that's what you wanna do. We know we will have our hands full
tomorrow with either opponent.  
The great thing about these guys is they play every team with great respect
and that's why they haven't been upset this year because the teams they lost
to are all good opponents and they play Houston as if they're UCLA. They play
Rutgers as if they're Kentucky. That's a great quality to have, great quality.  
  
Q. Luke, you've seen Russ a lot throughout your career. I'm curious how you
would describe the performance tonight. As well as you guys are playing how
much fun is it to be on the court with the style of ball you guys play?  
LUKE HANCOCK: You can't describe Russ's game, it's "Russdiculous". The way he
moves and the way he gets to the places he does on the floor and the shots he
gets for himself and for his teammates is unbelievable. Being able to play
with a guy like that makes my job easier, makes our team run smoother.
Sometimes he does some crazy things and sometimes it works, sometimes it
doesn't but that's Russ, we love his game.  
It's nice to be on a roll a little bit right now. We know, like Coach said,
we're looking at every team like they're one of the best in the country and we
need to win. We're trying to be hungry and preparing for everybody like
they're the best.  
  
Q. Talk about during the run in the first half you had, like, three
offensive rebounds off missed free ‑throws, I think you guys got 8 points off
that?  
COACH PITINO: Believe it or not, we probably have worked harder on that in the
past two weeks than any other fundamental in the game. We have a technique
we're using, and Luke got two of them, somebody else got 1.  
LUKE HANCOCK: It was 3, I had 3.  
COACH PITINO: Excuse me! We worked very hard at that and we're excited about
it.  
You know, the other thing that you look at with these guys is how much they're
willing to pass to each other. That's what makes a good offensive basketball
team because we have a high assist total. Since I've been at Louisville I
can't tell you the‑‑ I think it is, but nobody has told me for the points
scored the lowest total of turnovers I've had as a Coach in terms of the
points we're generating so that's good passing, very good fundamentals by the
guys. We don't turn it over very much. And Ralph Willard who really talked me
into taking Russ said this the other day, and I had an argument with him, he
said "Russ will be a much better pro than a college player" and I wasn't
arguing he wasn't going to be a good pro, I said, "Ralph how can he ‑‑ he's
having a first‑team All‑American season, how is that possible?" And he said
I'm telling you, he's a scout for OKC, "Russ Smith is going to be a great pro
because he's unguardable, and now he's learned to pass, he finds open people."
Senior night he decided because he was playing strictly to point he was going
to get his teammates shots and had 13 assists. He's a great steal person. He
plays with an upbeat attitude all the time.  
I don't know if Ralph is going to be right because I don't know if you could
have a better senior year or better career than Russ Smith has had.  
  
Q. Coach, fourth consecutive conference tournament championship game what
are your thoughts?  
COACH PITINO: We're excited about it. We talk about it all season long, about
winning the regular season, winning the conference tournament and going on for
a successful postseason.  
It's very important to us. When you play for a championship, you need to do
everything humanly possible to get it and the guys are preparing to get it. We
know we're going to go against, either UConn or Cincinnati, two great teams,
been ranked all year. We have our hands full but I have a lot of confidence
that our guys‑‑ this championship is very important to them.  
  
Q. Coach, as far as preparing for the postseason, whether it's this
tournament or the next one, does title defense become a part of your Lexicon
when you're talking to these guys or is last year forgotten?  
COACH PITINO: It's a different team but I tell them, look at how much fun we
had last year and we want to experience that again.  
I know they're going to give me extraordinary effort but like anything else,
anything can happen in this tournament. We passed the "eye" test in terms of
the way the guys are playing, we pass the eye test. If I watch Wisconsin or
Florida or Michigan, they all pass the eye test. There are so many teams this
year that pass that eye test that are really, really good. It's going to be a
fun tournament. There will be some 1 seeds, but I don't think you can‑‑
between 1, 2, 3 and 4 seeds I don't think you're going to find too much
difference in any of them.  
  
Q. Russ, you passed three places on the Louisville all ‑time scoring list
tonight. You're now No. 5. How do you think you will be regarded? What is your
legacy?   
RUSS SMITH: When I first came to school, Coach P. used to always say that to
the guys, what is going to be your legacy here? I took as a challenge, not
individually but as far as team work. I wanted to win as much games as
possible. I wanted to get a championship. I never experienced that in high
school, not in AAU, I never played an intricate role on a team that won a
championship. So I made it a personal goal to play a role on a championship
team and I have succeeded in many ways and I'm just thankful that I play for a
coach that has a hunger and drive to win that you won't find nowhere else. I'm
thankful for my teammates because they buy into the system. When you buy into
a system that's been successful, you're going to always be successful. I
personally took that challenge to buy into a system, listen, pay attention and
get better as a player so I'm extremely happy where I'm at.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, we appreciate your time. Thank you very much.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2014

  

### [James Dickey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26662)

### [Danuel House](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26728)

  
_MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE_  
  

Louisville - 94  
Houston - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the University of Houston head coach, James
Dickey, student athletes, Danuel House and TaShawn Thomas. Coach?  
COACH DICKEY: I'm certainly disappointed for our team and for our seniors that
we didn't have a chance to advance. I want to congratulate Louisville, they
played an outstanding game. Rick's got a heck of a team. Russ played‑‑ he was
terrific tonight. We had trouble containing him. He had big shots. Not to take
anything away from what they do because this is the way they play, they create
opportunities off turnovers, and off second‑chance points and they did that,
they got 54 tonight. In the first half I thought there was critical plays,
there was 8 points off free‑throw box outs, Russ hit two three's and Hancock
got a foul on an offensive rebound and made two free throws. So you can't help
them and they're good enough that you don't have to.  
They made it tough on us, defensively they were a little more physical than we
were, and we just never could‑‑ once we got behind in double digits, we could
never make a run at them.  
  
Q. Danuel, could you talk about trying to contain Smith in the open floor
and then when he's got the 3 ‑point shot going as well?   
DANUEL HOUSE: Our goal was to try to stop him before he get a head full of
steam. Certainly he got a head full of steam. As a good player should, he
knocked down the three ball and once that got going we started falling for the
head fake and not guarding the way we were capable of guarding and we just let
him get going.  
COACH DICKEY: I thought he was very balanced. He attacked well in the open
floor, he's great off ball screens. You know, he gets 42 points on 22 shots,
he gets to the free‑throw line. We were talking back in the holding area about
getting to the free‑throw line. He gets to the free‑throw line ten times. He
got his three going as you mentioned, but he is so terrific at driving the
ball and making good decisions with it and really did a good job offensively,
great speed with the ball.  
  
Q. Coach, you think you guys have done enough to get a postseason invite
somewhere?  
COACH DICKEY: We hope so. As I told our guys, we are going to go home and hope
that we get an opportunity to continue to play. I've got two great young
players here that they're going to be special for many years to come. We've
got a locker room full of guys that are dejected that would like to continue
to play.  
We have been inconsistent. We had some guys injured during the year, that's
not an excuse, that was a fact that happened, some guys got hurt. I know the
guys would like to continue to play. We're certainly disappointed we didn't
have a chance to get to the championship game but we got beat by an
outstanding team. I will say this about our league. We're going to get five
teams in and I think all of them will do great in the NCAA Tournament. They
all deserve to be there. We hope we get a chance to play somewhere, and we
look forward‑‑ we played pretty well the last three weeks and I think our team
has gotten better. Our guys know how to play and anytime you can play in
postseason I think it gives you a boost and helps you toward next year.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you see the American Conference with the former conference
you were in, in intensity, not to say quality?  
COACH DICKEY: Conference USA was a great league and they had some wonderful
teams and they did a good job. When you look at the American Conference it's
certainly a step up. It's a step up in terms of talent and in competition. I
know there was a lot of talk about the teams at the top and the other five,
but everyone had to play ten games against top‑20 teams all year, five teams
that are going to be in there. We were fortunate to have some big wins during
the year, just weren't as consistent as we needed to be.  
But I think this league is terrific and I think that will be validated over
the next three weeks in the tournament. I think you're going to see The
American do extremely well in the NCAA Tournament. They will be well battle
tested.  
  
Q. As you say, there are five possibly six. How do you see Houston in the
next couple of years?  
COACH DICKEY: Well, we want to make a jump and be a top‑25 program, be in the
NCAA Tournament. That's been the goal since I've been there and we've been
fortunate to get some special guys, two of them sitting to my left. They want
to help that program and certainly they have aspirations and will play at the
next level in time and we want that for them, but in the meantime, we
certainly want to be a quality program that is in the top‑25, and get a chance
to participate in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, at what point did you sense this game was getting away from your
team?  
COACH DICKEY: Well, when we got in foul trouble in the first half, and we had
TaShawn on the bench much of the first half and Danuel was having to play a
lot of minutes I talked with him about that when I took him out in the second
half. He had to play a lot of minutes for us. We were not as efficient
offensively and defensively. The biggest disappointment I thought was on our
execution, like on the free‑throws, because you can't help a team and I
thought we did that.  
It caused us to play a little bit faster. We probably didn't have the
confidence in our offense as well as we did when we had our starters in there.
When we got behind in double figures, that's one of the things that they do
well. When they get you down they try to pound on ya and they're good at it.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, we appreciate your time.

## March 14, 2014

  

### [DeAndre Daniels](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26735)

### [Shabazz Napier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22172)

### [Kevin Ollie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24199)

  
_MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE_  
  

UConn - 58  
Cincinnati - 56

  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will get started with the UConn Huskies, head coach, Kevin
Ollie, Shabazz Napier and DeAndre Daniels, Coach?  
COACH OLLIE: It was just a great game. Seems like every time we play Cincy it
comes down to a one‑possession game. They're well‑coached and they play hard
and I think we stood up to them and we stayed in the middle of the ring and
kept throwing punches. It was a great victory for UConn and for our program
and I told everybody coaching is overrated. This is a players' game and my
players stepped up tonight and took over the game and they matched their
intensity and then we brought it up a notch. We got down by 7, wasn't anybody
pointing fingers, we just came together and stayed connected and everybody did
their job tonight. Not only the players on the floor but the players on the
bench and it was a collective team win and we go to the next one, that's what
it's all about.  
  
Q. Coach, how does it feel in the first season in this brand new conference
for your team to be playing in the conference championship?  
COACH OLLIE: It feels great but, you know, it started last year, when we
couldn't perform in a conference tournament or go to the NCAA Tournament,
those guys still played for our great university and they stayed loyal to the
program and they planted seeds and that's what it's all about, now you seeing
the plant grow but they planted seeds last year. I want them to continue to
plant seeds and we keep moving on and it's another 40‑minute war and we ready
to battle.  
  
Q. Coach, one week later you get Louisville again. We know what happened a
week ago. Why will this be different in your mind?  
COACH OLLIE: We going to come out and play. This is the postseason and that is
behind us. I think we're a better team and of course Louisville is a better
team and we're going to face out in the ring and see who comes out but I like
my guys and I wouldn't trade 'em for the world and we're going to play solid
and hopefully we come out with the win tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kevin, how did the defense change so quickly and early in that second
half. Obviously Amida was a big part of it, what was the difference.  
COACH OLLIE: Amida, DeAndre took it personal. They wanted to win individual
match‑ups with a team concept and that's how we got back in the game. We
started rebounding the basketball better, we got out on the fast break and
started converting a little bit but that defense was stellar.  
To hold a team town to 37% and then we held down our last team 27% and it's a
great feeling when you know you can get stops and we call three stops in a row
"kills" and I believe we had five kills tonight which is a great attribute to
bring at anytime when we not scorin', we can always rely on our defense that's
what we hang our hats on and that's what we been doin' since I was a player?  
  
Q. Coach, it was clear like in the first half, 11 turnovers, second half, 4.
Once you got to a point where you started protecting the ball and responding
to the pressure how much did that change the shape of the game?  
COACH OLLIE: It changed the shape of the game because they were getting live
turnovers, I believe they had 12 points off of turnovers and 18 points in the
paint. It was leading to easy buckets and we started being more solid with the
basketball, keeping them in front of us and it allowed our defense to stay
solid and with Bazz taking care of the ball, Ron taking care of the ball even
DeAndre and Niels it allowed us to get shots up to the rim and it wasn't empty
possessions. So we was just down by 4 halftime, and we was smiling, down by 4,
11 turnovers, I didn't show that to them but I was happy. It was a grind‑out
win. That's why this team is so fun they get down and dirty and I love 'em. I
love 'em to death!  
  
Q. Shabazz, take us through the last play with Shawn having the and talk
about guarding him down the stretch.  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: I picked the ball up and Shawn was behind Justin and Shawn was
running down setting him a pick and I was trying to bait him on one side and
he came down on the other side and I'm not sure, I think it was DeAndre or
Amida, when I cut him off he went back middle and they contested his layup and
I thought it was going to go down but he definitely put too much spin on it
and it went out the other way and the big guys were smacking the ball up in
the air in case one of the guys was trying to grab it and that buzzer sounded
off and we were straight to win it.  
  
Q. How much were you able to enjoy the win? It was a great come back but
after everybody started celebrating you started shaking your head because you
missed the free throw it looked like.  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: I'm happy because we won but I'm so much of a competitor I'm
upset that I missed the free throw. I'm upset I put my teammates in that
position. I understand it's over with and we went in the locker room and guys
was hugging and I was definitely happy we won but I'm so passionate about the
game I just hate missing free throws, I hate turnovers, it's who I am. I'm
definitely happy we won the game.  
  
Q. Coach, I know he's been professional and complimentary of you but I'm
curious how badly you want to beat Rick Pitino going back to what happened at
the Celtics.  
COACH OLLIE: I really don't care about the Celtics. Rick‑‑ actually I grew so
much with Rick that summer, so I became a better point guard with him and he
came to the decision where he had to let me go but when you have a set‑back
like that it just gets you ready for another opportunity. It's nothing against
Rick, I love Rick to death. He's a Hall of Fame coach, he's a great coach, a
good friend of mine and I could learn a lot from Rick Pitino.  
  
Q. DeAndre, we have seen you guys grind out these wins and it's been
sustained throughout the year. What do you think it says about you guys that
you have been able to do that consistently now into March?  
DeANDREA DANIELS: Like you said we have been through it all season and we
always have fight and we never give up. Everybody has heart on this team and
when it comes down to the end I put the bet on our team.  
  
Q. Shabazz, when you made the surge to take the lead by 8 what changed
offensively that allowed you guys to get goin'?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: Coach telling guys keep the team, move the balls when they
were gettin' tired and crackin'. In the beginning we didn't move the ball as
much as we should have but after that we was able to do so and DeAndre was
able to get mis‑matches and Amida was able to get the ball in the paint
because we was penetrating off of passes. We ended up sharing the ball more
and that's what Coach said, we gotta share the game more and we ended up doing
that and we started scoring. He's the brains of this.  
  
Q. Shabazz, are you ready for your match ‑up with Russ Smith?   
SHABAZZ NAPIER: I'm ready to play Louisville, I don't see no match‑up between
me and him, I'm not here to play a one‑on‑one game, it's a five‑on‑five game,
so I'm ready to play Louisville.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S

## March 14, 2014

  

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Justin Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26736)

### [Sean Kilpatrick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22084)

  
_MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE_  
  

UConn - 58  
Cincinnati -56

  
THE MODERATOR: Okay we'll get started with the University of Cincinnati, head
coach, Mick Cronin, student athletes Just in Jackson and Sean Kilpatrick.
Coach, your comments on tonight's game?  
COACH CRONIN: First of all, I thought UConn played extremely well. They made
shots. We had defensive breakdowns that for us are inexcusable, that led to
that, and that's disappointing. That's probably our biggest problem that I
would have with tonight.  
Second thing is we didn't shoot a free‑throw in the second half until 2
minutes roughly left in the game. That was a big problem for our offense. Five
times we point blank hit the rim, came up empty. Gotta do a better job of
making sure we're getting fouled and finishing around the rim. Can't continue
to come up empty at the rim. We were getting the ball where we wanted it, but
like I said, disappointed because we showed that they're leaving their feet,
trying to block every shot.  
We didn't fake and get fouled until two minutes left. The last part of it is
we didn't get the ball inside nearly enough, either, which in the second half,
which I thought was a huge problem for our offense.  
  
Q. Did you see somebody hit the net when Sean's shot didn't go in? Did you
think there was a goaltending call?  
COACH CRONIN: I'm already worried about Selection Sunday in the NCAA
Tournament. I'm not tall enough to see stuff like that. You really think
they're going to call that for Cincinnati? What games you been watching all
year? Seriously.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts on Selection Sunday and where you might be seeded
in the Tournament?  
COACH CRONIN: I was proud of our effort tonight, I thought that our fight was
excellent, our competitive desire was excellent.  
I think the biggest thing is making sure our players understand why we lost.
Winners know where they win and why they lose. That's what we just talked
about. Two things: We had a lot of defensive breakdowns, everything I told you
that is inexcusable, we gotta get fouled more at the rim and get the ball
inside more and be accountable to each other and make sure that we know that
we can do better.  
The last part is we had great practice tonight at making a come‑back. Other
than the tying the game we executed in the last three minutes every time,
every possession. We either got a great shot, got fouled or got the ball at
the rim. When you get the great shot you have to relentlessly rebound because
you can't come up with empty possessions or you're never going to catch
anybody. The only empty possession we had in the last three minutes was the
missed layup at the end. That stuff just happens. Really proud of that. It was
a great segment for us and our press did wonders for us tonight. We're
probably going to have to use it more going forward.  
  
Q. When you see S.K. drive the lane like that he makes that shot 99 out of
100 times. You had to feel good about your chances?  
COACH CRONIN: I did feel really good about it. Right now getting back to
Cincinnati, getting rest and getting ready to go next week.  
  
Q. Justin, can you talk about when you went into the scoring drought, it was
a 17 ‑2 run. Why was it hard for you to score? You were getting to the rim and
couldn't score or what was going on?   
JUSTIN JACKSON: Like Coach was saying, UConn played great defense and played
great as a team. We couldn't execute in the end but like Coach said we came
back in the last three minutes and do what we needed to do. And S.K. hits that
shot 99 out of 100 times, I can't tell you why, it just happens.  
  
Q. How do you feel you're playing as a team going into the tournament?  
JUSTIN JACKSON: We are going to get back in the gym and do what we need to do
and we're going to play what we need to do, play Cincinnati basketball, like
I've been saying.  
  
Q. Sean, you guys were able to cause turnovers in the first half, a lot of
steals and not so much in the second half. Did they change something that you
guys were doing as far as combatting the press or it was something that they
were doing that led to the lack of turnovers on their part?  
SEAN KILPATRICK: No, I don't think so. We applied the pressure that we needed
to apply. I think our press worked pretty well. We did pretty good and it was
something that happened down the stretch.  
COACH CRONIN: Can't press if you don't score. We couldn't get the ball in the
basket.  
  
Q. Sean, with respect do you think you guys should be seeded based on the
resume that you've built all year?  
SEAN KILPATRICK: I don't know.  
JUSTIN JACKSON: Not our choice.  
SEAN KILPATRICK: I've been focusing on the game today and that's what Coach
teaches us, to take it a day at a time and I let the guys that place the
seeding and everything take care of that. I don't think about things like
that.  
COACH CRONIN: That made my night. We don't worry about things we can't
control.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Eddie Jordan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16808)

  
_MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE_  
  
Louisville - 92  
Rutgers - 31  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will get started with Rutgers and head Coach, Eddie Jordan,
Student Athletes, Wally Judge and J.J. Moore. Eddie?  
COACH JORDAN: Obviously it was a very disappointing performance for us. A game
like that really tests your character, and they're a good team, top‑5 in the
country. They've been to the top of the mountain and we're starting from the
bottom of the mountain and we want to get to where they are.  
It's going to be a process for us, it has been a process for us, but I thought
our guys had a lot of character and we just need to know how hard we have to
work to get to where we want to go.  
Again, we were picked 10th, we ended up 7th, we won a first‑round game. Again,
it was a disappointing performance and disappointing loss but we achieved some
things that was probably overachievement this year.  
  
Q. You talked last night about slowing down against the press that sometimes
that can break it but it seems like ‑‑  
COACH JORDAN: Nothing worked tonight so just the X's and O's, throw it out the
window. It was something that we said in pregame, the X's and O's are probably
not going to be the most important part of our success tonight, it's going to
be making basketball plays, making plays, keep your spacing, what do you see,
being able to make passes, be receivers and make a good pass to get a good,
quality shot.  
That didn't work for us, either. We tried, we gave great effort. There were
times when there was a crack in the armor where we didn't give it 100%, we
didn't get back, we threw lazy passes, we were hoping instead of doing. That's
where the two programs are right now. That's reality.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about testing your character. What did you tell them at
the half? What do you do to try to get their minds into the game?  
COACH JORDAN: We wanted to slow the game down a little bit and move the ball
and not really look at first shots. Probably get into a scoring mode, run
about fifteen seconds. I don't know if it worked but after a few possessions I
said to myself, just do what we have been doing all year, but let's still move
the ball a little bit more, let's not take, again, tough attempts, let's get
the ball in the paint, keep running.  
So let's just go out the way we have been doing all year, just do what we have
been doing but with more patience.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Donnie Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26648)

### [Kasey Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26694)

  
_MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE_  
  

Cincinnati - 61  
UCF - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We will get started with UCF, head Coach, Donnie Jones, and
forward, Kasey Wilson. Coach, if you want to talk about Isaiah Sykes and his
injury?  
COACH JONES: Yeah, obviously he had a tough fall at the end of the game.
Couldn't tell what he had done but it looked like he had done something to his
knee. He's being evaluated right now, not sure what the evaluation is at this
point but we will know that soon and let everybody know but right now he's
being evaluated.  
THE MODERATOR: Your thoughts on the game?  
COACH JONES: Great game, proud of these seniors that represented us here at
UCF. These guys came so far. We may have lost on the scoreboard but those guys
had a victory here today with the way they competed in this tournament and at
the end of the year.  
I'm proud of those guys laying this foundation for us making this move in this
conference this year and I'm proud of how we competed. Had a great opportunity
down the stretch, obviously Cincinnati is a great team, Mick has done a
terrific job with them. There is a reason they finished first in this league
and we had a chance down the stretch and they made the plays. Congratulations
to Cincinnati but I'm very proud of our basketball team today.  
  
Q. Donnie, I was going to ask you about the decision to go box and one and
how effective that was?  
COACH JONES: Yeah, we worked on that in the ballroom today. We didn't have
shoot around, we taped off a room up there and we told our guys we were going
to hold it close to the second half, trying to keep it close so they couldn't
make adjustments at half time, and we were there, 1‑point, 3‑point game and we
put it in to see what would happen. I thought it was very effective, we were
trying to force other guys to make plays for them just to get them out of
rhythm. They're such a rhythm team and obviously Sean Kilpatrick is the focal
point. We limited him, I don't think he got a field goal during that stretch
until the end when he made four free throws, and I thought we did a good job
of changing their flow, which is what we wanted to do.  
  
Q. Any affects from last night's double overtime? Did y'all feel any of that
at any point in the game?  
COACH JONES: Kasey?  
KASEY WILSON: I don't think so, we were well rested and we played a lot of
minutes last night, but I don't think it carried over. We played as hard as we
could during the game so I don't think it affected what happened today.  
COACH JONES: I agree, last night was a hard‑fought game, as I told them,
fatigue is mental, those guys play AAU ball and on weekends they play
sometimes 15 games so when you're playing for an NCAA Tournament opportunity
you don't have time to be tired. No excuses for that. I thought we played with
the right energy and the right focus and it came down to making plays.  
  
Q. Donnie, could you talk about that 3 ‑pointer in the right corner? Was
that something you were looking for?   
COACH JONES: Absolutely, we were box and one had Justin McBride over on that
side and during time out I switched Kasey over to that side because I knew
they were going to run something over there. We had to choose ‑‑ it was a
2‑point game and we didn't want to close all the way to the three‑point line
obviously they bring in a kid off the bench that didn't have a lot of minutes
for them. We live with the long three and he made a play, so give him credit
and that's what guys gotta do to advance in this tournament and they did. We
thought about going man‑to‑man but obviously that means we would give Sean
Kilpatrick a chance to make a play or get fouled and there is no one better in
the league than him in doing that down the stretch.  
We had to play the percentages, and that's what got us here so we live with
it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.

### [Chris Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26683)

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

### [Stephen Van Treese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25195)

  
_MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE_  
  

Louisville - 92  
Rutgers - 31

  
THE MODERATOR: We will get started with the University of Louisville and head
Coach, Rick Pitino and Student Athletes, Chris Jones and Stephan Van Treese.
Coach?  
COACH PITINO: Well with, I'm not sure what to say. It was one of those nights
where everything went really well for us and nothing went right for them.  
We got a chance to play everybody and rest our legs. Anytime you play in a
tournament where there is a potential for three games in a row, the more you
can play your bench the better you will be. These two guys played a terrific
basketball game. Stephan has been rebounding the ball and playing great
defense and Chris Jones the last two weeks has been the best I've seen him.  
Very proud of both of these guys. It was one of those games in the second half
we wanted to pack in our zone and they held their own, forcing 26 turnovers,
only turning them over ten times, turned them over in the half court which is
a little surprising, but it's just one of those nights where one team, nothing
goes right, the other, everything goes right.  
  
Q. Rick, it's 18 ‑8 when Monday Montrezl picks up his second foul. Do you
have any anxiety at that point or do you think your team is playing so well it
doesn't matter?   
COACH PITINO: No, I didn't. I knew it was going to be a good night when we
went to throw a lob to Stephan and Monday Montrezl dunked on Stephan, I knew
it was our night at that point.  
STEPHAN VAN TREESE: I'm not happy about that, I thought he was throwin' it to
me, and I didn't even see Montrezl and he dunked on me, I was like, "Man,
that's not fair!"  
  
Q. Last year you talked about the "boom" affect, today did we see the Sonic
boom affect?   
COACH PITINO: Yeah, I've been proud of these guys all season because our
losses have been to good basketball teams. We haven't lost to a bad basketball
team. And every single night they come to play as if they're down 10 with 2
minutes to go, they're very intense, they pay no attention to an opponent's
record and respect everyone. That's a great quality to have.  
Certainly we know we're going to have a tougher game with Houston tomorrow,
upsetting SMU, Houston has terrific talent. Rutgers has played everybody tough
in their last five games from Cincinnati to Memphis and they just don't play
real well against us. Some teams are like that in conference.  
  
Q. Chris, Rutgers last night talked about trying to ‑‑ since the last game
with you guys, trying to slow down and attack the press, you know, with a
little more logic. It seemed like their speed was letting you set up traps
even better, was that the case today?   
CHRIS JONES: I would say that was the case. I think our presence got better
over the weeks, going into the tournament you need to know how to switch
defenses to get farther in the tournament and that's what we learned how to
do..  
  
Q. Coach talked about the last two weeks, your improvement. What are the
things you have been working on the most?  
CHRIS JONES: I think my overall trying as a person. I came in thinking about
scoring because I've been a scorer all my life but he have great players
around you that make you better and I feed off those guys and sometimes they
feed off me.  
I think my game surrounds myself off of defense. Pushing the pace. So that's
why I think I've been playing my best basketball the last two weeks.  
  
Q. Chris, this must have been very emotional for you today coming back to
Memphis after your step ‑brother's death. Despite the lopsided game can you
give us a sense of your emotions today?   
CHRIS JONES: I think my emotions came out yesterday when I went to the grave.
Some things you've got to let go of, they come between the lines. I don't let
that get to me when I'm playing basketball. I think that freed my mind of
that. His death is not a good thing but at that point it frees my intentions
right now and that's why I'm playing harder and I'm playing way better, too.  
COACH PITINO: One of the things we talked about with Chris is, you know,
because this is a tough city as we all know, and we talked about when
tragedies hit, about celebrating one's life no matter how young.  
That's what Chris and I talked about, about celebrating his step‑brother's
life and celebrating in a good way where you don't necessarily win a game with
him but you honor him with the type of person you are and the type of person
you can become. Chris Jones is‑‑ we all know he's been able to play this game
since high school but he's come so far as a young man. He's just a great,
great young man, I don't want to call him a kid. He's just a great young man
and he's evolving into the type of person we want at Louisville.  
  
Q. Rick, you said Rutgers is a different team all of sudden when they play
you. What have you noticed about them on film that doesn't come to light and
do you have an explanation for today?  
COACH PITINO: No I really don't have an explanation for today. If you watched
them the last five games they've played tough, South Florida, Memphis, and
Cincinnati, and the last poor game they played at our place was a lopsided
victory. I think sometimes we can wear them out and the passing is not as
sharp as they would like.  
I really don't have much of an answer tonight to say why, because they've been
playing good basketball prior to this night.  
  
Q. Stephan, you had opportunities to take that 3 ‑point shot that you didn't
get at home. Why did you pass it up and why did you only take one shot
tonight?   
STEPHAN VAN TREESE: We're in tournament time so I'm not trying to mess around
too much. I thought senior night would have been more appropriate if we were
up by 12 or so and I think Coach would kill me if I shot one in at tournament
time.  
  
Q. Rick, night like this, Eddie feeling his way out in the head job, what
would you tell him after a couple of games like this?  
COACH PITINO: Well, he's coached in the pro's and you have certain nights in
the pro's that are unexplainable and then you come back the next night and you
win like the Lakers got blown out by 40 the other night and they came back and
had a good win. There are nights that are unexplainable, and you got to forget
about it. He is building, he was a terrific player, he knows the game at all
levels. He has to get a deeper bench. Kadeem Jack has gotten better as a
basketball player.  
Like I said, certain opponents are a little stronger and deeper and quicker
and we are and everything went well for us and nothing went right for them.
He's seen it in the pro's and it's the time where you go right to the bar,
forget the game, have a drink and get ready for next year.  
  
Q. Coach, what is it about your teams that you seem to be able to get them
to play their best basketball at the right time? You guys seem to be peaking
when you would want to.  
COACH PITINO: I've always believed this, that if you can get your team to
respect everybody the same way, regardless of their record, regardless of what
they're doing in terms of preparation and the way you go about it, and these
guys have been able to do it. I had maybe my best team, I forget the year now
with T. Will and L. Clark, two lottery picks‑‑ and we went to the Elite Eight,
because they weren't able to do it like this team does it or the year before.
When you have humility as a basketball team you root for each other.  
I think a humble attitude gets you to play hard all the time and know you can
get beat. Our guys watch TV and they saw Villanova get beat today by Seton
Hall and they saw DePaul beat Georgetown we are more than capable of getting
beat by any team, Houston can come tomorrow even though we played great and
they could beat us, we know that, so I think it's a humble spirit,
understanding you play the same way against everybody. Now you may change your
defenses and your offensive attack from a scouting standpoint, but you don't
change the way you get up and play defense and these guys have been able to do
that.  
  
Q. Stephan, given Chris's circumstances, I'm curious how the team has shown
support and we heard that his family provided some of his favorite desserts, I
don't know if you had a chance to sample that.  
STEPHAN VAN TREESE: He hasn't shared any of that yet. Don't tell Coach G.
that, either. That's our strength Coach.  
We're a close‑knit group and anytime Chris needs to come talk to us and we all
live in the same dorm and we all hangout and try to get his mind away from
things like that. It's tough and I think he's battling through it pretty well
right now.  
  
Q. Coach, your impressions of Memphis as a host so far after spending so
many years in NewYork at MSG.  
COACH PITINO: It's a great place to have it. Obviously the crowds were
disappointing the first day because people work. Personally, I miss the Big
East because it's Madison Square Garden where I coached and played and grew up
seven streets from it. Memphis is a great place to have it, it's a great fan
base, great basketball so when Memphis plays the place will be packed and it
will be exciting and I hope we can get to the finals and play, and our fan
base will come down each day but this is a week night and on the weekend it's
easier, great city, great fan base, we're excited to be here.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you.

### [Geron Johnston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25245)

### [Nick King](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26706)

### [Josh Pastner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22043)

  
_MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE_  
  

UConn - 72  
Memphis - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Memphis, head coach, Josh Pastner and student
athletes, Geron Johnson and Nick King. We will start with your comments,
Coach?  
COACH PASTNER: Gotta give UConn credit and Coach Ollie and their program. They
played great, they've got a great team, great program and they deserved to
win. Secondly, we stunk, no other way to look at it. We played poorly.
Obviously when we lose a game all responsibility has to go to the head coach
so I will take full responsibility.  
I've said that before, it's going to be hard for us to win when our four
senior guards combine for, you know, 10 for 38. We're not going to win that
way.  
With only 2 or 3 assists out of those four guards, it's just not going to
happen. Again, anytime we lose a game it's got to fall on the head coach, when
we win a game the players got the job done. It was a bad performance and we
gotta now be ready to go for next week, we will be in the NCAA Tournament and
we have to correct a couple of things. I did not see this one coming. We had a
great week of practice. Guys were ready to play. They were fired up.  
I just did not see this coming. I felt the first half, the majority of the
game, but especially the first half we played not to lose instead of playing
to win. When you play not to lose against a really good team you end up
losing. We played timid and, you know, just one of those things.  
  
Q. Josh, they got a lot of wide open looks. Where were the defensive
breakdowns? What was the problem?  
COACH PASTNER: Well, they got a couple of them off of second chances. They got
one the first part of the game by Griffey and at the end of the half they got
one, Ryan Boatright hit one off of a second‑chance rebound. We had breakdowns
on containment, there was that time when Ryan Boatright took Chris Crawford
basically from one end to the rim on that. It was just one of those nights.
There was just breakdowns on a lot of areas on containment and things. They
hit a couple of tough shots, they're a great 3‑point the shooting team, but
like I said, first and foremost it's gotta go to the head coach so any of the
losses have to be put on my shoulders and obviously we didn't do a good job
and we will have to get better and get ready for next week.  
  
Q. Did you feel like there was a lack of fight, a lack of hit back there in
the first half?  
COACH PASTNER: You know, Jason, I felt we played not to lose. We played not to
lose. You can't win if you play not to lose. That was the whole halftime
speech, the whole talk was guys, we're playing timid, we're looking like we're
paralyzed out there in a lot of the things we're doing. We have a glaze over
our eyes and I don't know why. Like I said, we had a great week of practice,
guys were ready to play. We just came out and we played very passive, very,
very passive for‑‑ I don't have an answer why we played passive, we played
extremely passive and when you play passive against a very good team that's
what happens.  
Even defensively, our ball screen coverage we tried to start the game doubling
on Napier which I felt for the most part we did a good job on Napier but then
first game Daniels has a career night against us. Second game, Napier has a
career night against us, and then this game, Griffey has a career night
against us, so just one of those deals.  
  
Q. Josh, they were talking about how their game plan defensively was to
close the middle, not get your bigs to post, and dribble drive penetration was
tough, so in that case it has to be outside shooting or you're in trouble?  
COACH PASTNER: If you're not making shots‑‑ we couldn't score the ball. They
clogged it in and that's what teams are going to do against us and we're going
to have to make some threes. We can't go 10 for 38. We missed a lot of layups,
a lot of layups, and when you miss layups and a lot of open shots it makes it
hard to score. I've said it for a long time now and I'll say it again, you're
going to have to make shots.  
Unfortunately I felt from the very beginning with our team that we were going
to be a great three‑point shooting team and the floor spacing andthen‑‑ but we
have not shot the three from my expectations or my thought process that we
would be shooting this year. So I knew teams were going to pack in on us to
make us shoot three's, but from the preseason and what we shot last year, the
percentage, I thought there was going to be no doubt about it, and we have not
shot the ball well. And when you pack it in ‑‑ and they did a good job on
Austin and Shaq and they clogged up dribble penetration, we had some open
shots we missed and we missed a lot of layups and those are back breakers.  
  
Q. Geron, how disappointed are you about the way you guys played tonight?  
GERON JOHNSON: I'm very disappointed with myself, the way I played the first
half, and lackadaisical, and Coach made the game plan up right and senior
guards, we got to prolong our season and hold ourselves accountable to make
shots. I told Coach, there is no sympathy, nobody is going to give us any
sympathy but we have to get to the drawing board andbe ready for next week as
we get into the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Will you watch the rest of the tournament?  
GERON JOHNSON: Will I watch the rest of the tournament? No, I'm not. I know
we're better than that and the country knows we're better than that and it's
over now and we put the wins behind us and put the losses behind us and you
gotta get back to the drawing board and play hard.  
  
Q. Josh, Kevin Ollie complimented Ryan Boatright on his floor game. What was
it that made it so hard for your guys to stay in front of him?  
COACH PASTNER: He played well but in the end Griffey makes those three's and
we don't make shots. Ryan Boatright is a very good player and Shabazz Napier
is a very good player. We can dissect all we want to dissect. We missed a lot
of shots, we shot 26% from the field. You're not winning; it's over. Start the
bus and go home because you're not winning when you shoot 26% against a good
team. Then defensively we did not do a good job. They shot 53%, so that's a
bad combination. We can look all we want to look into. We've got to be able to
score the ball.  
We're not winning games scoring 53 points, not with the offensive fire power
we have. And with our bigs, Shaq has to play better, Austin has to play
better, but to loosen things up we have to have our perimeter guys make shots.
Those shots are important for us just to loosen stuff up. That's why we were
able to beat SMU the second half, we just couldn't score the ball tonight;
whereas, against SMU we made the shots in the second half. Louisville, same
thing. You look at our losses, we couldn't score, and our wins we were able to
make three's. Gotta be able to make three's.  
  
Q. What will you tell your guys from here?  
COACH PASTNER: Well, I told our guys in the locker room, and anyone that knows
me, I'm an optimist. I'm not a guy that‑‑ I tell it like it is, and there is
no time for fluff. I'm not a big rah‑rah speech guy. I told the guys, hey,
this was embarrassing for us, and, again, I take full responsibility. I don't
blame players, it's on the head coach when we lose games and when we win it
goes to the players. So I take full responsibility, but I told our guys, look,
this is embarrassing, this is not good.  
The only way to really make it up is, you know, to have a good week next week,
try to win two games. I told our guys, I've said all along there are three
seasons. I thought we had a very good regular season, very, very good regular
season, one of the few teams to stay in the Top‑25 from the start to the
finish, swept Louisville, won Old Spice, had Top‑25 wins. We did a lot of good
things.  
Second season, conference tournament, we grade ourselves with an "F." So to
balance it out and leave a good impression we need to do our job next week and
try to win two. Not just one, but we need to try to win two.  
  
Q. Geron or Nick, what is it about the UConn team that you guys are 0 ‑3
against them?   
NICK KING: UConn is a good team, don't get me wrong but most of the time I
think it's on us. We had a lot of defensive breakdowns by the players. The
coaches drew up a great game plan, we had too many breakdowns, mental
breakdowns on defense and couldn't knock down shots. I believe that's what it
was.  
  
Q. Josh, all season long you bounced back from adversity, every time. You
haven't lost two straight. I don't know what happens in between but you do a
good job of getting the guys ready again. Will this be tougher to bounce back
from, being the tournament, hosting the tournament and having lost the way you
did?  
COACH PASTNER: Well, Greg, if anyone's got the "woe is me, sorry for myself,
blame game syndrome," you're not coming to the Tournament, and I don't want
that around.  
We don't have time for that. I told the guys we all got to take accountability
and responsibility, starts with me. We don't have time to bury our heads and
feel sorry for ourselves. We will bounce back. We gotta find a way to win not
just one next week, but two. And I recognize that and these guys recognize
that. We gotta get the job done. Whether we're a 1 seed, 9 seed, 16 seed,
whatever we are we have to win two. Doesn't matter.  
GERON JOHNSON: We will win two games next week, that's what I'm going to say.
I got faith in my team. We can play with anybody in the country. I know Coach
doesn't like that, but we're going to get to the drawing board and we are
going to work hard, and you can put my statement on that, and we will win two
next week. We can go from there.  
COACH PASTNER: I don't mind him saying that and for us to win two next week
he's going to have to be great, as will everybody else, we just gotta get the
job. We got to produce on the floor and we have no option but to win two next
week. We're going to find a way to do it. It's going to be a heck of a
tournament whoever we play, so I think it's wide open but we're going to have
to find a way to get the job done. We will get back and correct what we need
to correct.  
  
Q. Guys, it seems like when you get into the lane, y'all like to get in the
paint to get y'all points. Seems like when y'all drawing contact you weren't
getting the calls that seemed like you should have gotten.  
COACH PASTNER: No, we went to the free‑throw line 37 times, UConn went 13, had
nothing to do with the officials. We didn't make free‑throws. When you're
shooting 20 of 37, not winning the game. We went to the free‑throw line, we
drew contact we couldn't score. We missed free‑throws, layups, layups, layups,
open shots, makes it hard but nothing with the officials whatsoever.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you.

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Niels Griffey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26704)

### [Shabazz Napier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22172)

### [Kevin Ollie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24199)

  
_MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE_  
  

UConn - 72  
Memphis - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started. UConn Head Coach, Kevin Ollie, Student
Athletes, Shabazz Napier and Niels Griffey. Coach?  
COACH OLLIE: The game was played at a high speed and I thought our guys came
in with the right mind‑set and that mind‑set is togetherness. We shared the
basketball. We put on the board that we wanted to get 15 plus assists and we
hit 15. Our defense was phenomenal from the tap, and we didn't give them
anything easy and the biggest thing we had on the board was transition defense
and we held them to 8 transition points and when they played in the LX Center,
our last game against them, they got 20. So I thought limiting them to 18
points in the paint, and then also 8 transition points in the paint allowed us
to get out on the break and we shared with the basketball and Niels
phenomenal, but everybody down the list came in and contributed you know
Shabazz with his leadership also and Ryan with his floor game had 6 assists
and it was a phenomenal game and we have to fuel back up and get ready for
Cincinnati because you know what type of game that's going to be, it's going
to be a war. We gotta have that heart, we gotta have that hustle. The same
thing we had tonight to beat a great team like Cincinnati.  
  
Q. Niels, can you talk about your night and what you were feeling coming
into the game? Obviously you were feeling the shot that you were putting up
with authority, but what was going through your mind as the game went on?  
NIELS GRIFFEY: This game was similar to the Louisville game, coming into the
game. They had a home crowd and we knew that we had to be‑‑ had to give them a
different game than the Louisville game. So we really came in with a good
mind‑set, really energetic and like Coach said, we had to stick to certain
points that we were emphasizing. That was rebounding and getting back in
transition.  
I think we did a great job staying solid, especially in the first half, where
we had a couple of runs. I think that was the main thing that our team did
really well tonight.  
  
Q. Shabazz, you guys shot 55% in two games here. What is it about this
building that brings out the best in your offense?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: I don't think it's the building, I think it's the way that
Memphis plays defense. They definitely double a lot of pick‑and‑rolls, which
leaves guys like Niels open and DeAndre and Lasan open and you got some good
shooters. If you give them time to shoot the ball, you can see what happens.
Niels was 6 for 8 today, he's been the greatest shooter, he has this whole
year and if you leave him open, which is astonishing, coming into this, a lot
of people around the country know Niels as a shooter, but the way they play
defense they double a lot and leave shooters open and we're not afraid to pass
the ball at all so Niels got the shots and knocked 'em down and kept it
rolling.  
  
Q. Was y'all game playing against sophomore Shaq Goodwin ‑‑ seemed like when
he had the ball in his hands y'all threw two or three guys at him?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: We didn't want them to score in the paint as much as they
have. We know Shaq Goodwin is definitely a great talent and we dug down a
little bit. We wasn't doing anything different than we did last few games with
them and we manned up and we told the big guys as soon as we see them in
trouble we're going to go give help but our guys did a great job on him,
definitely getting him in foul trouble and he was definitely playing DeAndre
and playing DeAndre on the perimeter is definitely tough for a big guy and we
got him tired and kept moving from there.  
  
Q. Kevin, you shook the lineup up a little bit, starting Niels and Phil
tonight. Particular reason for that?  
COACH OLLIE: I just wanted to do something different. Them guys were still
going to play, Lasan came here and gave us a great effort and Amida came in
and gave us great effort, but I wanted to change it up and get Niels out there
so he could spread the floor and get more space for my guards. I know
Louisville, they tried to wear Shabazz andRyan Boatright down and we wanted to
give them more space and Niels made me look like I was a good coach so thank
you, Niels.  
  
Q. Niels, what was it about your defense that made it so tough for them to
score?  
NIELS GRIFFEY: Memphis is a great team and they score in the paint, so we
focused on clogging up the whole paint and helping guys out as soon as the
ball came in there and make them make their shots from outside.  
That was one of the keys we thought about.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2014

  

### [James Dickey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26662)

### [Jherrod Stiggers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26663)

### [TaShawn Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26664)

  
_MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE_  
  

Houston: 68  
SMU: 64

  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we'll get started with our postgame press conference
starting with the University of Houston, Head Coach James Dickey, student
athletes, Jherrod Stiggers and TaShawn Thomas. Coach, we will get your
comments on the game.  
COACH DICKEY: Thank you very much. Really proud of our guys, big win for us,
have a lot of respect for Coach Brown and SMU, they've beaten us twice this
year at home. I think Nic Moore had a huge second half. They hurt us in two
key areas, on the boards and at the free‑throw line. They got 16 more free
throws than we did and averaged 8 more rebounds a game than we had, so would
he outrebounded them today and we did not get to the free‑throw as much as we
would like but I thought our guys rebounded well.  
Second half, down 9 at half, I was proud of the way our guys came back and we
finally got some flow to our offense. Down the stretch we had empty
possessions but they missed free‑throws and I thought our defense and
rebounding were key in the second half and obviously we had some balance in
scoring. J‑Rod kept us in the game in the first half and hit some big shots
and when you have four guys in double figures that always helps, and obviously
TaShawn had a huge block toward the end of the game there that was big for us.
That's an area that he's really improved on this year and then we made‑‑
Danuel made two big free‑throws and L.J. hit two big free‑throws.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you think was so special about the way your team responded
after falling behind in the second half?  
COACH DICKEY: The biggest thing we talked about was togetherness, toughness,
playing hard, leaving it all out there on the court.  
Our guys were disappointed that we lost both these games and they knew if we
played right we would certainly have a chance to win. Right before the half, I
didn't think that we settled for‑‑ we settled for too many perimeter shots and
didn't get to the free‑throw line. The second half we kept pecking way and had
good possessions and the guys started understanding "paint touches" you don't
always throw it to TaShawn or big J or Danrad but we've got to get to the
paint with the ball either off the dribble or throwing it in there and I
thought once we played the game inside out, it opened it up for us and we were
much more efficient offensively and then we complemented our offense with the
defense at the other end.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys came close last time at their place when you played. Is
there anything from that game you took to this game?  
COACH DICKEY: The biggest thing was we took better care of the ball when we
played in Dallas, didn't rebound as well as we need to do and we weren't as
efficient offensively. I thought we were more efficient offensively in the
second half even though we had empty possessions there when we had that 3 and
4, our defense kept us in it, they missed some free‑throws and we got the
rebound and we had guys hit some big shots. Our guys came into the game with a
lot of confidence and I thought Coach Hamilton, one of my assistants did a
terrific job in preparation and we're happy and thrilled to come out with a
win.  
  
Q. Is Jherrod your 3 ‑point shooting was excellent. Can you talk about how
you felt out there? Seemed like everything was going in for a while.   
JHERROD STIGGERS: My mind‑set was never know if this would be the last game,
never know there would be tomorrow so leave everything on the floor. Take
everything they give me. Feels great, though.  
  
Q. TaShawn, you get a key block at the end, your point man comes up with the
ball. Few seconds left. What's going through your mind?  
TaSHAWN THOMAS: Not to give up the easy basket. The whole game, the rest of
the night, lettin' us play and people were dropping to the basket so I knew I
was going to be able to give up little "contact" on the basket so I waited for
him to release the ball so I could get the block.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Kevin Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26693)

### [Sean Kilpatrick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22084)

  
_MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE_  
  

Cincinnati: 61  
UCF: 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We will get started with the University of Cincinnati Mick
Cronin, Student Athletes, Sean Kilpatrick and Kevin Johnson, Coach?  
COACH CRONIN: I want to congratulate Coach Jones and Central Florida on their
effort last night and tonight. Some of the teams that finished toward the
bottom in our league faced a great challenge in adjusting to playing in a
different league against teams that had time to build. I had time eight years
ago to build to play in the Big East.  
Especially guys like Donnie and Coach Dickey coming from Conference USA and
their team had every right to pack it in coming here. They had a great finish,
big win over Houston in their last regular season game and they had a great
win last night and they probably deserved to win tonight so it's a credit to
Donnie Jones and his staff and their kids for the character they showed. I
wanted to congratulate late them.  
As for the game, Kevin Johnson made a big shot for us, obviously, in the game
and we were able to get enough stops to win but other than that, I don't know
how much we did well or how much we have to be proud of.  
  
Q. Mick, talk about that play, because you used your All ‑American as a
decoy and two people stayed with him and you count on your freshman. Was that
a drawn‑up play?   
COACH CRONIN: Yeah, and I have a lot of confidence in Kevin because he's got a
lot of confidence in himself. He believes in himself and he deserves a lot of
credit. There were times in the regular season of conference play he didn't
get a lot of minutes because he's playing behind the player of the year in the
conference and an All‑American. But they were playing a box and one on S.K. so
somebody was going to have to make the shot and we knew we could get that open
shot in the corner.  
  
Q. Mick, you went three guards a lot in the second half. Was that trying to
combat the box and one or trying to get a different look to get things
going?  
COACH CRONIN: I thought Kevin‑‑ we needed some energy on the defensive end and
Kevin had some great rotations. They got him credited for two steals, but I
thought defensively his energy was tremendous. We had some other guys that
were a little lethargic and he deserved to play. He was playing well, he
deserved to play. He's tough enough to guard bigger people, so is S.K., so
trying to go with the guys that I thought were giving us the best chance to
win.  
  
Q. Kevin, can you talk about that shot and were you surprised when they drew
it up for you?  
KEVIN JOHNSON: I wasn't so surprised, I know Coach Cronin has confidence in
me. Throughout the game I had a nice rhythm offensively and defensively. S.K.
was getting box and one so we needed someone to step up and hit the shot. When
the play was drawn up and I shot it, I was pretty confident and it went in?  
  
Q. Mick, I know that you don't know who you will play yet with UConn and the
Tigers going on the floor right now but if you were to match ‑up with the
Tigers again, this will be on their home floor tomorrow night, just comment on
the environment if you get them tomorrow night?   
COACH CRONIN: My thoughts on you mean if we have to play Memphis and beat 'em
for the third time in front of a sold‑out crowd in the FedExForum? You gotta
ask that question? Either team we play tomorrow night we're going to have to
play well. Chance to get a quality win and get ready for a quality tournament.
Obviously we're trying to win a championship here, but from here on out we're
going to play teams with winning records. We're done playing anybody without a
winning record. You know obviously a tremendous challenge for us to pull that
off. We struggled tonight trying to beat a team for the third time. Some other
teams did as well today around college basketball.  
It's hard to beat a team three times in a row. Hopefully in a few years they
will have that same problem in our conference tournament.  
  
Q. Sean, talk about the ‑‑ this year just the job that they did?  
SEAN KILPATRICK: They did a good job, being a decoy for my teammates is
something that really pays off for me. I know that a lot of teams are going to
have a lot of attention on me but my teammates can score as well and that's
something we have on this team. We have a lot of weapons and a lot of talent
so I let my teammates take over what they can do.  
  
Q. Sean, were they playing you like that the whole game or just the second
half?  
SEAN KILPATRICK: Second half.  
COACH CRONIN: Midway through the second half.  
  
Q. Do you get frustrated when that happens?  
SEAN KILPATRICK: No, we have talent, everyone can shoot and we have Justin and
Titus that can pass in the high posts and that helps us a lot.  
  
Q. Kevin, what was it like when you weren't getting much playing time,
playing behind S.K.?  
KEVIN JOHNSON: I love basketball and I understand the position I'm in and I
would come to practice and guard S.K. and continue to get better so when my
name was called I could step up and help the team. I'm always willing to do
anything to win. It was a tough period but it pays off now.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Larry Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14093)

### [Marcus Kennedy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26665)

### [Nick Russell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26666)

  
_MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE_  
  

Houston: 68  
SMU: 64

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Larry Brown, student athletes, Markus Kennedy and
Nick Russell, Coach, your comments?  
COACH BROWN: We got outplayed. You know, when you go 4 for 19 the second half
and we missed a bunch of free throws late, I don't think you're going to win
many games.  
You gotta give them credit. We had pretty good control of the first half. We
talked about winning the first five minutes, and I just thought they punched
us in the mouth and we just didn't respond very well.  
Their guard, L.J. Rose, controlled the game, played great. TaShawn Thomas when
the game was on the line, played great. You gotta give them credit. They made
the plays that were necessary. They made the shots when it counted and I think
they had the confidence that they could beat us. We have had a lot of games
like this, where we have had some adversity happen and we haven't handled it
very well, and this was a typical one of those performances.  
  
Q. Coach, how much did lack of experience, playing this late into the season
with these expectations of being a ranked team, did that play any factor in
the game?  
COACH BROWN: I don't think so. I think it is true we haven't been in big
games. It's obvious we have had a hard time handling games when we have gotten
behind or had some difficulty, but we had great shots. Marcus hits a 3 at the
end of the game but other than that we're 4 for 19 and I don't think one of
those shots was guarded. TaShawn Thomas makes a great block at the end, we're
14 for 15 from the free‑throw line. Game is on the line and we're missing free
throws. The biggest thing is their "will" was greater than ours. I don't think
it's about experience or anything.  
This is part of our building process. We have to develop a trust factor in one
another and I don't think we've gotten there yet.  
  
Q. Markus, how is the ankle? You did tweak it during the second half, did it
feel any better as the game progressed?  
MARKUS KENNEDY: It still hurt, but there is no excuse for playing and losing
the game. I asked to come back in the game and I was ready. This is a
mind‑set. My ankle hurts but it wasn't enough to keep me out of the game and I
asked to come back in and I came back in and I felt I was ready to play.  
  
Q. Coach, three straight losses, not exactly how you want to finish the
regular season. Can you talk about how you go into the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH BROWN: I'm not thinking about that. I'm just disappointed because the
same stuff happens over and over again. Things don't always go right, you
know, and it's how you handle situations, that's what I'm concerned about.  
We lost to two great teams at the end of the season. I don't think anybody is
going to look at a Louisville or a Memphis loss and be worried, but I kinda
had it in my gut what was going to happen today. Houston, I thought, felt they
could win. I was thrilled the way we finished the half. Kinda felt, you know,
maybe we started to understand that every possession matters and every
possession defensively is important. But, again, we didn't handle it but we
got four days, five days to work on things and get better, and I'm confident
we will be ready when we have an opportunity to play again.  
  
Q. Nick, when you guys got up 10 in the second half, were you feeling
confident that things were going to go your way?  
NICK RUSSELL: I knew they wasn't going to give up and we was going to start
the battle for the second half, 20 minutes. We said that we had to come out
and win the first five minutes but they came out stronger than us.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you for your time.

### [Issaish Sykes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26649)

### [Ryan Watkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26650)

  
_MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE_  
  

University of Central Florida: 94  
Temple: 90

  
THE MODERATOR: We will get started with our postgame press conference, joining
us, UCF Donnie Jones, student athletes, Tristan Spurlock and Isaiah Sykes,
Coach we will get your comments.  
DONNIE JONES: First of all what, a great basketball game. Obviously give our
hats off to Temple. It's a hard‑fought game and I'm proud of our guys how we
hung in there and found a way down the stretch. There was a lot of great
efforts tonight and we're just very excited we were fortunate to come out on
the winning end down the end and look forward to having an opportunity to play
tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, you didn't have Isaiah last week when you lost at Temple. Can you
explain the difference in having him on the court tonight?  
DONNIE JONES: The difference was 36 points, which was very important. He
played very well tonight and there was a lot of great efforts on our team
tonight. Obviously having him, he's been a focal point in our offense in so
many ways, versatile, you can see we use him in many different situations we
play him at the point and we play "out" of him. So, not having him there is an
adjustment when you have one of your best players not playing in any
circumstance.  
We're glad he is healthy, back, and had a great game tonight.  
  
Q. Isaiah, did you think the buzzer beater at the end of regulation was
good?  
ISSAISH SYKES: I wish it was, but the coaches they told me it was off late so
we wanted to get on to it the next play and get ready to go the next five
minutes.  
  
Q. For any of the three of y'all, this being a "one and done" type of thing,
how much pressure is it as you get through the over time and get through the
stretch?   
TRISTAN SPURLOCK: I don't think it was that much pressure. We believed in
ourselves and every over time we didn't quit, we were down 4 with two minutes
left and we all looked at each other and we were going to do whatever we had
to do to get back in the game. Isaiah did a great job scoring tonight, and
Staphon Blair did a great job blocking shots and Kasey Wilson had 10 rebounds
so I think as a team we stepped up in other areas and we knew we were going to
have to play some defense to get this win.  
ISSAISH SYKES: It was an all‑around great game and great team effort. A lot of
people contributed to it from the point guard to the 1 through 4, you know. I
think we did a good job in game situations, changing up our players and stuff
during the game. I think our focus was on this today.  
DONNIE JONES: I think obviously pressure is always in any game when you're in
these situations, but I think the biggest thing as a coach is we're trying to
keep the guys in the next play.  
We're down 4 two minutes to go in the game and we play those kinds of
scenarios all the time in practice. You always work on late game situations
and now we just talked about, hey a lot of basketball time left it's about
gettin' stops, two possessions. So I'm just always talkin' to those guys about
going on to the next play, let's get a stop and don't worry about, oh, we're
going to lose, if we don't make this, we're in trouble, on to the next play,
on to the next play.  
I think that's the biggest mentality. Obviously you've got two seniors up here
that have been in a lot of those circumstances. Those guys did a great job of
keeping the focus and on to the next play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.

### [Eddie Jordan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16808)

### [Myles Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24970)

  
_MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE_  
  

Rutgers: 72  
University of South Florida: 68

  
THE MODERATOR: We will get ready to get started here with the Coach and
student athletes from Rutgers. Head coach, Eddie Jordan and student athletes,
Myles Mack and Kadeem Jack. Coach, we will start with you and get your
comments on the evening.  
COACH JORDAN: Okay. First of all, I just thought as simple and basic as it
sounds, I thought our personality and our demeanor on the floor was a key
element in our victory tonight.  
We missed a lot of layups. We threw the ball away, we had some missed plays,
but just our determination and our will and our personality, we didn't point
fingers and hang our heads. We didn't go haywire, we kept our discipline and
kept poised and something I have been preaching all year from the beginning,
you have to compete with composure, you have to have a great personality on
the floor, you have to help your teammates, your demeanor means a lot and that
was the key element to me.  
Obviously we made fouls down the stretch and we made some plays, but they're a
good team. They changed their defenses up on us, zone, man, pressure, some
traps and just because we sort of saw what was going on we kept our heads up
and kept our composure and that was key for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach and the student athletes.  
  
Q. Eddie, how much more difficult did it make things when Wally Judge fouled
out?  
COACH JORDAN: Well, Kadeem has assumed some center position for us and we said
we have to have team defense in the paint because they go to Chris Perry in
the paint and we wanted to help Kadeem on that.  
They're a post‑up team and a driving team and we had to have people who can
contain the drive for the most part. But we didn't want to have to worry about
a guy getting to the rim and worry about a shot‑blocker, although they got to
the rim too much for my taste.  
They got too many layups, but, again, when it was time to get some stops, we
shrunk the floor, it was a team coverage and we got some key rebounds.  
Look, we just dug it out, it wasn't a pretty game from my standpoint but it
was pretty from the fact that we kept together as a team, we had a great
personality, we didn't point fingers and hang our heads and we kept
encouraging each other when things went wrong. A lot of things went wrong so
it could have been easy for us to separate and point fingers and it didn't
happen and that is so important to winning basketball.  
  
Q. Kadeem, Myles, talk about keeping together. This is something you have
developed over the last couple of weeks. What has developed that?  
MYLES MACK: Our team leadership has gotten better throughout the season. Me,
Kadeem and the guys talk about confidence and staying together. We stayed
together throughout the first half. Second half the confidence level of
staying together went down a little bit but we fought through it.  
  
Q. You got a big boost down the stretch, didn't you?  
MYLES MACK: Yeah, he's a high energy particular guy, plays the passing lanes
and he had a lot of energy for us.  
  
Q. Kadeem, what did you have to worry about without Wally around?  
KADEEM JACK: Being physical and staying physical because Wally was already out
so I stayed physical down there and held my own.  
  
Q. Myles, what's changed since you played Louisville and what gives you a
chance to beat them?  
MYLES MACK: We have come together and the team chemistry has gotten a lot
better. We've become a better defensive team, a better offensive team, sharing
the ball with each other so I think our confidence level and our defense can
keep us in the game.  
  
Q. From that blow out with Louisville, things turned around. What did you
put together, what did they put together?  
COACH JORDAN: Just a matter of trust. You know, we have to trust each other at
the offensive end, trust what we do, trust the system, believe that if we can
stay disciplined in our offense that we can get through the initial press and
their secondary press in the half‑court. We're better at seeing the floor. So
that's going to be key for tomorrow, that we execute against their initial
press and that we execute to get a great shot in the half‑court when they
press you.  
From my standpoint, my point of view last time they just kept coming and
pressing us, making us speed up and I tell our guys, slowing down hurts the
press a little bit, less dribbling hurts the press a little bit, being able to
be organized and get to your spots. You can move the ball from side‑to‑side
the way you want to. You can get some backdoors, paint attempts, some rhythm
jump shots.  
Slow down, see, make a pass, limit dribbling and be confident.  
  
Q. Eddie with this match against Louisville do you guys have a greater
gauge, knowing what to expect or was their game plan what you expected?  
COACH JORDAN: I thought at Memphis and at Louisville was probably our two
worst games of the season as far as not trusting, not executing, not being
able to attack their pressure. I felt we did a good job against Cincinnati and
other teams that tried to press us, but even tonight for the most part, those
two teams, Memphis and Louisville put it to us.  
Look, it's a national stage, a great challenge, a great opportunity for to us
play with a lot of confidence, to show people where we are and I'm looking
forward to it. I really am.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much.

### [Fran Dunphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18225)

  
_MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE_  
  

University of Central Florida: 94  
Temple: 90

  
THE MODERATOR: We will get started here now with Temple University, head
Coach, Fran Dunphy, student athletes, Will Cummings and Quenton DeCosey. Coach
we will start with you.  
COACH DUNPHY: Very proud of our team. I thought we hung in there as well as we
possibly could and Don some really good things and obviously we made a few
mistakes that hurt us a bit.  
I thought there were a couple of plays by then that I thought were critical.
Obviously the jumper by Isaiah Sykes the end of the first buzzer, we didn't do
a great job of defend that go and Staphon Blair's shot in the second overtime
was critical where we had gone up 2 and they hit a jumper, I'm sure it was
Calvin Newell and that put them up by 1 at that point. There were a couple of
plays we need to do make and didn't. You gotta give UCF credit because they
made the shots when they needed to. Got to give them credit, but proud of
these guys.  
  
Q. Coach, this team went out the way that it played all season long and that
was fighting until the clock hit zero. What does that say about your team
right now, especially moving into next season?  
COACH DUNPHY: We talked about it half the game. I'm proud of their effort.
There was never any quit in them. I thought their attitude through a
challenging and trying season was very good. Was there frustration and
disappointment on occasion, yeah, there sure was. But I thought they fought
through it as well as you could possibly do.  
Again, I would tell you I like where we are, I like where we're headed and had
I thought this particular group did about as good as they could do in a very
challenging situation.  
  
Q. Guys, you were matching them offensively until that one stretch where you
couldn't buy one for about six shots and a couple of turnovers. Anything they
were doing defensively that was crossing you up, or run out of gas at that
point?  
WILL CUMMINGS: In the second overtime?  
  
Q. 84 ‑82 to 89‑84\.   
WILL CUMMINGS: I would say they did a good job of getting stops and taking us
out of our offense. Credit to those guys they came up with big plays at the
end of the game.  
  
Q. Stopping Isaiah Sykes was a problem all night long.  
WILL CUMMINGS: That, too.  
  
Q. What did he show you?  
WILL CUMMINGS: What we knew he could do, slacking to the basket, making plays,
he was knocking out jump shots today and he got everything going early. He
hurt us pretty bad.  
  
Q. Fran, did you have in mind to foul at the end of the first half? I know
the clock was tight.  
COACH DUNPHY: You know what? I didn't. If I was going to burn another time‑out
we would have talked about‑‑ we talked about in the previous time‑out that we
had fouls to give but we wanted to keep Isaiah Sykes in front of us, if he's
catching balls going back to the basket that would have been what we would
have tried to do and Dalton Pepper said it at halftime, "I should have kept
him in front of me" and I forgot to mention the big play, we were up 75‑70
Sykes made that critical jump shot that cut it to 2. He didn't make the foul
shot but that was a huge jump shot.  
To answer your question, I would have rather kept everybody in front of us and
not take a chance on a intentional foul or whatever, but if we had done what
we needed to do, kept them in front of us, we would have been okay.  
  
Q. Will, Fran mentioned that he likes where the team is. Can you expand on
that? Do you agree with that? Do you like where the team is after Quent's big
night?  
WILL CUMMINGS: Definitely we are going to use this stuff that we learned from
this year, sometimes we struggled just a bit on and get better as a group. We
have "Q" right here, he's coming back next year, so we're going to hit him
with some stuff some more and we have guys that didn't get a chance to play
this year that were sitting out, so we're going add all those guys to the team
and all those guys on the team right now that contributed this season, we're
going to get better and start working when we get back to campus.  
  
Q. Quenton, you scored a career high 28 points. Despite the loss, do you
think your game was on point?  
QUENTON DeCOSEY: Yeah, my teammates did a good job of looking for me and my
shot was falling through.  
  
Q. Coach, you went with the same rotation of Will, Josh, Quenton, Pepper and
Lee that rotation was on the floor for 20 minutes.  
COACH DUNPHY: Once we got late in the game typically that's what you would do
because it's so tight and every possession is so critical and we stayed with
that lineup throughout the overtimes as well.  
  
Q. Obviously you like the direction this team is taking. Defense would be an
area that you have to step it up next year, is that correct?  
COACH DUNPHY: Yeah, we have talked about it certainly as a team and I have
mentioned many times that it's the one thing that I think we need to spend so
much time on it in the off‑season and get to better spots. I don't know that
it's an effort thing, I think it's an anticipation things and we need to be
better at it. We need a lot of work on our defensive play. We actually did a
better job today than we have been doing in terms of shooting percentages and
those kinds of things.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.

### [Stan Heath](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13792)

### [Victor Rudd, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23336)

  
_MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE_  
  

Rutgers: 72  
University of South Florida: 68

  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by USF, head coach, Stan Heath, and student
athletes, Martino Brock and Victor Rudd. Coach?  
COACH HEATH: It was a tough loss. If you followed us, the game was almost a
microcosm of similar games over the last, maybe eight games that we have
played. We have been right there, one possession, one strong 3‑point shot, a
rebound, just a crucial play. Seems like we have been coming up short when it
comes to making some of those plays. We battled.  
I'm really proud of my guys and the fact that you lose games and you lose
games that are right down to the wire and it would be easy to pack it in and
give up, and we never did. We kept fighting, kept battling. We even got down
in this game by 12, and I thought our guys turned it up another notch and had
a chance to take the lead. I thought ‑‑ I think we had a 3‑point shot or a
couple of free‑throws that would have taken the lead and didn't get those, but
I'm proud of them. It was tough. These two guys right here give 100% and
worked hard and tried to make plays for our basketball team.  
We played without one of our premiere players the whole season in Anthony
Collins, and yet we had other guys who picked up the slack and didn't make
excuses and just played and tried to give ourselves a chance to win.  
  
Q. Victor, the come back. What were the things that you were finally able to
do after they pulled away on you?  
VICTOR RUDD: I think we forced them into a lot of turnovers. We got the ball
and ran and got some easy layups.  
  
Q. How frustrating has it been these last eight or nine games, one big play
away, it seems like? What has been the toughest part and is there a trend in
that you just can't get over that hump?  
VICTOR RUDD: I think a lot has to do with Anthony not playing. When you have a
point guard as good as him, he knows how to take over the game and control the
game the last 5 minutes. Even though I thought Josh picked it up real good for
us, but you miss a guy like A.C. and you can't replace a guy like that.  
  
Q. Stan, so much has been made about the change in athletic director and
what may or may happen. What's you're mind going into the coming weeks?  
COACH HEATH: I'm just going to do my job. I'm going to obviously evaluate our
program right now and see what we need to do to improve it. Three‑point
shooting is a big area that we've got to improve. We have signed a really good
player that can do that and we probably want to add a piece or two in that
area. And the guys that we have, we have some good players, guys coming back,
like Chris Perry and John Egbunu and for me it's about getting guys better,
and my focus is on the basketball program and preparing for next season as
best we can.  
  
Q. Martino, how was it to come to your hometown and have it go this way?  
MARTINO BROCK: Not very good. I wanted to come and deliver and play well and
we didn't do that. It was tough.  
  
Q. Stan, with the five teams at the top, how do you see this unfolding?  
COACH HEATH: I don't think it's as big as people think, you know, toward the
end of the year at the end of the year Houston pulled one off against Memphis.
Rutgers went down to the wire with them, three or four‑point game, last game
of the year. I don't think it's as wide of a gap as people think. It wouldn't
shock me if something happened. Down the stretch if I had to hang my hat on
it, I would say Louisville has the best opportunity, Rick has the best chance;
they have been there and done that, and Mick has done a great job with his
basketball team, and you obviously can't count out Larry Brown, either.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, gentlemen.

## March 16, 2014

  

### [Langston Galloway](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21965)

### [Halil Kanacevic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25004)

### [Phil Martelli](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16280)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

ST. JOSEPHS  65  
VCU - 61

  
HALIL KANACEVIC: We could go back to the 40 right now if I've got to feel this
way again. Just happy for that, that's how I felt.  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: I mean, we talked about it yesterday; this is a
championship game, and it didn't matter if we were tired, hurt, anything. We
just wanted to go out there, play hard and leave it all out there and try to
get this win. It was a great, great feeling; so we could play this any time,
anywhere, right now.  
RON ROBERTS, JR.: : I didn't really feel that fatigued, especially when we
knew what we were playing for. They played the same amount of games as we did,
so that's not an excuse. So we just wanted to go out there, play harder than
them, have more energy, and it's a great feeling now and it's all worth it.  
  
Q. Halil, what did you say this time, because we know you're the guy that
always motivates everybody, when things were getting a little tough and they
were on a run and took the lead in the second half what did you say to pump
everybody backup?  
HALIL KANACEVIC: Nothing. I had a time where I was frustrated and my emotions
almost got the best of me and these guys did a great job just keeping me in
it. So it's not always me. We've got a very good group of personalities here
and he does a great job managing those personalities. I'm the one that's
emotional, he's a little quiet, he's a little quiet, helps me a lot. They are
my sound board. Sometimes I don't say the right things and they help me a lot,
so give credit to all these guys.  
  
Q. Langston, a lot of big shots this weekend, is it possible for that last
step back three to stick out and what was going through your minds at that
time?  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: I mean, Coach and this team, they put a lot of trust in me
to take the big shot, and I just wanted to step up for my team. I knew it was
a critical time and I had the ball in my hand, so I just wanted to make a
play, and the ball fell. I didn't get close to pushing off so nobody would
disagree with that. Definitely a good way to knock down a shot for the team.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about DeAndre', about obviously the defensive end,
looked like a veteran and on the offensive end he looked like a freshman.
Today on the offensive end he looked like a veteran on that end, too.  
COACH MARTELLI: I really think that the play of the game for us that got us
back, we were a little skittish, was his dunk. I'm not sure that you're going
to see a better dunk.  
You could put a different jersey on a kid and say he's from a BCS conference
or whatever you want, but that dunk ‑‑ and then the only thing that we want to
work with him‑‑ and this is honest, is I don't‑‑ we don't need all those
reactions. In fact, we are going to have a coverings with Langston going into
the NCAA Tournament. You don't need all these gyrations, you know what I mean?
Like they all come up with these special gimmicks for making a 3‑point shot.
Make a 3‑point shot and get on to the next play; and DeAndre', the same about
the dunk.  
He was much better offensively. He had eight assists, and against that
pressure‑‑ and don't take anything‑‑ they changed the way they guarded us. It
was much tougher today than it was in Philadelphia when we played them.  
  
Q. You guys did a European trip, right?  
COACH MARTELLI: We did.  
  
Q. How much did that help make this come true?  
COACH MARTELLI: Well, here it is. That's a Pope‑blessed rosary ring. That's
what worked‑‑ (laughter)‑‑ nope.  
Here's what happened. When we got together in June, there was something
different about the group. DeAndre' got to campus and it was just different.
There was a seriousness of purpose.  
There was a‑‑ I'll bet that they dreamt about this day, that day, and when we
went over there, the thing that was revealed to me was character, the
character of the group. We had two rules, you're not allowed to stay in your
room, and number two, if you're out of your room, you have to be with somebody
else on your team.  
And my wife and I would kind of walk around and when it wasn't an organized
part of the trip, and we would look up and three guys would be getting pizza
together and you would think, those three guys don't seem to hang out; or
another group over here taking pictures together; and there was no pain in the
trip. Because I'll be honest with you, I was waiting for the first one that
complained about the food or the hotels are different; that breakfast is
different. They were so‑‑ they were so‑‑ and I say this in the kindest way,
they were so childish on the trip and so appreciative of the trip, that I knew
when I came back, you know what I just have to get this going in the right
direction, come up with the basketball part, because the character of the team
is clear. It's a strong‑‑ it's a championship character.  
  
Q. Last year, you seemed occasionally frustrated with Halil; how do you feel
about him this year? Have you seen some growth? Can you talk a little bit
about ‑‑  
COACH MARTELLI: I think he's a pain in the neck (laughter) I'm glad he's my
pain.  
No, what‑‑ two years ago, it was hard to get him just on basketball. He had
five or six technical fouls. I haven't had, in my career, I haven't had
players accumulate five. He had five or six in one year, and it was all‑‑ it
was all the noise that surrounded him. And he reacted to that noise.  
He told me in June that it would be different, and he has been different. And
really, he does as much coaching as I do with the group, and, you know, look,
he graduated from college. He won the Atlantic 10 Championship. That's a
pretty full plate. Now he's going to the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how you guarded Weber who had been tearing up the
conference and the tournament?  
COACH MARTELLI: Well, his speed is just phenomenal. And look, you can do all
the campaigning that you want; the national media has already decided that
Aaron Craft is the best defender in the country.  
Briante Weber is the best defender in the country. The kid has 120 steals. So
they can give the award to whomever they wants but that kid's the best
defender in the country and I was scared to death of his defense and his
presence around the ball, and you're absolutely right.  
Without Melvin Johnson, like we played and beat a wounded team, and Weber was
the one coming in. Graham is a magnificent player, an all‑league player, but
Weber was taking the ball wherever he wanted this whole tournament and the
games going into the tournament, and he was‑‑ we just tried to keep him in
front of us as much as possible, and make him take some challenge shots.  
We did a lot of switching on the perimeter, too, so that they couldn't turn
the corner with‑‑ they had him greater‑‑ they had a bigger advantage in foot
speed than we would have.  
  
Q. When you came in and gave your opening statement, you said you know this
is a type five league and you would get six teams in. Last night, Mike
Krzyzewski compared the A10 to the ACC and said that he didn't know if A10
teams could handle that schedule. What did you see this week that reinforced
your belief that this is a top five league?  
COACH MARTELLI: I'm not familiar with whom you're referring to (laughter) who
is the guy?  
  
Q. Mike Krzyzewski from Duke.  
COACH MARTELLI: Oh. (Laughter). Look, I think that‑‑ here's what I say, and I
said the same thing about Wichita State and I said the same thing about my
team in 2003, 2004. If we were playing their schedules, we would have
different players, because we would have greater recruiting advantages.  
Look, the decisions that are being made that are already been made at 6
o'clock tonight are numeric; who did you play, how did you do and where do
your numbers lay out. It will be a great celebration for the Atlantic 10
tonight with six.  
  
Q. When you play VCU, turnovers happen but it seems to be the ability to not
allow those to steam role. How did your team keep from having repeated
turnovers?  
COACH MARTELLI: Well, to be honest with you, I think we dribbled the ball a
lot. We dribbled the ball probably too much at times, and we really didn't get
the second pass involved. And watching the tape, one of the things that they
were doing a lot of is the pass from the wing to the top. They were really
denying and jumping that.  
And today, their press caused us to have turnovers. In Philadelphia, it was
passing and catching. We didn't do a good enough job passing and catching. But
I just think having really a fourth ball handler in Halil, allowed us to stem
the tide.  
I think we could have done even a better job with it, but certainly to come
out of that game with 12 with a great atmosphere, I salute the VCU fans. They
were tremendous and they made it a pseudo‑ home game for them, and we reacted
to that; I think with we got the eight‑point lead in the first half, we didn't
handle it as well.  
  
Q. Did you know at halftime you're going to play all the starters for 20
minutes and did you think they could do it?  
COACH MARTELLI: Well, I thought that in the first half, to be honest with you,
I have in my notes, and I could show you this, that I wanted to try to get
short rest for everybody. In the first half, the two guys that went in, it was
a little bit too much for them, so we were just going to ride it out. We
didn't have foul trouble. You know, like I said yesterday, you had those
time‑outs that are so long.  
What the players remarked was that they were playing for a championship; so I
had to give them the best chance to win a championship.  
  
Q. Just for accuracy ‑sake, so I get this wrong and my soul is in I am more
toll petitioner I will, did you actually get an audience with his holiness?   
COACH MARTELLI: No‑‑  
  
Q. Bummer ‑‑ Atlantic 10 championships?   
COACH MARTELLI: No, and I'm really disappointed because he's a Jesuit and he's
a Jesuit school. I just figured he would Tweet me and we would have a chance
to meet. (Laughter) but he didn't.  
And ironically, ironically, while we were there, he met with the Argentine
soccer team. But I guess he didn't want to meet another balanced‑headed
Italian American, I don't know.  
  
Q. Do you follow him?  
COACH MARTELLI: No. I don't follow anybody. I shut my Twitter down on December
8. That was the day that the world ended in Philadelphia if you ask our fans.

### [Rob Brandenberg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23622)

### [Shaka Smart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21504)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  
ST. JOSEPHS  65  
VCU - 61  
  
COACH SMART: Not much to say. It was a disappointing game. Give a lot of
credit to St. Joe's, they played great. Thought their seniors really stepped
up. Galloway, Bembry, Roberts, they made some huge plays. Congratulations to
Coach Martelli and his team. I think they have had a terrific year and they
earned this championship today.  
  
Q. Rob, on that three that Galloway hit that ended up being the tie
‑breaking three, what did you see from him there, starting to the for the
drive and pulled up for the three?   
ROB BRANDENBERG: You know, I just wanted to try to make him put it on the
ground, put the ball on the floor because he's a great three‑point shooter. I
played the drive, he stepped back, made a tough shot. I mean, that's all I can
really say about that.  
  
Q. How does it feel knowing that it's you're senior season, obviously it's a
disappointing loss, but how can you use this as motivation heading into the
NCAA Tournament and you have one more opportunity?  
ROB BRANDENBERG: I was just telling, Juvonte, Tre, you know, let it hurt, but
you can't be down too long, because you know, we've got some games we've got
to play this week in the NCAA tournament. I'm just going to use this as
motivation to leave it all out there. I don't want my season to end like this
on a loss.  
So I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure my teammates are ready
and make sure that whatever happens, you know, I just leave it all out on the
floor like I did tonight.  
  
Q. How difficult is it having lost another tight conference Final game
another straight year in the same building?  
COACH SMART: It's difficult. It's a close loss in a conference championship
you want to win. It's not really any more difficult because of what happened
last year. It's just you want to win this year in the present moment.  
Thirteen teams came up here to win, because two of them left today at one
o'clock. We felt like we had a really good opportunity to be the team that won
it, but St. Joe's obviously had something to say about that and they played
better than us.  
  
Q. Yesterday you talked a lot about the culture of unity that you guys have
developed. How do you think that's going to help you move on for this and get
ready for the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH SMART: Whatever we do, we have to do it together. It's important we are
connected in good times and in tough times. So, today we lost a game together.
We weren't good enough as a team, and it's something that hurts because it was
a big goal of ours. But it wasn't our only goal. We have obviously an
important part of the season coming up next, so I think for us, the most
important thing is to stay together and regroup, figure out who we're playing,
where we're playing, when we're playing and move forward.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S

### [Mark Schmidt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23402)

### [Matthew Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23547)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

ST. JOSEPHS  67  
ST. BONAVENTURE - 48

  
COACH SCHMIDT: Give all the credit to St. Joe's. They played well. I thought
Kanacevic was the difference. He affects the game both on the offensive and
defensive ends. He was tremendous tonight, double‑double.  
I thought in the first half, we played well defensively. We struggled
offensively throughout the game and some of it had to do with St. Joe's
defense, and some of it had to do‑‑ I think we went ran out of a little bit of
steam, especially in the second half where we made four field goals.  
One of the strengths of our team is being able to score and when we lost, it's
more defensive break downs, but St. Joe's, Roberts, Kanacevic and Galloway
were just three tremendous seniors and they played really well and deserved
the win.  
  
Q. Obviously you're disappointed in the loss, but if you could take a step
back and think about the season as a whole, 18 wins and being here today in
the semifinal, what's your take away from this last season right now?  
MATTHEW WRIGHT: At this moment it's hard to reminisce. Obviously the loss
stings right now. But maybe in a few days, when the dust and debris settles,
I'll be able to look back at the season and see how far we came from being
picked last in the division.  
You know, we're not even supposed to be here. We should be doing individuals
right now. Our season should have been a week ago‑‑ but the fact that we are
still not done and we still have games left, and Charlon and I both know, we
want to play at least three, four, five more games. We don't want to end our
season with a bad taste in our mouth like this.  
But when the time comes, we'll be able to look back on the season and
reminisce, but right now, it's back into the gym.  
  
Q. You guys were up 19 ‑10 at the 11‑minute mark of the first half and
really playing well at that point, and then from that point on, really nothing
seemed to go your way. What do you think happened from that point on?   
MATTHEW WRIGHT: Like what Coach said, the key to our offense, like
offensively, was‑‑ defensively I felt like we played a decent job. We did a
decent job defensively guarding them.  
Offensively is where we really struggled and what keys our offense is
turnovers and stops and transition and Charlon, he's the fastest player in the
league, he pushes the ball and we get dunks and layups and threes and that's
what we thrive off. It's hard to push the ball when we have a set defense back
there taking underneath the net. So they did a really good job of putting the
ball in the basket and it was really hard for us to get out on the floor and
run.  
And also, I'm not going to sit here and lie and say we are not tired.
Obviously we came off two really physical games against Saint Louis and La
Salle. I just felt like we looked at each other and nothing was going, baskets
we usually make, going off the rim. It was frustrating physically and
mentally.  
  
Q. What about their defense when you're already maybe a little bit tired;
probably makes it harder when you are feeling pretty tired.  
MATTHEW WRIGHT: They are a sound defensively team in general but what makes
them really good is their offense, and their versatility, especially with
Kanacevic, a four‑man who can pass the ball, handle the ball, shoot. It's
their offense that is their bread and butter.  
  
Q. Obviously you've been such a big key to the whole season, especially from
a scoring standpoint, you are this team's scorer when they need it. Bembry
seemed to kind of be able to take you out of the game a little bit today or
make it very difficult for you to do what you normally do. How tough was that
for you?  
MATTHEW WRIGHT: Well, they scouted us very well. They usually run a lot of set
plays for me, and he just seemed to‑‑ he was yelling out the plays as we were
yelling the plays; they were ready; they were prepared. And give them the
credit, and Bembry's a taller, longer defender, just raise up above him and
shoot.  
So he played‑‑ he played very good defense on me. It was frustrating. I forced
a lot of uncharacteristic shots in an effort to get going. Just give St. Joe's
credit.  
  
Q. Was there a point in the second half you were just like, it's just not
our game at any point; it's just bad luck kind of a thing?  
COACH SCHMIDT: No, not at a coach. Just like a player, you continue to fight.
You're never going to give in. Is that the question?  
  
Q. No, just seemed that there was such a crazy amount of lay ‑ups‑‑  
COACH SCHMIDT: Yeah, we missed a lot of layups. It's frustrating as a player,
as a coach you, but just continue to play and I thought that's what we did.  
  
Q. Obviously the third game in three days, and we talked about maybe some
tired legs. How much do you think the fatigue might have been a factor?  
COACH SCHMIDT: It's hard to say. We missed a lot of layups, and like I said,
St. Joe's is a good defensive team. They gave us a lot of problems but we
missed a lot of shots. Part of it could be fatigue. Part of it was their‑‑
it's a combination of both. But to make four field goals in the second half,
you're not going to win doing that. But they are good. They are a good
defensive team.  
  
Q. The loss is still fresh but can you reflect on what you accomplished this
year?  
COACH SCHMIDT: Yeah, I think the expectations were really low. People thought
that we weren't going to be able to do anything, and I think our guys‑‑ we
always emphasize over‑achieving and I thought we over‑achieved. You never want
to be a part of a team that under‑achieves and I think we have a bunch of guys
that got the most out of their ability.  
And if someone said that we were going to win 18 games this year, I would have
looked at them a little bit sideways, but I thought our guys really came
together; with what we lost, I can't even remember what the percentage of the
scoring and the rebounding and the assists.  
But we lost a great deal last year, and we really didn't have one go‑to guy
coming back and for us to be able to win 18 games and play in the semifinals
of the Atlantic 10 tournament speaks volumes about our guys and how far they
have come.  
  
Q. Beyond accomplishing what you did after being picked 12th, beyond that,
going into this game, Charlon, Youssou, Jordan, those guys were 5 ‑0 in A10
tournament games and have not lost in this magnitude of a game; what does that
say about just these guys as a team‑‑ before this, you had won five in a row‑‑
playing on this stage and how well they have been able to do that.   
COACH SCHMIDT: Two years ago we were 3‑0 and had a great player in Andrew and
some really good players that graduated.  
But I think with Charlon and Matt and Marquise, they have been through it and
they have good experience, and I think that helped us in this tournament,
knowing what to expect, even though Marquise wasn't a part of it from a
physical standpoint. But those other two guys, Matt and Charlon, had a great
deal to do with it, along with Jordan and Youssou. So that helps. But when you
shoot the way we shot today, it doesn't matter how much experience you had. We
just didn't have it today.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

VCU  74  
GEORGE WASHINGTON - 55

  
COACH SMART: That was a grind of a game. I thought GW did a great job
attacking us inside early on. They have two all‑conference guys in Armwood and
Larsen, and put us on our heels to some extent getting the ball into those
guys early.  
But I thought our guys kept fighting and played with great aggressiveness.
When Mel went down, that was a hit to our team to our guys, to our coaching
staff, because he's one of‑‑ first of all, he's one of the guys that everyone
on the team absolutely adores, including the coaches, and secondly he's a
very, very good player.  
But at that point, you've just got to keep playing. I told the guys, hey,
let's win this game for Mel and I thought these two and their teammates did a
great job staying together and continued to attack, and then in the last six,
eight minutes, we were able to extend the lead with our defense.  
  
Q. Briante and Treveon, it seemed like Melvin went out it took a little bit
out of you guys but you two in particular seemed determined not to lose this
game today. Could you talk about your attitude after that?  
TREVEON GRAHAM: When he went out with the injury it really hit us, because
he's a great player, a player that we look for. It may have gave us a little
bit but for him we wanted to bounce back for him and that's what we did.  
BRIANTE WEBER: Yeah, we just played for him and the seniors, knowing any game
could be our last game so we just put our heads down, and when we attack,
there's nothing that we can do wrong‑‑ we can make aggressive mistakes but at
the end of the day, as long as we're aggressive, that's the way we want to
play.  
  
Q. For both, if I ask you what you think of Melvin Johnson; just think of
him as a person: What's the first thing that pops into your head?  
BRIANTE WEBER: My brother. That's my brother. This is my brother.  
TREVEON GRAHAM: Like he said, my brother, because he's just a loving person.
He's easy to get along with and he's one of the funniest on the team. So he's
great to be around.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how you attacked the zone a little bit, seemed like
they made an adjustment with a double screen up top and you've found success
in two games now operating in the gaps, talk about the adjustment and what you
were doing to get the threes.  
TREVEON GRAHAM: We just wanted to change our mind‑set from really being
tentative to attacking. So when we were in attack mode, it was hard to stop us
getting in the gaps and find the open man when he's knocking down shots, so
were really both in the zone that way.  
BRIANTE WEBER: Basically we wanted to attackthe gap. They were trying to
funnel us in, but me and Tre just made a move and they had Larsen trying to
check us. And pretty much we just attacked him and read whatever the defense
gave us and most of the time it was Tre coming behind me for the open shot or
for him to attack the elbow, as well. That's what we did.  
  
Q. Talk about the spark that Mo brings when he comes in the game, the fans
love him and grow crazy for him; and he played great, eight points and seven
rebounds.  
TREVEON GRAHAM: He's playing great literally. He defends the basket well. For
him to be 6‑6 and be able to block shots like that is amazing and then
rebounding‑wise, he's a monster on the board when he wants to. When he brings
the type of aggressiveness that he brings today, he's real effective on the
court.  
  
Q. Armwood scored seven points really fast, looked like he was going to have
a big game, what did you do to shut them down in the second half?  
TREVEON GRAHAM: When he first started the game, he really attacked me, I got
two quick fouls, just made me be more aggressive, tried to take away from him
getting the ball, and if he did get it, then being ‑‑ inaudible ‑‑ and then on
the offensive glass, they are a good offensive‑rebounding teamso trying to box
them out and get rebounds so they don't get second chance points.  
  
Q. Briante, as much as you had 16 points today, you also were all over the
place as a distributor. Can you talk a little about what you're looking for on
the floor when you're looking to pass?  
BRIANTE WEBER: First, I have to attack and make the defense honest and when
I'm attacking, then that means, exactly, I'm getting my teammates open. So
whatever the defense gives me, that's what I'm going to take and my teammates
were open and I hit them and they were making open shots.  
  
Q. I want to make clear that math is not my strong point, but between the
two of you, you had 38 points and 12 assists, which is at least 62 points, I
don't know how many assists might have been for three ‑pointers; did you feel
it was on your shoulders to carry the team and get to the final?   
TREVEON GRAHAM: Yeah, I mean, if‑‑ I always feel like if I'm attacking, I have
a good game, so I felt coming out that I was real aggressive and I got into
the flow of it. So I just put it on my shoulders, and Bri was getting open; we
were both attacking and it was hard to stop us, definitely, when we both have
the good game we did today.  
BRIANTE WEBER: Coach Smart put the ball in our hands at the top of the key and
he wanted us to attack. So you have two against one, pretty much the odds is
in our favor. So me and Tre just attacked from the jump and took what the
defense gave us and we made the defense be honest and we just attacked them.  
  
Q. Coach Smart became the all ‑time winningest coast in VCU history with the
victory today. He always deflects the praise towards the players and his
assistants. What's Coach mean to you guys?   
TREVEON GRAHAM: Ummm (laughter) he means a lot to me. Coming out of high
school, I wasn't really recruited a lot, so he gave me the confidence, because
he had confidence in me coming out of high school, just believe in me, coming
in, played well my freshman year. The amount of confidence that he has in me
is amazing. A lot of coaches wouldn't put that much confidence in me, so that
was really appreciated and I love him for that.  
BRIANTE WEBER: Words can't explain the type of bond me and Coach has. Since
Darius was here we connected and since he leave, we've kind of been on the
same page.  
We had tough times freshman year. He sat me down towards the end of the season
so I kind of didn't‑‑ I don't know how I felt about him but now‑‑ (laughter)‑‑
me and Coach Smart, we're close and I congratulate him on his win and we're
going to get him more wins.  
  
Q. When you say attack, attack, attack, what do you mean, do you mean
getting in the gaps, taking shots, forcing turnovers on defense?  
TREVEON GRAHAM: Just playing basketball, just finding what you see open,
defense just played us havoc all over the place, pressing the ball, that's
what we do. So, if it works, we do it, so might as well do it every game.  
BRIANTE WEBER: Attack; that's us. That's a habit. It goes hand‑in‑hand, attack
and habit, that's just the way we play. We don't play 2‑3 zone. We don't play
any zone. Attacking is what we do.  
  
Q. This is the first game against them that you held them under 50 percent
shooting. What was the difference on defense today?  
COACH SMART: I thought after the first five, six minutes of the game, our guys
really buckled down and fought them for every basket. They made some threes at
the back end of the press, which that's going to happen when teams have good
shooters. The kid, Mikic, is a really good player, good shooter.  
But I thought for the most part in the halfcourt, we took great pride in our
defense and really worked as much as we could to keep the ball out of the post
and then also chase them through screens.  
  
Q. What did you say to your guys to settle them down after Melvin got hurt,
if anything, and those of us that know him know what a great kid he is, so I'm
going to ask you the same question I asked them, when you think of him, forget
ball for a second, what comes to mind first?  
COACH SMART: Well, first of all, I think it's important to note that Melvin
did not pass away today (laughter). So we will not give him a eulogy.  
He's a terrific player, a big part of our team. He was voted A10 six‑man of
the year. We'll find out, diagnose, exactly what his injury is moving forward,
and he's got a lot of great basketball ahead of him at VCU.  
So when it happened, in answer to your first question, it was a hit, because
our guys, like I said, are very connected. They care about one another, and
when they see one of their brothers go down, it affects them. Plus, he's a
good player. You play against 1‑3‑1, he's our best shooter, and he goes out
and that's something that you look around and now you're a big man down.  
First thing I think of when you say Melvin Johnson is just his smile. He's got
a terrific smile and he loves the game. He knows everything about basketball;
just ask him. But he's a basketball junky and I think for him to be able to be
up here playing in New York means a lot to him. He was really emotional back
in the locker room, during the game when he went back there, when I saw him at
halftime; and then after the game, he was very emotional.  
But again, Melvin has got a lot of great basketball left in him. Keeping our
fingers crossed that hopefully his injury isn't too bad, but whatever it is,
he'll work his way back and he'll be a great player again.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the job Briante and Trev did today of scoring,
distributing the ball and getting it to where it needed to be?  
COACH SMART: I thought those guys along with Jordan Burgess and Rob
Brandenberg showed a lot of guts against the 1‑3‑1\. That's the best word I
can use to describe it. Because when the game started, we were very tentative.
We were on our heels and we were trying to pass the ball around, had a couple
unforced turnovers. I told those guys, you've got to attack and get into the
gaps, be strong with the ball, force two guys to guard you and make a pass and
find the open man.  
And I thought those four perimeter players did a terrific job of that.  
  
Q. A big part of the game may have gotten kind of overlooked, we haven't
really talked about the ability of you guys to get extra opportunities, five
defensive rebounds, five offensive rebounds for Juvonte, which you just talk
about the way you got some really good looks in the second half and when they
were not falling, it seemed like he was the guy pulling them down for you and
giving you extra opportunities?  
COACH SMART: If you can out‑rebound GW by nine, that's a heck of feat, because
they have got a physical, big lineup. They are a very good rebounding team.
Their three man is the size of our four man, so they just have a bigger team
that impose their will.  
But I thought our guys did a good job rebounding for each other and working
together. Briante came in there and chipped in. Juvonte, I told him before the
tournament, any time you get ten or more rebounds on a year we are
undefeated‑‑ I think in his career, our wing percentage is 95 percent or
something like that, so he needs to keep doing that.  
  
Q. There was a stretch, that three ‑minute stretch in the beginning of the
second half where you guys had the four straight possessions where you made a
shot at the end of the shot clock but it seemed like nobody even tried to take
a shot; was that part of the strategy to try to slow the game down?   
COACH SMART: No, not at all. Not at that point. Guys were trying to play with
poise and get into the gaps and find their teammates, and there wasn't a lot
of shots that materialized early in the possession. GW was doing a great job
rotating and flying around, and then guys just stepped up and made some big
plays. That's just what you call talent.  
Rob has an ability to sometimes make plays at the end of the clock, and we
needed that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Mo's play on offense and defense?  
COACH SMART: Yeah, Mo was terrific. I think that's two days in a row that he's
been terrific, and three games in a row, because he was really, really good in
our last home game before the A10 tournament. He was just, again, realizing
how good he can be and I think he's opening his eyes and seeing, I can play
with these guys and I can play very, very effectively against these guys.  
I don't know, Drew, whoever did the stats had him for two blocks‑‑ seemed like
he had about ten. Scott Day would have made sure at home he had more than two.
(Laughter).  
But anyway, he changed a lot of plays around the basket; a lot like yesterday
against Kendall Anthony. He's credited for two blocks, but he changed so many
more, and I then thought he did a terrific job on the glass, as well.  
  
Q. Back in November, early December, when Briante was adjusting to being a
starter and being the point guard, talked about it being a process; could you
talk about where he is in the process now, and seems to me like he's one of,
if not the team leader.  
COACH SMART: He is. He's the emotional leader. He's definitely the biggest
talker on the team, because our two seniors are not big talkers.  
I think to be honest with you, the process started last year in March, because
he really out‑played Darius at the end of last year and started to assert
himself more and more.  
And then when Darius moved on, what we needed Briante to do was assume the on
the court role of handling the ball and leading the team and getting everyone
connected on the court, but also the off the court leadership which Darius was
so good at that. I mean, he was the best we've had.  
And that process is still evolving. I think he's come a long way as a point
guard. These last two games really demonstrate his versatility, the way he‑‑ I
mean, he affected the game so many different ways, 16 points, eight assists,
rebounds, he guarded, did a good job defensively, his hands were all over the
place.  
So he's getting better and better as a player, but he still has a long way to
go and I think he understands that. The best thing a point guard can do is
affect winning for his team and he's certainly done that the last two nights.  
  
Q. The chain Antravious has been wearing, what's the story of that and is
that a throw back to the 2007 Rams?  
COACH SMART: It is and it isn't. It's something I was aware that they used‑‑
CJ used to talk about that. But it's just something that ‑‑ our No.1 theme for
this year was we wanted to be connected and we want to be tied together as a
team and whatever happens, we do it together, and we really want to encourage
members of our team to lift each other up when things got tough, and the chain
is just a symbol of that.  
You've all heard me say, you're as strong as your weakest link. So we want
everyone to understand that if we can all be tough together and stay
connected, then nobody can break us, and we sometimes use visual symbols to
bring that point home for our guys.  
  
Q. What does it say about this program that you've been able to sort of pick
up where you left off in the CAA? Not all other programs have been able to do
that. There have been some schools that have had some bumps making the
transition and how important is it to get this Atlantic 10 Championship and
put that on the mantle, as well?  
COACH SMART: It would be great. It would be terrific. Our guys really want it,
but I'm sure St. Joe's guys do, too. They have a senior‑laden team and they
are playing really, really good basketball.  
In terms of transition from the CAA, it's a big, big step up in league. I
mean, this conference is so deep and so talented and every game is a bear,
particularly when you go on the road. I don't know if Drew is in charge of the
schedule ‑‑ but we got the short end of the stick with having to go to all the
hard teams on the road this year‑‑ the blocks, year.  
I think what it says about our guys, that we have been able to make it a
pretty good transition so far, is that our players are a lot better than
people thought during the recruiting process, because 75 percent of our
players were recruited to come to VCU when we were in the CAA, so they were
kind of recruited at that level. Maybe one or two of them, we beat someone
from a bigger league, but for the most part, no.  
Since we moved to the A10, we are obviously playing against better players,
but what it says is like these two guys sitting up here next to me, they had
peanuts for offers. Those guys, especially Briante, he was begging to come to
VCU. That's one of the reasons he's been good is guys that want to be a part
of VCU, guys that really have that want to and take pride in those three
letters across their chest, those are the guys that have been good in this
program for a long time before any of us got here.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

ST. JOSEPHS  67  
ST. BONAVENTURE - 48

  
COACH MARTELLI: First of all, tremendous respect for Mark Schmidt and what St.
Bonaventure did and how they came out. You would think they would be the ones
with the tired legs, and they put us on our heels.  
Our ball skills came in question in the first half, and these three guys just
kept talking to their teammates about staying with it. It really wasn't
coaching. It was more them being great teammates and trusting each other, and
we just wore them down. You know, they missed shots at the rim.  
I think obviously these numbers by Halil are extraordinary, and Langston
yesterday, but the effort that DeAndre' just gave, really poor offensive game
with five turnovers in the first half, but his defense on Matthew Wright was
at a very, very high level.  
So I'm happy for these guys. I just told them that we'll go back and we'll
rest and tomorrow we're coming over here for rings and nets. That's what we
want to get tomorrow, rings and nets.  
  
Q. Would you say that was one of the biggest or best performances of your
career?  
HALIL KANACEVIC: I would say numbers‑wise. I really never base my game on
numbers. I'm more‑‑ it's my floor game for the team. I don't care about
points. I definitely look at rebound, but that's the only thing I care about,
rebounds, and not so many rebounds I get, it's how many offensive rebounds the
other team gets. That's my main concern is. It's my floor game for the team.
Scoring, I don't really care about it. I just want to win, and I think these
guys feel the same way.  
But yeah, I had a good scoring game and rebounding today numbers‑wise, so that
way, yeah. But I really don't care about it.  
  
Q. You had a tough first half and you had 16 in the second half. What were
you doing differently, and also, how big was it, Halil's first half
performance?  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: I mean, the second half, Coach was just saying be
aggressive and just keep playing. I had two fouls in the first half, so I had
to sit down, but I just wanted to come out and be aggressive and then I mean,
these guys, Halil and Ron, were finding me and I was getting open looks and we
just got going from there. It's all credit to this team. We played a great
game tonight.  
  
Q. With the rest of the team struggling in the first half, you were all over
the whole game but especially the first half. Was the mentality that you
needed to take over to keep the team in it?  
HALIL KANACEVIC: No, after yesterday area performance, how they played the
whole season, they were hard on Langston, hard on the screens, just all over
him, so I was getting good looks. He was giving me good looks. Coach has
confidence in me and teammates have confidence and I have got confidence in
myself.  
So we if have a good shot ‑‑ yeah, we were all chaotic in the first half,
turnovers all over the board, and for myself, everybody. But everybody did a
good job of getting me some good shots, and we got a better rhythm in the
second half where he started scoring and I started scoring but the first half
I got good looks.  
  
Q. You had a couple blocks off the ball ‑‑ tell me how big that was and also
the fact that they missed a lot of shots inside.   
RON ROBERTS, JR.: Yeah, I just tried to help my team in any way. If the guard
was coming to the lane, I wanted to protect the basket and just try to do the
little things to keep our team in it.  
  
Q. For any of you, how do your legs feel after two games in a row logging
heavy minutes and how do you think it's going to affect you tomorrow?  
RON ROBERTS, JR.: Well, we're playing a championship tomorrow, so we've got to
just forget about that. We're still going to play hard, feel the energy, we
really want to win a championship. Since we've been here we've never been this
close, so we've got to seize the moment tomorrow.  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: I mean, Ron said it, we've just got to go out there, sees
the moment, play hard and leave it all out there because there's no tomorrow.
So I mean, it's a championship game, and we're going to come with a lot of
energy.  
HALIL KANACEVIC: They said everything.  
  
Q. In Philadelphia, I would assume that Villanova got a lot of pr this year
because they had such a good year, and you guys get to the Atlantic 10
tournament as the four ‑seed and yet you're considered a bubble team. Are you
guys tired of being overlooked?   
HALIL KANACEVIC: We don't care about any of that stuff. It's just been about
us the whole year.  
Do you think we're underrated? We don't care. No offense ‑‑ I mean, no
offense, but we don't listen to that stuff. We just keep our head straight.
Coaches do a good job of just keeping us in that tunnel vision. We don't care.
We just care about winning basketball games, one, a hundred‑‑ I don't think
anybody in that locker room would care, we just keep trying to win games, each
and every game.  
RON ROBERTS, JR.: Yeah, like Halil said, we don't listen to the outside stuff.
We just listen to each other, listen to our coaches and so we just try to go
out there, play hard and control what we can control and that's it.  
  
Q. You mentioned before that you are preparing for the Championship game
tomorrow. How do you go in to night looking at either playing VCU or George
Washington? How do you prepare for either one of those teams?  
RON ROBERTS, JR.: We have to wait until the game is over obviously. We're
going to prepare, watch film, do a walk‑through. Coaches do a great job of
getting us ready, get off our feet and just be ready to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Langston, if you can remember, you guys were starting to get some
separation and you fed Halil for a layup for a basket and you had a pretty
good emotional response to that. Can you remember what was going through your
mind at that time?  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: It's funny that you say that because me and Halil were
talking that at the end of the bench at the end of the game. It happened when
we played at St. Bonaventure. I hit Halil with the same pass and he dunked on
Andell. But this time, I knew it was coming. I was just waiting for him. He
kept slipping all night and I finally got an open look to try to hit him with
a quick pass and he finished with a dunk.  
  
Q. With 14 assists on 21 made baskets, what does that say about the
unselfishness of your team?  
COACH MARTELLI: Well, the coach in me is going to say it's really a nice job
by them but then there's 14 turnovers, but we have to clean up. We had ten in
the first half. We'll clean those up.  
Obviously against these two teams tomorrow, VCU with their pressure and George
Washington with their 131, you can't turn the ball over that much. But that's
what we've done. We basically had five guys average double figures. We do it
by six‑game totals and I always give them number of baskets on assists and our
total for the last six games was something like 67 percent. So that's
basically what we did here today.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about, again, the two potential opponents you
could face tomorrow, more specifically, what problems each team might present
for your team and how you guys are going to go about trying to overcome those
challenges?  
COACH MARTELLI: Well, first thing is that they are both really good teams. We
were fortunate enough to beat VCU at the end at home. We had some separation
in that game and they just kept coming, as is their kind of MO.  
With George Washington, we got down 14 I think in the first half, went on a
16‑0 run to take a two‑point lead. We maintained that lead in the second half
but we had a lot of foul trouble, particularly with Halil. You know, they have
a wonderful, wonderful player, I think underrated maybe, even a pro prospect,
in Garino.  
And they are both going to be coming in on an uptick. They both played really
well last night. I only saw snips, little snippets of their games last night,
but they both played really well and I would expect that this will be a
high‑energy game. They tell me, the people from the league tell me, that
George Washington has a really sizable turnout with them and the VCU crowds
are legendary.  
So I'll know more at 6:30, and we'll meet the team at 8:30 tonight just do
film, tomorrow we'll walk‑through at 8:00 AM.  
I think we have to make it about us, not necessarily about who we are playing.  
  
Q. Halil has such a unique skill set ‑‑  
COACH MARTELLI: And personality, and vocabulary‑‑ (laughter).  
  
Q. Because of the way he plays and the way you guys play with him, and he
has the ball so much, how difficult was the decision for you when he first
came to the program to put that kind of trust in a kid like that?  
COACH MARTELLI: Well, I think the biggest thing was to get him on the floor.
You know, like Ron Roberts, obviously everybody knows is a highlight reel
dunker and we had C.J. Akin leading the country at one point in blocked shots,
and now we are looking at Halil. And Halil is the best low‑post passer,and
he's also the best low‑post distributor.  
So we had to figure out a way to get him to the post and not‑‑ but he's been
asked to sacrifice. He'll tell you that he's been asked to sacrifice, and if
he could play in the low post, he would be convinced that these would be the
numbers that he would post every single night.  
So I'm fascinated by him as a person. I said yesterday in his press
conference, on a team full of great teammates, he's the best teammate. And
he's the one‑‑ when that was‑‑ like that was ugly for about 14 or 15 minutes.
He kept saying in the time‑outs, "Listen, it's all right," we were just down
nine, we're down one; it's a tie, we're up‑‑ whatever‑‑ I didn't have to say
it. He said it to them, and because he says so much, they all listen to him.  
  
Q. You talked about Langston in the past beating opponents softly; is that
changing? Is he turning the corner on that?  
COACH MARTELLI: Well, Langston, all three of these guys are seniors, and
really, they want to keep going. When we came here, we didn't know if we would
keep going. Like we didn't know if we would keep playing.  
And Langston has a fire that you almost have to equal at times, because he
always wants to be in the gym and he always wants to get shots and he always‑‑
and he has to listen to what we're telling him about, you know, get off your
feet, rest, and just keep driving at this thing, because that's the attention
that he deserved and he just had 16 points in a semifinal game in the second
half.  
And we are going to lean on him tomorrow, against either one of these
opponents. It was a little hairy there a little bit, you know, and he hit the
three, like on your side of the court, the press table side. That's a monster
three. That ended the game, really. I think we were holding nine and he hit a
three put us up 12. That's what we need from him. Your best players have to
play their best in order for you to advance.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit more about your defense against Matthew
Wright? I don't think he got an open look today.  
COACH MARTELLI: Bembry was unbelievable. At the offensive end of the floor,
DeAndre' was a freshman in a big game setting. At the defensive end of the
floor, he was a ten‑year vet.  
We kept talking to him in the time‑outs; that offensively, it will come, it
will come, stay relaxed, quit turning the ball over. But defensively, he maxed
out his effort. He's exhausted and he should be, because that was a really
good player that he guarded.  
  
Q. Would you consider this Halil's best all ‑around game as a whole?   
COACH MARTELLI: I don't know. I don't rank them, I really don't. I'll be
honest with you; I think the game he had and the game that saved the season
was the second half against Drexel. We were down a couple at the half, I think
he had 27 against Drexel, and he knew it; he knew that day that we really need
him, because we weren't hitting on all cylinders. But seriously, I‑‑ I just
asked him walking over, did you have 20 rebounds, because I didn't know how
many he had.  
But I think from the whole, scoring the ball, rebounding the ball and leading
his team, it was right up there as a great performance.  
  
Q. 2014 did a few things, but they didn't win an A10 title. What is the
meaning of playing for a championship with these guys and for your program?  
COACH MARTELLI: Well, for these guys, it's justification for how much they
have believed in each other, and the fact that‑‑ you know what it was like.  
We go back to that Sunday after we lose to Villanova by about 111, I think the
final was, and it's justification. They stayed with it. They trusted each
other, and what Ron said is what they did; they went internal. They only
listened to each other.  
I'm delighted for them; that they are going to have a chance now to put their
name on a line that really only one team has done, that only one of my teams
has done. So I think it's not just the seniors, though. I've been saying it
all year. This team has extraordinary character and their character's being
rewarded by the way that they are playing.  
  
Q. One thing the St. Bonaventure did yesterday and love to do, they love to
get down in transition and be able to kick it out with the perimeter shooters
and today they only hit two triples, was the main key to the transition, the
perimeter that you can talk about?  
COACH MARTELLI: I'll be honest with you, three games in three days. We played
defense. I'm not taking anything away from my team but they played three games
in three days, and ironically, I spoke to my team last night. I've been asked
questions all year about depth, depth, depth, depth, depth, but then I looked
at their minutes and their guys played heavy minutes.  
But when you're being run off your plays, that ball's heavy. That ball's
heavy. Like I said, we were able to take advantage of the fact that they were
playing with tired legs.  
  
Q. Along those same lines, I know you've had a tight rotation all year but
now playing three games in three days, how much of a challenge is that going
to be, especially against VCU?  
COACH MARTELLI: You're playing for a championship. You know what I was
thinking about coming over here? We came‑‑ I don't know the streets up here
but we came past a park, and I was think to go myself, those kids in the park
are playing for one reason: They want to stay on the court. So if they have to
stay on the court until 6:00 tonight, and that was at 11:30 this morning, they
would do whatever was necessary.  
And that's exactly what we're going to do. And if that means throwing guys in
to save minutes, buy minutes. But seriously, if you look at these media
time‑outs, I got engaged in less time than the media time‑outs. It's too long.
I don't have anything left to tell them. I don't know that much about
basketball, and there's two and a half minutes; what am I going to tell them?
I know we have to sell advertisements and all that other stuff, but we'll use
the time‑outs. We're playing for a championship.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2014

  

### [Isaiah Armwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25020)

### [Mike Lonergan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20780)

### [Nemanja Mikic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26733)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

VCU  74  
GEORGE WASHINGTON - 55

  
COACH LONERGAN: Yeah, disappointed with the loss. I thought that was a pretty
good game for about two‑thirds of the game and I think Nemanja hit a shot to
cut the lead to 53‑50 with 7:43 left, and then after that, we just struggled
to score.  
I think a lot had to do with three free shooting. We missed one, one, two in a
row; so we left four points in a row there, and they made plays; but sometimes
have to give the other team credit and I definitely give them all the credit
in the world.  
We struggled to score because their bench did a good job and we were tired
late and the two shots that beat the shot clock, a three and a two, those five
points were really killers and big momentum swing, so that really hurt us.  
  
Q. Isaiah, what changed the second part of the second half? Seemed like they
were able to dictate after that?  
ISAIAH ARMWOOD: Early in the game we made all the right plays but there was a
turning point in the game where it wasn't necessarily them making us turn the
ball over. We just made some uncharacteristic turnovers and they took the lead
going into the halftime and that continued in the second half.  
  
Q. What was it like seeing Keethan back on the floor for you guys and when
he had to step out a few minutes later, what was that like? What did you talk
about?  
ISAIAH ARMWOOD: It's been awesome. He kind of carried us through for the first
half of the season. He's really improved this whole year and we are really sad
to see him go down and then for the last eights weeks, we all waited for this
moment to see him come back.  
  
Q. Nemanja, another great day from the three ‑point shooting range, talk
about the confidence you have going into the NCAA Tournament, assuming you're
getting in, it's a good time for you to be hot?  
NEMANJA MIKIC: I think the style of the play for VCU, a lot of times, they
will trap and I think our guys did a good really job of‑‑ our guys did a
really good job of finding the extra pass. We had a lot of good shots, but
it's not like I created them; I think my teammates found me open.  
  
Q. Do you want to talk about the inside defense of VCU?  
ISAIAH ARMWOOD: I think early in the game, defense scored a couple times.
Their defense on the inside, really didn't affect that much, but late in the
game we couldn't get the ball inside because of the pressure, it was
full‑court pressure, and we kept turning the ball over, it was hard to get it
in the half court the second half. They have good bigs and they are strong but
other than that, we struggled getting the ball over the halfcourt.  
  
Q. For both of you, what do you take away from this tournament moving
forward to the NCAA?  
NEMANJA MIKIC: I think especially like last two games, we face teams that play
a lot of press, VCU, that's what they are known for so hopefully helped us get
better with us. Played 1‑3‑1 today and that exposed some things and hopefully
we can learn from that and gain confidence from each of our losses and wins
and just carry forward.  
  
Q. They out ‑rebounded you today by nine; what was the difference that they
were able to get to the boards?   
ISAIAH ARMWOOD: I mean, we played zone, so when we play zone, we can't find a
man but that's no excuse for not rebounding. I think it was tied at halftime,
the rebounding margin, but the second half we didn't do the job on the boards.
They are known for rebounding and we knew that coming into the game, we just
didn't put a body on them‑‑ so there for it was on the shoulders of me and
Kevin.  
  
Q. Yesterday I asked Coach Kellogg with UMASS how does he even worry about
game planning for a player like Nemanja who has flourished recently. Do you
think teams should really start game planning for him or do you hope they
don't?  
COACH LONERGAN: I don't know. I mean, he's always been a good shooter. He's
definitely struggled the second half of the year to make open shots. And
today, all those open shots he made, the bad shots he took, they were
contested, and the bounce plays, he didn't make them.  
But my hope is that in the postseason here, if we are able to get to the NCAA
Tournament, hopefully he'll make shots because it definitely makes us a better
team. We should have had the lead at halftime, gave up a three late but by him
coming off the bench‑‑ bench scoring and bench rebounding is our biggest
weakness.  
But by him coming in and scoring two days in a row that allows us to compete
with some of the top teams in our league and nationally. Earlier in the year
he was making shots and we were beating some of the best teams in the country.
I'm happy for him that he's making shots again but we've got to get him and Mo
Creek and everybody making shots on the same night.  
  
Q. Bringing Keethan back in, was it to give him game experience and give him
the female of the tournament?  
COACH LONERGAN: Yeah, I think we are going to be allowed to play him maybe
four minutes‑‑ he felt some soreness, I think he told our trainer, so he told
me to take him right out. It's tough, I feel bad, I'm hoping he's all right
and maybe if a few more days‑‑ supposed to be six to eight weeks and it's been
seven weeks. So it's something we have been kind of like, one more game, keep
him back and now here we are and he's not really back yet.  
So I'm hoping that if we make the tournament, we don't play until next Friday
but we really need him, and it's changed our team a lot and we were able it
beat VCU at our place being at home but also because it gave us another ball
handler and they took advantage of our lack of ball handling.  
  
Q. Anything you've heard about Joe's injury in the second half, how he's
doing?  
COACH LONERGAN: I don't know. Somebody said it might have been his ankle,
which I felt good about, wasn't his hip. But I knew it would be tough for him
to come back, whatever, played till 11:30, come back at 4:00. I knew it would
be tough but he's a warrior, he plays so hard.  
I mean, I don't have a lot of choice as you see, so I'm glad he played, even
if he wasn't full speed. But you know, I give VCU credit. They wore him out
and wore all our team out but hopefully he'll be back by NCAAs.  
  
Q. VCU had a sizable fan base in Brooklyn at the game. Did that play any
factor in terms of your offensive sets or defensively, the crowd?  
COACH LONERGAN: No, I don't think so. I thought we had a great crowd.
Obviously the last seven minutes and 43 seconds, the crowd had already left;
ten minutes before that the crowd were louder because they were on a big run.  
But I don't think our guys were affected by the crowd at all. We are excited
to play in this beautiful arena and I thought we had tremendous support again
just like we did last year. I thought it was more the players on the court for
VCU that affected us in their defense than the crowd. But it was good to see.
This is what they get and it's great for our conference.  
  
Q. Even though it's not the results you wanted, do you take any consolation
that there's more basketball ahead of you in all probability and you have
another chance in the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH LONERGAN: Yeah, I told the guys before the game no matter, hey, if we
win, we have to prepare for tomorrow and if we lose, we'll be miserable for a
few hours, so I told them, I'll try to make it an hour. Sulk for a while and
probably take me until I go to bed tonight or if I go to bed, but I'll Wake up
tomorrow and it will be a great day in my life.  
Talking about‑‑ getting in the tournament‑‑ but we're getting in the
tournament unless everybody's wrong. So I'll be happy, I'll be happy for our
team, I really‑‑ and I'll be happy for our fans, a guy like Diego Sherikov
(ph) wrote to me talking to me about 1998, and he was like, hey, we lost to
Xavier in the tournament and we lost to Oklahoma State.  
I told our guys, all these people are into it and that's how it should be.
There's a lot of people that are really happy about our success and we don't
want to just make the tournament, though. If there's ever a year you can
advance, hopefully this will be the year.  
So I think we'll be refocused and hopefully play a lot better next Thursday,
but, you know, like I say, one of the reasons we played very poorly the last
ten or minutes was because of VCU.  
  
Q. Can you just talk more about the early play of Isaiah inside and the
struggles to get him the ball late?  
COACH LONERGAN: He was 4‑for‑4 and Kevin was 4‑for‑7 at halftime. I told our
guys, they are really scoring, we have to get them the ball.  
But we struggled to get them the ball and we got to the halfcourt where we are
trying to get it, and they are not really respecting some of our guys as
shooters so they are backing off and it's a smart thing to do and it's really
difficult to get the ball inside.  
So, you know, that's because of their defense and we wanted to go inside more,
and I think we got tired, too. I think Kevin was really tired out there. He
played a lot of minutes and it was one of my fears going into this game, not
just because of the turnaround time, really, but just because of the way VCU
plays‑‑ we did a did job‑‑ I don't want to say controlling tempo but playing
more to our pace. But the second half, some turnovers and bad shots got going
and that's when it really started to slow down.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Derek Kellogg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23395)

### [Chaz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23397)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

GEORGE WASHINGTON  85  
MASSACHUSETTS - 77

  
COACH KELLOGG: I'll start out by saying GW, George Washington, I thought
outplayed us tonight. They played a very good game and made some shots; they
go in almost 50 percent from three, I think hurt us quite a bit.  
We didn't take advantage of a lot of the opportunities we actually had. We
didn't make the shots or the plays when we had gotten the game sped up to a
certain extent.  
So, we will move forward, at least I'm hoping that we are able to move forward
and play again. You know, time is past. You lost here and you go home. I think
this team has some life left in us. A couple days off will actually be pretty
good for us. Looked like the legs on some of our threes were not quite there,
not too happy. It's been an emotional kind of start with the Saint Louis game,
and even last night versus Rhode Island. Got a little emotional, everybody is
putting a little‑‑ trying to win maybe a little too hard.  
  
Q. Is it concerning to you at all that you guys were a little bit
inconsistent, especially early tonight to not play as well as you guys have
played this season?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's a little frustrating. Maxie has been carrying the
load honestly, our six man or seven man off the bench, carrying the load,
that's not real good to the guys that are starting the game. We all understand
what we have to do, and like Coach just said, we just going to have to just
sit and wait and hopefully Sunday it's all good, everything is good and we get
our name called.  
  
Q. Feel confident about it?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: Yeah, I felt tremendously confident about it. We played some
tough teams this year. We beat some great teams.  
  
Q. I want to go back to the sequence of events at the end of the first half
where they went on a 5 ‑0 run. What did that do to the team mentally going
into the half, because you guys were making a run at the end and all of a
sudden, boom, it's up to nine.   
CHAZ WILLIAMS: It didn't do much to us. Like we've been in that situation
before, but it always hurts a lot more when you're trying to make stops and
you are stopping the guys and here they come with a nice run.  
So it always hurts just to know like you're doing good and they overpower you.  
  
Q. Did you feel like you had to take matters more into your hands the second
half?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: I just had to make plays. Nobody in my team was scoring the
ball so I just had to make plays. The whole first half, I was trying to get
guys involved, and just keep going. But the second half, I seen nobody is
really making shots but here and there but I just wanted to get it going and
hopefully they get it picked up off of me.  
  
Q. For as well as you've played over the course of the season, to finish
this way, does that concern you when you have big games coming?  
COACH KELLOGG: Well, what concerned me is we had a play that's two games
back‑to‑back, wasn't perfect for us. We didn't have a lot of time to prepare,
so hopefully we'll have a little more time to prepare in the tournament and
we'll be a little sharper and hopefully make some shots. That would be
beneficial to throw some balls in the basket.  
  
Q. Is playing against the 1 ‑3‑1 particularly hard with no time to prepare?
  
COACH KELLOGG: Yeah, that was difficult. Really what's difficult honestly was
the end of that first half. That drove me to insanity actually. It was not fun
in the locker room, because we couldn't afford‑‑ the flow of the game was our
way. I thought we had them kind of right where we wanted them, and kind of a
couple of just non‑smart basketball plays gave them the momentum going into
halftime.  
And then even the second half when we got the flow going the way I thought was
beneficial for us, they actually took advantage of it and made the shots that
we didn't make.  
So, I mean, you know, we had to have Clyde and Demetrius come in to make
threes, where everybody else I think was 4‑for‑21 or something along those
lines.  
  
Q. Did you ever think you'd have to prepare for a game like that from
Mikic?  
COACH KELLOGG: No. We've known he's been a good shooter for a long time but
that nine points in the first half, actually, that kind of propelled them and
gave them some confidence I thought.  
I thought we were guarding them pretty well and they actually were running
things for him was a little surprising. But he's a good player. He gives them
another weapon, and as you can see, when you can make some 3‑pointers, I think
that loosens things up; that opens the game up for them.  
  
Q. You said guys were maybe trying to do a little too much. What do you do
in the next few days?  
COACH KELLOGG: Right and I talked about maybe having a little too much‑‑
honest, because I thought our whole staff, myself included we were probably a
little too emotional because I really wanted to win the tournament. I wanted
to play well. I wanted to get our guys prepared for the next step. I think our
staff and maybe even the players were a little more tense than normal.  
And so there will be a lot of reflection and I think coming into the NCAA
Tournament, our guys will be ready. We are going to calm down a little bit and
play our game and concentrate on defense and rebounding instead of worrying
about scoring the ball.  
  
Q. You spent almost the whole two days trailing. How tiring is that for a
team and how much do you have to adjust the game plan when you're always
playing from behind?  
COACH KELLOGG: Well, you know, we had not pressed much this year as we have in
years past, which will change next year for anybody who is wondering. That
said, when we are trying a style and trying to come back, we're pressing and I
don't think we‑‑ I tell you what, I will say this; the game, even though it
wasn't the way I wanted to be, the pace was where it needed to be for a while
there. And I haven't been in one of those in a while where we didn't take
advantage of it, about 17 different times then they made a few big plays and
runs and a couple threes.  
So I think if we are going to press like that in the NCAA Tournament, the next
three or four days will be definitely a little more up‑tempo in trying to get
it in faster.  
  
Q. You mentioned the emotions of the past couple days, and probably only
going to heighten going into Sunday, been a while since the team has gone into
a Selection Sunday ‑‑ how do you think the team will handle that in the coming
days coming off a disappointing loss going into something so special like
that?  
COACH KELLOGG: You know, I explained to them that in a weird way, UMASS has
not been to the NCAA Tournament for me in 15 years is like, come on, we're
UMASS, we should be there. And so let's not go in there like that's good
enough and that everybody is excited we're there. No, I want to go and try to
win.  
So that's the message. I think they are going to take on my demeanor over the
next four or five days, which is going to be, we're going to be loose but
we're going to be sharp and we're going to play the way we need to play.
That's happening. Now, whether we win or lose, I hope we win; but they are
going to take on the way I want their personalities and their kind of mental
approach is going to be.  
  
Q. How much is on the line with Maxie's play?  
COACH KELLOGG: He's been great. As you can see, when we play a little more
up‑and‑down, a little more freelancer or free wheeling and pressing, he's
fantastic. He might be the best one‑man press in the country. And so, that
would be one of the reasons, too, for next year, we're going to be pressing
more, because I'm hoping he'll be in the front of that pressing on the ball.  
But come NCAA Tournament time, if he's got more legs and is bouncier and is
playing better defense than the other guys, then he's going to play. He's
really our sixth starter and he's just behind a couple guys that are seniors.
Now I'm not one that likes to just change lineups to say I'm changing them,
because I think he's either deserving to start or play 29 minutes a game.  
  
Q. Given the boost Demetrius gave you in the second half, do you wish you
went deep near your bench earlier?  
COACH KELLOGG: Yeah, I think about that all the time, earlier in the season I
should say, not earlier in the game. I look back and reflect, when it was
going so kind of well and I kind of wanted to stay with the older guys and the
guys that have been there, but I do think it would have been nice to have
worked one more shooter in, whether it's Demetrius, Clyde or even Seth. Those
guys have practiced fantastic all year. I'm proud of Demetrius, Seth, Jabarie,
Clyde, and even Zach Coleman, those guys have been great, and I'm looking
forward to some day being in a similar position with those guys being juniors
and seniors.

## March 14, 2014

  

### [Matt Kavanaugh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26716)

### [Archie Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23486)

### [Dyshawn Pierre](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26715)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

ST. JOSEPHS - 70  
DAYTON - 67

  
COACH MILLER: Obviously very hard‑fought game. I thought both teams really
battled and competed.  
You know, from our standpoint, I thought we had enough in the tank to get the
job done. We probably shot ourselves in the foot just one too many times at
some critical times that we couldn't even maybe carry a bit of the lead,
disappointing.  
But you're up with one, 20 seconds to go, it's March, playing sense St. Joe's
who is a terrific team and the guy makes a great shot; a great player makes a
great shot.  
Like I told the guys afterwards. I have to do a better job for them, 15, 16
seconds to go, I have to set them up a little bit better. We have to get a
better shot. We have to get a two‑point basket on that. I'll kick myself on
that one.  
But couldn't be more proud of the group. They have been one of the most fun
groups to be around. We still have a lot of ball left in us to play, and my
hope is that we'll have one more burst in us where we can make something
happen.  
  
Q. Dyshawn, what did you see off Galloway, the last shot he made?  
DYSHAWN PIERRE: Could have gone both ways. We thought it was a push‑off. But
that's a really good team. It was a really good shot, and it was just a tough
shot.  
  
Q. Matt, you guys were down six and made a real quick run to get back in it,
maybe the biggest shot of your career at that point. Talk about the run.  
MATT KAVANAUGH: Well, we've been in that situation multiple times this year. A
lot of our victories, we've had to come back from behind, so we're used to
being in that situation and yeah, that definitely was one of the biggest shots
I've ever made and just too bad we couldn't close it out with one more stop.  
But yeah, as you mentioned, the fact that this team can continually be down in
that situation and continue to fight and comeback, that says a lot about the
character and the resiliency of this group.  
  
Q. I know you want one more chance to play in the NCAA Tournament. How much
would that mean to you to get the call on Sunday?  
MATT KAVANAUGH: That would be the perfect, I guess, the perfect period at the
end of a senior season I guess, and we think we've done enough to earn a spot
in the tournament, and we're looking forward to that opportunity.  
And if not, we'll be looking forward to playing in the other tournament. We
definitely know we have more basketball to play; so whichever tournament we're
in, we're going to be excited and ready to keep battling.  
  
Q. What was the plan when you had the ball with 15 seconds left and you were
looking at that last shot?  
DYSHAWN PIERRE: We ran over a play that Coach drew up. It was a great play.
Just was shut on it. At the end of the day, we tried to get a shot, wasn't
exactly what we wanted. We wanted to get to the rim but I mean, didn't happen
and we adjusted and just didn't work out for us.  
  
Q. You guys are in an interesting situation here, obviously with the first
four, I don't believe Dayton has ever had a situation where they have been so
close to the double and obviously with the situation in the first four; so I
know you believe you probably should be in, hope you get in, but if you do,
there's a chance that you might just barely scoot in and play on your home
court. Can you speak to that situation and how even though right now, if you
lost, it might benefit you by knowing the arena and having a process that
would replicate something much closer to the regular season than what would be
a postseason tournament game for others?  
COACH MILLER: Yeah, the question has been asked a few times of late about that
situation and that opportunity, and I'll answer it the same way I pretty much
answer all of them: You don't go into the season saying, I hope I get the draw
and we can play at home in the NCAA Tournament. It never crosses your mind.
The mission is to get to the Tournament.  
Now, the first four is the tournament, and we've seen some great things happen
from the first four. I think VCU a few years back made a great run. You have
got to win to move on, but you're in the dance; and you're going to play
against another team that is excited to be there.  
To play in the arena, would it be familiar? Yes. It's a different crowd; it
would be a different setup. The restrictions, the ability to get on and off
the floor would be fine. It's going to be an equal deal for the game, and when
you tip it, maybe the rims are a little bit more familiar.  
But I think the quality of the opponent, the atmosphere and the environment
would change the mind‑set a little bit. I don't necessarily know if we would
be going in there feeling we're in good shape because we're at home.  
But it is a unique situation. I hope we get the call. I expect to get a call.
I think we have done enough and if it's in Dayton, it's in Dayton.  
  
Q. With that possibility, how do you handle the next 48 hours?  
COACH MILLER: There's nothing to do. I mean, our guys have come off one of the
more memorable runs that a team has had.  
For St. Joe's, unfortunately I don't necessarily know if they are going to
lose another game and we can't beat them right now. They are the last loss
that we have had since January. It's been them two times, and we've had two
good games and one not so good.  
But we've had a great run. They have exhausted an extreme amount of energy.
There's a lot of emotions with the ups and downs that go into the season, and
the next step is to take a deep breath and be proud of what we have done
together.  
It's a great group to be around. They should be really proud of what they have
been able to accomplish. There's so much sacrifice and so many individual
players on this team that could play on other teams and get more minutes and
whatnot, and they just kind of stuck with it.  
There's a reason you come in here in March, won 23 games‑‑ 10 out of 11 before
tonight; we're playing as good as maybe any team is playing. We just weren't
good enough tonight. If there's just one thing, you just look at it tonight,
if we could just make a couple free throws and maybe help ourselves a little
bit.  
But you've got to control what you can control. We've had a lead with 32
seconds to go and a guy makes a great shot, he's a great player.  
  
Q. Can you take us through the huddle with about 3:30 left to go, your kids
responded after being down six, were there any specific adjustments or was it
just playing?  
COACH MILLER: It was just playing. But at the end of the day, we have been
there a lot. We understand how we have to do it if we are going to get back
into it.  
We've done it a lot. We've had so many games this season where we made runs,
and it starts on defense. And we were able I thought to get some stops and a
stop led to a three and then we were able to get another basket. The next
thing you know, you're right back in it.  
. That's been the MO of our group all year. They are kind of fearless like
that. They don't hang their heads a whole lot. There's a lot that went on in
the last 3:30 that I thought if we could have gotten a couple of those
first‑time rebounds maybe it changes a little bit, and particularly the last
play, I have to do a better job of getting into the situation.  
But we battled. That team has battled all year; it's battled since we were
down 15 at the half to Maui; to Gonzaga; at Saint Louis. There's been probably
ten times this season that they have sat there and looked at me and said, you
know, here we go. And they did it again.  
  
Q. Pierre said the push off, looked like it could have gone either way,
wondering what your opinion ‑‑ on the Galloway shot.   
COACH MILLER: It could go either way. The referees did a good job. It was a
well‑officiated game. Had a great crew on the game. And if you ask me, what
did I see, I felt like he got some space. I felt like he created some space.  
Now is everybody referee going to call the call with that much on the line?
Probably not; let the kids finish it out. We still had an opportunity to
control what we wanted to control down the other end, and we did a poor job,
and I'll take the blame on that one.  
But we have no problems, and if we make some free threes‑‑ there's a lot of
things that can go on in the game. The officials did a good job.  
  
Q. What's the plan for the players the next 48 hours?  
COACH MILLER: Well obviously de compress here. Figure out our departure plan
out of New York and at some point in time we'll get back together, give them
some time to themselves on Saturday to rest, and we'll get back together at
some point in time and we'll figure out what the next step is.  
This is a big waiting game. Obviously a lot going to happen on Saturday and
then on Sunday's championship games and whatnot. I'm not going to watch a
whole lot of TV and I'm going to tell them not to watch a whole lot of TV
because the only thing you're going to do is get stressed out.  
We've done our thing. They have everything they need to know about us and if
going 12‑3 in non‑conference, going seven‑‑ I don't know, seven true road
games we have won; nine away from our building; we have ten wins against the
Top‑100; four or five wins against the Top‑50\. The intense (ph) of schedule
in a non‑conference, they tell you to schedule as hard as we can. We tried to
schedule as hard as we could. So our resumé is what it is, and I think it's
very favorable when you stack up against the others who are in your field.  
And if you add to the fact that you only lost a couple games since February 1,
there's very few teams that are playing as well as us. I hope we get a chance
to get on that stage. Our kids deserve it and in particular our deserve class
deserves it.  
  
Q. What adjustments did you make for Galloway?  
COACH MILLER: Not very many. The thing was in Game2, in Philadelphia, we were
very, very paralyzed by him. Here is a guy that that's prolific from behind
the three‑point line, he dominates the game plan. You don't want him to get
off and at the same time when your kids are confused and consumed with it,
they become polarized and then you start to play four‑on‑four and you don't
have your five guys guarding your rotations, your positioning. He becomes kind
of an on island and you say, good job, you held him to eight points. Well,
they got 90, you know what I mean.  
We went with a team approach and we really tried to contain the post and tried
to guard the ball better and tried to do some things. I thought he got some
good looks early and made them. He got open a couple times in the second half.
The last one he made was a very difficult shot. That's not the first time he's
had six threes. The last time we played him I think he was coming off check
heck and you could make the case for him as being the Player of the Year in
our conference.  
We needed all 31 of them and he delivered.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2014

  

### [Shawndre' Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26721)

### [Chris Mooney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16304)

### [Alonzo Nelson-Ododa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26688)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  
VCU - 71  
RICHMOND - 53  
  
COACH MOONEY: Congratulations to VCU. I thought they obviously took control of
the game early. I thought Briante Weber played great. I thought we hung in
there and fought. We didn't give ourselves a chance by making enough shots,
which we would have needed to do. I thought we defended okay. I thought we
couldn't generate enough on offense. Obviously for us, if Kendall shoots
2‑for‑15, it's going to be really hard for us to win any games at this point.
You know, disappointed in the outcome but proud of our effort.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the fatigue factor, if you felt more tired tonight and
how much that might have affected the Spiders?  
SHAWNDRE' JONES: I don't think it was a fatigue factor. I just think we would
have played better. We could have came out more aggressive. I don't think it
was too much of fatigue.  
  
Q. What can you guys learn about this going forward, such a young team
playing against a good VCU team, they really took it to you tonight; how can
that help you going into next season?  
ALONZO NELSON‑ODODA: I think we can learn how to handle these different
defenses, how VCU plays, aggressive. We need to it's a long off‑season, and we
are all going to be working hard so it doesn't happen next year.  
SHAWNDRE' JONES: Like Alonzo said, I think we use it as a learning‑‑ a
learning opportunity, if we can just get better, take it into next year, move
on, but don't forget it so we'll be prepared for next year.  
  
Q. For both players, I guess for Alonzo first, what does it feel like when
VCU has its game going like it did tonight and you guys are trying to keep
up?  
ALONZO NELSON‑ODODA: It's pretty frustrate being, but like I said, the defense
is pretty overwhelming tonight. Yeah, I mean‑‑  
  
Q. I'll follow ‑up by asking: For such a young team, you guys embraced the
possibility of playing more this year, and continuing the season; Alonzo?   
ALONZO NELSON‑ODODA: What was that?  
  
Q. Because you have such a young team, you want to keep playing this
season?  
ALONZO NELSON‑ODODA: Oh, definitely, yes. Definitely want to keep playing this
season.  
  
Q. There's an opportunity out there ‑‑  
ALONZO NELSON‑ODODA: Yes, and if we get an NIT bid, we do want to play.  
  
Q. Did they do anything specific to Kendall? It looked like they really made
him put on the floor; he wasn't a catch ‑and‑shoot guy tonight.  
COACH MOONEY: Extremely aware of him. I think any time a ball screen or he
made a drive, guys were really helping off their man, giving him a lot of
extra attention, and you know, he forced some things. He has a lot of
responsibility at this particular time, so I can understand, but he forced
some things, and that probably didn't help. Probably didn't help him and
probably didn't help us.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the performance by ShawnDre', pretty impressive for a
freshman in his first A10 tournament.  
COACH MOONEY: Yeah, ShawnDre' is going to be a really good player. He has a
very good sense for the game. He's very poised. I think he obviously needs to
get stronger but he's in college and we'll work very hard on that.  
But I think he's going to be a really good player and thought he had handled
himself well tonight.  
  
Q. If you don't mind, could you just talk about what VCU is like to play
against when they have got everything rolling like they seemed to have
tonight?  
COACH MOONEY: Well, the pressure is really, really good, and then, you know, I
thought the last two games against us, their halfcourt defense has been good.  
And so, you know, it comes back to the fact that they have really good players
and guys who can make shots, guys who can score in a variety of ways. Just a
really good, deep team.  
  
Q. Similar question to what I asked the players. What can you learn in a
game like this?  
COACH MOONEY: Well, that we have to get better. I thought we felt good about
how we played last night, and felt good about our opportunity today.  
But just that we have to play a little bit better, whether it's 0‑0 or whether
it's 6‑0; when we're in the second half and we're trying to make a run, we
just have to do a little bit better. Just understand how hard it is to win at
this level of college basketball.  
  
Q. I presume the Spiders will be interested in participating in NIT if
possible; would the spiders also be interested in playing in the CBI?  
COACH MOONEY: I don't think so. I think we'd like to see how the NIT process
shakes out and hopefully we'll be a team that gets invited.  
  
Q. Why would you not participate in another tournament?  
COACH MOONEY: Just I think right now with our rotation being limited and‑‑ I
think it's probably always a good‑‑ it's probably always good to play, and
especially with our young team. I just think that we have a unique
circumstance with our rotation of players. We're basically playing seven guys
right now. I think that might be, you know, a little bit more taxing than we
want to do.  
  
Q. I know you're not on the selection committee, but do you think this team
is a team that deserves to get an NIT bid?  
COACH MOONEY: Sure, you know, it's hard because I don't see the other‑‑ what
they call, resumés and whatnot. I think we have a pretty good one. I know our
strength of schedule is really good and we have beaten some good teams. I hope
so. I hope so.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

VCU  71  
RICHMOND - 53

  
COACH SMART: Our guys played with very good energy and focus tonight. We
haven't played for six days and our guys have that kind of time to prep for a
game, it's usually terrific in terms of providing them with a sense of purpose
and understanding of what's next. Obviously moving forward, we won't have that
type of prep time but nobody else will, either.  
These two guys played really well tonight. Bri gave us a terrific lift early
on offensively, put the ball in the basket a lot, which we'll take whenever we
can get it. I thought that gave us momentum early and we were able to get
defensive stops to extend the lead. Melvin made some big shots over the course
of the game and he's a big momentum mover for us and excited about what both
of them are going to do moving forward in the tournament.  
  
Q. Can you talk about defending Kendall Anthony and what the plan was
against him? Obviously he had a rough night.  
BRIANTE WEBER: Knowing that he played the day before, knowing we had an upper
hand on him and just making sure he caught the ball close to his baseline and
worked him. That played a big part of he was fatigued and wore him down a
little bit.  
  
Q. Briante, you came out very cool, calm and collected and looked as if you
were here on a business trip. Are you guys thinking of bigger things than just
about beating Richmond?  
BRIANTE WEBER: We definitely came here with the mind‑set to win this thing. We
just came to take it one game at a time. We took care of business tonight.
We're going to watch this game coming up and see who we have to play next and
we're just going to make sure we do what we have to do to get the W.  
  
Q. Melvin, this is your third win over them this year, this is your largest
margin. Normally when a team plays a team a third time with two wins, that can
trend to being a tough game; this looked like the easiest. What's your biggest
reason as to why you guys were able to play the way you were?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: First of all, we came out playing for a 40‑minute battle. We
didn't think it was going to be that way. We played them twice already, and
once our style of play, once their style of play; so we are real familiar with
their offense.  
So for the most part, this was just a players' game, just come out and play. I
mean, Briante sparked us with great defense on Kendall Anthony and that was it
for us.  
  
Q. You were able to start the game with a couple nice shots right near the
hoop and you had the touch working. Can you talk about how getting early
baskets helps your confidence?  
BRIANTE WEBER: I just came out with the mind‑set to attack, because the prior
game, I actually didn't get to play that much. So I actually wanted to play
this game. So I came out with a chip on my shoulder and I was just going to
attack from the jump.  
  
Q. For those not from Richmond, can you talk about what this rivalry means
to you guys, and is there a bigger win for you in the conference than beating
Richmond?  
BRIANTE WEBER: No. Actually it's a crosstown rivalry, probably six miles
apart. Any time you can beat a team three times no matter who it is, that's
big. And for to beat your rival three times, that just gives you more bragging
rights.  
  
Q. Sounds like you had the crowd behind you; what does that mean for both of
you guys out on the floor hearing the support behind you?  
BRIANTE WEBER: Last year we were surprised with us‑‑ this being our first
tournament last year and how many fans came out to support us.  
This year we kind of knew what we were going to get when we came to Brooklyn
and they surprised us again because it was more than what I thought, and just
playing in front of our crowd is just like playing at home.  
MELVIN JOHNSON: Definitely I think they filled one third of the arena, and we
are just fortunate to have a great fan support being able tosell out 50 games
in a row, and they just brought the show on the road for us. That was a big
help; a lot of momentum plays, three balls go in, they get crazy, and that's
demoralizing for other teams knowing it feels like a home game for us.  
  
Q. You told me the other day your role was a defensive specialist, and this
season it's involved into taking what's given to you offensively and
defensively; is this an example of what was given to you offensively
tonight?  
BRIANTE WEBER: Yeah, they were going to back up and they played me as a
driver. I still drove and got to where I needed to get to to the mid‑range
area and I shot‑‑ which I think is a great shot for me in the mid‑range area.  
  
Q. Could you talk about what it feels like not just when you get going and
start hitting shots but when everything gets going for the team and you're
shooting well, you're rebounding well, you're playing defense well?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: I told Briante when he came to the bench that the way he
started the game got me going. I didn't shoot particularly well, but I still
was into it. I felt really good. And I think when the team gets going, you
know, we're really dangerous and we did that with one of our star pieces,
Juvonte, so when we all gel together and really get it going, I think we have
something special.  
  
Q. Much is made, rightly so, of the steals and turnovers, but tonight I
think the rebounds were 50 ‑28 or something and I think you had 20 offensive
rebounds. How do you get that part of your message across to them?   
COACH SMART: Our guys played with great energy tonight. We felt like we could
have an advantage on the glass if that was a point of emphasis for us. Our
guys did a great job following the plan, going hard to the offensive glass. We
were able to force a lot of misses. So you know, that led to some defensive
rebounds, as well.  
Richmond is a very difficult team to press and to turn over. I don't know that
we've ever turned them over 20 times, which is kind of our benchmark that we
try to get to. 14 tonight is just okay, but I did think that we made them
work. We knew that we had an advantage in terms of fatigue, because they
played last night.  
So we thought if we could make them work every time, getting the ball across
halfcourt, that would lead to good things for us.  
  
Q. You spent the six days, I'm sure, preparing for Richmond, but how much
did you spend just on your team and just preparing to come here and play
whoever you had to play?  
COACH SMART: We didn't know who we were going to play. This is such a good
league that as evidenced by some of the games earlier in the tournament, you
don't want to bank on the higher seed winning.  
So we didn't know if it was going to be Richmond or Duquesne. We did a little
bit of prep work with our guys on each of those teams. Fortunately, we just
played Richmond eight days ago, so our guys had a very good familiarity with
them, and it's not like we had to reinvent the wheel in terms of our game
plan.  
  
Q. Twenty ‑five and seven tonight, but is it possible because of the depth
that you guys have and the style that you play, that you might be built better
for the postseason than even the regular season?   
COACH SMART: I hope so. I think we have a chance to make some noise if we can
keep getting better. A lot of it's about matchups. I think depending on who
you see when you get to the postseason and how the matchups work out, last
year in the NCAA Tournament, we ran into a team that was playing as well as
anybody in Michigan in our second game, and it wasn't a great match‑up because
they had multiple NBA‑level guards. So, we'll see.  
I do think that there's a lot of teams in the Atlantic 10, obviously St.
Louis, hopefully ourselves, UMASS, George Washington, Saint Joe's, I think
there's a lot of teams in this league that once they get out of league play
and play against someone else in the postseason, really have a chance to be
dangerous because when you play in a league like this, you get battle tested.
You get challenged. You play against different styles of play, and then now
you're playing someone that has not seen you and I think that can be an
advantage for us the way that we play.  
  
Q. Juvonte got two early fouls and you took him out and he got the third
early foul but you elected to keep him in. Did any of that decision have to do
with how well Cox was playing and you just felt comfortable regardless?  
COACH SMART: Mm‑hmm, the score‑‑ we were up by 15 or so. So I think if it
would have been a tied score, we probably would have taken him out when he got
that third foul.  
You know, guys have to play through foul trouble sometimes, and Juvonte, one
thing I give him credit for is he kept a good attitude throughout. He could
have been on the bench sulking because it wasn't his night and things weren't
going his way.  
But he made it about the team, made it about winning and advancing, and that's
what you need from your best players.  
  
Q. And to that point, Mo played so well, 7 ‑of‑10, two blocks, a couple big
dunks. He's a freshman but has a great physical gift and he's a very large
player. Can you talk to what you saw from him tonight and how he's going to be
used throughout the postseason?   
COACH SMART: He's just scratching the surface. He's a guy that even though he
looks so big and strong, the biggest key with him is him believing more and
more in himself and I think tonight was a big step towards that. Because it's
almost like he looks around and he says, you know what, I can go do this, I
can score on these guys and I can rebound with these guys, I can block shots.  
I thought he was really big in affecting Kendall Anthony around the basket.
Even though he was credited for two blocks, I think he effected a lot more
shots than that. Just the tip of the iceberg for him. We just have to keep
instilling confidence in him.  
  
Q. Getting everybody involved, communicating, all of the things that you
want a point guard to do, but can you talk about what it means when Bri is
scoring like that?  
COACH SMART: Well,y with haven't been confused with the Showtime Lakers in
terms of the number of points we put on the board, so we'll take points any
time we can get them.  
What happened early in the game is Briante was getting deep into the lane, and
then he was showing the ball and they were kind of jumping out of the way or
jumping for the ball. So he turned and pivoted and had wide open shots at four
feet, so he took them and made them.  
And then sometimes when you see the ball go in for yourself, then you start‑‑
your confidence starts to build and then he started making pull‑up jumpers, he
made a three‑point shot on a great pass and from there he got the ball going.  
  
Q. JeQuan was under the basket with the big guys, he's so tough for a little
guy, can you talk about how he's able to go at them?  
COACH SMART: Yeah, he's going to be as good as he sets his mind on being in
terms of mental toughness. He's a freshman; he's just learning. But he's very
quick and explosive. He can drive. He's typically a very, very good free throw
shooter. So we like when he drives in there and makes plays for himself and
his teammates.  
  
Q. What's it been like playing in Brooklyn? What do you think it means for
the A10 that the ACC will be moving to this building to play their conference
tournament in 2017 and 2018?  
COACH SMART: Well, your first question, we love playing here. This is our
fifth game in the Barclays Center. We played three times here in last year's
tournament. We played here just after the holidays, I guess Boston College,
our guys had a good experience there.  
We are excited to be back here. It's as good a venue as there is in any level
of basketball. I think the Atlantic 10 does a terrific job of putting on a
high‑level tournament that I think can go toe‑to‑toe with anybody.  
As was mentioned earlier, our fans do a great job of making it up here. We
appreciate our fans so much; I want to make that point to all the students,
all the fans, all the hard core VCU people that made it up here, it really
means a lot, and it's something that we don't take for granted. We really
appreciate you.  
In terms of the ACC I don't even‑‑ I didn't even know that. Somebody mentioned
it to me earlier today. I don't read the news at this time of the year or
really pay attention to that. You know, I'm sure the Atlantic 10 will continue
to put on a great tournament and I'm not really focused on that because I
think that's years away.  
  
Q. I know you don't read the newsexcept for the Richmond Times Dispatch ‑‑  
COACH SMART: That's actually true‑‑ that's actually true. Usually when I get
up on my iPad, I search on the Richmond Times Dispatch. In fact, I've been
kicked off there a couple times for going on there too much (laughter).  
  
Q. Oh, we'll see if we can't get you a discount because I know that you need
it (laughter). It is a time of year when you're concerned about matchups,
particularly past this tournament, but how important is it for you and your
team to always focus on playing their game and not worrying so much about,
we've got to do this, we've got to do that, and just focusing on, we have to
do what we need to do?  
COACH SMART: That's a great point. I think it's easy when you're playing very
good teams to say, wow, we have to really adjust to this guy or we have to
account for that guy.  
But we still have to do‑‑ be true to ourselves. We still have to do what we
do. I think for our team, when we have gotten away from how we play and who we
are, we have really gotten in trouble and we have not been good.  
We're only at our best when we're the aggressors, so we have to be the more
aggressive team. I thought we were that tonight. We're going to need to be
that tomorrow, regardless of who the opponent is, and I think that gives us a
great chance to win.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

ST. BONAVENTURE  71  
SAINT LOUIS - 68

  
COACH SCHMIDT: Yeah, I don't think I can overemphasize by saying it was a
great ballgame. Give Saint Louis a lot of credit. It was just a great ballgame
back and forth.  
But I thought our guys, we got down by ten, by 12 or whatever it was, and I
thought Youssou's length of the course, layup that we practice every day
(laughter), I think gave us a little bit of momentum, a little bit of hope
going into halftime because we didn't play well ‑‑ I think nervous, whatever
it was, we didn't play well in the first half, and we went in, we had a
glimmer of hope because of what Youssou did.  
And then the second half, the first five minutes of the second half was
critical. I told the team it was either going to go from ten to 20 or we were
going to cut into it and make it a ballgame and our guys really responded. I
thought our 1‑3‑1 zone in the second half was really effective, kept Jett out
of the paint, Dion Wright was tremendous on top of it.  
And then we made plays. We've had a hard time making plays throughout the
year, getting really close and not finishing and the last two nights, last two
days. And then at the end of the game, Jordan's big shot, the biggest shot of
the year, and probably one of the biggest shots in Bonaventure history.  
So it was a great victory. We showed some character. We fought and we did it
together and really proud of our team and the effort that they gave.  
  
Q. Take us through, first of all, when the ball left your hand, did you know
it was going in and did you have one of those, did you not hear anything, see
anything?  
JORDAN GATHERS: Definitely when I ‑‑ when Charlon passed me the ball, great
pass by our senior veteran and captain, and when I let it go, yeah, I knew it
was going in. I've been in the gym working hard and it's finally paid off.  
  
Q. Have you ever hit a game ‑winning shot before?   
JORDAN GATHERS: No, this is my first in my career.  
  
Q. And was the play designed, did the plan unfold exactly as you planned it,
where you were on the floor, was it extremely fluid or did something break
down where you ended up with the ball?  
JORDAN GATHERS: No, we chanted Charlon to have the ball on his hands to come
off and create and find whatever he needed to find off the high ball screen
and I circled up and I was open for the three point shot.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about, what it's like to play alongside Matt, and what
that's like, and the second half, did you feel there was a key to get going?  
JORDAN GATHERS: We've been playing together this whole season. These guys are
my brothers. I love them. I wouldn't want to play with any other two guards.
They are great passers and great decision making and just great leaders out
there, so love playing with them.  
  
Q. Players talk about being in the zone. In that second half when those 3
‑pointers were going down, did you feel like you were in the zone and if so
what was that feeling like?   
MATTHEW WRIGHT: I'm not going to lie, I was a little numb in the second half.
I kept telling the team to relax, the game isn't done yet, so a lot of
basketball left. I was ready, when Dwyane Evans hit that three, I told them,
the game isn't done yet.  
But you know, they played‑‑ give credit to Saint Louis, they played amazing
defense in the first half, they really made it hard on me to even get an open
shot. But you know, once we broke the initial defender, Charlon did a great
job of finding me in transition, especially in transition; and just to see the
ball go to the rim as a shooter, it gives you a lot of confidence.  
  
Q. Obviously the second half of this game is probably going to be the story
that lives on, the game ‑winning shot, but talk about Charlon's performance in
the first half.   
MATTHEW WRIGHT: Yeah, he's the heart and soul of our team, and he's the guy
who‑‑ he's the spearhead of our offense. He's the guy who gives us the pep
talk before the game.  
You know, when he goes‑‑ like wherever he goes, we go. And Charlon, when
things weren't working in the first half, he had, I don't know, 14 points to
keep us afloat, basically single‑handedly put his team on his shoulders the
first half.  
Everyone is going to remember Jordan's shot but people are not going to
remember Charlon's pass on that one and the decision making and his defense on
Jett who is the Player of the Year, so you have to give a lot of credit;
Charlon should be up here, too, with us.  
  
Q. Take me through the play when Evans hit the play to tie the game; what
goes through your mind?  
JORDAN GATHERS: We knew we had the last shot, and trying to put ourselves in a
good situation with the last seconds on the clock when I knew Charlon was
going to come off and make the right play. You don't think a lot about it. You
just go out there and try to make a play.  
  
Q. Matthew, when you guys did go to that 1 ‑3‑1, particularly when you
started extending it out a little bit further, why was that so effective
against Saint Louis?   
MATTHEW WRIGHT: In our first matchup we played 1‑3‑1 and it was kind of the
first time we implemented that defense and we noticed that in Saint Louis, we
forced maybe the first seven possessions, maybe five turnovers. So for some
reason it just worked on them better than any other team that we have put it
on.  
You know, their weaknesses is outside shooting, so I felt like with Dion,
having a 6‑8 forward at the top of the press, it really makes it hard for the
guards to really maneuver and get straight line passes. That's what hurts our
zone, so we throw a lot of passes and we are able to get there in time and it
really worked the second half, for some reason, it really works well on them.  
  
Q. Right now they are showing your shot on ESPN1, ESPN2, etc., but this is
March Madness, right. Have you dreamed of this moment? Have you ever
fantasized ‑‑  
JORDAN GATHERS: I mean, it's every player's dream to hit that big‑time shot or
to make that play or have a big game. It's really a blessing and I give God
all the glory for that shot I made tonight.  
  
Q. In the second half offensively for you as a team, to be able to shoot 59
percent and put up 43 points on a defense that good, how were you able to do
that?  
MATTHEW WRIGHT: Like I said, Charlon, it all starts with him. And Coach is
right, Youssou's full‑court layup gave us momentum going into the second half,
but you know, Youssou, as well, played huge down the stretch. And you know,
more or less, we were able to get stops and that keyed our transition. It's
hard to guard teams in transition, especially teams like us, we thrive in
transition. But you know, Charlon definitely instigated the second‑half
attack.  
  
Q. When you talk about the zone defense, you were able to mix it up.  
COACH SCHMIDT: We just thought that they run such good halfcourt offense, they
execute tremendously; they get the ball swung from side‑to‑side and it's
really difficult to guard them.  
I thought in the first half, we guarded them, for like 25 seconds, and then we
would break down and they would get a layup or an open three.  
So we felt going into the game, you try to change defense, keep them off
balance a little bit. They are not a great three‑point shooting team
stat‑wise, so we thought our zones could be effective against them. But you
never know going into‑‑ until the game starts and then you see and make
adjustments, but I thought our guys, the 1‑3‑1 was much more effective than a
1‑1‑3\.  
We were active, kept them out of the paint for the most part. And that's what,
from a defensive standpoint, that's‑‑ when the game end, it helped us
offensively, we got some steals and we got some easy baskets and that's how
you shoot 59 percent in the second half.  
You can't ‑‑‑ against Saint Louis, you can't attack them; their set halfcourt
defense, it's just too good. They do a tremendous job of ball screen defense
and knocking the big guys off the post. You need to get some stuff in
transition, and we got 23 points off of turnovers, and that was critical.  
  
Q. I think most people remember, two years ago, you authored a magical run
in this tournament. Are you trying to block out thinking about doing that
again? Are you trying to press the same buttons that made that happen last
time?  
COACH SCHMIDT: No, I think we have some guys on our team that were a part of
that, and I think that helps, that experience. You know, experience is
everything. Charlon and Matt, Jordan, Youssou were a part of that, and you
know, they have seen it, they have experienced it, and that's something that
we talk about when we came into the tournament.  
You know, two years ago, we lost our last game against La Salle and so we came
in, we didn't have, quote, momentum. And we made some momentum as we went
through the tournament and it's the same thing here.  
And you know, who knows what's going to happen tomorrow. But we've got some
momentum. We're playing better. We're playing with some confidence and we're
finishing games. You know, to beat a team as talented as Saint Louis can only
give you that confidence that you need to be‑‑ to play well.  
  
Q. You talked about Dion at the top of the 1 ‑3‑1 and his impact, and you
also saw his depth at grabbing offensive rebounds; why is he so adept at being
such a factor on the offensive glass, and talk about his impact on the
defense.   
COACH SCHMIDT: Yeah, we call him "the worm"; he's slithering all the time.
He's got that crazy‑looking body. But he's really active, and he's just got‑‑
from an offensive standpoint, only had one offensive rebound today, but he's
just got a knack. You can't teach that; you've either got it or you don't, and
he has it.  
He's got really good instincts. He's got really good length, and that helps on
the top of a 1‑3‑1\. You can't play a short guy at the top. As Matthew was
saying, if you allow direct passes, you're in trouble. And I thought Dion did
a tremendous job up top making him throw high passes, loop passes, so we could
get to the shooters.  
  
Q. How are able to limit some of Saint Louis's big men down low, like
Manning; they only scored a combined ten today?  
COACH SCHMIDT: Yeah, I think the 1‑3‑1 was effective. I thought the first half
they hurt us. We played much more man‑to‑man than we did in the second half,
but they hurt us inside. I'm not sure what it was, I think they had‑‑ they
were plus‑ten in the paint in the first half and it was even for the game.  
So THE 1‑3‑1, it was really from a defensive standpoint, it's what won the
game for us.  
  
Q. You mentioned yesterday, the last game against Saint Louis, 66 ‑60, you
said you made it a close game; how did that help your confidence?   
COACH SCHMIDT: I think our guys knew that we had a chance; that we were not
playing a team that when we went to their place, even though it was two months
ago, that they beat us badly. We had the lead, I think it was eight, nine, ten
minutes left in the game and we got a one‑point lead.  
So I think our guys understood if they continued to play well ‑‑ we played
better, because I didn't think we played that well out there. If we played
better, we'd have a shot. It's a neutral court and not at their home place.  
So we went in with a lot of confidence thinking that we can give them a game.
You know, winning, who knows, but we knew we would give them a game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the level of unselfishness of Kloof and how the whole
team feeds off it?  
COACH SCHMIDT: Yeah, he was named captain, you know, as a junior. You've got a
foreign kid that has not been in the States butsix months or whatever; and for
our guys to name him captain speaks volumes and tells you everything you need
to know.  
Unselfish; he played tremendous today. He had a tough year last year but he's
really bounced back and he's the leader of our team, and he has the ball in
his hands and like we're going to talk about Jordan's shot, and it was a great
shot, but if it wasn't for Charlon delivering the ball, that shot would never
have presented itself.  
  
Q. Also to that point, he had big point totals in the first half.  
COACH SCHMIDT: Yeah, exactly. They were playing really aggressive, denying
man‑to‑man, and we couldn't really get the ball to the wing and we really had
to do a lot of stuff off the dribble. We had two assists at halftime, which is
a season low. But I thought Charlon really, he was aggressive and we needed
him to be.  
When they are out denying the wings, you have to have somebody that can take
guys off the bounce and that's what Charlon did in the first half and he came
our passer in the second half‑‑ but really proud of his effort and what he
brings to our team, not just from a basketball standpoint, either. He's a
great kid and a tremendous leader.  
  
Q. What's it like to have the A10 tournament in Brooklyn ‑‑ (Inaudible)‑‑
what do you think that might mean for the conference as well?   
COACH SCHMIDT: Hopefully we stay here. It's a great venue. It's the capital of
the world. It's where basketball‑‑ basketball here is everything. Hopefully we
can stay here for the next 20 years. It's a great environment. You saw what it
is, a noontime game, having that type of environment speaks volumes about this
league and how good it is.  
  
Q. Matt Wright obviously didn't make it all 18, but if you can give him his
due for the development that he's made over the last couple years and talk
about where he came from to where he is now and what he's meant for this team
this year.  
COACH SCHMIDT: Matthew Wright didn't have a scholarship offer from any school.
We got Matthew Wright in June, might have even been early July, and he had
nothing. I don't think anybody knew Matthew Wright. I certainly didn't. For
him to come from not having one DivisionI scholarship and probably played in
some small school in Canada to what he is now, just speaks to his work ethic.  
He's just been tremendous. His skill level has improved, his strength. You saw
him as a freshman, he was a little skinny‑‑ he looked like he was 12 years
old, and now he's a man and he has a chance to play for money after he
graduates.

### [Halil Kanacevic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25004)

### [Phil Martelli](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16280)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

ST. JOSEPHS - 70  
DAYTON - 67

  
COACH MARTELLI: We didn't play great. We competed our backsides off. The two
possessions that Halil had, he was quick to tell me I took away a dunk from
Ron Roberts on a time‑out, but he fought and got those two big loose balls.  
And I thought the game would be a 50/50 game to be honest with you. And then
I'll just‑‑ it doesn't matter what a coach has to say at this time of the
year. But you all know what you just saw. You saw two high‑level teams, and if
justice is to be served for those kids and for Archie and for that wonderful
fan base, they will get their name called on Sunday.  
  
Q. Langston, can you just talk us through that last shot and what was your
mind ‑set coming down the floor?   
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: Just trying to figure out a way to help this team win, and
coach had drew up a play before that for me to come off a double screen and it
didn't work out.  
But the next play, I said, let me put it in my hands and this team, they trust
me with the ball at the end of the game, and I just tried to make a play. I
made a step‑back and just got enough room to shoot it and that's all I need to
shoot the ball, and it went in.  
  
Q. Langston, do you think you pushed off? Did you extend your left hand and
get an advantage?  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: No, I don't think so. I think the whole night they were
letting us play, and everybody was just trying to be physical and try to make
plays, and that's what happened on the last play.  
  
Q. They seemed to limit your opportunities in the second half. Is that
accurate, and can you talk about what the rest of your team did?  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: No, not really. I was just trying to help Halil and Ron get
going, because the first half I was just trying to keep us in the game. The
second half, I knew that they were going to try to deny me the ball and try to
do different things to make me pass the ball and get the ball out of my hands.  
But the second half, I was just trying to get the ball inside, because that's
our balance, we need to go inside and then out. That's what I was trying to do
the second half.  
  
Q. You did not have any fouls at halftime; how big was that to play freely
and not pick up any fouls?  
HALIL KANACEVIC: I'm playing the same way the whole year. I've been playing
the same defense. It's how they are calling the game. I'm not going to switch
how I play and I do a good job on the defensive end. So I'm playing the same
way.  
I was conscious of the coaches saying, keep doing what you're doing, but I
have no hold on what the officials are going to call and what they are not
going to call so I'm just going to keep playing the same way.  
  
Q. Can you explain what's going through your head in that four ‑minute
stretch when you're sitting with four fouls and maybe talk about what happened
in front of you that you went down with a four‑point lead and came back, you
guys were up six and seemed like the team really forged together.   
HALIL KANACEVIC: We've been there before. We have other two seniors, Ron and
Langston, so I'm not worried, they know how to handle it. I've been in foul
trouble; he's been in foul trouble; Ron's been in foul rubble. We are a
veteran team, we have a little youth on our team but we have are a veteran‑led
team. So one person getting in foul trouble shouldn't affect it as much. You
can't use that as an excuse.  
Everybody did a great job just picking me up because I got in foul trouble. It
was just a team effort. So not really worried about it. Am I angry? Yeah, I
don't want to be in foul trouble, but I'm not worried. These guys know how to
handle it.  
  
Q. Was there any point that you felt that either you guys or they might be
pressing some?  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: I don't think so. Everybody was just playing loose. I mean,
both these teams wanted to win tonight, and I think both teams gave it all. It
went down to the end, so I know everybody left it out there and it was a great
game.  
  
Q. You guys had a rough week last week and you had a four ‑day layoff. Have
you been on pins and needles knowing that another loss might knock you the
wrong way off the bubble?   
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: No, not really. This team, we've been through adversity all
season really. I mean, we were 4‑4 and we made a big push to try to make this
run into the Tournament. We knew if we just took it one game at a time in each
of these games that we played‑‑ and that's what we've done. I can't be more
proud of these guys because we left it all out there and it was a great game
for us.  
  
Q. Before you played, St. Bonaventure knocked off Saint Louis. Do you think
they did you guys a favor and made your path a little easier tomorrow?  
HALIL KANACEVIC: Not at all. The A10 is a tough conference. Every team is
tough. You see every game this year, probably every team is tough, from the
bottom of the league to top of the league; UMASS, Rhode Island team, tough
last night; St. Bonaventure, Saint Louis, every game you play, you've just got
to bring it. Doesn't make a difference. Are they different teams? Yes. Is
Saint Louis a great team? Yes. St. Bonaventure is not no doormat, you know,
they are a really good team.  
So, you know, you're worried about every team. You take every game exactly how
you approach it. We approach St. Bonaventure how we approach Saint Louis. It
doesn't matter. We worry about ourselves first and then we've got to worry
about them. Everything is really good. So at this point just got to play,
you've just got to play your hearts out and just play hard.  
  
Q. I believe you beat Dayton with a late shot earlier this season. Was there
any sense of déjà vu? And what happened to your mouth?  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: I guess so. Like I said earlier, this team, they trust a
lot in me to have the ball at the end of the game, especially Coach. And I
just caught an elbow at the end of the game and brushed my lip, so that's
pretty much it.  
COACH MARTELLI: So I just ask something real quick? Markus asked the question,
what does Halil do when he sits over there, and unfortunately over the last
five or six games, he's had a lot of time over with us with foul trouble.  
He's one of the best bench players that I've ever had. If you watch him like
if you could take your eyes off the action and put a camera just on him, he's
talking every play, he's encouraging on every play. He's offering suggestions.
He's a phenomenal‑‑ he's a really high basketball IQ; rough around the benches
but he has a really wonderful basketball IQ and he is a tremendous, tremendous
teammate.  
This is a team full of great teammates. He might be at the top of the list,
though, as a teammate.  
  
Q. After you guys got that rebound, you had the two ‑point lead and they
took a shot that was a second left. You were kind of I guess celebrating, you
let out like a whoop and everything over there. Was that kind of‑‑ sort of an
NCAA sigh of relief or something like that? Did you feel the frustration? What
was that about?   
COACH MARTELLI: I was just excited for my players because that was‑‑ that
literally was a fistfight, and it was a fistfight for 40 minutes. I asked them
to fight for 40 minutes, and they gave me everything that they had.  
Because of the character of these guys, I just want to keep coaching them. I
want to keep being with them. You know, the chance‑‑ I knew that that game was
a chance to play tomorrow, and these next 24 hours or whatever it will be, 20
hours, will be a blur, but it will be an enjoyable blur.  
Just for the players; it's a wonderful, wonderful group, and all success is
due to them.  
  
Q. Every coach will say that every conference tournament game is hard; do
you breathe a sigh of relief when Saint Louis went down? Did that affect you
guys at all?  
COACH MARTELLI: (Pausing). Nope. (Laughter) no.  
I'm going to say this with all due respect. For two years, Saint Louis has
been the best in this league and there's part of me that wants to measure
ourselves against the best. And for 40 minutes today, St. Bonaventure was the
best, so we're anxious to do that tomorrow.  
  
Q. You had to take Halil out for a four ‑minute stretch in a crucial part of
your game; can you address how your team functioned without him and I don't
know how happy or relieved you were that they were actually able to grow the
lead?   
COACH MARTELLI: Well, what we did was we went to our playbook, really, and
tried to think of ways, really, that we could get the ball into Langston's
hands and then on swings of the ball to get to DeAndre' to go to the basket.  
We know what our limitations are and we know who we can lean on, and I was
really pleased at the other end because I thought we defended fiercely without
Halil, and there were times in this game where we didn't defend fiercely. We
kind of played on our heels a little bit. So I was pleased with the defensive
performance when Halil was out of the game.  
  
Q. Galloway has had those games before, but not for those stakes; can you
put into your perspective what you saw had from him today?  
COACH MARTELLI: I thought that that would be the case, and I'm not like a
fortune teller or anything. But when I looked at the last game and we scored
79 points, he had seven.  
When I speak to these guys about being seniors and having your moment in time,
he's really drilled in on me. He's like‑‑ he's such a kid that wants to
please, and I thought right in the beginning of the game, I liked the idea
that he was hunting, and I could feel it; and there was no hesitation on where
we were going to go.  
And I just watch for occasions where he gets a little bit tired. And I think
that in the second half, he had his cleanest look of the night in the left
corner away from our bench on an out‑of‑bounds play ‑‑ or Chris penetrated and
hit him and he shot an air ball.  
Last year Langston would have hung his head and thought, I disappointed
everybody. Now, there's a fighter in there, and again, he has nothing‑‑ I have
nothing to do with him.  
He's a product of how he was raised, and you want good things for good people,
and he's certainly brought it. And really, a lot of leaning on them tonight to
get them back to square one will be on Halil and Langston to make sure that
we're ready to play tomorrow at 1:30.  
  
Q. Just take us through what you saw in the last offensive play.  
COACH MARTELLI: We actually wanted to run Langston off a triple screen. He
went too early and Chris was starting too high. We were going to run a triple
screen for Langston and then a double ball screen for Langston, and they
stopped it and Chris was smart enough‑‑ Langston stopped his momentum and
caught the ball and then we flattened out.  
I really wanted Ron to get up there and set a vertical ball screen. He didn't
get there, kind of froze, everybody froze. And then Langston, the move that he
made was really a pro prove. That's a move that the pros teach, you drive the
ball into the guy's chest and then you do a step back. Kind of reminiscent of
ten years ago; I wish that ball had gone in ten years ago on that same move.  
  
Q. You spoke very eloquently about Dayton deserving. You may not want to
address this, but do you deserve it?  
COACH MARTELLI: Do we deserve it?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
COACH MARTELLI: Well, here's my point. Coaches campaigning or coaches thinking
in any way, shape or form that campaigning to Joe Lunardi has anything to do
with it, it's numbers, pure and simple. We'll now be under 40 RPI. We have 11,
I think, road wins, rode or neutral. We played in this league and we're in the
semi finals in this league. Enough said. Enough said.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

ST. BONAVENTURE  71  
SAINT LOUIS - 68

  
COACH CREWS: Well, I thought that the first half we played pretty well. I
thought we ran well. We were sharp offensively. We did some good things
defensively. We committed too many fouls in the first I think nine minutes,
got them to bonus, but the last 11 minutes, we were really sound defensively.  
I thought a little of a negative in the first half, though, was we kind of had
it going our way and we took really quick shots when we were getting good
results by just staying with the offense.  
And then obviously we weren't very good the second half. When you give up 43
points like we did, you're not going to‑‑ we're not going to win from that
standpoint.  
But St. Bonnies did a great job. They stayed with it. Their guards were
really, really good, both distributing the ball, hitting the open threes,
finding the right guys and putting pressure on us, and pushing the ball to the
floor when we turned the ball over. We had a few too many turnovers in
situations.  
Their zone bothered us in terms of being in rhythm. We just didn't get guys in
the right spots in a consistent way. So really don't know why, but we were
having problems with that. So here we are.  
  
Q. Can you all talk about the difficulty that you did have dealing with the
1 ‑3‑1, particularly when they started extending it out a little bit?   
MIKE McCALL: I didn't think they were aggressive with it. I thought it was
just sticking‑‑ just holding the ball and not attacking it. They was trying to
turn us over and stuff like that, and I just probably should be more
aggressive with it but wasn't.  
DWAYNE EVANS: Yeah, I agree, they weren't aggressive, especially when they
first got into it, we didn't really show that we could make plays against it
and that ended up being the story of the second half.  
  
Q. Mike, when you experience a one ‑and‑done loss like this, does it make
you appreciate the great run that you guys had here a little bit more?   
MIKE McCALL: I guess you could say that. I mean, last year, we made a great
run in this tournament. I mean, everybody knows that, but I mean, St. Bonnies,
like Coach said, they are a good team. I mean, we respected them since day
one, and I mean, they made some big plays down the stretch, and the second
half we didn't play that well. So just got to move on.  
  
Q. Dwyane, on the last possession for you guys, you hit the three pointer.
When you got the pass, that was a little bit awry; do you have in mind
immediately to shoot the three or you just went through a process of what you
want to do and then you just presented yourself with shooting the shot?  
DWAYNE EVANS: Yeah, it was a process. I turned to see what was open and I
think I had thebig guy ‑‑ (indiscernible) ‑‑ so I shot it.  
  
Q. I know you don't like losing, but is there any sort of good news/bad
news, where you now have six or seven days before you play your next game so
you do get to rest?  
MIKE McCALL: Yeah, it's tough losing the first one, especially in the
tournament. But like I said, we have to get back in the gym, clean up some
things and get ready for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Mike, could you take us through that final possession, St. Bonaventure's
final possession and what you wanted to do defensively against that?  
MIKE McCALL: One of our ball screens ‑‑ we knew a ball screen was coming,
their zone action, so it was basically get over that and just try to stop them
from scoring. But player came up, made a good play, and had a wide open look
and took it and it fell.  
  
Q. The first half you had a 7 ‑0 run and you had a really good game today
scoring 21 points. How do you carry your success here forward going into the
NCAA Tournament?   
MIKE McCALL: I thought we played good defense in the first half. We had, like,
made the run. I mean, that's the type of team we play ‑‑ (indiscernible) ‑‑ on
defense. So just got to get back in the gym, try to get ready for the
tournament.  
  
Q. You've lost four of the last five games now. What's been the difference
between the great start and the last few games and what do you think you need
to work on in the next six days to get ready for the tournament?  
MIKE McCALL: Rebounding a little bit more. Defending, just little things like
loose balls. Like I said, rebounding, ball screen defense, things like that,
in order to be successful.  
  
Q. You competed today against Kloof, their senior captain, especially in the
first half, he was so crucial, what was your experience playing against him
today?  
DWAYNE EVANS: I thought he was pretty aggressive throughout the whole game. He
was finding players to get to the rim when he needed to. He had a couple big
plays throughout the game, he was being a leader and that's what you have to
do.  
  
Q. The feeling on the last possession, after you guys tie it up, what's the
feeling there those last 20 seconds?  
DWAYNE EVANS: We thought we were going to win. We thought we were going to
win‑‑ with the mind‑set of getting a stop. We tried to ball screen the last
one. So, I mean, things didn't go our way.  
  
Q. On St. Bonaventure's final possession, there was a ball screen and
Charlon looked like he got doubled and was ‑‑ outside of Jordan making the
shot, was there anything else you could have done on that possession‑‑  
COACH CREWS: Well, he put pressure on us. Kloof drove the ball and we rotated,
but then 35, he set the screen for that kid. And I mean, he's a big screen,
and we didn't quite get to it.  
Mark did a great job. Those are all little wrinkles that he does all the time
with situations, and they are really well set up and they are really
challenging from a defensive standpoint.  
  
Q. I know we talked about this a couple days ago, how important it was for
you all, you wanted to win this tournament back ‑to‑back, but is there a
benefit now to having six or seven days off and resting these guys?   
COACH CREWS: Well, I hope so, since we got beat. That was not the plan and
everything. I think it also is a great reflection of what these guys have
done.  
There's only four championships in the last two years. I mean, the regular
season, the tournament here, regular season, and now, and they won three in a
row. They won three in a row. I mean, that doesn't happen. That does not
happen very often, and so it's tough.  
I mean, I've said it all the time, I don't know if anyone ever believes me or
anything; our league is really, really good and you've got to really play well
and you've got to be fortunate and we didn't play well enough today, and
that's because Bonnies outplayed us. They outplayed us.  
But hopefully it is‑‑ I don't know if it's a benefit or not. I guess if you
win a couple games or a first game, you can say it is. If you lose, you can
say, well, you got rusty. I mean, we can do all that all we want. We just need
to get better this week and try to see what happens.  
  
Q. Obviously a lot of great experiences here last year. What do you think
after this report ‑‑  
COACH CREWS: Say that again‑‑  
  
Q. The ACC might be coming to play in Barclays in 2017 for the tournament
and the A10 would have to go. What do you think of that and what it might mean
to the conference.  
COACH CREWS: I have no clue. I don't care. I have no clue. I mean, we really
love playing in New York. I think it's been great. Wow, 2017‑‑ wow‑‑ I don't
know. You're more futuristic than I am.  
  
Q. Their 1 ‑3‑1 was the most difficult aspect of the length of the kid‑‑  
COACH CREWS: We couldn't get our guys in the right positions most of the time
for some reason, I don't know what the heck was going on. But we weren't very
aggressive at the right points. We got out of what we were doing a little bit.  
But they are good. They are long, they are competitive, and they stretch you
out. A lot of times when people stretch you out, you quit looking inside. You
just look kind of outside the house instead of inside the house, and I thought
at times that's what we did.  
  
Q. Being that you are one of the top teams in the conference, or one of the
two top teams ‑‑  
COACH CREWS: We didn't win the league‑‑ so there's only one that one the
league ‑‑  
  
Q. What I'm saying is on a national level as far as, do you feel your team
gets everybody's best shots?  
COACH CREWS: Yeah, but I think the league is like that. I don't see the St.
Bonaventure ‑ George Mason game, or the VCU ‑ Rhode Island game, I don't study
all that.  
But this league is a very competitive league. You have competitive kids that
do a great job. It's a fun league. I'm well equipped because when I go home,
my wife will look at me and goes, "Do you need to"‑‑ "do I need to call your
daughter or your son?" My daughter is a therapist and my son is a pastor; so I
don't know if I need counseling or I need prayer, so I take my pick; I'm well
equipped. (Laughter).  
  
Q. It's always tough to go out early in the tournament like this but on a
personal level, you were able to see some family, took the team to West Point.
Is there anything about those kind of personal things about this trip soften
the blow?  
COACH CREWS: We try to make trips any time that we have a chance and have a
little time. We are very fortunate because we are on spring break this week
during this tournament the last couple years. So we always try to get the kids
a good experience of fun or educational things and things that will help them
just see the big picture more and more.  
So being able to do that, and then obviously it's a special treat for me
because I've had both of my kids living in Brooklyn now, I have one living in
Brooklyn, and a grand baby and a daughter‑in‑law. It's good for me. It's a lot
better than the tournament being in Charlotte.  
  
Q. Are there trends in the four losses that have been consistent or have you
concerned?  
COACH CREWS: The game‑‑ we just take one game‑‑ not really. I think there's
always‑‑ I mean, you can get a laundry list. When we won 19 in a row, there's
still a laundry list of stuff that you to get better at. You can never get
better at all of them. You just chip away and try to get better.  
I'm not trying to blow off your question but I'm not smart enough to figure it
out, either. We pick out our spots and try to clean it up and keep working on
the fundamentals and then move forward. It's a pretty simple formula. I'm not
saying it's a great formula and I'm not saying it's the best formula, but that
is our formula.  
  
Q. We have talked about the theory of late ‑game situations; any thoughts of
fouling, tie game, 20 seconds?   
COACH CREWS: It did cross my mind but not for long. Not for long.  
  
Q. Because ‑‑ what swung it the other way?   
COACH CREWS: I think we get a stop, I think we can win in overtime, something
might have happened before that. But I thought they would kind of spread it
out and just put you in a position where they are not a ball screen, because
we get aggressive with our ball screen defense the four or five minutes and
knocked some things loose for us. So they did a good job of getting away from
that that last play.  
  
Q. This is the third consecutive year you'll be in the NCAA Tournament. Do
you feel you're ready to make a good run?  
COACH CREWS: Well, I think you're not going to face any bad teams in the NCAA
and I think that's what makes the NCAA an unbelievable spectacle in this
country. I mean, people are addicted to the NCAA Tournament. It's fun, because
it's the unknown. I mean, you don't know what's going to happen, and us
coaches don't know, either. We don't.  
But you know what, kids have dreams, that's why this is a special‑‑ it's kind
of like, what's that TV show, when they sing American Idol. You have all this
talent and kids can get their dreams. Same thing as American Idol almost. Kids
are living their dream, working their dream; and you have to be good and
you've got to get lucky. You've got to be good and you've got to get lucky.
Hopefully we are good enough, and hopefully ‑‑ I know we are pretty darned
good. But we have to play good and get lucky. We weren't good enough today and
that was the bottom line.

### [Mike Lonergan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20780)

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

GEORGE WASHINGTON  85  
UMASS - 77

  
COACH LONERGAN: That was a nice win for us, great turnout, GW fans, we really
wanted to keep them here for at least another day. Our guys played really hard
and got a nice lead at halftime and thought we rebounded real well the second
half, missed some free throws and had some bad turnovers.  
But give Coach Kellogg and his group credit. They kept in that game. We were
up 13, 15, 17, and they wouldn't go away. So very happy to get this win.  
  
Q. Your early threes, how much confidence did that give you and how much do
you think that helped the team down the stretch, and you made a couple more
after.  
NEMANJA MIKIC: I think lately, the last couple games‑‑ (indiscernible) ‑‑
getting shots and I've been pretty muchgot a lot of open shots lately. They
just didn't go in the last couple games and when Coach, teammates believe in
you, they passed me the ball when I was open and they dropped down tonight.  
  
Q. Where this program has been, and you, your thoughts on winning the game
‑‑ this is the first step.   
ISAIAH ARMWOOD: Yeah, it's a good feeling. It's a good feeling. We've got six
players in double figures scoring. We score a couple times and they came back
and cut it down to maybe eight, so we wanted to keep stretching that lead. So
it's definitely a good feeling to move on to the next round?  
  
Q. You kept their bigs to ten total points; talk about the battles inside
with the bigs.  
ISAIAH ARMWOOD: It's definitely a battle, Cady Lalanne is a big body and long
and athletic. So you have me and Kevin in there just barreling and Kevin did a
good job ‑‑ he got two put backs so that was big for us.  
  
Q. This is your last A10 tournament, how does it feel to have this big game
at this time?  
NEMANJA MIKIC: It's terrific. This whole season has been great, 24th win. We
are looking forward to the game tomorrow against VCU. We won one, we lost one,
feel like we ‑‑ indiscernible ‑‑ so it's exciting.  
  
Q. It was just touched on but facing VCU, can you talk about facing them and
trying to get to the finals tomorrow?  
ISAIAH ARMWOOD: It's definitely a difficult challenge but they beat us on our
home court and it's a neutral site now. So we have to be able to handle that
pressure and stay out of foul trouble, I think we'll be all right.  
  
Q. You guys talked about getting another shot at Mass after last year, must
be that much more special?  
ISAIAH ARMWOOD: Yeah, that was the end of our season and that wasn't a fun
thing at all. No matter how rough our season was last year, we didn't want
toend the season short. And they beat us early in the season on our home
court; the only loss we had on our home court this year, so getting them back
here was definitely a good thing.  
  
Q. You guys split the season series, each defended home court well, both
teams travel well, what's it going to take for you guys to beat VCU
tomorrow?  
COACH LONERGAN: Well, we are going to have to really handle the ball better
than we did tonight in the game there. What really helped us in the first game
is keeping Savage (ph) and did a great job of handle the ball and did taking
some of the pressure off of Joe.  
And you know, now without Keith in, as you saw tonight under pressure, we
don't have a lot of ball handlers. Kevin Larsen is going to have to help us
out, and Maurice is going to have to do a much better job, I think he had six
turnovers tonight, so it's kind of going to have to be a team effort. It's
easier said than done. They have got a heck of a team, and the defense is
incredible. Not a lot of turnaround time, so it's not an ideal matchup for us;
but you know what we are excited about playing, we can play loose and
hopefully we'll just trade shots, not turnovers.  
  
Q. Six players with at least 12 points and bench scoring which has been an
issue recently.  
COACH LONERGAN: It's great. We shot well, some guys but having Nemanja score,
I don't know, he was really good early in the year and I looked at the first
game against UMASS, we had one basket and two rebounds combined. That's kind
of what we've been getting out of our bench. We have some guys that play hard
but no real production as far as points or rebounds. I haven't lost confidence
in him because he's getting open shots and he makes them in practice.  
I just told him, maybe it's not the right thing to do ‑‑ I said, I what I
remember from last seasonis you hit inside the backboard with a three late if
the game. It's not too late to turn things around. And you know, this is the
time of year‑‑ what a great time of year, March Madness, and the A10
Tournament, especially.  
But seniors step up this time of year, and it was a really good three games in
a row coming in today and Isaiah was great, and to see a senior, just a smile
on his face after the game makes you feel really good. But it's a seniors'
time of year right now and we need our seniors to step up.  
  
Q. UMASS is a team that's made a name for itself as kind of start slowly and
starts to build momentum in the second half. Is that something you addressed
with the team at the half?  
COACH LONERGAN: Yeah, I tried to, and you know, coming off time‑outs, certain
things, we just had some silly turnovers. But they are so athletic. You know,
we just threw the ball right to them, and Esho he's had a great couple games
in this tournament. He's a handful. And Isaiah got in foul trouble early, so
we really had trouble stopping them, and Chaz is so quick, and they had some
guys hit some threes and we missed free throws. I thought the game would never
end be to be honest with you. It was the longest 30 minutes of my life.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the 1 ‑3‑1 and how it worked?  
COACH LONERGAN: We've been playing it a lot and we had to play it a lot with
Isaiah in foul trouble and with Nemanja is out there, you really do have to
play a lot of 1‑3‑1 and Joe is not 100% so it's really hard to guard such an
athletic team in man‑to‑man but we do have good length. It's a good defense
and it takes some threes away.  
Where you get hurt is sometimes when they penetrate in that middle, and the
first game we played UMASS they were penetrating just throwing lobs and things
like that. We did a better job guarding against that tonight but you know, I
just thought it was a hard‑fought game and obviously we were more well‑rested
and I think that definitely helped us.  
  
Q. Not suggesting your guys need a wake ‑up call, but when you with you see
St. Bonaventure knock off Saint Louis, does it give a higher seed a wake‑up
call going into the first round?  
COACH LONERGAN: Yeah, I guess we are a three seed and we earned it and that's
great. I was happy last Sunday, people helped us out, we were three instead of
tied for fourth or whatever. But you know what, sometimes I feel like a tenth
seed; we were picked tenth, so I don't feel like we are sitting here like
Saint Louis or VCU. We are playing but I don't really feel like we are the
favorite.  
I think it's great for basketball what St. Bonnies did. I like Mark Schmidt,
and it just shows you how good our league is, it really does, from top to
bottom, and you know, people on TV can say what they want, but you know, this
league's getting six bids, maybe five, but I'm pretty sure it's getting six;
and if people watch our tournament on TV today, I think they can see that it's
just as good or better than the BIG EAST, SEC, ACC, whatever; it's right
there.  
  
Q. You turned them over 17 times; the point guard matchup, just talk about
that and how important it was.  
COACH LONERGAN: I thought we did a better job in this game. Chaz was
penetrating really getting six hands in. We talked about just digging in and
creating turnovers. He keeps you on your heels but we did that and we left
some guys as shooters. We feel that some of their guys are not shooters, so we
got away that.  
But I think we had active hands and it really created a lot of turnovers, and
late we did the same thing with a couple jump balls that we didn't get jump
balls and we had some reach‑in fouls. I thought that was the key, we were
aggressive and we didn't play on our heels and when he drove we didn't sit
that and kind of watch the Chaz Williams Show. We really didn't quit on plays.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Archie Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23486)

### [Devin Oliver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26117)

### [Vee Sanford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26669)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

DAYTON  87  
FORDHAM - 74

  
COACH MILLER: Obviously very happy to get the win. Advancing is the greatest
feeling in the world this time of year, and I give these guy, these two in
particular, a lot of credit. We finished the regular season on Saturday night
with a lot of emotion, and to our leaders credit and to our kids credit, we
stayed very consistent.  
Very happy with the way we worked on our approach coming in here, not really
knowing who we had to play; and then finding out late last night that we would
draw Fordham, to have a very, very quick turnaround on prep and to come in
here this afternoon and be ourselves.  
And I thought we got off to an outstanding start in the first half on both
ends of the floor. A little disappointed in our approach coming out of
halftime, just the maturity and the intensity that you need this time of year,
you're not always going to have that luxury of playing with that lead.  
But for the most part, very, very happy and both of these two guys right here
are going down as two of the better seniors that have been at Dayton.  
  
Q. 9 ‑for‑9 from the field, 3‑on‑3, 2‑for‑2 from the line, how does it feel
to be perfect?   
VEE SANFORD: Far from being perfect. Just a good night and I'm glad my
teammates could find me and just looking forward to tomorrow.  
  
Q. Talk about your great start, you were shooting lights ‑out for the first
ten minutes or so, how big was that?   
DEVIN OLIVER: It was good to get off to a great start. I think guys were
excited, had a lot of energy to start the game, like coach said, weren't
really fearful of anything. Shot the ball with confidence and that helped us
get off to an early lead and we tried to maintain it throughout the game.  
  
Q. In January, you guys were on that losing streak, what was it about this
group of players that you're able to stay together and turn things around to
where you're standing right now?  
VEE SANFORD: That's just life. You're going to go through adversity and we
have got a really good group of guys that know how to handle tough situations.
If you can handle life, you can handle anything, so that's what we did.  
  
Q. Tomorrow, of course, St. Joseph's, two bad tastes, a buzzer beater and a
loss, are they going to beat you a third time? What are you going to do to fix
that?  
DEVIN OLIVER: Just going to do what we do every day. We are going to go back
to work tonight, look at film and get our team prepared and come with an
attack mentality. Just try to continue to advance and don't worry about the
past two games, just get ready for the game tomorrow and be ready to attack.  
VEE SANFORD: I mean, it's hard to beat a team three times. I feel like we're
prepared and the edge we have, we don't want to go home and we want to
continue to play. So it's going to be a dogfight and we're going to play hard
so we're not going to worry about it.  
  
Q. Even though they scored 45 points ‑‑ they did it on shooting 13 of 42.
Talk about how you defended them?   
VEE SANFORD we knew they were really good scorers. In the scouting report, we
knew they were going to hit tough shots. This is a game you've just got to
guard hard, this is a game you have to guard hard and just play D and have a
little pride.  
  
Q. Can you remember the last time you went in a game where you didn't miss,
and you just talked about life and overcoming adversity. When you decided to
make the transfer, did you think that something like this was even possible?  
VEE SANFORD: I think the last game I had like this was in high school, but
transferring, it was a big move. I felt really comfortable about coming here
under Coach Miller. He sought me out, got a release. He told me what his
expectations are, so nothing's surprising. We've had‑‑ since I got here as a
team, we're pretty much doing what we planned on doing and we're going to
continue to do it.  
  
Q. Was it motivation losing the first game last year, coming back, was that
on your mind at all?  
DEVIN OLIVER: Yeah, you know, in the back of your mind you try to concentrate
on the game at hand and get ready for Fordham but the season as a whole, we
just left with a bitter taste and we got knocked out in the first round last
year. We just tried to come with an advance mentality and just try to continue
to play.  
  
Q. Can you talk about St. Joe and what you think about this matchup?  
COACH MILLER: I think St. Joe's is a terrific team. We have not fared very
well against them for, I would say probably three halves in a row, three
halves of the four halves we've played. We sustained it at home for a half.
The second half, we didn't have a whole lot of answers. And then obviously in
Philadelphia, we had zero answers.  
So we have a big challenge. They are a great team, and I think that as we
approach this one, we will have to be much, much better, much more detailed in
terms of the energy that we have to end and in certain areas and the bottom
line with them is, they have a great plan against us. Can't score. We haven't
been able to score against them in two games. When you can't score, they are
too good to hold off. They control the tempo really well. They really
barricade around the basket and it's been very difficult for us to get easy
ones and we have not shot it particularly well.  
But, you know, this is a different season, so to speak. There's a lot of
freshness in the air right now. To play in this venue this time of year, and
you get one under your belt, as well, you have to feel good about taking the
floor tomorrow and that's what we want our guys to do.  
The only thing on our mind right now is an opportunity to compete against
those guys and see if we can't find a way to get to the semifinals, that's it,
and that's probably the same thing they are trying to do.  
  
Q. Coming out in the first half, thinking preparation ‑‑ it looked through
the roof. How do you maintain that, now ten of 11, moving into tomorrow?   
COACH MILLER: We have good kids, and even when we weren't doing very well, we
still had a good way about us. I think the thing that we've been able to do
over the last month and a half or so as we've wrapped up 10 of 11 is we've
been able to be great every day. You know, we have not had very many bad days,
and I'm not talking about game day. I'm talking about the hour and 15, the
hour and 20 that we take the floor, improving, just having a mentality about
us, a bounce, a positive, connection, togetherness. We have a lot of guys
games playing in games, which helps. I think there's great camaraderie around
these guys, but just sticking true to who we are.  
I felt like we had our Monday and Tuesday in Dayton before we took offwere as
good as any practices that we've had, and I've been saying that for a month.
If the players and the coach are enjoying coming to the gym every day, you're
going to have a chance to be successful and I think that's what's going to
happen to this group.  
  
Q. Good to get the first one under your belt, but is it more advantageous
that they made a little run to see how you guys would respond?  
COACH MILLER: I think the one of the things that will come out of tonight is
that maturity that you have to have playing with a lead, deep down; I don't
think we handled the halftime very well coming out in, particular just
defending the three‑point line. It's not like you're going toplay against
those two guys, in particular, Branden Frazier and shut out, you know that.  
But there's always a lot to take from the game. There will be a lot of good
and there will be a lot of bad and we'll mix that in very quickly here this
evening, and then we move on as fast as we can to try to prepare to be ready
to go tomorrow.  
I do think the plan here, getting a win is great, and not having a whole lot
of feel good‑‑ yeah, there's some things that we have to get corrected for
tomorrow, because to this point forward, we are not going to be able to beat a
team if we have that type of first eight minutes in the second half.  
  
Q. Kyle Davis gave you a big look; can you talk about his play?  
COACH MILLER: He's done that all season long. He understands when he comes in
the game what his job is. He's fearless, he's not afraid; and I can go all the
way back to the first game of the season and all the way through, he's got a
great way about him. He's part of the reason that we have won 23 games now or
the win streak or whatever people are talking, he's part of the reason.  
I think Kendall has surged in, as well. The last three games in particular you
go back to St.Louis to Richmond to here, he's given us great minutes, as well.
Our bench got 35 points tonight; that's very, very big for us.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

ST. BONAVENTURE  82  
LA SALLE - 72

  
COACH SCHMIDT: I thought it was a great opening game today, really
competitive.  
Going into the game, everybody knows it was one‑to‑one, this was, quote, the
grudge match. Game one we played well, game two, we didn't. Give La Salle all
the credit in the world, they shot the heck out of the basketball. Going into
the game we thought if we didn't defend and rebound like game one, it would be
the same result as game two and we would lose.  
I thought that we came out strong. I told the guys, you know, in the locker
room before, you can't play this game not to lose. You've got to play to win,
and I thought they had that right mentality.  
You know, so we got off to a great start. I thought Youssou was tremendous in
the first half. In the second half, the third foul and the technical foul and
La Salle made a run at us. In the past in the season we've lost a lot of close
games and not being able to finish, not being able to make that big play to
stop that momentum ‑‑ and today we did. It was 53‑52 and we had a time‑out and
we talked about it and our guys responded.  
I thought Marquise played tremendously, put‑backs, strong inside, especially
when Youssou was out, playing a kid like Wright who is big and strong. But we
made plays and we finished‑‑ we found a way to win and it was a good victory
for us, especially coming off of four losses.  
As I said all along, momentum is fleeting. You can't worry about the four
losses. It's when the ball goes up, you have to make your own momentum and I
thought we did that.  
  
Q. Charlon this seems to be one of your guys best games in the halfcourt
offensively all year. What kind of allowed you guys to play as well as you did
on that end?  
CHARLON KLOOF: I think teamwork. Everybody was committed to just winning and
not getting their own or forcing the issue. So everybody was just committed to
getting a basket, so there was ball movement, player movement, and I think
that really opened things up for our guys.  
  
Q. (No mic).  
CHARLON KLOOF: He was working really hard‑‑ (Inaudible).‑‑ I just let him know
that when he comes back in the game, we need the same effort, because it was
his fourth foul. So when he came back, he could have got his fifth foul but he
stayed calm, he stayed focused and he got a big block at the end. He got two
big rebounds. So I just wanted to make sure that he's still focused and into
the game.  
  
Q. Marquise, talk about the resolve of the team after Youssou picked up the
technical foul. They made a run at you but you guys were able to hold them
off.  
MARQUISE SIMMONS: We just wanted to remain calm. We knew that they made a run,
it's part of the game. We just all had to stay together and fight back.  
So when Youssou picked up the technical fall, I just tried to get all the guys
and let them know that we got to snap out of it and, you know, everybody relax
and calm down, because I felt like we were playing a little bit split up at
the time. So we just had to get back into our groove.  
  
Q. Being basically a fifth ‑year senior, this might have been your best game
of the year. How much did that maybe play into this game, thinking about your
last game after your career here?   
MARQUISE SIMMONS: Could you repeat your question?  
  
Q. Did being a fifth ‑year senior play into our mind at all before the game?
How much had you thought about the fact that this might be possibly your last
game, from a box score standpoint, did you think about that during the game at
all?   
MARQUISE SIMMONS: No, not really. Like Coach said before the game, he told us
we can't play not to lose.  
So I just went out and helped my team win, did everything I could do to put us
in the best situation and win. Really wasn't thinking about it being the last
game, and we played hard enough to winso it's not, to live to fight another
day.  
  
Q. On the steal with fast break with a couple minutes left, was that a case
of over ‑playing? Did you think you might have a passing lane there?   
CHARLON KLOOF: Not really, but the coaches did a really good scouting job, and
they emphasize that their offense runs to Duren. So whenever somebody is
stuck, they are going to look for Duren and we anticipated that.  
  
Q. This question goes along with his, but two years ago, obviously you
missed the A10 Tournament that you guys won with the injury and now you're
kind of getting an opportunity to be a part of it this year. What does this
mean to you to have that chance now to maybe help your team try to go on a
little bit of a run and to have the kind of game you did today with 15 points
and seven rebounds?  
MARQUISE SIMMONS: It means everything. You know, like you said, two years ago,
I tore my Achilles and I wasn't able to play, so I was just here to support.
We missed the tournament last year and this is my last chance to go at it.  
So every game that we have from here on out, I'm just going to try to leave it
all out there and do everything I can to help us win. I won't get another
chance to play here, so trying to do everything I can to help us move on.  
  
Q. Duren, 0 ‑for‑7, how much was shutting him out a part of your plan?  
COACH SCHMIDT: You know, when they are good, he scores. He's in that‑‑ next
guy. We thought that, believe me, we didn't think we were going to shut him
out but since we shut him out, that was a big reason that we won.  
But he's a heck of a player, and like I said, when they are playing well, he's
that next scorer that can really‑‑ and in game two, he did a great job of
getting into the paint. We tried to make him a jump shooter as much as we
could. He's a really talented kid and believe me, he had some open looks; he
just missed, and thank goodness.  
  
Q. When the big kid picks up the third and the fourth ‑‑ you said you talked
to them. Keeping in mind that most of us work for family publications, was it
in their heador was it‑‑  
COACH SCHMIDT: Yeah, I think at that time, I knew it was a big call. Youssou
didn't doing in that we wanted him to do, and he's playing really, really
well. We were going inside and getting some easy stuff. But when we went out,
you could see in the kids' eyes, here we go again.  
I just reassured them that we've got the talent on the team to be able to
cover Youssou. He made a mistake, and good teammates pick him up and I thought
that's what our guys did. Youssou knew he lost his composure a little bit.  
But good teams, good players, good teammates, you know, don't yell at him.
They go out there and help him. And as Charlon said, we needed him in the
game. And Charlon is the captain, did a really good job, probably a better job
than I did, of keeping calm and keeping his composure and making sure that
Youssou‑‑ he's going to go back in the game and when he does, he has to have
his mind right and he did that.  
  
Q. The last time you played La Salle, Youssou also had a great first half;
is there something about the matchup that you knew that you could get the same
stuff that you did a couple weeks ago or was it more just organic?  
COACH SCHMIDT: We like to go, like every coach, you want to go inside out.
He's really a back to the basket guy. And they played it straight up for the
most part. They don't double.  
So we knew that if he could score‑‑ he was going to get some shots; and could
he make them. He got off to a great start, and really, we had that lead in the
first half because of how well he played.  
And then he had the big jump hook at the end of the game, but yeah, it was a
little bit by design. You want to go inside early. You look at La Salle, you
want to try to get Wright or Zack in foul trouble. We didn't do a great job
with Wright, but you always want to try to go inside.  
It's like I said all the time, I love playing golf, and you want to get the
ball close to the hole, you know, and same thing in basketball. Easy‑‑ usually
the closer you are to the basket, usually it's an easier shot.  
  
Q. Talk about your team's resolve.  
COACH SCHMIDT: We showed character. We've lost a lot of games in the Atlantic
ten at the buzzer, by two or three baskets, and we had a hard time finishing.
We couldn't make that play, that stop.  
And you know, like Charlon said, we had that big steal. That was a big stop.
Youssou had the big put‑back ‑‑ the jump hook. Those are the things we
struggled with throughout the season, and you know, when you have solid kids,
character kids, they didn't get down on themselves and they had another
opportunity and they cashed in.  
Just proud of their effort. Everybody was talking about coming in on a
four‑game losing streak and we're going to be one‑and‑done. The kids hear all
that stuff and I thought they really had a mind‑set that they were going to
try to overcome it, and they did.  
They had a chance to cave when Youssou got that technical, and they made a run
and got it down to one. There was a chance for us to crumble, but with the
leadership that we have and the character of our players, we hung in there and
pulled it out.  
  
Q. How big was it when on a day when Matthew was quieter than he's been over
the last month or so with only eight and a couple other guys have quiet days
and you're able to get 34 and 17 out of Youssou and Marquise, where really you
maybe get both their best games on the same day like that.  
COACH SCHMIDT: Yeah, you know, Matthew struggled a little bit, and you need
some inside presence and it was big. We wouldn't have won without Youssou's
and Marquise's play today. I thought Dion Wright did a lot for us, too. When
we get in foul trouble, Dion came in. We went four‑wide and Dion got some
baskets taking Zack off the bounce, so he was big, as well. But our forwards
were really, really big for us today.  
  
Q. With Youssou on the bench for so long, do you have any concern about
rustiness?  
COACH SCHMIDT: No. You know, if you saw him running back and forth behind the
bench‑‑ I told him to loosen up and I guess that's Youssou's‑‑ that's how he
loosens up.  
He played well, and throughout the game, and we had, you know, we felt
comfortable with him. The play was designed as a two‑mangame with our best
perimeter player with big Matthew and our inside‑out player with Youssou, and
we wanted Matthew to come off if he had the shot, and if he didn't, he was
going to go inside to Youssou. So Youssou made me look good.  
  
Q. What do you have to do against St.Louis?  
COACH SCHMIDT: We've already got to talk about them? They are tremendous.
Great coach, player of the year in Jett; Evans inside; Loe is a matchup
problem because he the defense. They are a great defensive team. They didn't
win the league because they have bad players or a bad coach.  
I thought we played decent out there. We lost 66‑60\. But they are a physical,
defensive‑minded team. They have great senior leadership. I think they start
five seniors. They have always been there. They win close games. So, yeah,
we've got our hands full. It's not going to be‑‑ let me enjoy this one for
another 15, 20 minutes (chuckling).  
  
Q. A thought on the shooting 54 percent, you only turned the ball over six
times, one turnover in the first half, grabbing offensive rebounds, making
free throws ‑‑  
COACH SCHMIDT: There's a big emphasis going into the game of taking care of
the basketball. They had 18 points off of turnovers in game two. They had five
points off of turnovers in game one and one of the reasons why we won and why
we lost.  
So going into the game, it was imperative that we execute in the halfcourt. We
took care of the ball. We got good shots and we turned the ball over six
times; I think that's a season low.  
And we work on it all the time, and it's easier to execute when your big guys
are scoring. When you're a jump‑shooting team, it's a little bit more, jump
shooting is fickle; it's a little bit more difficult to execute when you just
have jump shooters. But Youssou and Marquise did a heck of a job inside and I
think that it made it look cleaner than when you're just a jump shooting team.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Dan Hurley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26699)

### [Xavier Munford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26700)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

MASSACHUSETTS  65  
RHODE ISLAND - 61

  
COACH HURLEY: Proud of the‑‑ it's a little bit like Groundhog Day for us in
the game. Obviously led the majority of the game against one of the better
teams in the conference, played them for the third time this year. Proud of
how our young guys fought against a much older, much more veteran team.  
Difference in the game, obviously, were the volume of free throws that they
shot. You know, they made more than we took, the majority of which, happened
in‑‑ in the game fouls, they did a good job of getting to the line.  
And we obviously missed free throws in that last five, six, seven minutes when
it was winning time and they were getting really, really physical and
aggressive defensively, both on the ball, off the ball, being really, really
physical.  
You know, obviously having some guys, when you're on demand and you're losing
guys, tailbones to the face and cramping and all types of stuff, it took us
out of our execution, because we were executing at a high level probably up
until about ten minutes to go in the second half.  
  
Q. Even with the loss tonight, the team did win three of its last four
regular ‑season games, seemed in the St. Bonaventure, you went on to really
play competitive; was there anything about game or anything about that game
that turned the season around a little at the end?   
XAVIER MUNFORD: I think what helped us in that game was traveling, we had to
travel and we had to fight through adversity. It was a long road to get there.
We just fought hard that game. We just wanted to make a turnaround to our
season and we became a better team in practice and that's when it all started
and we just built it from there.  
  
Q. Coach alluded to things got a little chippy out there. Is that kind of
just building up, you play these guys three times in a month and a couple
frustrating losses, is that just kind of building and building up?  
XAVIER MUNFORD: Playing against UMASS is a big rivalry, very familiar with
those guys, it's our third time playing them so it's going to get pretty
chippy and stuff like that but we just have to keep playing them.  
COACH HURLEY: I think that run we had, a seven‑, eight‑point lead, and that
showed our lack of experience, because we were playing significantly better
basketball than they were playing, and then when the talking started and the
chirping started, I think that had a negative effect on us.  
I think it became too emotional. It became too personal and then we started
putting ourselves in really bad spots off the dribble, and you could see it
and we tried to calm the guys down but it certainly got chippy.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your first half shooting six for six from the field
and also specifically, you and Chaz Williams going at each other over the last
20 minutes or so?  
XAVIER MUNFORD: When I came out, I didn't force anything. I just found my
rhythm and I just went from there. Tried to find my offense and as far as me
and Chaz Williams, it's a great rivalry. Me and him, two hard‑nosed players.
We both want to win. We're both tough, and that's basically it.  
  
Q. Did they play you any differently in the second half? Did they cover you
differently off ball screens? Did they use maybe two or three different guys
on you, anything differently than the first half?  
XAVIER MUNFORD: Just laid off the screens‑‑ the guys stayed longer than usual
the first half. The first half I was able to turn the corner a lot. The second
half, they kind of took that away from me.  
  
Q. With 24 points in your final collegiate game, I know it's probably a
little fresh, but at this point, as best you can, can you reflect back upon
your two years at Rhode Island, a thousand ‑plus points and just what it's
meant to you?  
XAVIER MUNFORD: It's been great, playing for Coach Hurley, that's been
awesome; playing for a coach that knows my personality and my game well.
Thousand points is a great accomplishment and I'm proud of that. I just want
to keep working and keep building on my game and see what my next step is.  
  
Q. You mentioned the youngness of the team. Is this the kind of three ‑game
series that down the road, you'll look back and say, you learned some things
from this as a positive growth thing down the line?  
COACH HURLEY: This was the same game we played against Providence earlier in
the year. Same game we played against St.Louis at home. Same game we played
twice against St. Joe's. We've been in these types of games.  
It's just what you see at the end of games is experience is usually going to
shine through, and then really in the game, we would have‑‑ we would have had
a cushion, two‑, three‑, four‑ five‑point cushion down the stretch in the
last, you know, three, four, five minutes of the game, which for a young kid,
a young team, is enormous.  
If we would have just made some free throws after playing behind after having
the lead the majority of the game‑‑ there's just a panic that you see in your
kids when they are just young and inexperienced and they are just not‑‑ they
are just not men yet. We just played against men; the top six players, average
age is 23 years old. We just played against men, when we are a very young
team.  
  
Q. Did the way the game ‑‑ aside from the talking and maybe you felt that
that was almost inevitable and you're trying to stave it off, but the way that
it was being called and the pace of the game totally changed, do you think
that was an even bigger reason why maybe your team got knocked off?   
COACH HURLEY: I thought the pressure the last 12 minutes of the game, the last
ten minutes of the game, when they got really, really physical, you know, both
in the full court and in the halfcourt, it rattled us.  
We were executing very, very well. You know, halftime, shooting 60 percent
from the field, up until ten minutes to go in the second half, shooting in the
high 50s from the field, obviously we had issues with turnovers. That's really
what you go through when you don't have a pure point guard like a Chaz
Williams who runs your team, and that also affects you in other game
situations. The last two or three minutes, it becomes a little bit
debilitating.  
But they stepped up their intensity level. You know, we didn't play through
the physicality. We could have done a better job, and then when fouls were
called, we didn't make the free throws.  
  
Q. Was it frustrating for to you see your team struggle offensively down the
stretch?  
COACH HURLEY: It's frustrating to lose. I just think this that's a by‑product
of just being young, you know, and not having a seasoned point guard. You
know, if you look at what they did down the stretch, they weren't exactly
prolific. There were a lot of broken plays. There was a step back‑‑ I don't
know if ‑‑ was it a 23‑footer from Chaz? That wasn't exactly great execution;
that was a guythat's shooting a step‑back 23‑footer, who is one of the best
players in the conference stepping up.  
So you know, the end of game, what became a physical, brutally physical,
intense, last five, six minutes of that game, it was going to be hard for it
to look pretty.  
  
Q. There were times this season when you were only dressing seven or eight
scholarship players, a lot of injuries; looking back, the way they finished
the season, how proud are you of the guys?  
COACH HURLEY: Proud of them. The line from today, the senior‑‑ shot 31 percent
from the field, shot three for 15 from three. I thought did an admirable job
for most of the game on the backboard.  
We lost the game by not making free throws and by the volume of free throws
that they made, we were minus 17 at the free throw line; that was the
difference in the game because we didn't make it and we put them down the
line.  
  
Q. You talked about young talent, looking at a guy like Martin, what do you
project for him as far as next year? What type of things do you want to see in
his game as he becomes a sophomore?  
COACH HURLEY: Stud. That kid is going to be a stud. I thought he had five
blocks in the first half‑‑ yeah, that kid, he's 18 years old playing against
grown men. That kid is going to be a star. He's going to be a star. This was
their first conference tournament game against a UMASS team that, you know, if
that's your sixth‑place team in the conference, right‑‑ you got anything to
say about that‑‑ if that's your sixth‑place team in the conference, then this
is one heck of a league.  
I wish we had‑‑ I need a week off. I almost lost my mind out there today and
it's happened several other times. But I wish it was a week, I wish we could
take a week off and I wish we could get started on the future.  
We have some help on the way. Internally we had some great pieces moving
forward, ranging from future Player‑of‑the‑Year‑types to guys that can really
emerge next year and take the next step.  
I'm excited about what I'm building. I'm excited about the year that we've
had. You know, we have made great improvement. We were plus six overall, doing
it for the most part with eight players, four of which were freshman this
year, anyone that feels like we didn't take major steps forward this year
doesn't know anything about basketball.  
  
Q. When a team is on a run like that and they are ramping it up physically
intensity ‑wise in the second half, you started to use a couple time‑outs, it
didn't stop them ultimately, in an ideal world, personnel aside, what has to
stop a team when they are making a push like that?  
COACH HURLEY: The pressure was bothering us, they were denying so many things,
so many of our sets which we had great success with. They were doing a really
good job of getting really physical, bodying guys up, getting into passing
lanes. And then when they got into denials, and then we tried to spread them
out and drive them, they did a really good job of physically guarding us off
the dribble and forcing us off of downhill drives and straight line drives.  
And then what happens with young teams is they take away your initial entry
and then now they are in denials and now you need guys to make plays, and then
that's when guys try to maybe do too much, put it on the floor, drive the
lane, they are a shot blocking team, instead of drawing help and sharing, I
think we had too many guys today that maybe that last five, six minutes maybe
just tried to do too much.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

MASSACHUSETTS  65  
RHODE ISLAND - 61

  
COACH KELLOGG: We're excited to be able to continue to play here at the
Barclays Center. I thought once again, Rhode Island played us tooth‑and‑nail
all the way to the end, and I thought our guys made some big plays to come
away with a victory on a night where obviously we didn't shoot the ball at a
high clip, but we made free throws tonight.  
I thought had we attacked the rim and I thought we got some contribution from
a lot of different place. We are excited to take on the challenge versus the
George Washington Colonials tomorrow.  
  
Q. Chaz, you had a tough game early, what did it mean to you especially here
to hit the three pointers?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: My teammates just kept faith in me. They kept telling me to be
aggressive. Whenever I would miss, they would tell me the next shot is going
in. I was just playing with confidence down the stretch and I feel like I
haven't done enough this game to help my team and I didn't want to let the
guys down, so I feel like I needed to make a stance.  
  
Q. What did that shot mean?  
DERRICK GORDON: It was big. It was definitely a crucial shot that he made. But
we just didn't let up. He wanted it more and we went out there and got the job
done.  
  
Q. Chaz, who did you have here tonight watching?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: I don't even know‑‑  
  
Q. A bunch of family and friends?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: A lot of family and friends here. I didn't deal with that this
year. I let my mom and the family deal with it.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you, you had a very visual reaction after the three
‑point shot. Just if you wanted to make another comment on what was going
through your head when it went through the net.   
CHAZ WILLIAMS: Just expressing myself. Throughout the whole game it's been
tough for me. I haven't been making shots. I felt like I wasn't making shots
so I wanted to take a defensive tone in the second half and guard Munford, and
once I made a shot, I was just like, finally, thank you, and here we go, and I
wasn't too long to miss too many. So I was just going to wait for one to go
in.  
  
Q. There was about a four ‑minute stretch late in the second half where
neither team scored a field goal but the intensity of the game was really
picking up‑‑ where the energy was starting to elevate?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: We were just playing, we were trying to find a basket, trying
to score. The way the game was going, we were making stops and making great
contests on both sides of the ball. It was kind of tough but that was the kind
of pace we wanted to play with and it was just like, one of our shots got to
fall in sooner or later, because this is how we usually play.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the spark that Maxie gave you guys?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: Oh, man, four for six, seven rebounds, 15 points off the bench,
that's great right there.  
You know, he was the one that kept us going in the first half and early in the
second half honestly with his energy and the way he came out to play, just
wanted to let him be the only one out there doing it so everybody else just
jumped on his shoulders and said, we're going to follow your lead.  
  
Q. Why do you think your team succeeds with the same formula, sluggish and
then you seem to turn it off?  
COACH KELLOGG: That's not how I'm coaching. I do think that we were a little
out of sorts in the first half. A lot of things weren't going our way. We kind
of started like getting a little selfish, I should say, just one dribble, but
these guys are older and they are more mature.  
We had a good halftime pow‑wow, if you want to call it that, and they came out
and played hard in the second half and competed at a high level. It's really a
testament to their makeup. We have good kids that all have their hearts and
heads in the right place which is important in tournament play.  
  
Q. I apologize if this has been asked already, maybe in the second half,
especially the last ten minutes, was it a case of, you guys were going to have
to win the game on defense and hopefully your offense was going to catch up?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: Yeah, pretty much, 17‑for‑54 today, so not many shots was going
in, and 3‑for‑15 from three, so no shots really was going in and the free
throw line kind of saved us.  
We just wanted to bear down on defense. We knew our shots wasn't falling, so
we can't allow them to score and let them keep their lead going. We wanted to
go out and make a defensive stand and we usually know that every time we play
the defense that we are always capable of it, it will be easy for the offense.  
  
Q. It's close to past 11:30 now but you have all your friends and family. Do
you have any time to celebrate tonight?  
CHAZ WILLIAMS: No, there's no celebration. Getting ready for tomorrow. God
willing, we celebrate on Sunday.  
  
Q. You had a chance to sit a little bit at the beginning of the second half,
is it just getting refocused?  
COACH KELLOGG: Pressing a little bit; he's in Brooklyn, wants to be the best
guy on the floor. Him and Munford were getting it into it a little bit, and so
I thought getting him a blow, let him watch for a miknute or two would kind of
refocus him, which I thought it did. I thought it was a good move; I guess I'm
not supposed to say that about myself. But it worked out, put it that way, and
he came back a little more focused. And I thought his defense was fantastic
down the stretch.  
  
Q. And the three ‑pointer‑‑  
COACH KELLOGG: No, I was waiting for that. He's made so many of those over his
career. They kind of slipped, didn't step out on the three when he raised up
and I basically knew it was in. I've seen that numerous times in his career
and that was one more in the memory bank for me.  
  
Q. With the way the game was trending in the second half, it seemed like
everyone was growing frustrated with the inconsistency of the flow; but, that
said, and the way that you guys played Rhode Island. Did that actually benefit
your team just to kind of get the game to kind of be tossed in mud so to
speak, and then you guys really seemed to capitalize?  
COACH KELLOGG: Absolutely. I thought the first half had no flow, at least for
how we want to play. In the second half, although it wasn't a beautiful game
to watch, per se, because guys were missing shots, there were some
back‑and‑forths and the floor opened up more, and I think we are a better team
when there's some space to operate. Allows our guards and allows our hybrids
to get to the rim and make plays.  
Actually I like the when game looks ugly, because I think that's when it
becomes a little bit of a street fight or a street game.  
  
Q. It looked like they were extending on Trey quite a bit, what were you
telling him with the two base client drives?  
COACH KELLOGG: He did a great job. He's shifty. That play was set up to post
Sampsan. They did a nice job of fronting him or kind of getting on his side,
and Trey on that, when he went baseline really, he created for himself.  
Again, like we talked about, he's a guy that needs a little space, and as the
game moved, there was more space for him to operate. And there wasn't really
any true post players for either team in the game at the time, so a lot of
guards and wings playing.  
  
Q. Did you do anything differently in the second half that held them to one
field goal over the final 9:50?  
COACH KELLOGG: We played like we guarded in the second half. At halftime I
asked him how could a team shot 60 percent? This is crazy. This is not our
identity. This is not who we are. So if you guys would like to continue to
play, you'll go out and take it to them and if you'd like to go home, do what
you did in the first half. It was kind of pretty simple but I thought we
executed better and we rebounded better in the second half.  
  
Q. As a follow ‑up to that, how critical is Raphiael's length? He had that
huge block which almost headed in a dunk in the other end, how important is he
on what you do on the defensive side?  
COACH KELLOGG: He may be one of the most om[prtant guys for us, because he can
do things that a lot of other players on our team or even in the league can't
do. He can guard on a wing but he can go into rebound and block shots. When
our defense is really good, you'll see he's involved in a lot of plays,
whether it's denying the wing or creating a block or doing things along that
nature.  
So, you know, like every college kid at times, they want to shoot the ball and
score, but he's got much more focused this year on the little things that help
you win.  
  
Q. I don't want to short ‑change anyone but the way that you guys play and
St.Louis plays and VCU plays, is this a tournament of survival?   
COACH KELLOGG: Yeah, it really is. The one thing I think the A10, we talk
about this quite frequently, so many teams play different styles that you can
go up against three or four different styles and you just survive.  
For us, what can we really do to prepare for George Washington tomorrow? I
mean, get rested, watch a couple tapes and give your guys a game plan. But
it's kind of like now, let's throw it up and play and try to survive like you
mentioned.  
  
Q. Would you talk about the matchups against George Washington tomorrow
night?  
COACH KELLOGG: I'm not sure but I think Savage is back from what I've been
reading‑‑ does anybody know? But I really like the team and the job that the
coach has done there. They have got really good guards that are solid and the
big kid, Larsen is one of the most improved guys in the league and arm Wood is
an older guy that‑‑ basically they have a really good squad. Garino is one of
the better slashers, defenders in the league; and McDonald and Creek, they go
six really strong as good as anybody guys in the league with their seventh and
eighth guys.  
They are a really good NCAA Tournament team that has improved as the year has
gone on and we'll have to be ready for their 1‑3‑1 and man‑to‑man defense.
That's their staple and I thought we did a good job against it down there. But
with not a ton of time to prepare, we'll see if our guys remember how we
attacked it.  
Thank you, appreciate it.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Branden Frazier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26627)

### [Tom Pecora](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26625)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

DAYTON  87  
FORDHAM - 74

  
COACH PECORA: Well, I think we started the game like we had run out of gas. We
were tired from last night and once we convinced them that that wasn't the
case, in the second half, we played with great energy and we made some of the
plays we are capable of making.  
I think they just wore us down. I know at one point we got it to five, the
three‑pointer obviously is a tremendous weapon, and we went on a little bit of
run making those and that was key for us, but gosh, they shot the heck out of
it. They really made some great shots and they are a heck of a basketball
team. Archie has done a great job with them. They have gotten better as the
year's progressed, that's for sure.  
So I think Branden was exhausted, too. He's playing ‑‑ we've allowed him a lot
of minutes and we just don't have the depth against an opponent like that to
go deep into our bench right yet, but that will come as we get into future
years.  
I wasn't satisfied with just one win here. I don't think they were. I know
Branden is not. But I think in one sense it's poetic that he ends his career
here in Barclays Center in Brooklyn, a kid from down the block. I think that's
a great story, so write about that.  
  
Q. Ending your career in Brooklyn, just talk about the 30 ‑point performance
and what it's like to go out in your hometown?   
BRANDEN FRAZIER: It was good to go‑‑ I mean, I didn't want to go out but it
was good to be home, growing up down the block. I just felt comfortable
playing and had a lot of friends and family here.  
So, I mean, what you said with the numbers, the 30 points, it's good that I
had 30 points, going out in your career, but to have a loss; I'd rather take
one point for a win. I mean, it's bittersweet.  
  
Q. With a few seconds left and the hugs, how much did that mean coming off
the court like that, because the Fordham family loves you especially?  
BRANDEN FRAZIER: It means a lot. I know Coach wanted to do that, he said in
the huddle before, and I have a group of guys on the team that love each
other. Those are like my brothers.  
So to go out, to have everyone stand up for me and clapping, even people who
were not Fordham fans, meant a lot to me, just to go down and hug every single
person that I went to battle within every game is special.  
  
Q. To be down by 19 at the half and come and fight back as a senior, what
were you telling the team, and what does that mean, how much fight is there in
the team this year?  
BRANDEN FRAZIER: Just have to keep your head up at all times. It's there's
going to be runs in the game, so I knew coming out at halftime we would make a
run, and it was for us to put the foot on the gas and they was going to throw
a couple purges back at us and that's what they did‑‑ we couldn't go down and
get a stop. You could see the effort on the team that we have, and over the
next couple years, you'll see the fight and the fight is going to begin now.  
  
Q. Coach talked about moving forward and now you've got like John and other
guys like that. What do you leave with this team as they move forward and you
finish your career?  
BRANDEN FRAZIER: I guess my competitive spirit. Just going out there and just
leaving it all out on the floor. Try to be a good leader to them, as well. I
know John is going to be good for Coach next year and also the guys coming in,
supposed to be a good recruiting class.  
They have a lot of young guys and I know they are going to fight, Bryan Smith
and Mandell is the next leaders for our team, hopefully they get them
together.  
  
Q. Are you looking forward to the draft?  
BRANDEN FRAZIER: Yeah, I'm looking forward to the draft I think.  
  
Q. I know it's hard to the minutes right after but is it possible for you to
sum up what he means to you both personally and professionally and what he's
meant to this program?  
COACH PECORA: Yeah, you know, I mean, you're all familiar with the story that
he was coming with us at Hofstra and when I decided to make a move and come to
Fordham, it was one of the first phone calls I got. I was getting a lot of
phone calls and not taking them, but his name came up and I picked it up. And
before I could say anything, Branden said, "Coach I'm with you if you'll have
me."  
You know, there was a lot of people that didn't think he was an Atlantic 10
level player. There was a lot of people that he should say stay and just play
in CAA. I believed in him. He was ‑‑ Bobby Leckie, long‑time New York City
coach from Bishop Loughlin who at the time was working as an assistant said to
me‑‑ "Tom, he's going to score a thousand points wherever he goes," because
he's going to get bigger and stronger, and he did that; he's going to compete,
and he's done that; and we moved him from a wing to a point and he's done
that.  
He means a lot. He gave us the credibility to go out and get Bryan Smith and
Jon Severe and get involved with other good players. We are recruiting good
point guards now and we showed them his stats and his growth as a player over
his four‑year career with us, and you know, we showed him the same stats for
some of the great players that we've coached over the years, and some that
have gone on to the NBA and grown as players.  
So he's grown as a player, he's grown as a person, he's graduating, he's a
fine student, and you can just see the way people react to him here and
everywhere. He's just a wonderful kid. I have an 11‑year‑old son, and if he
can be like him, I'd be blessed.  
  
Q. Give us a little bit of a scouting report, you've played both teams, why
is St. Joe's giving Dayton some trouble so far this year?  
COACH PECORA: I don't know. I haven't watched it that closely to be quite
honest.  
You know, so many nights it comes down to match‑ups. I think, you know‑‑ I
think Dayton was a much different team‑‑ I'm not even sure when they played. I
know they played last a couple weeks ago. Last night I watched the St.Louis
game and the Richmond game Dayton played and then our first game with them, so
I didn't see that.  
But so often it just comes down to matchups and where you are, what part of
the year, where players are. They are 18‑ to 22‑year‑old kids; so where are
their minds at that point in the season.  
  
Q. You mentioned trying to convince them that they were not tired at
halftime. What was that chat like at halftime?  
COACH PECORA: I can't‑‑ I could‑‑ well, I wasn't over the top. I didn't even
yell to be quite honest. I just said, look, I told them at pregame this
morning, I said, look, we've got it all set up the LIU, after we win today,
we're going for ice baths. Everyone is going to jump in the ice baths at the
training room in LIU, so you can get those fresh minds, fresh legs, is the
term I use all the time with them.  
Like I said, we didn't practice long on Monday or Tuesday; we practiced hard
but for about an hour, hour and 15 minutes. I really think it was just mind
over matter and they came out and hit us hard early on on those early shots,
some that were contested and I think that put us back on our heels.  
But I really just talked to them about having pride. It's an old Bill Walsh
term, the score takes care of itself. If you go out and you give the kind of
effort you're capable of, the score will take care of itself. Maybe we'll get
back in this game and maybe we'll steal it.  
  
Q. You've played a lot of close games this year, and you're going to review
this year, but how excited are you for next year, because there's a lot of
good things happening with this program moving forward.  
COACH PECORA: No doubt about that. I'm very excited. We're going to hit the
ground running. I am going to have dinner tonight with my family, and tomorrow
I'm on the recruiting trail and we'll be all over the country doing what we
have to do that way. The young man we have signed early is an exceptional
player, he's a very good player.  
I'm always excited. I think when you're not excited about coaching college
basketball, you're a fool. I mean, there's real jobs out there. And I'm
blessed; young guys come in and they say, they want to coach and I say, guys,
don't just see game night. You have to see, you know, 70‑, 80‑hour weeks; you
have to see the traveling; you have to see driving at night; coming home, not
seeing your family.  
But with all of that said, for me, to work at a university like Fordham, in my
hometown, it's like I won the lottery twice. I've been a head coach now for 15
years or 14 years, whatever it is, and to do it at two schools in the town I
grew up in, and now to do it at Fordham, it's so well thought of at every
level, I'm blessed and I'm lucky.  
  
Q. Following up on that a little bit, considering how hard you guys played
down the stretch of the season in games that got a way a possession here, a
possession there, and the way they didn't quit obviously in this game, is
there a tangible value to that in the off ‑season when you're trying to build
and you're trying to get this program going in the direction you want?   
COACH PECORA: Yeah, I mean, you know, people, especially friends and people
you run into, they always say, what's the most important skill a basketball
player can have: Is it shooting the ball, is it rebounding, defending,
passing? It's competing. It's having the ability to compete and that is a
skill, and it's a skill we really worked on with the number of guys on this
team to try to elevate their competitive nature, their ability to play hard
every possession.  
So yeah, I truly believe it's something we can build off of. Early in the
year, I was saying, we call our mistakes experience, because they have gone
through the gauntlet of the A10 now. This is such a good league. This league
has gotten better every year I've been in it at Fordham and next year‑‑ I
don't think you can ever underestimate how good this league is going to be,
and we have to build off our ability to do that and how to play.  
That's one of the reasons why teams in this conference can go into the
postseason and have great runs, because they play through the gauntlet. It's
not a league where, you know, it's three or four cupcakes. The teams at the
bop of the league are taking the teams at the top of the league to last
possessions, to overtime games.  
So it's a heck of a basketball league. And I think that if you don't compete‑‑
good leagues eat their young, and we are still young, but next year we won't
be quite as young. And we're moving in the direction of becoming a good
program in this league and that's what our goal is when we walked on campus
four years ago.  
  
Q. That might be the best quote of the tournament so far ‑‑  
COACH PECORA: Which one?  
  
Q. Good leagues eat their young.  
COACH PECORA: If you're an old ‑‑ if you have an old team, it's a good quote.  
Thank you all very much. We appreciate everything.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Jim Ferry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22062)

### [Ovie Soko](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26690)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

RICHMOND  76  
DUQUESNE - 64

  
COACH FERRY: I thought we actually played a decent first half in regards to
defensively. I thought we did a good job guarding Kendall Anthony and guarding
their offense.  
I thought we had our opportunity the first half. I thought it was our shot
selection that really hurt us in the first half. In the second half, we fouled
way too much and really got hurt on the glass.  
You know, when you get down against a Richmond team like this, it's so
difficult to get them sped up and to come back. I really thought we had our
opportunity in the first half and then we got beat at doing things that we
normally do. We only got eight free throws on the game, and they got 26 and we
got out-rebounded, and that's stuff that we usually ‑‑ you know, when we win
games, we usually dominate those two areas.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about your season here, what it's been like and just
tonight's effort, 23 points, 13 rebounds in this last game?  
OVIE SOKO: It's just been a real learning experience. Coach brought me into a
new role here at Duquesne. It's just been a good experience just growing,
being a leader on the team and leading a bunch of younger guys. I've grown
tremendously with the help of the coaches and the players. We bounced off each
other and tonight we just came up short.  
  
Q. Talk to today, they opened up the second half on a 13 ‑2 run, but you
guys were able to make it a closer game; talk about the change in strategy
maybe.   
OVIE SOKO: We tried to chasetheir best three‑point shooters off the line and
we had a little bit of success, and we were able to get some stops together in
transition. That's how we were able to bring them back and they were able to
break loose and get a couple easy ones in the break. I guess that's how it
opened backup.  
  
Q. They started out on a 9 ‑0 run in the second half and it just seemed you
never recovered from that. How tough is that, because you played such a
competitive first half.   
OVIE SOKO: Their system, they run their offense, the way they run it, they run
through it they use the shot clock if they have so. So when you get down on a
team like that, you know, it's tough to sort of chop away because they do such
a good job of using up the clock. You know, they run their offense, and we
just weren't really able to get back into it.  
  
Q. What were they doing to Micah that didn't allow him through the course of
the game, only took three shots ‑‑  
COACH FERRY: Well, you know, they switch at every position. They switch on
every exchange, and they did what Micah does ‑‑ they really switched and they
switched out deep on him, so they really didn't give him any comfort or any
looks at the basket. We tried to get him to be aggressive and we tried to get
him some driving kicks.  
We talk about guys screening their own; well, you really have to credit them
defensively for locking in on him. They funneled us to the inside, which Micah
passed the ball well today, but we needed him to score and he really didn't
have any open looks. He's a good basketball player. He's not going to miss
four shots, and Ovie and Dom both scored interior‑wise but we really lacked
that third and fourth score tonight.  
  
Q. Talk about being in Brooklyn after being in L.A. for so long.  
COACH FERRY: It stinks right now to be honest. Barclays has been great to us.
Coming back to Brooklyn is great. We practiced at LAU every day and I'll
always be a part of that family and it was great seeing everybody. I just wish
we could have stayed here a little bit longer.  
  
Q. Vast improvement this year. What can you take out of that and then what
are you looking forward to take that next step?  
COACH FERRY: This is a resilient group and it takes time to rebuild a program.
I've done it before. And when you're in a league that's such a monster of a
league, it takes some time, because there's just great players and great
coaches. You need multiple recruiting classes.  
For us to play well down the stretch, which is what we did, and I knew it was
going to take us a little while because we had so many new guys, whether it
was a transfer or a guy sat out, a bunch of new guys that never played
together, never wore the jersey, it took us a little while to get going.  
And then at the end of the year, we are playing pretty good basketball. Prior
to tonight, I thought we were playing some of the best basketball in this
league. We played close to UMASS, we could have won that game. We beat St.
Louis. We went on the road, beat George Mason which was a big game.  
And I think the experience of being able to grind at the end of the year, make
a run, finishing tenth in great league, that's an accomplishment for a young
group. We just have to be able to build on that with recruiting classes and
maturity and growth.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Tyreek Duren](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25052)

### [John Giannini](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21943)

### [Jerrell Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25053)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

ST. BONAVENTURE  82  
LA SALLE - 72

  
TYREEK DUREN: It was just sad to see the season come to an end on a loss. Like
I said the last game, I had a lot of confidence going into the tournament that
our team could make a good run, so it was definitely a little emotional just
knowing that the season might be over.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the fact that you guys never led in the game, you
came close and all that. It just seemed like you used so much energy trying to
get back in the game. Could you talk about that?  
TYREEK DUREN: I think we just came out sluggish. We always talk about how we
don't want to come out in the game slow. We want to come out with the
intensity that we are going to need to win the whole game, so like you said,
we are pretty much fighting back the whole game. We exerted a lot of energy
trying to do that.  
JERRELL WRIGHT: Same thing Tyreek said. Basically trying to go in and play as
much defense as we could. We were chasing the whole 40 minutes. On offense, we
were kind of tired, but they just played hard today.  
COACH GIANNINI: I thought it was a great game. I thought both teams played
extremely hard. I thought St. Bonaventure was the better team because of the
place they were able to make offensively.  
Certainly we scored against them and shot a good percentage and didn't turn it
over much, but they were really terrific offensively. They made really hard
shots from multiple positions, whether it's tough threes or their big guys
inside. Of course, making 90 percent of their free throws, and then they got
some lucky bounces and Kloof drove one time and had the ball bounce off
someone's elbow and someone's head and roll in at a critical time.  
I thought the critical play, if there was a critical play in the game, it was
when we were down 53‑52 with a lot of momentum, we had the ball, we had a play
that went exactly the way we wanted it to: A fake handoff where Tyrone had the
whole baseline to himself to drive and looked like we were going to score and
take the lead. You know, things didn't go our way on that one. I thought that
could have got us over the hump both on the scoreboard and just emotionally.  
Other than that, individual play, it was just a hard‑fought game, and they
were just terrific. They have a lot of good players and they really make hard
shots. This league is‑‑ I mean, this is my tenth year and I've never seen so
many good teams. I mean, George Mason and St. Bonaventure, they could play
against almost anyone in the country and have a chance to win. It's a battle.  
So we are very disappointed. What I told the guys after the game is that the
basketball frustration speaks for itself, but when you spend a year of your
life with someone the way you do in college basketball now, there all summer
and with each other constantly, just on a personal level, I just am really
pleased that I got to be with these guys and share a year of my life with
them.  
I mean, we didn't win the way we wanted to; we didn't play the way we wanted
to, but I really like them as people and I'm proud of them as people. I was
proud of their effort today. Our problems are basketball‑related, not
personal. I'm honored to coach them.  
  
Q. How about Tyrone? They were playing off him and letting him shoot; how
tough was that because you obviously rely on him for offense.  
COACH GIANNINI: It was real hard. And I think, you know what we expected to
happen this year obviously didn't, and there's no way that we achieve what we
did last year without Tyrone. He was just an explosive player off the bench
that other people just didn't have and he was a difference‑maker.  
We had a lot of good players and we needed every single one of them to make
the tournament and we needed every single one of them to win close games and
we needed every single one of them to advance in the NCAA Tournament and he's
one of the ones that we couldn't have been successful without.  
This year his role was dramatically different and the results were
dramatically different. If anything, that's my fault for not anticipating
that. Certainly he's the same person and the same player.  
So, you know, the fact that I didn't anticipate that is a disappointment and a
lot of people didn't see that coming, as evidenced by our preseason
predictions and Tyrone being a preseason all‑conference player.  
  
Q. What do you think these seniors will be remembered for?  
COACH GIANNINI: Like I said, I think for the people who watch our team every
day or every game, game‑in and game‑out, and for the people on our campus,
they will be remembered for being really good people, first and foremost, and
as frustrating as this year was, the previous two years were just terrific.
And they still lead La Salle I think as the winningest‑‑ for the winningest
four‑year period in the last 25 years.  
So they‑‑ I just in hindsight didn't put this team together properly at all.
But some of the decisions that I made that helped us last year, hurt us this
year. Again, that's in hindsight.  
And besides maybe recruiting another shooter and a‑‑ again, to have an impact
at this level, the guy has to come in and be good from the get‑go. Those guys
aren't just growing on trees. You just don't find a guy to come into the A10
and average double digits and shoot 40 percent from the field; but in
hindsight, I wish I had found someone like that. We needed to replace Ramon
and we didn't. We thought we did, but we didn't.  
  
Q. You talked about Tyrone, and with Tyreek, can you just talk a little bit
more, you handed him the ball a long time ago and I know you have a point
guard to replace him but what is it going to be like to replace him?  
COACH GIANNINI: You know, I just think it's our job to replace people, so we
do that more confident‑‑ but rather than look ahead, I'd rather look back.
Tyrone did absolutely every single thing that we expected him to do. I mean,
he led the program, he made us better, he got us to a high level. Just the way
when Rodney Green left, we looked to Tyrone; we'll look to Amar and some other
people.  
When Rodney left, we looked to Tyreek. When Tyreek leaves, we'll look to some
other people and I'm equally as confident in them as I was in Tyreek.  
  
Q. Talk more about looking back ‑‑ what his impact was‑‑  
COACH GIANNINI: I told you; I'll say it again. He did every single thing we
expected him to do. He was a great player on a great team last year and on
good teams in other years.  
I don't know what to say other than he did‑‑ it's hard to top; he did
everything we expected him to do. It's hard to give him a higher compliment
than that. You have a better command of the language than I do, but he did
everything we ever wanted him to do. We love him; we counted on him; he came
through; he always did his best. He passed, he scored, he gave us poise. It
was hard to take him off the court.  
You know, he was‑‑ he was extremely special and indispensable to the teams he
played on. Obviously I hope he's not indispensable to teams he won't play on
because neither of those words make sense, so moving ahead we are very
confident.  
But for the teams he played on, he was our most impactful player.

### [Chris Mooney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16304)

### [Alonzo Nelson-Ododa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26688)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

RICHMOND  76  
DUQUESNE - 64

  
COACH MOONEY: Well, better to finish the game on the bench, and I thought our
guys played very, very well. I thought over defense was really good. Obviously
Micah Mason is the best three‑point shooter in the country. I thought we were
very alert to him. I think he only got off two threes and the ones he did were
contested and were hard shots to make.  
So I thought our defense was critical and then we made a couple of shots and
of course Terry Allen, Alonzo, played great games, as well as Kendall. I think
really, the game came down to our defense being‑‑ just making it hard for them
to score and hard for them to find a rhythm.  
Really proud of our guys and looking forward to moving on to tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Alonzo, did you see this offensive emergence coming? You had some trouble
scoring in the last four games of the season.  
ALONZO NELSON‑ODODA: For this game I think my main focus was to come out and
play aggressive and try to get rebounds. That's what the coaches have been
emphasizing a lot in practice and watching film with all the coaches. So I
really think that helped get me going offensively.  
  
Q. Collectively all together, did you see it coming?  
ALONZO NELSON‑ODODA: Yeah, I did, especially when I saw Terry, I think he had
13 points in the first half and Kendall was playing really well. Everybody was
playing really well offensively and flowing together.  
  
Q. Billy shot eight free throws. Talk about how you played such good defense
and didn't get into much foul trouble.  
KENDALL ANTHONY: We just stick to the game plan. Coach had a really good game
plan about who was the shooter, who was the driver and things like that and we
played it really well. We can't play defense without our hands, I think that
was the big thing, and we rebounded really well. So I think that all
collectively as a team, I think we did really well defensively.  
  
Q. Third time against VCU tomorrow night, what are your thoughts on that,
and your thoughts on your two games against them this season?  
KENDALL ANTHONY: I think we know what to expect. I think that's the best
thing, you know, all our guys know what to expect with them, their defense, we
know how to handle it I think. I think it will be a really good game tomorrow
night. We'll play just like we played in the last two games and be aggressive
and attack the press.  
ALONZO NELSON‑ODODA: I just think it's good that we just played them last
week, so we are already on the scout and it's just how we ended up matching up
with them. We're ready to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. For those of us who aren't from Virginia and don't know about that
rivalry, what does that game mean and how intense is it?  
ALONZO NELSON‑ODODA: We know it's a huge rivalry but like I said, again, it's
just the way things matched up, so we're going to be ready to play tomorrow.  
KENDALL ANTHONY: It's a big rivalry especially for Richmond but we are here to
win the Championship and we have to take it one game at a time, and then the
next opponent. So we have to be ready to play no matter who we play, so I
think it will be a really good game, especially because of the rivalry.  
  
Q. You missed some shots early but then you started getting to the line and
you were perfect from the charity stripe. Did you change your approach on the
offensive end?  
KENDALL ANTHONY: No, I just played my game, just being calm out there, saw my
teammates were scoring easily so I tried to get them more shots and I'll take
my shots whenever I have them. So I'll just be patient and take my shots and
if someone came, and I knocked some down in the second half.  
  
Q. Alonzo, can you talk about the front court having a little more impact
for y'all and what you need to do going forward with that?  
ALONZO NELSON‑ODODA: I think that, again, starts off with us just being
aggressive offensively and defensively, just getting rebounds and going out
there and playing hard.  
  
Q. You said you know what to expect from VCU, they are going to press you
backcourt, halfcourt, trap you. What is the counter measure to that?  
ALONZO NELSON‑ODODA: There's really no counter measure. I think we are just
going to come out and be aggressive. I think that's the best way you can
handle pressure, and I think we have good enough players to handle the press
and handle the ball. Even our front court players can handle the ball. So I
think we have to attack it like we have been doing the last two games and be
aggressive.  
  
Q. Did you see this coming from Terry, and do you think Terry saw this
coming from Terry based on the second half with Dayton the other night?  
COACH MOONEY: I hope so. I think Terry is going to be a great player, and you
know, he‑‑ you know, sometimes he makes things look so easy, but you think
that, you know, when he has 15 points, he could have 25; when he has eight
rebounds, you think he can have 15. I think sometimes he makes it look so easy
that sometimes you're kind of starting to be more urgent and maybe even
impatient.  
I think that he's playing with confidence right now. I think he knows how
important he is to us, and the different things that he can do on the floor
are really, really impressive for a guy his size. We think really highly of
him and think that, you know, these games could be more the norm to be honest
with you.  
  
Q. I'm just curious how VCU's inclusion in the A10 the past couple years has
changed the tenor of the rivalry; curious how philosophically things have
changed in that rivalry.  
COACH MOONEY: It's always been a real will he big rivalry. It's unique because
the schools are different and we're only six miles apart, and I think it's
great. I think the fact that they joined is great for both programs. I think
it's good for the Atlantic 10, I think it's probably even intensified a little
bit because you're obviously playing twice, playing later in the season.  
So it's definitely a big game, a great rivalry, and there are a lot of
different things that matchup that make it that much more interesting,
starting with how different the schools are and of course now the styles of
player are a little bit different. So it really does make it that much more
interesting.  
  
Q. A solid night for your sophomore class in general. Can you talk about how
important this stretch is for that group and especially for the program moving
forward?  
COACH MOONEY: Yes, we have these four sophomore front court players who all
contributed greatly tonight who we're really high on. Like many players and
many sophomores, they have been somewhat inconsistent this season, but
tonight, I think‑‑ we got great contributions from all of them.  
You know, Trey is our best defender. Alonzo is a great defender who finished
at the rim tonight as well he has all season. Deion is another very defender
who is a good shooter and player and good all‑around player. Terry I think is
just so dynamic, he has such a big body and he's so versatile and can do so
many things.  
Those guys are the cornerstone of our program for a few years; the more
experiences like this, the more confidence they will have and the better we'll
be.  
  
Q. How much is it to have those days off to regroup, to set a goal and say,
this is it, pretty much.  
COACH MOONEY: Yeah, it's very important. The season can grind you down. Our
last week of the season, we played VCU on Thursday and followed to Dayton on
Saturday, so that was a tough stretch, but it did give us an extra day coming
into the conference tournament.  
I don't know how much teams are practicing on the floor, live things right
now, but for us we are trying to get on the floor and only do the critical
things on the floor to keep our guys off their legs; so the extra time was
beneficial.  
  
Q. Coming in off a four ‑game losing streak, lost some close games, how
encouraged are you to see the team play so well, and did you have any concerns
that it was just going to be hard for them to sort of finish out what's been a
little bit of a disappointing season with some adversity?   
COACH MOONEY: I thought‑‑ I think it was a rough end to the season. Our guys,
we didn't have any practices with the guys packing it in and there was no
energy. I think we feel like we have good basketball left in us and we have
some good guys.  
When they accept that responsibility and are aggressive, that puts us in a
good position to win games.  
  
Q. You were in the locker room at the halftime, were you aware of the award
John O'Connor received for his outstanding contributions to A ‑10 scholar,
student athlete?   
COACH MOONEY: Is that right? I am not surprised by that, Paul, I'm really not
surprised.  
  
Q. None of us were. And turning to a more serious topic, when you have gone
back and looked at the most recent game against VCU, you had sort of the upper
hand for much of that game. Have you pinpointed where it got a way and what
you need to do to keep that from happening tomorrow night, and a second part,
a neutral court, a bigger arena, some of the advantages VCU normally has
present will not be there, will that help you guys?  
COACH MOONEY: To the second one, I don't think that will have much impact on
the game.  
On the first question, when I read the recap of the game, it said VCU, an 18‑3
run in the second half, and that was over probably five or six minutes. So I
think we missed opportunities when we were up by 11 to pull away, and we
missed opportunities as they cut into the lead to steady the ship. Of course,
they deserve all the credit. Their aggressiveness and their pressure obviously
has an impact on almost every game.  
So I really look at it that we have to take advantage of our opportunities.
The pressure presents problems, especially in a tournament format for every
team and for all of your ball handlers but I do think that we can take
advantage of some opportunities and hopefully the familiarity will benefit us
in terms of scouting and not having as much time to prepare for the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the impact that Alonzo has when he plays like this?
And second question, how is Deion?  
COACH MOONEY: Yes, Alonzo's impact on the game is tremendous. You know, he's
so fast and active and long and can do so many things well. You know, for
Alonzo, I really think it boils down to confidence. I mean, he has to kind of
fine tune his game a little bit more by for the most part, it comes done to
confidence, and he can be such a dominant presence on the floor, especially
defensively. So yeah, it makes us‑‑ it makes us really, really good when he's
aggressive.  
I think Deion is okay. He went down pretty hard, so we are going to check him
out and make sure that he's good to go tomorrow. But I don't have an update on
that yet.  
  
Q. You know VCU is going to full ‑court press all the time, can you talk
about playing them a day after a game‑‑ you have a 20‑point lead tonight, can
maybe help you out tomorrow?   
COACH MOONEY: We're obviously expecting the pressure, and that probably
creates more of a problem because of the no prep time or no rest time. But it
is a tournament that we're excited to play the game.  
What was the second part? Oh, tonight. We tried to keep Kendall out and then
he's our best foul shooter. So we tried to keep him out of the game to have
him more fresh for tomorrow. But of course we missed a couple foul shots and
needed to put him back in unfortunately, but hopefully not too taxing on him.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

FORDHAM  70  
GEORGE MASON - 67

  
TOM PECORA: You know our focus to the game was controlling the backboards, and
then protecting the paint, especially off the dribble and post ups. So being
able to out‑rebound them plus eight was huge for us; only having seven
turnovers, we got a lot of shot attempts up, as they did. I think we are very
similar teams. Both teams, you look at the offensive rebound numbers, we had
24 offensive rebound, they had 17. Two teams playing really, really hard and
that's the way it should be in March.  
And, look, I have tremendous respect for Paul. He's a dear friend and that
program, they are a very proud program, and that's a good win, because trust
me, they are as good as any 11‑win team in the country. They have played a lot
of close games in this conference and lost a lot of really close, tough
basketball games, so we have great respect for them.  
But a career night for Ryan Canty. He's been coming on, getting better and
better, he had 19 rebounds and we needed just about every one of them. Our
foul shooting slipped on us, and I think we were top in the league, or second,
top team in the league all year. We missed a few down the stretch and needed
to make and could have got some separation.  
I'm very proud of them. I wrote on the board before, "Only courage can secure
victory: And I thought we were very courageous. We played without fear and we
continued to do the things we needed to do.  
  
Q. For Bryan and Brandon, what does it mean for you guys to come into this
building where you grew up and know your season is going another game?  
BRYAN SMITH: It was a great feeling because a lot of people that were not able
to come to the Forum and watch me play and came today and played a good game,
so it was a good game for them to watch me play.  
BRANDEN FRAZIER: I would just say it's good to be here. I grew up down the
block from here, a lot of my friends and family got to see me play. And I just
think playing in Brooklyn was good for our team, for our fans to come down and
just we heard a lot of people in the crowd rooting us on, so I think that
helped a lot today.  
  
Q. BRANDEN and Ryan and Bryan, what were your thoughts when that final shot
was in the air?  
BRYAN SMITH: Miss it‑‑ (players speaking together)  
BRANDEN FRAZIER: Just hope it don't go in. Got a good look, too‑‑ got to do a
second‑‑ and miss it.  
  
Q. Ryan, 16 rebounds in your last game, 9 today, seven on the offensive
glass, talk about how you were able to position yourself?  
RYAN CANTY: I just try to crash the boards. Every time I see the ball go up, I
just basically run at the rim and try to see the ball hitting off the rim and
go where the ball is and just grab it, every one I can.  
TOM PECORA: I use the term with Ryan, very often in football ‑‑ we use a lot
of football terms because they are aggressive and we always say, just blow up
the play; get in like a linebacker might and blow up the play. So when he gets
to the rim, you see Bobby is flying and he's a great rebounder.  
  
Q. Ryan, over the past four games, double ‑digit rebounds, when did this
monster finally come out of you where you're playing tough and you're playing
as hard as you can out there on the floor like we didn't see earlier in the
year?   
RYAN CANTY: The first time I remember, it clicked when we were playing at BCU,
something clicked in my head, basically, earlier in the year and last year, I
was following a lot but now I just control myself and keep the same energy and
keep attacking the boards the same way. If I can stay out of foul trouble,
I'll play with that intensity all game so that's basically the key to it.  
  
Q. For Bryan and BRANDEN, does the team really feed off of Ryan when he is
hustling, grabbing rebounds? Not getting put ‑backs? Is that something you
really feed off?   
BRANDEN FRAZIER: Yeah, I think we feed off that. I mean, Ryan, as you see, he
enjoys doing that, like you see him jumping everywhere.  
He's a jumper, like he likes jumping around all the time so for him to go out
there and get 19 rebounds and he enjoys doing that, like some people just
enjoy scoring and getting assists, he enjoys rebounding. That's what he likes
to do.  
So I think we feel his energy and we just know that ball going up, he's going
to get it‑‑ he brings a lot of energy for us.  
RYAN CANTY: And he's like always the heart and soul of the team; like he's
always pumped up, he gets the team and the crowd going, and that's great for
the team.  
  
Q. You had a lot of good wins during your tenure but how does it feel to get
a win in the A ‑10 tournament?  
TOM PECORA: It's nice to be in the postseason. You see what we've been
through, every win is special. I've learned to appreciate that.  
It came a little easier a few years back for me, and right now, I think it was
important‑‑ it's not only important for‑‑ it's important for Fordham. It's a
big step for us, and we're right there in rebuilding this. We are so close.
We're right there. One‑possession game with GW at home, one‑possession game
with La Salle at home, and these are good basketball teams. We're right there.
So for them to win this, it's another step in our growth process, and you
know, now we are going to prepare for Dayton.  
I said to them in practice on Monday, I said‑‑ and you know, us coaches, we
are always trying to motivate and I just said, well, we lost to GW by a
possession. What do you think GW is thinking going into this tournament?  
And they say, well, they are thinking about winning it‑‑ I said exactly right.
We just played them to the wire. Why are we not thinking about winning.  
And Tuesday, I gave them the Jostens book that every coach gets sent to pick
out rings. I always keep it in the drawer, and I showed it to them Tuesday and
I said to ‑‑ Frazier, guys, let's sit down and pick out rings, because we are
going to win the tournament.  
Now, someone could write a book, but you just always are looking to get them
motivated and for them to understand, look, they are part of history tonight.
They did something special and at halftime, they said, we're in Brooklyn; this
is a home game, we are not in Virginia, let's go out and play. And we couldn't
make a shot, we shot 25percent. But I think it was a great effort game, and
you can win a lot of games playing with great effort like that.  
  
Q. You guys attempted I think one free throw in the first half, and maybe 20
more in the second; did you say something at halftime?  
TOM PECORA: No, I think they were fouling us a bunch near the end obviously
and that got us up. I think the offensive rebounds led to a lot of free
throws. I thought there were a couple possessions where we could have had
separation and we took it to the rim soft.  
So during the time‑out I kind of talked to them about doing everything hard to
get it the rim hard, gain the respect of the officials, you go to the foul
line, so maybe a little more of that when I watch the tape, I'll see. But if
you can shoot more free throws than your opponent, and once again, we missed
11 free throws, that's crazy for us. And to have that many offensive rebounds,
you're going to win a lot of games.  
  
Q. In terms of effort, was this the team's best game of the season just on
an effort standpoint?  
TOM PECORA: I think the last few have been. I think it's really clicked in a
little bit. A lot of it has to do with Ryan Canton. We lost six or seven games
in the middle of the year, and that was a blow because he is; he's like a big
St. Bernard. He's always bouncing around in practice. He's always laughing.
He's a little cooky but that's okay, 19 rebounds, I can live with cooky.  
He's got great bloodlines: Both his parents played at Providence, and his
grandfather was a great player at Harvard; so he oozes potential and he's
finally coming around in his junior year, and so I'm excited he's a junior and
not a senior.  
  
Q. What does it mean for your New York kids to finally get that step up and
feel like they are on top of the world after that win?  
TOM PECORA: I think it's, once again, for all of them, but the New York kids
especially, especially Branden, he's a senior, but Bryan Smith‑‑ they are
pretty highly recruited kids. Branden was going to come with me, and then when
I came to Fordham he came with me and showed great loyalty. So I have got a
place in my heart for this kid for the rest of my life; he's special.  
Bryan Smith could have gone to a lot of other places. His dad is an alum, and
he chose Fordham; and it took guts for these guys to choose Fordham because we
were really coming out of a rough spot. So I have a wonderful appreciation for
that.  
And I think it's special for the local kids because they could say to people,
see, I told you we were going to get this thing going. And maybe this is a
step in the right direction; and for all of them, they have had a rough year.
We have lost a lot of close games. We lost some games early in the year when
we were up and gave away leads.  
I mean, we practiced the last two weeks as hard as we have ever practiced, and
I said to my assistants, we have not lost them, and that's really important,
because there's a lot of kids when you're 9‑20, you're just going to go
through the motions every day in practice but they have really been practicing
hard and I'm very proud of their effort for that and that speaks to their
character and their substance.  
  
Q. At the end, the first foul, did you want to give it at that time? Was it
a little too early? And for the second foul, I know you wanted John to cover
Holloway and he still ended up somehow getting the ball. The first foul, was
it too early?  
TOM PECORA: You're playing with fire there. And I've been converted, because
you can lose the game fouling. We almost did. You know, if it goes one way or
the other, you know‑‑ but we practice it, and we practice faking and then
fouling, because guys are going to try to shoot the ball, so you want to fake
it the one time to see if they just throw up a crazy shot in hopes of getting
fouled and getting free throws.  
So we tried to do that in the backcourt, might have been a little early, but
you know what, it's the second‑‑ I thought Branden did a great job of press
offense of getting the ball and Bryan Smith, they are both very good free
throw shooters, so you know, I'm going to live with it. I think you've got to
foul, because the teams are just so good.  
I mean, Allen made that three up top and we were in our 3‑3 defense where he
was basically shooting about 17 percent from three against and he came down
and just drilled and Branden for some reason backed off him. I'm going to keep
fouling. I just hope I'm in that situation every game the rest of the weekend.  
  
Q. When did you convert?  
TOM PECORA: During the season. You know, I did it once years ago against
Drexel when I was at Hofstra, and they missed a shot like that, tipped it out,
missed a three, tipped it out, missed a second three, and I said, I'm never
going this again because we were only up two at the time.  
I was like, I almost lost this game‑‑ but watching it more and seeing how well
teams‑‑ and everyone runs great stuff now against the zones and all of that.
And then, you know, at home, I might not do it. But at Rose Hill, we have a
huge advantage, we might not do it at home. But if you're on the road; if
you're a team that you think you can win in overtime‑‑ there's a lot of things
that go into it, but most of the time we are going to foul.

### [Byron Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26623)

### [Paul Hewitt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14139)

### [Johnny Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26624)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

FORDHAM  70  
GEORGE MASON - 67

  
PAUL HEWITT: Just want to thank Byron, J2 and Sherrod, our seniors for all the
effort they put into our program over the last three years.  
You know, we inherited them but they were really, really loyal to Mason,
played extremely hard for us. Obviously this year was not the type of year we
hope for them going out the door, but the last two years, 24 wins and 22 wins;
and this year we competed, we battled. Just didn't get some breaks that we
needed down the stretch, but again I appreciate everything they have done.  
Also want to congratulate Tom and his team and wish them luck tomorrow
afternoon.  
  
Q. Byron, there was at least one late three, did you feel like that you
finally got some of the momentum shifted when you hit that three late? It was
sort of a slow climb for you guys to get back in the game.  
BYRON ALLEN: I just looked up at the clock and I realized how much time was
left, and my senior year, I mean, it's all‑or‑nothing at that point. So I
wasn't really worried about the shot. I was just trying to make sure I was
staying confident in my game and went down with the momentum and just slowly
kept chopping their lead down and comeback.  
  
Q. I noticed that you changed your shoes a few times during the game. Were
you having trouble with your feet?  
BYRON ALLEN: My shoe ripped so that's why I had to take it off and I went to
my shoes that I walk around in and they were too‑‑ they didn't feel right, and
then I went to other shoes and they were the ‑‑ (indiscernible) size and I
went back to the orange shoes, just said, I'm going to have to play through
it, doesn't matter.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the performance of Canty on the glass and how much
that affected your game planning and the way you guys played?  
JOHNNY WILLIAMS: Yeah, his rebounding was pretty great but it was our fault.
That's one of our main focus, rebounding, and he took it out of the game by
doing that and he's a great player. But that's one thing that we‑‑ I mean,
that's one thing we focus on all year is rebounding, and today they beat us on
that.  
BYRON ALLEN: Yeah, our focuswas keep them off the boards, because we knew they
send four or five people to the glass, they don't really give back. But he did
a great job on the glass today and held his team and he held them out a lot on
the boards, so it was a good job by Fordham.  
  
Q. There were times you got really close. Why weren't you able to get it
over the hump? What was the difference in getting the lead?  
PAUL HEWITT: Just shots didn't fall. Obviously the rebounding was a major
issue. I thought we did a pretty good job on the initial shot.  
And one of the things we did talk about quite a bit was just we're going to
make them miss the first shot where you have to get that second shot, you
can't let them get a second shot and I think sometimes it deflated us quite
honestly and especially the last four or five minutes, we had some really good
shots and the ball just skimmed right off our fingers and we didn't grab it.  
  
Q. You talked about the rebounding, seemed to be the difference in the game.
Was it a matter of, you said a couple of balls came off fingertips, was it a
matter of Fordham was out ‑efforting or putting a few too many men back at the
boards or was it the kids just not blocking out?   
PAUL HEWITT: Offensive rebounding is an effort category, so I thought we were
playing hard. We had 17 offensive rebounds and I'm sure Tom wasn't pleased
with that number.  
You know, sometimes, that's your strategy and you send‑‑ it's like blitzing a
quarterback, you send more guys than linemen. Were them that I thought we
should have grabbed; there were a couple times we broke down in terms of box
out assignments, sure, but that was more the guards than the bigs. I thought
our bigs were battling pretty hard.  
But again we had 17 offensive rebounds and played pretty hard. That's a sign
of a team really giving great effort, but their effort obviously was
outstanding as well, so I don't take anything away from our guys but at the
same time you have to credit Fordham with a great effort on the boards.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 16, 2014

  

### [Rodney Hood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25967)

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Jabari Parker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26129)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Virginia  72  
Duke - 63

  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I want to congratulate Virginia. It was an amazingly
physical game. Both teams wanted it so hard, so much. They were poised. They
finished better than we did. Obviously, they got to the foul line a helluva
lot better than we did. And they're just a good team.  
And we have a good team. Our kids fought like crazy. It's their third game in
40 hours. We had a hard time finishing and getting to the foul line when we
didn't.  
The heart of our team was great. Our kids played with great heart. So going
forward into the NCAA Tournament, I think these three games have really helped
us get on to another level. I'm excited about our group and proud of them. Any
questions?  
  
Q. Mike, when you watched Jabari in the second half, it seemed like he was
demanding the ball more and kind of trying to take that role of taking over.
Do you feel like that's a point in his development?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: No, he's done that. He took 24 shots and only three free
throws. Part of his development is, when he makes those moves, is to finish,
get fouled, not get fouled, you know what I mean. I mean, his should be a
combination. Jabari played his butt off. He was relentless in trying to get
things in.  
We were almost there. We were right there, in spite of not being able to
finish. So it's disappointing. But Jabari, I mean, that's what we want him to
do.  
  
Q. For Jabari and Rodney, can you talk about what it was like to face that
Virginia defense?  
MODERATOR: Jabari?  
JABARI PARKER: I think we kind of just rushed. We were just so anxious to get
on the offensive end once we tried to get down and get their momentum on my
side. But I could have did a better job myself, gathering myself and getting
to the free throw line, but it didn't help me out.  
RODNEY HOOD: I think they're a really good defensive team. But at the same
time, I think we got a lot of looks. Some is going to haunt me tonight, but I
think we got the ball in the paint. We played, we shared the ball. They're a
great defensive team, but I think we got enough looks to change the game and
we just didn't finish.  
  
Q. Mike, I was curious, in both halves, it was a very long time before you
even attempted a three. Was that a function of defense or a game plan thing?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: They take it away a lot. We felt driving the ball and trying
to get to the foul line was the way to go. If you drove and kicked, then you
would get a better three‑point shot because they're a heck of a defensive
team. So actually, it was the best that we've driven the ball for a long time
today, because you have to drive through a strong defense. And our guys were
doing that.  
  
Q. Jabari, what is it about Akil Mitchell that makes him such a good one
‑on‑one defender and what are the challenges of going up against him today?  
JABARI PARKER: He's athletic and he anticipates a lot on the defensive end. I
kind of read him in the second half and kind of shied away and put him off the
hook and I didn't listen to Coach like he was telling me to not settle. I
started settling, but I could have just kept on going. He's a good defensive
player and he should be one of the greatest defensive players in Virginia
history.  
  
Q. Coach, can you explain that technical in the first half?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I have no clue. None.  
  
Q. The video showed you throwing a pen?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, but you can throw a clipboard too. I didn't do it in
reaction to anything. I can hit my head on the floor. I can do a handstand. I
can tumble, as long as it's not a reaction to anybody.  
There's no way that there should be a technical foul on that. I mean, that was
ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. Shameful. Shameful.  
  
Q. Coach, this particular opponent, it seems to symbolize a lot of the same
things you've been kind of preaching at Duke for a long, long time. The
teamwork, the unselfishness, the conditioning, the defense. Can you just
elaborate on what you see in UVA along those lines?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I see all the things that you just said. I mean, they did
it. You answered your question well. I mean, I admire them. I think they're a
helluva basketball team. They've had a great season, great kids, unselfish.
They're one of the best teams in the country. They've done that in a
consistent manner.  
They've been healthy too. So they haven't had bumps in the road and so they
keep getting a little bit better all the time.  
  
Q. Jabari, with all the state titles you won in high school, just dealing
with a postseason loss, how does it feel and how will that kind of change your
approach of going forward, knowing what this feeling is like?  
JABARI PARKER: Now, zero and zero, you got to move on. I don't get a second
chance anymore. The point of emphasis has to come on me and Rodney. We have to
lead our team. That's what it's going to take to win.  
In the past, I lost city championships, but I changed my mentality to get a
state championship. I know it's going to be twice as hard.  
  
Q. Jabari, there were a couple of different points in the second half where
it seemed like you were about to take the game over and they always had an
answer, mostly in the person of Joe Harris. What did you think of his
performance and how did he respond to some of the things you did out there?  
JABARI PARKER: As a whole, UVA did a real good job in executing their offense.
They're a good team, a great team. They should be really good coming into the
tournament and I applaud them. There are some things I could have done better
out there.  
  
Q. Mike, you've spoken out about Harris in the past. What do you see in
Brogdon? How much difference has he made for the team?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Brogdon's first team all league player. He's steady, kind of
unflappable, and so strong. Strong mentally and obviously strong physically.
He and Harris are two kids that‑‑ they're two men. They don't make many
mistakes and you can count on them on every possession.  
Those two and Mitchell give you three of the better players in the country on
one team.  
  
Q. Mike, you've been pretty outspoken over the years about the respect that
the ACC gets. This is now three years in a row you've had three different
teams, Florida State, Miami, and now Virginia have won this championship. What
do you think that will do, different teams other than Carolina and Duke
winning this, maybe to broaden people's perspective and awareness of the
league?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Hasn't done anything yet. Should I tell Roy the two of us
should keep losing? I don't think it comes from us. I think it comes from all
of you who cover our league to make sure that the league is given the respect
that it deserves.  
It's not up to the coaches.  
MODERATOR: Any other questions? Thank you.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Thanks.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Virginia  72  
Duke - 63

  
COACH BENNETT: We need to get on the road because the weather's getting bad so
this has got to be short and sweet because we've got to get back.  
But obviously, it was a heck of a game. I told these guys in the locker room
just now, to me, the true joy is in how they played when the ball was tipped
between the lines, how hard they played. How well they played. Not perfect.
How they defended, how they moved the ball and tried to outlast through the
game. And that's it.  
We'll celebrate all this stuff later on, but that's what I liked, and you want
to play good ball now heading into the NCAA Tournament. So it's great. For
these guys, who have been through a lot, it's a nice feeling for sure.  
  
Q. Akil, down here to your left, I guess, can you just discuss the
challenges of playing Jabari Parker man ‑to‑man? What did you try to do and
how do you feel you played against him today?   
AKIL MITCHELL: He's going to be a good player. He's special, strong, quick,
athletic. He can shoot the ball, put it on the floor. I made sure I stayed
down, kept my balance, tried to stay in front.  
COACH BENNETT: He had 15 rebounds. I didn't know he had that many. Wow.  
  
Q. It was a one ‑possession game for a lot of the second half and your team
slowly but surely built that lead. How proud were you of the composure of your
team?   
COACH BENNETT: We kept talking about don't get sped up. Make them guard you
and make them earn on the other end. That's what they did. That's what I meant
when I said to see that unfold is what it would take. And again, they missed
some bunnies. They did some things. But we had to earn this against that kind
of team and that kind of program.  
Yep, that made it very gratifying.  
  
Q. Joe, you played in front of a lot of great crowds at JPJ this year, but
did you expect this outpouring of support today? What was it like on the court
hearing that?  
JOE HARRIS: That was unbelievable, to have the support that we had. We were
kind of joking around when we came in, where are the Duke fans. All we could
see was orange when we drove over here. It's special to share it with the
fans. They deserve it. The city of Charlottesville deserves an ACC tournament
title. They've been extremely loyal and very supportive ever since I've gotten
to the school here.  
  
Q. Tony, talk about the history angle of this first time in 37 years.  
COACH BENNETT: So long. I think I told you that in the last press conference,
that Wally Walker said we want some company with that team in '76. Just like
what Joe said. Faithful fans. I think they appreciate how these guys have gone
about doing it. The way they play, the kind of character they are off the
court, and they've watched these two grow up.  
To get that‑‑ I've not been to many finals. I went to the one in '95. I don't
know if it's always this charged in here or this electric with the crowd noise
and the atmosphere, but it sure felt special and that's a big shout‑out to the
Cavalier fans. Because that was‑‑ when I heard UVA when I walked out on the
floor, the chant, I said are we in John Paul Jones Arena or in Greensboro? It
felt like a home crowd at times. Duke got it going, but that was a special
crowd.  
  
Q. For the seniors, Akil and Joe, what are your emotions and what were they
as the final seconds were ticking down and the fans were going crazy? How good
did it feel?  
AKIL MITCHELL: It felt amazing. It's what you dream of. It's what we wanted to
do. Now we've still got work to do. That's all I'm really focused on now. But
for the last couple minutes of the game, you just, you just want to close it
down and start to celebrate.  
JOE HARRIS: Yeah, I would say we've experienced a lot in our time here and
this is very rewarding for the program to get to this level. This is what we
wanted to do when we first came here, and this is a special feeling. But at
the same time, we only had a short glimpse to celebrate this.  
We always talk about how we'll celebrate our season, our careers and all that
later on at some point because we still have a lot of unfinished business.  
  
Q. Malcolm, you're about to play one of the biggest games of your career.
Last night, how do you even go to sleep? How do you compose yourself to come
out here and play so well and score 23 points and match Parker? The biggest
game in at least the last decade or two for UVA.  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I try not to let our opponents‑‑ I try not to let my mindset
depend on our opponents. I try to keep my mindset steady no matter who we
play. I know I'm playing on a really good team. I'm playing for a really good
coach. I just have faith that things will work out as they may and not try to
get too up or too down for certain games.  
  
Q. Coach in the second half, there were a couple points where Jabari almost
took over the game and you always had an answer specifically from Joe. What
did you think about those stretches and how important some of the buckets Joe
had were?  
COACH BENNETT: Big‑time players making big‑time plays. When Akil was off, out,
and that's not a slap in the face to anybody else, but you could see he could
get going. They started running a little four‑to‑five ball screen or
five‑to‑four and they took advantage of that.  
You have to answer in a game like this. I'd love to say we had this stuff
diagrammed that we got the shots we needed. The players made the plays. Joe,
Malcolm, Akil, the rebounds, the plays were significant. Just watching how
hard Joe was moving off the ball, I saw it in the Florida State game
yesterday. That was good to see.  
He's got to feel, I said that to you guys before, when to step up, when to be
assertive and when to let it come. I think that's a strength of his.  
  
Q. Coach, when you think of the things that you value in basketball, whether
it was player, coach, has there ever been a group you've been associated with
that reflects those things any better than this?  
COACH BENNETT: They're as good as it gets. We've still got work to do. I've
been a part of a lot of good teams. I don't want to slight those. I saw that
the year I was a volunteer manager for my dad's Final Four team. That's how
they came together.  
Here's what's unique about these guys that's different. And we still have work
to do. How they've sustained it from start to finish. Conference play to now.
That's different. And so that, I take my hat off to knowing there's still
stuff in front of us. That's what I appreciate.  
  
Q. Tony, you talked about there's more work to do. Have you been able to
reflect at all during these last 15 minutes about this accomplishment or are
you just trying not to do that at all?  
COACH BENNETT: Definitely enjoyed it. I told you I loved the game, but we'll
relive all this stuff later. We need rest. We need to get rested up and ready
to go for what's next.  
Yeah, that moment when you're on the floor, you see your wife, you see your
parents, you see the joy in these guys' eyes and hearts. That's gratifying as
anything. I soak that up without a doubt. I gave thanks certainly for all
that's happened, as I said, through the tough times, through the good times.  
  
Q. Coach, you touched on this a little bit, I think, but when you look at
the team that had the two technicals and the team that was able to hold on in
the end, do you feel like your team was more poised and, if so, why?  
COACH BENNETT: I don't know more. Our guys played with great composure. We
needed that. I don't know what happened with the technicals. I didn't see it.
But the mark of a team to win a championship and a conference tournament, you
have to play with that kind of poise, composure down the stretch.  
We even shrugged off missing some free throws. But yeah, they certainly did
that, and I like that because you need that in tournament play. It's so
important.  
They haven't gotten flustered. That's been a trademark of them all year.  
  
Q. Tony, Anthony Gill put tremendous pressure on Duke around the basket. How
large was he in the game plan coming in? Did you think he would need to play
well?  
COACH BENNETT: He got to the line 17 times. Yeah, he was really on the glass.
He was getting it, attacking, and he has that ability. We saw that in
practices last year. We knew he'd be important because he could get going that
way, and he draws fouls. I said that all year. He just knows how to get
contact and draw fouls.  
  
Q. Tony, first of all, did your dad stick around for today?  
COACH BENNETT: He did. He told my wife he wasn't coming in the morning and
told her about 30 minutes later, "I am going to come." I didn't know if he was
going to be there or not. We left him a ticket. To start the game, I saw him a
couple times put his hands in his head when we missed a free throw or
something.  
I'm glad he was there. I know he loves these guys for what they stand for and
he's going to appreciate how hard‑nosed and tough they were.  
  
Q. You were talking about history a little while ago, but I'm not sure if
you're aware of it or not. This is the first time in the history of this
conference, 61 years, that you've gone three straight years with a non ‑North
Carolina team winning the tournament championship. With Florida State winning,
Miami and now you guys, if that helps the perception of the league outside of
the geographic footprint that it's more than just Carolina and Duke?   
COACH BENNETT: I mean, I hope so because there's great teams besides those
storied programs. With Louisville coming in next year, and the teams that
have‑‑ are in this year, it's a monster. It really is. So that's why to get it
and, yeah, I didn't know that for the last three years. Thinking about it, it
is. That's special but, it shows you the stranglehold those schools have had
on it. Our job is to pry it away.  
  
Q. Joe, I know you want to celebrate later, but what does winning the MVP of
this tournament mean? Nobody from Virginia's done that since Wally Walker.  
COACH BENNETT: Northwest guy too.  
JOE HARRIS: Yeah. He was in Seattle. I didn't put much thought in it. I didn't
expect it or anything like that at all. I was more concerned about trying to
get the tournament championship. That was my main concern. All the individual
stuff, that's just‑‑ I mean, I don't put much thought into it.  
  
Q. Akil, talk about the last time you went back in on Jabari and I think
Coach Bennett referred to it that said ‑‑ that he'd been going off there for a
while. Did you tell yourself you had to shut him down?   
AKIL MITCHELL: I mean, there was no pressure on me to shut him down. My
teammates, they knew that I was capable of the job and they kept telling me to
just do my best and then lock him up and the kind of stuff my team is supposed
to do. I just went out there and gave my best.  
You know, he missed a couple of contested shots and from there, I think I was
able to frustrate him.  
  
Q. I'll piggyback off that. Did you have a specific defensive game plan, you
personally, for Jabari or do you play the same kind of defense no matter who
you're facing?  
AKIL MITCHELL: It's got to be the same defense against everybody. With a guy
like that, so aggressive and so skilled, you have to be more on your toes.
You've got to be a little bit more ready for the jump shot and the drive. So I
just try to be in two different places at one time, and I don't know. I felt
like my teammates had my back and I just gave it my all.  
  
Q. What's this team's mindset going into the NCAA Tournament? Do you feel
like you've maybe proven you can be a one seed in a couple hours and how will
you guys handle the next week in getting ready for the NCAA tournament?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I think we would, of course, like to be a one seed like
anybody. I don't think our focus is really on that. The fact that we're going
in the NCAA regardless, it means a lot to us, and we're going to focus on
going there and competing against whoever we play. That's really the mindset
we have going on now. We're going to try to enjoy this tonight but move on
tomorrow and get back to work.  
  
Q. Malcolm, what was the team's mindset in the last two or three minutes?
You had the lead, but it seemed like you were still looking to score. I'm
thinking of your layup that made it 66 ‑60 with a minute left. What were you
thinking out there? What was the game plan at that point?   
MALCOLM BROGDON: The game plan was to take care of the ball. In that
situation, you still want to remain aggressive. But we had to get stops. Every
close game we play in, it comes down to getting stops in our defense and I
feel like that's what we thrive on doing and that's what we did tonight.  
MODERATOR: Any other questions? Thank you.  
COACH BENNETT: Thank you.  
JOE HARRIS: Thank you.  
AKIL MITCHELL: Thank you.  
MALCOLM BROGDON: Thank you.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Duke  75  
NC State - 67

  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It's better if I get hurt than you.  
MODERATOR: Whenever you're ready, Coach.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: We beat a heck of a basketball team today. We played very
well. The first half, neither team could stop one another, and, I mean, guys‑‑
look, they're really good. And Warren is a great, great player. But their
other guys are really good. Barber hurt us a lot in the first half.  
In the second half, we just played better defense. They shot about 70 percent
from the floor in the first half and in the second half about 35 percent. And
we made some big hustle plays. Thornton made one of the biggest plays of the
game. We were up by seven right at half court for the loose ball, and it put
us up by nine. I think that was the score.  
Then Jabari made a big play to force a time‑out before that, to give us a‑‑
thought it really kind of energized us defensively to make those two plays
defensively.  
We were poised. We missed free throws, but I think a lot of that had to do
with, one, just being tired. I know they're tired. They've played three
straight games. We're tired. We played the late game last night. So the fact
that we're getting to the line was good. We couldn't close the door on them by
missing those free throws.  
Open for questions if you want to ask the players.  
  
Q. You just mentioned T.J. Warren. He kept them in it in the first half.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Barber did too. I think Barber was as big for them in the
first half as was Warren. Warren's a great player. I mean, he's not a good
player. He's a great player. He's had one of the special years that a player
has had in our conference. He's terrific.  
As a result of all the stuff you have to do, you have to be aware of him. It
opens it up for his teammates. He's not a selfish player either. He's a great
player. He's a great player. I'm so impressed with him.  
Rodney did a good job on him, just to keep him to 21, although he had to take
a lot of shots to get there.  
  
Q. You jumped my question, actually.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: This is part of what I'm doing. I'm going through stuff like
this to try to anticipate. My wife says I do this all the time to her. Would
you like to meet her? So now you have something in common.  
  
Q. If you and Jabari would talk about how impressed you were by the ‑‑  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Together, would you like to listen to us?  
  
Q. Sure, whatever works. Then, Rodney, if you could talk about if you had a
certain approach to guarding him, or if you kind of just went out and played
normal defense for yourself.  
RODNEY HOOD: I wanted to contest him. In the first half he beat me a little
bit. I wanted to make him take tough shots. You can't contain a player like
that. Team‑wise, we did a great job in the second half of shrinking the floor
and making him see multiple people.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Rodney made a big adjustment. You can overcoach. We
overcoached our preparation. He was doing what we asked him to do and it
wasn't working. He said, "Coach, let me play him my normal way." That was
better.  
  
Q. Jabari, you obviously weren't guarding T.J. on a regular basis, but what
could you see what he did tonight and what were your impressions of his
performance?  
JABARI PARKER: Like Coach said, he's a real good player and one of the pivotal
roles on the team. He's going to be one of the top scorers offensively. We
wanted to put him in tough, tough situations because we knew that he can score
anywhere on the floor.  
  
Q. To the players, there are other coaches and other teams that really don't
put a lot of emphasis, as much emphasis on this tournament as the next
tournament. Now that you're in the finals, you've got a chance to win this
thing and put a banner up and everything, what does it mean to be in this
tournament and have a chance to win this thing?  
RODNEY HOOD: Every kid dreams of winning a championship. Especially this one.
It's a special tournament.  
We worked all year to get where we are now, and I think we're in a really good
spot. We're going up against a senior‑led Virginia team who is a great team,
had a great conference schedule. It's going to be a battle. We've dreamed of
being in this position and are ready for the fight.  
MODERATOR: Jabari.  
JABARI PARKER: Like Rodney said, we dreamed of this from the beginning of the
season. We had a couple of bumps and bruises in the midseason during
conference play where we knew it would be important for us to play in the
tournament.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Our school has valued their relationship, being part of the
ACC. I mean, it's evident for all these years the number of championships that
we've been fortunate enough to win. Each one is special. Each game is special.
I said that last night.  
For me, it will always‑‑ as long as I'm coaching, coaching an ACC game is an
honor, let alone coaching multiple games. If you have a chance to win a
championship in this league, it's the best.  
  
Q. Coach, I have two totally different questions for you. First of all, with
the national spotlight so much on Jabari, has it maybe put Rodney in the
shadow unfairly a little bit?  
The other question is on Virginia and the job that Tony Bennett has done in
reviving that program.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, Jabari's a guy that people want to be good, and there
are no jealousies because he's a good guy. And Rodney has his own place.
Rodney, to me, has a special quality. I mean, Rodney's as good a player as
there is. He played Warren head‑on.  
He's okay. He just wants to win. But also, Jabari just wants to win. And they
both know that. There's no jealousies at all, not just with these two guys but
with any of the guys on the team.  
You have a freshman and a guy who hasn't played before for our program come
in, guys have to adjust their roles who have been playing, and they all have
done that.  
As far as Tony, Tony's done a sensational job. What he's done is, has built a
program. It's not just a Virginia team. It's a Virginia program. It's based on
solid play and solid character. Those kids on that team have great character,
and it's obvious that they don't care who scores, as long as Virginia scores.  
  
Q. For either Mike or Rodney, I'm curious, what was the original strategy on
T.J. before you went back to just normal approach?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Just to high contest him where you didn't have contact with
him. And as a result, he got back‑doored a couple times. Our help wasn't
there. And then it was tougher for him to stay with him because he was playing
up.  
Then T.J. moves so well that Rodney just said, "Coach, I can stay‑‑ it's going
to be tough, but I can stay with him better if I do it our normal way."  
Q.For anybody up there, Cook and Sulaimon combined 30 points. How much tougher
does it make it for teams to guard you when you're getting contributions not
just from Jabari and Rodney but from that sort of‑‑ you know, four guys?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Obviously the last part of your question steered the
question to me. Quinn and Rasheed were terrific in the second half. Again,
these two guys are okay with them being terrific. If somebody's hot like
Rasheed really got it going start of the second half.  
Then Quinn came in and gave us a huge lift. When they went zone, Quinn hit
that three, I think that gave us a double‑digit lead. Either 11 or 13. I
forget what it was. But he handled that well. Quinn had a heck of a second
half in this game.  
  
Q. Coach, do you think tomorrow's winner should get a number one seed?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I don't know. I haven't followed that at all. I haven't. I
really don't think either team will care, because we're both in, we'll both
get treated very well, I would think, because of the seasons we both have had.  
  
Q. For the players, Coach talked about Virginia building a program. What
kind of challenge does Virginia present to you tomorrow?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: They haven't watched Virginia yet. I haven't watched them
either. I mean, we just got through with a helluva game, you know, so I wasn't
watching Virginia tape last night, and if we did win, apparently Pitt played
pretty well today too. So we played them two months ago. So it's a long time.  
We just know that they've been great all year and been as consistent a team as
there is in the country. We'll study them tonight and hopefully be ready by
1:00 tomorrow.  
  
Q. Mike, you've been pretty consistent all year, saying the ACC as a
conference deserves maybe more respect from the committee, more teams in the
tournament. When you look at a team like NC State, their season ‑long resume
puts them on the bubble. I imagine from a coach's perspective, it's hard to
think of a team playing as well as they are not getting into it.   
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I said to Mark at the end of the game, "I hope you guys get
in." I don't understand it, Luke, really. They won at Tennessee. They probably
should have beaten Syracuse twice. I think they've played a really good
schedule, and they've got one of the best players in the country.  
I don't think our conference‑‑ the fact that‑‑ I don't know. That there's
discussion about it, I don't understand it. I'm not against‑‑ I'll get in
trouble probably for saying it. Like the Atlantic 10, they're a really good
conference. I hear people saying there are six teams in there. Come on. I
mean, they're good, but put them in our conference and go through the meat
grinder that our conference has to go through.  
That's the thing. I don't know if there's a quantitative way of measuring the
degree of difficulty that there is in playing in this conference or like a Big
12. You've got to be on all the time.  
To me, Florida State's there. The only reason I'm saying that is Stan's in the
audience. He still has something to do over me. So he has hidden videos on me
so I got to say something nice about it.  
But really, Luke, our league should get more respect. The fact that Pitt comes
in here and people are saying they have to do something, come on. Come on,
man. I don't get it. The Clemson team we played last night is a heck of a
basketball team.  
But this team we played today is really good. I think Mark's done a fabulous
job with this team. And again, you watch Warren. Do any of those kids look
jealous? None. I mean, they got it going. They're a tough out, man. They're a
tough out. They'd be a tough out. I wouldn't want to play them in the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. Mike, you mentioned the better defense the second half. Is there a why to
that, whether it's effort or ‑‑  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: We talked more. I think these guys would tell you. Why don't
you guys answer the question. I'm talking. I've got verbal whatever.  
RODNEY HOOD: I think we played more connected on the defensive end. We made
some subtle adjustments. We knew T.J. was going to get his points. I mean,
he's that great of a scorer. We wanted to limit them on the defensive rebound.
We gave him some, but we did a good job of helping each other out, especially
in transition.  
  
Q. Jabari, last time you guys played UVA, you obviously opened each half
with a three pointer. Otherwise, it wasn't your best outing of the year. What
do you remember from that game?  
JABARI PARKER: All I just remember is us winning and Rasheed coming through
with a big play. A lot of games aren't going to be won by me but by my
teammates and they pull through. Hopefully, I can be there for them.  
MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2014

  

### [Mark Gottfried](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13796)

### [Jordan Vandenberg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26745)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Duke  75  
NC State - 67

  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Start off and say, you know, this is a tough one for us. My
guys are really disappointed. They really believed we could win, and they
played with great courage, I thought. We played really hard. We competed, and
we just came up a little short.  
I thought maybe we got tired in the second half. We didn't seem as fresh as we
have been. The three‑point shooting, I thought, was a difference. They stepped
up and made a number of them and we couldn't seem to make any.  
Happens like that, and I still think there's something special left for this
team, wherever that may be. I'm really proud of our guys. We're really
disappointed but really proud.  
  
Q. Mark, obviously, the committee judges these things over the whole season.
You have to feel like the way your team is playing now, there is no question
you deserve to be in the NCAA tournament.  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I think so, but I don't have a vote. I think when you look at
teams, you've got to look at a lot of things and I learned the hard way back
in, I think it was 2001, didn't schedule very good in the non‑league and we
learned our lesson.  
Even with this team, we lost all that we lost last year and played a really
good non‑conference schedule. Could have lightened it up. I didn't think that
was the right thing to do. I wanted to do what the committee has asked us to
do. The selection committee has asked you to play a tough non‑conference
schedule, take your team on the road, which we did at Cincinnati our second
game. Went to Tennessee and won.  
I think our league is a great league. I hope that we don't get penalized with
our record in the league when you play in a great league like ours. I
certainly think the committee‑‑ I've talked to a number of members different
years, not this year. I trust them. I do. I hope they really take a good look
at our team and see how much better we are than we were at the beginning.  
To win at Pitt late in the year, beat Syracuse. Honestly, if you win at Pitt,
beat Syracuse, beat Duke, hell, you're about a Final Four team by then. It's
hard to ask of anybody. We showed we certainly believe in the field of 68.  
  
Q. Jordan, Coach talked about how you guys might have gotten tired in the
second half. Did you feel like the legs were starting to go? If so, at what
point did they start feeling heavier and did that start kicking in?  
JORDAN VANDENBERG: I don't think that's the case. We played hard. We came up
short. There was no fatigue in us, really, even though we played two games all
right. You can't blame it on playing games. That's what we're here to do.  
We're not going to sit here and say we were tired, that's why we lost. We
missed a couple of defensive plays and came up just short. We looked after the
ball. I can't ask anything more from my teammates. Sure, we were a little
tired, but it has nothing to do with the fact that we lost today.  
  
Q. Mark, what did you see on their defensive strategy on T.J. in the second
half?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: They tried to full front deny him, deny his catch, eliminate
his touches. They made it hard for him to catch the ball, and it became hard
for him to get it where he wanted to get it. They did a great job of switching
when they needed to switch and denying when they needed to deny. They made the
game a little bit harder for him than some other teams have.  
MODERATOR: Any other questions? Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2014

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [Lamar Patterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24439)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Virginia  51  
Pittsburgh - 48

  
COACH DIXON: We'll get started here. Obviously, congratulations, Virginia.
We're extremely disappointed. We thought we had our chances to win the game
and thought our guys played well. Did a lot of great things. Obviously came
down to a lot of plays at the end of the game and they were able to pull away.
But obviously, one‑possession game could have gone either way.  
I'm proud of how our guys played. We got better this week. We're healthy and
playing our best basketball. I told our guys we have to continue to improve
this week and be ready for next week.  
  
Q. Jamie, did you see on the last layup you guys had, looked like there was
clearly ‑‑  
COACH DIXON: We just saw it on video. What can you do? What can you do? Just
watched it. Everybody saw it.  
  
Q. Coach, about 15, 20 seconds left, Robinson had a great steal, very good
defensive possession. Back to a one ‑point game. Talk us through the play and
kind of what the mindset was and how good that was for momentum in getting it
back to a one‑point game.   
COACH DIXON: That was the play he just asked about. Obviously, I can't comment
about anything else besides that. I mean, great. We just watched it on the
video. Great steal by James. Played great defense in front of him. All ball,
take it away, go the other way.  
Can't state the obvious.  
  
Q. Lamar, after scoring over 80 points the last two games and this one
today, what is it about Virginia's defense that makes it so tough, not just on
you but other teams, to keep them in the 50s?  
LAMAR PATTERSON: They're a solid team. They don't make very many mistakes, and
they just stick together and they're real solid. They sat into the paint and
they're a good team. That's why they won the conference.  
We expected that coming in, so we were ready for it.  
  
Q. Coach, every coach has at least a goal of having his team playing its
best going to the NCAA Tournament. Can you say that even in defeat about your
guys right now?  
COACH DIXON: I think so. We didn't shoot well. I think our offense wasn't
exactly what we needed to do, but we battled. We did some good things. When it
got down to the end, we got better defensively and got stops.  
It didn't go our way. We had three offensive fouls. We only had eight
turnovers, and three were offensive fouls. As far as taking care of the ball,
that's pretty good against a good defensive team. That's remarkable, actually,
when you think about it.  
So again, eight turnovers, three were offensive calls. I think we can improve
on our shot selection. That's something we've got to battle and our defense
can improve too. Every team can improve too at this point. We improved this
past week. That's the encouraging thing.  
We're healthy and we're playing our best basketball. We lost to a good team in
a one‑point, one‑possession game that obviously could have gone either way. So
I was proud of how our guys responded. But we're going to get better this week
too.  
  
Q. Jamie, Tony Bennett called this a blue collar knuckle buster, some kind
of thing like that. The number of fouls being a lot different than yesterday
aside, what did you think about how tough and physical the teams played
today?  
COACH DIXON: I thought it was two good teams, defensive teams. As I said, this
conference, there's been so many close games and I think we should not at all
be surprised. Obviously, Virginia won the conference, but we felt that we were
in here to win the game. So we were confident in ourselves and our ability and
we just came up short. But I think we learned a lot from it.  
  
Q. Coach, Talib Zanna has really stepped up in the past two games,
especially today offensively. Can you talk about how he kept you in it
offensively, especially in the first half?  
COACH DIXON: They were double‑teaming him. That's what they do. We were used
to that. I thought he played well out of it. We wanted to get the ball into
him and make plays out of the double‑team. We did to a certain degree. I wish
we could have done it more. But it's something that he made some great drives.
That one layup that somehow came out, I don't know how it came out. That was a
big play for us. But a great move by him.  
Just he's done a tremendous job on the glass, obviously. He's healthy now, you
know. That helps. I watched the film of us against Virginia last year when he
turned his ankle and was really ineffective. Two points, three rebounds.  
MODERATOR: Any other questions? Thank you.  
COACH DIXON: Thank you.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Virginia  51  
Pittsburgh - 48

  
COACH BENNETT: Obviously, hard‑fought game. It was physical. We went through a
bad‑‑ a long scoring drought at the end until I think Joe hit that nice layup
on the wrap. But we knew that coming in, it would be like that from that first
game with them. It was trying to stand and last and fight. Three games in a
row. Hopefully our depth and having that bye was significant in that game.  
MODERATOR: First question, front row.  
  
Q. Tony, Anthony has not always been automatic at the line, but given the
way he's been playing in this tournament, were you confident when he went up
for the one on one?  
COACH BENNETT: When he made both, you're saying, yeah. Because the last game,
he was 5 of‑‑ what was the last game? Didn't he make them all at the line? Or
5 of 6, yeah. And we've been shooting a ton of them. He had his rhythm and we
had a little‑‑ there's 0.5, and should he make it or miss. I told him to miss
it and then I caught myself and said, "Just make it." Either way it worked
out. Those were big free throws for sure.  
  
Q. Akil, on the late layup by Patterson, looked like you had contact with
him. Were you surprised you didn't hear a whistle?  
AKIL MITCHELL: A little bit. I wanted to contest it as best as I could. I
definitely didn't want to foul. But, you know, they let it go.  
  
Q. Hi, Tony. You've talked about your team taking advantage of
opportunities. Talk about the opportunity you have in front of you tomorrow.  
COACH BENNETT: Well, it's certainly a great opportunity. You know, to advance
into the championship game and, you know, this is what it's about. We're
fortunate to win an ACC regular season championship. I don't know if we call
it that in this league, but we won that and this is a huge opportunity. Such a
prestigious event.  
To play for that, again, preparation for the NCAA Tournament, all those things
are huge. It's been a while. There's only one, right? You can ask our
writers‑‑ that we've won, and I get reminded of that quite a bit. So it's a
chance to add a second one to it.  
  
Q. Tony, you had given the two fouls on Pitt's last possession. Did you
consider fouling again since you were up three and then what about Justin's
defense to block the shot?  
COACH BENNETT: Made a big block. No, we didn't. Did you watch the Maryland
game? So it's just‑‑ the studies have been done on that. I just felt
comfortable making him hit a tough, contested shot. That's kind of what we try
to build our defense on.  
It doesn't mean I wouldn't ever consider doing it. I felt with them not having
any time‑outs and not being set, they'd have to shoot or make a tough shot.  
You saw Justin unfold on that shot and that was obviously a great play. We
made some big defensive plays where they got in the lane on us defensively.
Whether it was blocks or just big plays that we had to come up with, you need
to do that. You need to make plays on offense. You need to make plays
defensively when it's one of those kinds of games.  
  
Q. For the players, seemed like each of the blocks that you and your
teammates had seemed to kill Pitt's momentum. Did it feel that way on the
floor?  
AKIL MITCHELL: I felt like every possession we wanted to try to gather
momentum. Whether if it was a turnover or just solid defense. That was our
mindset the whole game. So, you know, the blocks just help. But I guess we
tried to stay in position the whole game.  
MODERATOR: Joe?  
JOE HARRIS: Oh, yeah, just go off what Akil said. I don't know. I guess those
plays really do help. The blocks are a huge momentum boost. The fans get into
it and they seem to give you a surge there a little bit. From that
perspective, the blocks do help from momentum.  
COACH BENNETT: Joe doesn't block a lot of shots so he doesn't know how to
answer that question.  
  
Q. Coach talked about Justin's key block at the end. What was going through
your mind? Given how well you've played defense throughout the year and today,
how confident were you on the last possession you could make a stop?  
JOE HARRIS: I would say I was very confident in our ability to get a stop
there at the end. We pride ourselves in getting stops and being a
defensive‑minded team. When the last possession comes down to getting a stop,
I would say that man for man on our team, we would feel confident we would be
able to do that.  
  
Q. For Joe and Akil, just watching Justin's block, how much do you guys and
your team, your fan base feed off his energy and his emotion while you guys
are out there?  
AKIL MITCHELL: It's definitely necessary to have a guy like that just because
he gives us so much energy and if anybody's dead or anybody is kind of
flat‑footed. He gets us going. Gets on our nerves every once in a while, but
it's definitely necessary.  
  
Q. Tony, what went into the decision for your dad to come to the tournament?
We know he's not famous for attending your games.  
COACH BENNETT: Well, first he said, "If you win your first game, I'll come to
the second game in the tournament." I said, "Okay. Are you going to watch the
first game?" He said, "Yeah." I called him after the Florida State game. I
said, "Did you watch?" He said, "No." I said, "Okay, are you coming then
because we won?" He said, "No." He said, "If you make it to the championship,
I'll come." I said, "Fine." But he said, "I'm coming to the NCAA Tournament."  
He showed up at 9:00 this morning and I laughed because he delivered a
message. He said, "This is going to be"‑‑ he called it a "blue collar knuckle
buster." That was his term. We talked about it before the game.  
It truly was in terms of how physical. It was a blue collar game. The "blue
collar knuckle buster" is what he said. I'm glad he was there. Obviously, he's
had a huge influence on me. He has a good relationship with the guys,
especially Joe and Akil, who came in. I'm glad he got to see it. I don't know
if he'll be here tomorrow or not. This is 50/50.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned earlier that in your time at UVA, you're going to be
asked about 1976 enough times over 60 years with that being the ACC title for
the Cavaliers. Have you become like an unofficial authority on Wally Walker
and those guy s, given all of those mentions to you over the years?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, it's been a while so it's good we're having this
conversation right now. Obviously, what they did was special. Because of how
special the ACC tournament is. But it would be great to obviously put another
banner or have that to share with them.  
He said‑‑ actually, I got a text before we came. He said, "We want some
company." Wally sent me a text. "We want some company, being that only group."  
  
Q. For Joe, the basket you scored at the end when you made the cut that
Coach Bennett was talking about, would you walk us through that play? What did
you read on that? What did you see shaping up?  
JOE HARRIS: It's our sides motion. I got a flair screen. I think it was‑‑ was
it from you?  
AKIL MITCHELL: It wasn't from me.  
JOE HARRIS: Anthony set the screen up with the high post and I wrapped it.
That's just, traditionally, that's what you do, wrap it to the block and then
if it's open‑‑ if it's not open, you come back off on the rescreen, and I
happened to be open coming off of the flair. And London made a great pass and
I was quick to get it to the glass.  
  
Q. For the players, is it fun to play a blue collar knuckle buster? Is there
a joy in that? And, Coach, is it hard to attract players to want to play
that?  
AKIL MITCHELL: I think it's fun. I love it. We're winning. It's fun to impose
your will and get after it, especially against a team like Pitt that's so
tough. In four years, we've been bred to enjoy those games and really enjoy
playing the knuckle busting style of defense. I enjoy it and I know the rest
of my guys do too.  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, I mean, just you're not going to break Pitt down quick
and, hopefully, you're not going to break us down.  
So our last game was like this and it's just hard to get a good look. It's our
best way to be successful. We're having a chance to play for a championship
and that's significant. And that's the beauty of college basketball. There are
so many ways to do it.  
I think this team has versatility, but we have things we hang our hat on. The
soundness and the toughness and getting good shots. We do it collectively. The
right guys want to play that way and it's fun to win.  
  
Q. Joe and Akil, talk about the journey that you've had starting out at UVA,
rebuilding the program and the synergy you've developed on the court and how
it's all sort of come together here this weekend.  
AKIL MITCHELL: You can answer that one.  
JOE HARRIS: Well, I would say that when we first came in and Coach Bennett's
first recruiting class at Virginia, he said, "We might have to learn to lose
together before we win together. It won't be easy but we'll go through tough
times." He believed in us and believed we could have an opportunity to change
this thing around. That's the reason why Akil and I and our class decided we
wanted to come here.  
Our first year it was tough. We experienced some bumps along the way. Over
time we gradually have just gotten used to what Coach wants out of us, his
philosophy, mindset. It's been ingrained in us.  
As Akil was saying earlier, a knuckle buster type game and how we enjoy it,
that's genuine. That's the way we think. We're a defensive‑minded team and
that's how we believe we'll win games and that's what we've come to believe
over time. I think that's why we've had success and why we've gained success
over the last couple years.  
  
Q. Tony, I think there was a point in the second half when the team was
shooting better than 50 percent from the floor. Then you had the six ‑minute
stretch without any points. Why did the offense bog down? Did Pitt's defense
just pick up?   
COACH BENNETT: They did. I think we got fatigued and we got stagnant. It came
down to us trying to make some plays, and we just got a few good looks in
that, but pretty stagnant and I probably could have maybe given them some
better sets to get them moving a little more.  
There were some tired guys out there, and I didn't think we ran our offense as
hard, or when we had a set, we kind of got thwarted by Pitt's "D". They got
physical. It was obvious, they weren't going to give you anything easy and
everybody knew it was kind of hanging on a possession. Our guys knew that in
our timeouts.  
We were saying one more stop, everything you got, leave it on the floor. They
were doing the same thing. When the defense has that mindset, it's hard to
score. I think we were very stagnant in that stretch. That maybe hurt us a
little bit.  
  
Q. Tony, have you had a conversation with Terry Holland since you've been
down here?  
COACH BENNETT: Been here, no. But he's been great, like, throughout the year.
He came, talked to our team. I mentioned that before. He and Coach Carlisle
did and then came to our shootaround before we played Duke. Sends an
encouraging text or email. He's been wonderful and, obviously, he's such a
legend as a coach and what he did for Virginia basketball.  
So hopefully, we can try to get this done tomorrow and make those guys proud.  
MODERATOR: Thank you.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Pittsburgh  80  
North Carolina - 75

  
COACH WILLIAMS: Needless to say, it's extremely disappointing to play the way
we did the first30, 32 minutes of the game. You have to congratulate
Pittsburgh because they made us play that way. They were really effective.
They had a great sense of urgency.  
They got to the back boards. They got to the loose balls. We were in too much
of a rush on the offensive end of the floor. We had some good shots the first
three or four possessions and then they didn't go in and we started really
rushing thing s and that's how it got to be the margin.  
And I thought we did a nice job and got back into the ball game right before
the half and then we came out in the second half and didn't play very well in
the second half early either.  
But again, you have to congratulate those guys. Talib Zanna 19points, 21
rebounds at our place. He had a difficult day and he was much more fired up at
the end of the game and played well, very well. I think James Robinson, Lamar,
all of those guys really did some good things.  
Jamie's club I thought was sensational yesterday and I thought they played
extremely well for the first 30minutes of the game or 32minutes of the game,
whatever it was. We're really disappointed to say the least. We wanted to be
here awhile.  
The last two years we lost in the championship game. We had some chances. We
really tried hard. Got it to four with the ball two different occasions and
got it three and didn't get a stop, but it was ‑‑ the kids tried exceptionally
hard and they're a wonderful bunch of kids. But we just didn't play nearly as
well as we wanted to play early.  
  
Q. For anyone. You always want to have momentum going into a tournament. How
do you kind of channel that going forward?  
MARCUS PAIGE: I think we can learn from the things we did well in that last
eight‑minute stretch like you said. We played really well. We forced a lot of
turnovers and we were able to make things happen with our traps, which will be
helpful next week.  
At the same time we also have to learn that getting down 17 early against good
teams, we're only going to play good teams from here on out. That can't happen
and it's going to be too big of a hole to dig out of.  
  
Q. Roy, throughout the game it looked like you were sort of looking for
combinations, something that would work against this team, and then like you
said, seven minutes left, something like that, you went to the full court
press. What sparked that or what did you see that made you want to go to that
at that time?  
COACH WILLIAMS: What we were doing wasn't working very well. We wanted to try
something else. At that point I'm dumb enough to still think we had a chance
to win the game. If we got some turnovers and got some momentum and got things
going in our direction, maybe they missed some free throws, miss some shots,
turn it over a little bit. We did a good job in the full court. Once we got in
the half court we didn't do as good a job there then. Once they broke our trap
we didn't do as well as we needed to do.  
I don't think many coaches are just going to sit there and let it play out.
I'm always the guy that thinks we're going to come back from anything. I've
never been behind enough in the game that I didn't think we were going to win.
It's just that old saying the clock ran out first. I really did, I thought we
were going to come back and win the game. Especially when we got it down to
single digits, I thought we it was going to be one of the great finishes. I
really believed that. Some people think I'm a little wacko anyway. But you got
to try something different, is probably the best answer.  
  
Q. James Michael, why was Zanna such a load inside?  
JAMES MICHAEL McADOO: Just his activity level, I would say for 40minutes.
Getting to the boards and having effort. I think part of that is on us, just
not doing a good job checking off each and every time they got a shot up. I
think he did a good job of going to the front of the rim. A lot of the balls
just dropped right in front of his hands.  
  
Q. Marcus, was the tape job on your left hand precautionary or had you hurt
it recently?  
MARCUS PAIGE: It was really preventative. I fell on it a couple of times in
the Duke game and it's been something that's bothered me a little bit. But I
mean, it was fine today. I had a little soreness in my thumb, but I practiced
with that all week and it was no problem. So it was definitely precautionary.  
  
Q. Coach or for Marcus, from the 12 game winning streak until now, has there
been any dip in performance? Obviously playing at Duke and playing at
Pittsburgh is pretty good competition.  
MARCUS PAIGE: Yeah, I think we were starting to play our best basketball kind
of maybe seven or eight games into the streak and then we had a little bit of
slippage in our overall intensity and making every play matter and that showed
up in the last couple of games more so than the games we were able to edge out
and win.  
But I don't think we played great against Virginia Tech. We didn't play great
against Notre Dame and obviously the past two games we didn't play great.
We're still doing things well. I think our confidence isn't all a loss. We
just got to get back to work and fine tune some things and understand that you
got to come ready to play against anyone for 40minutes, not for ten.  
COACH WILLIAMS: He said it very well.  
  
Q. To the players, for the better part of the last month, teams have kind of
had to match your intensity and your your urgency. Today it was kind of the
other way around. Did that knock you back a little bit?  
JAMES MICHAEL McADOO: I don't think it necessarily knocked us back. I think it
just kind of put us in a hole early like Coach was saying. That's really hard
to come back from. Not necessarily when we play with effort, but when we play
our game. It does include effort and, just like Coach was saying, doing our
job. You know, each and every possession.  
And I think today, you know, collectively they did better than we were able
to.  
MARCUS PAIGE: I think in the wins we had, we really set the tone defensively.
We were really active. We were all over the place in the defense ends. That
hasn't happened recently. I think that's one of the biggest changes. The
Maryland game where we came off, we came out defensively just great and that
really set the tone for the entire game. We need to start doing that again if
we want to be successful.  
  
Q. Marcus, I kind of wanted to follow up on what you just said earlier about
confidence. This has been such a weird roller coaster, roster changes
obviously. Do you feel like you've exceeded expectations, fallen short of
expectations? What were your expectations for this year?  
MARCUS PAIGE: The season is not over for us. It's hard to say. There's a lot
that could happen in the next however many weeks that could change that
answer. I think we have dreams and goals of making the deep tournament run and
I think we're capable of doing that. A lot of it rests on that.  
We're pleased with the way we've been able to fight back and win 12 games in a
row and put ourselves in the good position. That's not what our expectation
was coming into the year. That's what really made this month.  
COACH WILLIAMS: You know, that answer was pretty doggone smart. I get tired of
picking on student‑athletes. The answer that young man gave you right now,
he's probably smarter than half you guys anyway. So sometimes say something
good.  
  
Q. Roy, your press has been very effective the last couple of games. Is this
something you might want to use more during post ‑season?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We could. It's very taxing on the kids. I mean, it really is.
I took Brice and JP out one time because I thought they were about to stop
breathing out there. Because it is very taxing. But if the other team gets
caught up in it and turns it over, you should get more energy from that.  
Marcus said there have been times where we've been very good defensively in
the half court. It's easier to cover the half court than the full court. We
did get some turnovers but they scored every time that we didn't get the
turnover. So we've got to do a good job in the full court press, but stop them
once we get back in the half court set. We could use it some more.  
Like Marcus said, we've got‑‑ this is the answer I gave somebody after three
or four games when they were saying that North Carolina, North Carolina State
and Duke, was I worried, I said, "Don't bury us yet." I'd say the same thing
right now. "Don't bury us yet." We've still got some play left.  
  
Q. Coach, Kennedy was limited to eight minutes. Is that just a matter of him
still trying to get his feet back underneath him from that virus?  
COACH WILLIAMS: No. The coach has got to put in the guys that he thinks is
going to do the job at that specific time. I didn't think we were going to get
as much out of Kennedy as we could have gotten. I had Joel and Desmond in
there. Brice did some really good things. He's got to get better defensively.  
Same thing with Kennedy. Kennedy has had some unbelievably good games for us.
At the same time he's had some games where he hasn't played as well. I've got
to get some other guys in there that will play better when he isn't playing as
well.  
  
Q. For the record, Marcus is smarter than 99percent of us in here.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I would have said 100, but there may be somebody out there I
don't know.  
  
Q. You mentioned the feeling of losing on Sunday the last couple of years.
You've also won on Sunday in this event. You've been at this event many times
even as an assistant coach. Do you feel a difference in terms of rest,
preparation? I mean, I know it's hard to find a silver lining when you lose,
but do you notice a difference when you're preparing for the NCAA Tournament
when you get to go back to Chapel Hill today rather than Sunday night?  
COACH WILLIAMS: You know, David, I think you do feel that difference. But I
want to win. You know, who knows what the crap's going to happen next week.
For me, if I have a chance to win, I want to win. And my teams have taken me
to seven Final Fours. And only one time did we win the conference tournament.  
But every one of those other times we've tried like crazy to win the sucker.
Three or four here and three or four at Kansas. I can't remember how many
we've won. But I like to win. And I think that gives you even more confidence
kind of thing. It is a little bit of now we got to start another tournament.
There's no question you have that feeling. But I like winning.  
  
Q. Roy, I think all of us were wondering which half we were in after you
said that. Right at the end you put Wade Moody in, 25seconds left, senior. I
don't know what your rotation would be at that point, but why did you play
him, what were you looking at, was that rewarding him for practice?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I put him in because the guy beside me just fouled out is the
first reason. And Leslie had already fouled out. And Wade is the best shooter
of all of the little guys left over there. I do things on senior day to reward
those guys. Start the seniors. I don't think I've ever had a team that I
didn't start all of the seniors and two times tried to start six of them. The
referee never would let me. But I do that to reward.  
What I was doing with Wade is I thought that gave us the best chance to win.
At that time it was a three‑point game. And I think I'm right. If we penetrate
and all of a sudden throw it to Wade, he's so wacko, he probably would have
made the thing. So that's the reason I put him. I really thought it gave us
the best chance to win.  
  
Q. The ACC and the Barclays Center are close to reaching the agreement to
move the tournament there in 2017. With the tournament in D.C. in 2016, what's
your thoughts on it being out of Greensboro for three years?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Frankly, my dear. I know that's an improper answer but, I
mean, we just got our butts kicked. And we got to get ready for the NCAA
Tournament. Frankly, my dear, I don't give a blankety‑blank where the hell
they put it. If they put it in Siberia, I'm going to try to go play. If they
put it in Owen High School in Black Mountain, Swannanoa Valley, I'm going to
try our best to go out and play. I know that's not the answer you wanted but
you got to remember I'm an old guy up here and we just our butts kicked.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2014

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Duke  63  
Clemson - 62

  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: We just opened up our locker room. So I don't think they're
coming. If you want any questions, I'll take them back and get answers for you
and then I don't know how we'll do that because I don't tweet. But I'll try to
do whatever you can do.  
Look, it was a ‑‑ it was a bruising game. Points were really hard to come by.
There's ‑‑ oh, I know they're fighting for their NCAA lives. And they fought
all year. I mean, Brad's done one of the great jobs in the country in coaching
his team.  
You know, we had them down by small double digits and then we couldn't put the
darn thing in the basket. And to get like a 14, 16, and really take control,
they never give up. And their kids played with a lot of heart and so did our
kids. And when they took the lead and Rodney made that play, it's really one
of the best plays for us that a player can make, to just take it down the
court like that. And then get a one and one, not two shots and to hit those
two free throws is just huge.  
When I think back on our first ACC game against Notre Dame, Notre Dame had a
similar situation with a little bit more time on the clock and he took it and
he didn't go and attack. And we lost the game. And so déjà vu, and all of a
sudden he's in that situation again. And this time he makes that happen. Like
that's a heck of a thing for that kid. He was throwing up at the start of the
‑‑ we had to take him out, he got sick. And so thank goodness he was okay.  
It was a big win for us against a really gritty tough Clemson team. And I
thought our team was tough too. It was just ‑‑ you know, the basketball
tonight, both games were just great ACC games and we're thankful obviously
that we came out on the winning side. Any questions?  
  
Q. Coach, first of all, congratulations on the victory. Tonight and all
throughout the season I'm amazed by Jefferson's ability to continue to come
out of nowhere and grab a rebound. Then you look at the stat sheet and it
turns out he has 13 of them. Where does that come from?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, one of the things with Amile is that when you're
playing with Rodney and Jabari, a lot of times you're not focused on ‑‑
especially offensive rebounds. Somebody's coming over to double Rodney or
double Jabari. And then you need to be alert enough to take advantage of that.  
And Amile had a really good year. But when he's had his terrific game like
tonight with 13 boards, he's very alert. He's very alert. And then he came up
with a couple of buckets too, huge buckets for us. He doesn't weigh very much,
about 210, so he's fighting those guys. That's why we're not a real big team.
So when he's playing like that, we got a better chance of winning.  
  
Q. Rodney also had the one play against Vermont early in the year with the
drive. Is there a different mentality that he takes that he learns from that
experience?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: First of all, he wants to learn. He takes responsibility for
the fact like this is what I should have done in that situation. Rodney is one
of the great kids you like to coach. In some respects, he sometimes is too
hard on himself and will pass up things if he misses instead of just playing
through. I mean, I wish we had him for more than one year. And because he ‑‑
the growth that he's had in this year is terrific. And it's because he wants
to be coached and he wants ‑‑ he takes responsibility.  
Anybody who is willing to take responsibility for his or her actions usually
does better. And that's what Rodney does.  
  
Q. Coach, from the point where you guys got up by about 13, I think Clemson
scored on a round of 15 out of 17 possessions. Do you write that up to Clemson
just getting hot or was that something you were concerned about in the
defense?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: No. We were really concerned about it. And the personality
and the heart of Clemson's team probably rose to its highest during that time
because they're fighting for their lives, not just in this game but for the
tournament. And we beat a team that put everything on the line against us.  
And I thought like when it was three points, we'd get a five‑point lead, we
just could not get a stop. And I don't know if we were ‑‑ I know we were
tired, both teams were tired. And it was really hot in there. I mean, that's
the hottest. It was really hot. And I think that had an effect on both teams.
The time of the game and, I mean, there's nothing you can do about it.  
But the kids tonight really fought through a lot and gave us ‑‑ commentators
say it wasn't a pretty game. Then don't commentate. To me it was a great game.
You have both teams fighting until the end like that, it's terrific. It's not
going to be pretty.  
  
Q. Rasheed kind of had that feisty anger at the end of the game that the
guys were looking for. Did that contribute to him getting the ball down the
stretch?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: That and I think Jabari and Rodney put an emphasis on not
letting him get the ball. I really think we got tired, and they're a little
bit more athletic than we are. Although we're athletic. They can wear you
down.  
Rasheed seemed to have a little spark there. Actually a couple of times going
to the bucket we hoped that he couldn't finish. But he got by. We wouldn't
have won the game tonight without Rasheed. Rasheed was very good. I don't know
what his stat was, 14, which was great. But he was in ‑‑ they were big
14points. And then his defense was very good too. Rasheed, especially in the
second half was terrific.  
  
Q. Mike, you get to come back in about 15hours to play NC State. Are you
surprised to see them in the semis? And talk about them.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah. First of all, we would love to face anybody in the
semis and I've coached a lot of games in this tournament. And every one is a
huge game. And you're just happy to advance.  
I'm not surprised at NC State. NC State is playing great basketball. And
Mark's got his team at a real high level of belief. Warren is playing
lights‑out basketball. I mean, he's had a great year, but the last few weeks,
last couple of weeks, you know, phenomenal is not exaggerating. He's been
unbelievable. And he never seems to get tired.  
I was watching ‑‑ I watched the first half back at our hotel until the under
four and then when I got here I was watching in our little coaches' area.
First of all, I thought it was a great game. And Warren is at that elite level
right now. Knowing the history of this tournament, sometimes a kid, they're
really good, but then when you have a guy playing like that, you become even
better. Because he gets points for his team. And he's very efficient.  
Tomorrow will be a very difficult game for us. And again, I don't know where
these bubbles are and all of that, where their team is right now with the
NCAA, but tonight's win against Syracuse has to go a long way.  
Again, you ‑‑ at this time of the year so many teams that are going to be
pretty good seeds in the tournament get knocked off by teams that just are
playing with great hunger and great sense of urgency, and in a lot of
respects, this week, starting towards the end of last week, until Sunday, is
some of the best basketball of the year.  
And to see kids on all of these teams fighting like crazy for an opportunity
to play in the NCAA Tournament, it's magnificent. We're in it. And so you have
to beat teams like that. And that's difficult. It's really difficult. And
tonight that was the case and tomorrow will be the case too.  
  
Q. Coach, could you touch briefly on the effect the team had and your staff
had on the new format? Was it a help to have the three days of sitting around
or was it a hindrance for the chomping at the bit from your team?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, there's nothing you can do about it. That's what you
have to do. I'd rather be a high seed. I do think, though, when you come into
the tournament today and you haven't done anything in the arena and if you're
the second game of the two games, you don't have much of a warmup.  
So I think that's where Carolina and us were in today. The team you're playing
against, they've won. They've just won the day before. They know the building.
They have a good feel. And there's not that much separation, if any, from the
teams. And all of a sudden that little bit ‑‑ I mean, it has an effect.
There's no question about it.  
But I don't know how you ‑‑ it's just the way it is. I mean, we talk to our
team about it, warm up harder, you know all of that. Maybe we warmed up too
hard, got ourselves tired or whatever. But that's part of the conference
tournament that's different. It's different in the NCAA Tournament. Because
everybody starts out 0‑0\. There are no byes.  
  
Q. You mentioned the NCAA and the bubble and such. Today Pitt won and State
won and Clemson played really well. Is that a testament to the depth of the
ACC and do you believe the conference is getting much respect in regards to
the bubble and stuff?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I really don't think the conference is getting the respect
it should. Because Syracuse was the number one team in the country for a
while. Virginia has been really good. Carolina in February was as good as
anybody and they still might be as good as anybody.  
And then we've been pretty darn good the whole year, I mean, where we're
ranked and everyone talks about the Big 12, and they should. Then they say,
"Well, when somebody beats one of those teams, boy, that makes them a
tournament contender."  
Well, we've gotten beat by ‑‑ Clemson had beaten us. Wake had beaten us. Notre
Dame had beaten us. People say, "Well, they're not having a good" ‑‑ well,
they beat us. So they have to be pretty good.  
Same thing with Syracuse. Syracuse gets knocked off. Our league is a lot
better. A lot better. When I see these things where they say certain
conferences are getting six or seven and we might now ‑‑ like I can't even
believe people now say, "Well, Pitt's earned it." Well, yeah, they have before
today. Before today.  
Again, I'm not trying to just be a cheerleader for the conference. I love our
conference. I'm just trying to be realistic. We have a great conference this
year. This year we have as many top ranked teams to match up against anybody.
If you look at the top 15 and the RPI or whatever, I think we have more, as
many or more than anyone else.  
So that means these other teams are good that people are saying are on the
bubble. I mean, it's frustrating. I'm frustrated for our guys. Because all of
us can ‑‑ just because we're Duke or ‑‑ you still have to earn it. We could be
in that position next year or the next three, four years, where we're the
eighth place team in a strong conference and not getting the credit.  
  
Q. Did Jabari Parker meet your expectations? Did you think he was capable of
this all along or has he exceeded it?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: No. I knew Jabari ‑‑ he didn't have a great night tonight.
But he came up with some big plays for us. Jabari's really had a great year.
And he's only going to get better.  
And Jabari and Rodney are very similar and they accept coaching and they
accept responsibility. If you had asked Jabari right now how he feels, he's
happy about our win, but he's not happy about his play tonight. He expects
higher. And then he would want to know why and then he would want to know how
to correct that.  
But he's a special kid. And a lot of pressure on him because we rely ‑‑ we're
relying on a freshman to be our best player. And he's been a pretty darn good
one.  
  
Q. Rodney said on the last play when he got fouled with three seconds, he
saw an opening and he felt like he could get to the basket and possibly get
fouled. Was there ever a thought for calling a timeout or was that an
opportunity to just let them create on that?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I just got eye contact with him when he got the ball and I
said, "Go." So no. He actually did that in our Vermont game and scored. And
then he wasn't able to score. Like I believe in Rodney. And you sink or swim
with him. And we're still swimming. So thank goodness.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2014

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

### [Aaron Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26661)

### [Okaro White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22135)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Virginia  64  
Florida State - 51

  
COACH HAMILTON: It was obvious to us that ‑‑ the energy to defend them because
they're extremely patient in how they execute their offense. And they had five
guys on the floor that are all capable of hurting you, four guys that shoot
close to 40percent from three and a couple of very athletic post guys that
were very capable of scoring.  
I was pleased with the first 15 or so minutes of the game. I thought we
defended them very well. And we kept pace offensively.  
The second half, it was obvious that the quality of their depth took its toll
on us. We didn't quite have nearly the energy to fight those screens for the
long periods of time. And I thought that really made the difference. We didn't
have the ‑‑ the four offensive rebounds we gave up the first half, I think
three of them they scored on. They did a very good job attacking the basket.  
We rotated over our guards, very concerned about their three‑point shooters.
We were kind of in an indecisive mindset, do I rotate, find somebody inside
the blockout, do I ‑‑ our game plan was not to give up very many threes and I
thought our guys were so indecisive when we thought for a second and they
crashed the boards and got those easy baskets in the first half. It kind of
gave them that breathing room.  
Down the stretch we ran out of gas. They kept executing and executing. That's
why I think they're probably one of the top teams that I've seen in a long,
long time. Playing within themselves, playing to their strengths, staying away
from their weaknesses, making you pay every time you make a defensive mistake.
That's to their credit. They're an outstanding basketball team.  
  
Q. Okaro, how critical was that the first three or four minutes of the
seconds half, you guys were only down five but it seemed like you couldn't get
stops to get yourself back in the game?  
OKARO WHITE: That was very critical. That's when they went on their run. They
kept it to a nine, ten, 11‑point game during that time. It's very hard to come
back on a team like Virginia when they're coming down and using 30seconds of a
shot clock. You can't get down on them. That's where they went on that run. So
that was a very critical part of the game.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys have struggled with turnovers a little bit. What was
Virginia's defense doing that kind of let you guys ‑‑ did it force you guys
into them or did you guys kind of do that as their defense setback?  
COACH HAMILTON: If you remember correctly, we must have had at least 12 to 15
point‑blank shots at the rim. I mean, we got great looks. We didn't finish
some of the opportunities we had available. So I'm not ‑‑ I can't fault
execution. I just think that we didn't have the legs to finish those plays
inside.  
This is one of the first times in a long time that we haven't had enough depth
to keep the rotation where we can keep our energy up. It's been a challenge
for us all year long. They're playing nine guys and we're playing four
perimeter guys and one rotation there. And it was a little bit more of a
challenge.  
I thought in order to guard this type of system, you have to ‑‑ you can't take
any possessions off defensively. I thought there were too many times as the
game went on they started getting separation on their cuts and, like I said
earlier, I just think that we look for some spots to catch a breather. And
each time we did that, I thought that it cost us.  
  
Q. Okaro, what defensively was Virginia doing the second half that seemed to
make it harder for you to get open looks there?  
OKARO WHITE: I just thought they played tighter in the second half, when I
tried to drive the ball to help them a lot quicker. That's pretty much it.  
  
Q. Leonard, a couple of reports have come out that the ACC tournament is
close to finalizing a move to the Barclays Center in 2017. As a guy who grew
up in North Carolina but also spent a lot of time coaching in the Big East,
what do you think of that move and what would it mean for the conference?  
COACH HAMILTON: First you have to understand that the reputation of the ACC
has been built because of the outstanding ACC tournament for many, many years.
And it's been‑‑ I think it set the standard by which all other conference
tournaments have been judged throughout the years, the pageantry, the
interest, the support. And it's been honed right here in Greensboro.  
I'm not real sure you can ever replace the culture that has been built for so
many years as a result of the tournament being held here in Greensboro. But
over the years, it's obvious that the footprint of the league has changed and
I think if that's ‑‑ I don't really want to comment on rumors. Because I don't
‑‑ I like to talk about facts. But the tournament has moved around. It's been
in Tampa. It's been in Washington, D.C., it's been in Atlanta.  
So if it moves somewhere else, I think it would just be part of the plan of
the ACC to expand their territory, which is not anything different than what
we've been doing all along. If that's the case, then that would be ‑‑ I mean,
I can understand that being under consideration. But until it becomes a
reality and something that's absolute, I'm not real sure it makes any sense
for me to be speculating on it.  
  
Q. Leonard, you're one of those, quote, bubble teams. I know you're not on
the committee. Do you think your team deserves to get in? Will you be watching
on Sunday, hoping they get in?  
COACH HAMILTON: Well, obviously. I think anybody that starts this season off
in October and November practicing, there's not a team in America who does not
have a plan of wanting to win a national title. Every kid grows up wanting to
have an opportunity to participate for a national title. And I think our team
and our players and our staff and our school and administration, we all feel
the same way.  
But the reality is we really don't have a vote. And what we have to do is wait
and see what happens. I do believe that we're more than capable of doing well
in the NCAA Tournament. But at this particular point, it doesn't do you any
good to play the what‑if game. Because there's a lot of criteria that the
committee will use as they try to make their decision.  
We hope that we have fulfilled most of them. A win today probably would have
helped us a lot better than a loss. So at this particular point there's not
anything else we can do other than go back and try to regroup from this game
and learn from it and move on and try to get a little rest, prepare ourselves
for whatever tournament we are going to play in.  
  
Q. Okaro and Aaron, same question to you guys, do you guys think you've done
enough? Do you think you deserve to get in?  
AARON THOMAS: Let's see. You know, I think we did. I think we got a couple of
good quality wins. Like Coach said, I think today would have helped us a lot.
And Syracuse would have helped us a lot. Like Coach said, let's see what
happens.  
OKARO WHITE: You know, as far as our record, our record speaks for us to be on
a bubble. But I mean, I think we're a great team. I think we've showed in the
beginning of the season and had a tough time throughout the course of the
season, but I think we showed everybody that we're a team that should be out
there. I think we're a team that is up to the level of a lot of the teams
that's going to be in the NCAA Tournament.  
But it's all up to voting and I know there's a lot of different categories
they go by. So whatever they choose, we'll go off of.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

NC State  66  
Syracuse  63

  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Well, obviously I'm very, very excited for our players. I'm
really, really proud of them. I'm extremely proud of a young team that keeps
battling, doesn't get down, bounces back. Even within the game, lose the lead
and respond when their back was against the wall.  
And I don't know if I could be more proud of a group than I am of my team. And
they believed they could win, which I think was the most important thing. And
obviously Syracuse is a great team. They're so long and athletic and can score
the ball. Their zone gives you so many problems, but our guys just seemed to
stay the course, not get frustrated, just stay with it and stay with it. And
we had answers because of our resiliency. So I'm extremely proud and happy for
our players.  
  
Q. Mark, could you go through what was going through your mind while you
were watching all of those shots go up in that last possession?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Well, I was saying to myself can we just get a rebound, just
somebody grab the ball. And it was interesting every time it left their hands,
it never really looked like it was going in. So we were okay. But we escaped
on that one obviously right there.  
But, you know, sometimes those kind of things balance out in life. You know,
you have a tough one earlier in the year where we didn't finish the game
today, maybe fate was on your side on that last possession.  
  
Q. Before this game, what did you stress to stop CJ Fair? What was the game
plan to ‑‑ you know, game plan for CJ?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: It was TJ Warren, period. I thought, you know, TJ gets a lot
of praise for his offense and he is a great offensive player. But I thought
tonight TJ Warren locked in defensively and made every shot that CJ took
tough. Every single one of them. I don't know that he had an easy shot all
night long.  
Obviously he's left hand dominant and we wanted to push him to his right,
those type things. But I think bigger than that was TJ Warren, showing
everybody he's not just an offensive player, but he's a phenomenal defender as
well. He showed it tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned the finishes and the finish you had at Syracuse.
What does it say about your team now that you've had these games here in a row
where you haven't been able to finish?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Well, we've learned, we've grown up, we've gotten better. We
had some games where we didn't finish and they hurt, they hurt bad. And that's
what I said earlier, that's why I'm so proud of our guys, because you bounce
back from adversity. We had some. We pour a lot into this. It's a lot of
sacrifice and a lot of effort.  
When you come out of there short, it just cuts you. But our guys have been
able to kind of get themselves back to together and we talk about finishing,
let's finish the game. So, you know, our young guys have grown up, gotten
better and improved.  
  
Q. With 18minutes left in the second half, Christmas went out of the game
with his fourth foul and that kind of sparked an 11 ‑2 run on your part. Were
you guys trying to go inside and really score there or was it just kind of
just where open shots came up?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: It wasn't necessarily by design we were going at him. We
wanted to get the ball inside. It's got to go in there some. I thought our big
guys did a great job tonight with our interior passing to each other.  
Jordan had a couple great passes. Lennard, Kyle, they found TJ a couple of
times. We don't want to be against Syracuse, a team that just plays outside
the three‑point line. We were able to get the ball around the basket and we
were fortunate there when he got his fourth foul.  
  
Q. Coach, you called this game an opportunity yesterday. What does this win
mean now for your team in its NCAA hopes?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Well, I hope that we're a legitimate contender. I really do.
I look at our team and people forget we played four games early without Jordan
Vandenberg and lost two of them, one of them to North Carolina Central and the
other to Cincinnati. He's a big part of our team of what we do and he didn't
play.  
Then we had a young team that got better. We're not the same team now that we
were in November and December. When you're playing and, you know, you lose
80percent of all of your scoring from a year ago, it's going to take awhile to
figure yourselves out. I look around the country and figure out how many teams
can go win at Pittsburgh like we did.  
We watched them today and they're pretty good. And at Tennessee and all of the
things we've done. We have a great league. It's a great league. And I hope
that these young guys have a chance.  
Now, we came to Greensboro thinking about one thing, and that's to play on
Sunday. That's our goal, was to play on Sunday and win on Sunday. And, you
know, today was just the next step. So our eyes were there more than anything.
I hope that we have the greatest chance to play in the greatest show on earth.  
  
Q. Could you go through that last possession and what's going through your
mind after shot after shot after shot keeps going up like that? TJ?  
T.J. WARREN: They got a lot of opportunities to tie the game. Luckily they
kept missing.  
COACH GOTTFRIED: He's the man of many words, TJ.  
RALSTON TURNER: I was definitely holding my breath. They got a lot of
opportunities. Every one of them seemed like it was taking forever to miss so
unfortunately none of them went in.  
COACH GOTTFRIED: That's probably why we couldn't get a rebound, we were
holding our breath.  
  
Q. TJ, time for some more words. Coach said you're the reason why you guys
were able to hold CJ Fair to three of 16 shooting. Take us through your
mindset from the beginning of this game to the end and really being able to
shut him down.  
T.J. WARREN: I just wanted to stay on his left hand, try to force him right a
little bit, make him uncomfortable. I think I did a good job tonight. I had a
lot of help from back side, Jordan and BeeJay, so it was an overall effort.  
  
Q. Coach, three minutes to go, Lennard Freeman, if you can just talk about
the job he did, he got six rebounds for you after the bench took that big
charge and from that point on you didn't lose the lead, you got it back from
that point on.  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I thought Lennard was huge. I thought the charge was too. I
think we took two charges late. I thought his was really important. One thing
Lennard has done pretty consistently all year long is go get the ball off the
rim.  
We felt like going into the game and watching film, watching the last game,
you got to keep them off of the backboard. You got to find a way to get a
defensive rebound and I thought Lennard was really big in that regard.  
  
Q. This is for all three of you regarding coaches in motion at the end of
the game. A lot more than we're normally used to seeing. So for the players,
could you go through how excited you were to see Coach that emotional and
pumped for the win? And then, Coach, what was so special about this win? Why
were you able to get that emotional? Starting with the players.  
RALSTON TURNER: I think like Coach mentioned earlier, it showed our growth.
The last time we played these guys, it was about the exact same situation. So
I think that not only was it a big win, but it also shows that we've come a
long way since then.  
T.J. WARREN: We've been working towards this since the last time we played
them up at their place. We adjusted the ‑‑ at the end of the game and came out
with the win.  
COACH GOTTFRIED: There was a timeout late, I'm not sure which one it was, but
I remember telling our guys, "I want you guys to experience this win. I want
you to experience it. And stay in there. Hang in there. Keep getting
shutouts." And they were able to do that.  
And, you know, they're happy. They should be. They feel good. At the same
time, we know that we're not done. We didn't come here just to play and beat
Syracuse. We came here to do a lot more. I was just really proud of them.  
  
Q. Mark, was that the best game Jordan Vandenberg has played in your three
years?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: He's played really good lately. He's winding down at the end
of his college career. Block shot here, rebound there, he had two baskets
early for us in the game that got us off to a good start. He started to direct
traffic defensively and really do a nice job of communicating with our guys.
So really proud of him. Told him in the locker room I think it's the best he
played the last couple of games. And certainly we can't win without him in
there.  
  
Q. For the players, there was a crazy sequence right there at the end where
Syracuse had like five shots, something like that. What was that like for you
guys? Did you get close to the ball? It seemed like you could never get your
hands on. TJ, were you ever close to the ball? What do you remember about that
closing sequence?  
T.J. WARREN: They were taking long shots. It was going to be a long rebound.
We was trying to secure the rebound. Like I said before, luckily we didn't
miss and we was able to get the win.  
RALSTON TURNER: You know, I was on the bench at the time, but looking on, it
just seemed like the ball was coming off of the rim really hard. It just
happened to keep bouncing to them wherever they were we were. Just fortunate
none of them went in.  
  
Q. Coach, you referenced that you're not done yet. Any concern about being
able to crank this thing back up for tomorrow against the team, either one of
them, got you pretty good the only time you saw them?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: No. I think our guys will be really anxious to play. We're
going to back to the hotel, get a bite to eat, get a lot of rest. This time of
the year, you don't have time for any of that. We're going to get ourselves
regrouped and we got a little confidence now we've played some good games here
recently.  
And we came here ‑‑ we talked about it before we came. We talked about playing
on Sunday and winning on Sunday. So whoever we end up playing tomorrow, we're
going to be really excited about it and really focused in.  
  
Q. Coach, on that same theme, your first two years at Raleigh, you made it
to Saturday. What would it mean what you're trying to do for the program to
actually get to that Sunday game?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Well, I think it would mean a lot. I don't really look at it
like that too much, the big picture of our program. I want these guys, this
group right here, I want these guys to experience something special. And
they've had the odds against them all year. We lost so much from last year. So
many questions coming in to this year, how are we going to play, how are we
going to score? Who's going to do what?  
I look back to November the 8th when we opened up until now, we just come a
long way. I want them to keep going. I want them to experience something
special. We'll look at the big picture later on. Right now the most important
thing is getting ready to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. You obviously felt the presence of Wolfpack Nation in the house tonight.
When it was close late, there were people wearing Duke T ‑shirts, people
wearing UVA T‑shirts, Syracuse, the Big East transplant, versus the home state
Wolfpack. Did you sense that bigger home court advantage at all?   
COACH GOTTFRIED: We've got amazing fans, I do know that. The Wolfpack Nation
is strong, they're loud, opinionated, which is good. They care about their
team. There might have been some Duke and some other people cheering, probably
not very many North Carolina cheering. But I do know our guys feed off of our
fans. They do a great job for us. They put a little wind at your back always
because there's so many of them and we feel it and appreciate it.  
  
Q. Ralston, just talk about that three. Was that one of the biggest ones
you've ever hit and how did you get the bank to be open so late on a Friday
night?  
RALSTON TURNER: Definitely one of the biggest threes I've ever hit throughout
my college career. That was one of the reasons I came here to play in games
like this. When it happened, I just let it go. I caught bank inside my head.
I'm glad it went down.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2014

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [Lamar Patterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24439)

### [James Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24440)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Pittsburgh  80  
North Carolina - 75

  
COACH DIXON: Thank you for being here. I was really proud of our guys. We came
back and played hard obviously and played well and executed all the way
through. I was really excited about how we played. Beat a very good team.  
I felt after playing them down there, we got in foul trouble. Talib wasn't
healthy, Lamar wasn't healthy, I told our guys we went in expecting to win
this game. That was our thought process going into it and I thought our guys
did a great job.  
Obviously Talib 21 rebounds, 19points. The glass, the rebounding was key. We
set that. We won that rebounding by 15. We only got it to 8. I thought we did
a great job battling.  
Fought through some foul trouble obviously and some missed free throws down
the stretch. But we'll make them tomorrow, I'm very sure of that and confident
about that, as we've been shooting them very well in recent games. We're
playing our basketball now as we've shown, and as I said yesterday, and we'll
continue to do so tomorrow.  
  
Q. James, early in the game, you were more aggressive offensively than you
had normally been the last few weeks. You just wanted to set the tone and get
your team off running?  
JAMES ROBINSON: Not really. I think I just had open shots and I took them. My
teammates did a really good job finding me when I was open. Obviously a lot of
the defense was really keying on Lamar and Cam and they did a really good job
finding the open players tonight.  
  
Q. Lamar, it looked like you were grabbing your wrist at one point. Is it
still bothering you at all?  
LAMAR PATTERSON: No. It's fine. It's all right.  
  
Q. For James and Lamar, how did the foul situation down the stretch affect
how you guys (no audio feed) ‑‑  
  
Q. Guys, can you talk about how the close games you were in this season
prepared you, if at all, what you faced down the stretch and how much that
benefitted you late in the season this year?  
LAMAR PATTERSON: It benefitted us. Like I said today, usually we make our free
throws, but today we wasn't that good at it. It's good. We know what we have
to do. We know we can't give up. The games previously during the season that
were close and that we lost and the ones that wetook stuff from each of them
and we were able to close it out today.  
  
Q. UVA has been able to win even when Joe Harris has been off, but how much
more dangerous are they when he's hitting shots? And then for the players, can
you comment from what you remember from the UVA game?  
COACH DIXON: They want to keep the scores down. They want to keep it low. I
think they have very good balance. I think Joe Harris obviously was the name
coming in. He's the senior. He's the scorer. I think Brogdon didn't play last
year and they're all returning guys. With that, I think you normally see teams
get more scoring out of other guys.  
I think their balance is really their strength. I think because Joe was picked
as a preseason all‑league player, you know, the focus is on him, but obviously
some other guys have progressed and they've got balanced scoring all the way
through. So there's not just one guy.  
  
Q. Lamar, thoughts on Virginia?  
LAMAR PATTERSON: We lost at the buzzer. So that game could have went either
way. We'll be ready for it. So we know where ‑‑ we can play with them or we
can play with anybody in the country we feel like. So we'll be ready to go.
We'll have our minds and body ready.  
JAMES ROBINSON: We know what we have to do coming in. Obviously rebound and
defend, which have kind of been our things that we try to do every night since
the beginning of the season. So we're going to get back and get ready for the
game tomorrow.  
  
Q. What other than effort obviously with ‑‑  
COACH DIXON: Shots is key to that. For him, we went smaller. It allows us to
penetrate. It made them rotate. Obviously he has a knack for it. He's always
been good at it. He was on the glass constantly. He uses quickness. I think
they had some bigger guys guarding him and that was to his benefit, his
strength, using his quickness and his agility.  
  
Q. As a coach, when you look at a special player like Marcus Paige, he has
27points, but at the same time it looked like you built your lead with Cam
Wright kind of slowing him down in the first half. Do you see the pluses or do
you see the 27?  
COACH DIXON: No. Obviously the game changed, it got prolonged, it was a
different game at the end. I thought we did a good job to put ourselves in the
position. You want to be in the position that you're at. Obviously the teams
are going to make runs. If you don't make free throws, that run is going to be
fueled by that. He kept battling and he kept playing. You know, they got some
long rebounds, they got some loose balls at the end. It was a different game
down the stretch.  
Seemed to change at a certain point in the game. It's just ‑‑ but we got it
right and we did what we needed to do.  
  
Q. For Jamie, the turnaround from this game playing at a fast pace, Virginia
will want to keep you in the 50s. Is that more or less of a challenge with the
fatigue factor involved?  
COACH DIXON: I don't think there's going to be any fatigue factor. We're ready
to go. They played today as well. We'll be ready to go. We're excited about
it. We're ready to go. We're playing our best basketball right now. I think
that's the most important thing.  
  
Q. Jamie, a couple of reports have come out that the ACC tournament looks
like it's moving to the Barclays Center in 2017 and 2018 for the league where
it is now. What does it do to the New York brand? How much do you think that
would help the league?  
COACH DIXON: It's going to be great no matter what. That's what we have to
remind ourselves of. We can debate it and talk about it and maneuver and try
it where you need to have it. But either way it's going to be great, it's
going to be terrific. And I think it's going to grow into the best event in
college basketball. That's what it will become.  
We're excited to be part of it. I think it's great for our conference wherever
it ends up. We'll be there and we'll be excited about playing.  
  
Q. Do you think that that expansion helps it playing in different places and
different people getting a chance to go see it, helps it become this greatest
event?  
COACH DIXON: I think ‑‑ I don't know. I think that's up in the air. I think
people like going to the same place. When it was in New York, I think the
same. But we've had the same amount of interest going to Greensboro too from
our fans.  
I can't believe that many people were there, even in those corner seats that
we got as the first year team, I guess what I was informed of. Notre Dame was
in the other corner and Syracuse was in the other corner. That's fair.  
I think our fans will get there no matter what and they're excited about it. I
don't know that‑‑ there's benefits to both. There's benefits to both. Moving
it around obviously doesn't give the home court advantage to certain teams
every year, but at the same time I think willing to go the same place every
time brings a tradition that we have in the Big East. I don't think it's going
to be in one place forever. I think it's going to be moved around.  
  
Q. When everyone's looking at resumes for the tournament this time of year,
how important is it to kind of have an on ‑paper win like this one this time
of year?  
COACH DIXON: Every win is important. You want to be playing your best
basketball. We've clearly done. I think that's the most important thing. We
weren't healthy. We're now healthy. You factor that in. You look at teams that
are playing their best. I've been saying it and we're doing it. And I think
this game is another example of that. I think it's the right time to be
playing your best.  
  
Q. James, every team practices late game situations. When you see you're up
late, you know you're going to take the pounding with the full court press.
What do you learn from those late game situations in practice and do you take
the same kind of beating there that you take when you're out there on a day
like this?  
JAMES ROBINSON: Yeah, definitely in practice. We call it our press team who,
you know, they challenge us every day in practice. So it's kind of like a
drill. Come game time and, you know, obviously the fans are into it,
everybody's up, excited. But I guess as a guard, as a person that's on the
court, you got to remain calm and know that everything is going to be all
right.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2014

  

### [Brad Brownell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21640)

### [Rod Hall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26732)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Duke  63  
Clemson - 62

  
COACH BROWNELL: Obviously this is a difficult defeat. Couldn't be prouder of
my players. To show the resiliency we did throughout the game especially in
the second half when we looked like we were dead again. Our guys just have a
lot of fight. They just kept coming.  
And, you know, we made it a one‑possession game and two bang bang plays right
at the end at the basket. They got a call and made one and we didn't. That's
not the end of the world, but it's painful right now. It's very painful for a
group of guys that have put so much into it.  
And obviously, you know, with a win today, we maybe would have still had a
chance to make the NCAA Tournament. So I think that's what makes it so hard.
But proud of my guys. Great effort and congratulate Duke on a good win.  
  
Q. Hey, Coach, this is for Rod Hall too. Just talk about that last
possession and your thoughts, foul, no foul, good call?  
COACH BROWNELL: Yeah, I can't really make comments like that. I haven't seen
it. I don't know. It's a bang bang play. We did exactly what we wanted. It's
something we practiced and guys executed it beautifully. We got it to our guy
who we want to have it drive into the rim. You know, there's contact. There's
nothing there. That's part of what you're trying to do, you got four seconds
or less, get it to the paint and make a play and we did that.  
  
Q. Rod, just walk us through the possession.  
ROD HALL: We drew up the play. We go through it in practice often. Coach knew
he wanted to get me the ball and I tried to make something happen at the rim
and the referee didn't call nothing. So I just had to deal with it.  
  
Q. Brad, were there thoughts if we can win this one and another one, there
would be an NCAA Tournament bid out there? This would have been a 21st win.  
COACH BROWNELL: Certainly, if you win the tournament, you got a chance to go
without anybody deliberating. And we played well enough tonight to feel like
we could win again tomorrow. So that's one factor.  
But certainly, you know, we've played good basketball here down the stretch
and, you know, we've had a couple of controversial calls that have gone
against us here late. That's part of basketball. Something guys got to learn
from.  
But the most important thing and what I told our team, is how proud I am of
the way they compete. I don't think there's many people in the arena that felt
like this game was going to get to a one‑possession game and Clemson would
ever have the lead.  
  
Q. Coach, I wanted you to take just a second and talk about your defense in
the first half. And then in the start of the second half I thought you guys
did a wonderful job of preventing Duke from getting the looks that they want
and the fact that you held them to just six three ‑point attempts in the first
half, was that by design? Can you help me out on that one?  
COACH BROWNELL: Yeah. We certainly were trying to guard the three. You know,
they make over nine a game. They shoot terrific percentage and we played great
defensively for 18minutes and then had a couple of bad plays at the end. Duke
made a couple of adjustments, got a couple of dunks. One was a steal. Two were
good offensive possessions by them.  
Certainly we felt by the way we played defensively in the first half we were
going to have a chance. Duke came out after halftime and played well again and
put us on our heels, but our guys dug in and fought and we've done that all
year. And gave ourselves a chance to do some good things. Certainly they're a
talented group.  
Parker and Hood are really good players, hard to guard. We did about as good a
job defensively as we could expect to do today.  
  
Q. Coach, you had that run in the second half. I think you scored on six of
seven possessions and it got you back in the game. What were you guys getting
done during that stretch that got you back in it?  
COACH BROWNELL: I don't know. I mean, sometimes when you get down a little
bit, I think guys almost play with a little more confidence. There's not as
much to lose in your mind. So if you miss a shot, you know, you're already
behind seven or eight or ten or whatever it is. There's quite ‑‑ you just
shoot with a little more confidence, a little more carefree.  
I think we executed some things well. We hadn't shot well most of the night.
We usually have stretches where we don't score, but then we also have
stretches where we'll look really good for 10 or 12 possessions and look like
a great team. The problem is where we have ten possessions where we don't look
very good. That's why we aren't better than we are.  
We usually find 10, 12 stretches during games and we stream those together.
And when we do, that's when we make our runs. It either puts us well ahead or
it gets us back into a game. Tonight it got us back into a game.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2014

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [C.J. Fair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23639)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

NC State  66  
Syracuse - 63

  
COACH BOEHEIM: I thought we got off to a slow offensive start and we just
really never could get anything going offensively and but I thought we made
some really good plays to get back in it and we made two bad plays to get back
out of it.  
  
Q. Jim, if you could go through your last offensive possession there if at
any point you wanted the guys maybe to slow down because they had time?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, we needed a three at that point and I think we got four
looks at it, which is more than you're normally going to get. But we had to
get a three at that time.  
  
Q. Same thing to you, what was that last possession like? It looked like you
had the best look on that last one?  
C.J. FAIR: Yeah, our last possession we got a few good looks and myself, I got
a clean look. I just didn't knock it down. And from there, we was just
scrambling trying to get in another opportunity.  
  
Q. CJ, you know, Warren was on you all game. Was his defense tight all night
or were you just missing shots that you normally get?  
C.J. FAIR: I mean, you do a good job denying defense. But I thought I was
getting my normal shots that just wasn't falling and, I mean, that's what it
was really.  
  
Q. Jim, how much did it hurt when Rakeem got his fourth foul early in the
second half?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, you'd like to have him in there, there's no question
about that. But he was out of position three times and if he had been in the
right position, he wouldn't have been in foul trouble.  
  
Q. Jim, Tyler was pretty good from behind the arc today, more emphasis on
shooting that he's been this year. Is that something that you want to see more
out of him considering Trevor's recent struggles?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Trevor was hurting a little bit. He wasn't moving as well as he
can. He turned his ankle a little bit. Tyler tries to score when we need
points, and we needed points.  
  
Q. Jim, forgive the timing, but can you kind of talk about, the ACC started
this season with a lot of hype. Can you kind of give the impression of what
you thought the league was like in the first year and how many teams you think
deserves in the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I have nothing to that, any of that.  
  
Q. Jim, can you talk about your team and how it's trending? Are you worried
about slumping heading into the NCAAs?  
COACH BOEHEIM: We played our best game of the year Sunday and that was a very
optimistic turn for us. When we didn't play well, you know, two of our last
losses, we didn't have Jerami Grant. So I just discount that completely.  
But we played extremely well at Florida State. And I thought that we would
play well here. And I don't think that we played that poorly. I think we shot
the ball badly and it's hard to recover when you're not shooting the ball
well, it's very difficult to win. The ball's not going in the basket.  
I thought we did everything we could to come back and we tried to get to the
basket more, get to the foul line, but we just have not shot the ball well
from the three‑point line the whole year.  
But we've been able to get back in the games and when we get back in them,
we've been able to make good plays down the stretch. And tonight we made two
offensive fouls and we took a bad shot when we had the two‑point lead. Tyler
got in traffic and took a bad shot and they got the ball out and we had the
foul and they made two shots. It was a really bad play and we haven't been
making those plays in the close games.  
Even the close games that we've lost, we made good plays, we make good plays
down the stretch. We missed the lay‑up in the Duke game. We made really good
plays down the stretch. But tonight, when we did get back in, you're going to
make a bad play, we made two really bad offensive plays.  
I thought we really made some unbelievable steals to get back in it. They had
the game pretty much under control. We made a couple of really good steals in
our traps and got down and gave ourselves an opportunity to win the game. But
we made some bad plays down the stretch.  
But I'm not concerned about our team. I think we played well all year. I think
we struggle shooting it. I think that's pretty well documented. But in spite
of that, we won 27 games. So I'm pretty pleased with what these guys have
done. And I believe that we'll be a very good tournament team.  
  
Q. I don't know if you've heard that the ACC tournament will move to
Barclays Center?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I haven't heard.  
  
Q. 2017, 2018. What are your thoughts?  
COACH BOEHEIM: No thoughts. I'm concerned about one thing. I think you may get
that point. I'm not speculating or talking about anything. We're concerned
about this season, how we're playing, how we're going to play this week. When
the season is done, we'll try to talk about all of this other stuff.  
  
Q. TJ Warren led the ACC this year in scoring, but tonight he played defense
on CJ throughout the game. Could you talk about what he was able to do
defensively?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I thought CJ got the shots he normally makes. I think he's the
best offensive player in the league. I think he was clearly the best player in
the league this year. And, you know, he is a tremendous offensive player. CJ
got the shots we'd like him to get.  
  
Q. Just because this is a first ‑time experience for your university
community as a whole, could you share your perception of how the fan base and
everybody else rallied around this experience compared to past experiences?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I think it's great. I thought we had huge fan support tonight.
You know, I thought we had a lot of people down here and I thought that was ‑‑
we've had great support wherever we've gone this year. The people in
Greensboro are great. They try to take care of everything you have. But it's
just a matter when you go to a tournament, there's only one thing that matters
is how you play. If you don't play well, then it's a bad experience.  
  
Q. CJ, what did you think about the shots that you got tonight and what do
you kind of attribute to not a ton of them going down?  
C.J. FAIR: Every game I take the normal shots I usually take. And today was
one of those nights where I couldn't really get going. You know, Tyler and
Jerami had a good little team man game going on. I had to fit around that and
not really force things. Because I didn't get anything going. But it was one
of those games where we didn't play good offensively and we gave up too many
easy buckets.

## March 14, 2014

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [Anthony Gill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26712)

### [Joe Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25059)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Virginia  64  
Florida State  51

  
COACH BENNETT: Okay. Well, first of all, I think hard‑fought game. I knew it
was going to be physical. I thought Joe Harris really kept us going and
Anthony Gill in the first half, and I think one of the strengths in our team
this year has been depth. So when a guy like Malcolm to have an
uncharacteristic game for him, to see those guys step up, and just getting the
contributions from the masses, that was important. And I think that was a key
in the game.  
They turned us over early. We looked shaky. They did a good job. They got on
the offensive glass early. When we shored those things up and had a level of
patience, I thought we became a better team and knowing obviously of their
talent.  
  
Q. I know you said you expected Joe to elevate his play here on the stage,
but when a few of those shots go down early, how much better do you feel
knowing, okay, it's happening?  
COACH BENNETT: No. He certainly did a good job. Joe has ‑‑ one of his
strengths is he knows when to step up. We talked about this yesterday,
actually Joe and I did. He knows when to let it come. I thought he really did
a great job early when we needed some things, showed a variety of things he
can do, which I thought was very good and I thought he was locked in
defensively as well.  
  
Q. Early on in the game Florida State had a huge advantage rebounding. Did
you get an opportunity to address that with the players or did they just kind
of solve that themselves?  
COACH BENNETT: Of course we talked about it during the timeouts. At halftime
that was our thing. I thought we were even better at the end of the first
half. I thought we were keeping them off of the glass. But our careless
turnovers or turnovers that led to opportunities for them and then their
offensive rebounding were the two areas that we had to get under control if we
were going to be successful.  
  
Q. A lot of us thought that you seemed more animated than usual on the
sidelines. Can you talk about your thoughts going in to the game?  
COACH BENNETT: Well, I mean, it was a physical game. You got to be ready. We
haven't played for a while. I think just it's‑‑ this is‑‑ not that it's okay
to not be that way during the regular season. But this is a great opportunity
for us. I thought our guys were ready. We wanted to set the tone. I was just
trying to encourage and be engaged and be passionate.  
That's what we talked about to our guys. Be passionate. Play with passion‑‑
wisdom, passion and compassion. Those were the three things we talked about
today in playing that way.  
  
Q. Tony, the 26 bench points tonight, Akil and Darion, could you maybe just
talk how big that was for ‑‑  
COACH BENNETT: You mean Anthony.  
  
Q. Sorry. Anthony and Darion.  
COACH BENNETT: I can't believe he's disrespecting you like that.  
Darion, as I said, gave us a big lift. We've seen Anthony do that. We needed
that. I thought Anthony was all over the offensive glass. They got such shot
blockers when we got into the paint and a shot went up. Anthony has good
timing and a good nose for that. Just looking at him, he had four offense
rebounds. Only one defensive rebound.  
But really that was important for us. I think as I said in the opening
statement, when Malcolm was a little off, the other guys stepped up and that
was certainly key.  
  
Q. Joe, Coach had said during the week he anticipated you elevating your
play here. Did you come in with a more aggressive mindset? I know you talked
about that a bunch.  
JOE HARRIS: I would just say you take it with the feel of the game. You kind
of have a sense of when you need to be aggressive and when not to be
aggressive.  
I thought I was getting my guys lost a little bit being able to move without
the ball. Guys like AG, Akil, DA, they're all setting very good screens and
allowed me to get some looks and I was able to constantly keep my guys in
movement which allowed me to get some open shots.  
  
Q. Anthony, talk about the motivation today. Were you aware of Virginia's
recent lack of success in this tournament?  
ANTHONY GILL: Yeah, I was here to watch the loss last year to NC State. I feel
like today we just really wanted to go out there and prove to everybody that
we deserved to be here. We deserved to be the number one seed. We went out
there and executed.  
  
Q. Anthony, to have this kind of game so close to your home town of High
Point, does that make it more special?  
ANTHONY GILL: Yeah. You know, I joke with you all of the time saying High
Point is the greatest city in the world, and I believe it. It was good to have
the fans out there for me and everything. So it was good.  
  
Q. Anthony, growing up in North Carolina, did you attend a lot of ACC
tournaments and what were some of your memories that you recall of big games
here?  
ANTHONY GILL: I really did not attend too many ACC tournament games. I really
didn't get focused or start focusing on basketball until probably my sophomore
year of high school.  
  
Q. For Joe, how often have you heard the name Ralph Sampson? How often has
that history been sort of thrown in the face of teams over the years to try
and match what was done so long ago?  
JOE HARRIS: I would say that we've been fortunate to have Ralph ‑‑ we've met
him a couple of times. He came and spoke to us I think my first year when we
played at Minnesota. His son happened to play here. He came to Charlottesville
my second year. We saw him after the Georgia Tech game this year in Atlanta.  
Other than most of the media I guess talking about the run that we made this
season and drawing comparisons, you kind of maybe hear about him a little bit
here and there. Obviously he was an unbelievable college player, but the
comparisons and all of that didn't happen at all until this season when we
started winning games.  
  
Q. Tony, Joe said he kind of went with the feel of the game. But could you
tell early he was feeling it and did you change any of your play calls to take
advantage of that at all?  
COACH BENNETT: No. As I said, I think one of Joe's strengths, when my father
and I were talking about him, he has a good feel when to let it come and when
to be assertive. He senses. He doesn't get it right all of the time. He senses
when something is required of him.  
I thought he had a good beat. Again, he said it. He was moving. I thought we
were a little stagnant early. He was moving very hard without the ball. He was
breaking the vision of some of the Florida State defenders and the guys were
setting good screens. You could see him get in that space where he could catch
it and either make the play, whether it's a shot, mid‑range game, I think he
showed a lot of things. I want him to be assertive and aggressive with
soundness, and I thought he had the right balance mark.  
  
Q. Joe and Anthony, obviously Okaro White came out and said some things,
kind of questioned the toughness of the team yesterday. How much did that
motivate you guys coming in to this game?  
ANTHONY GILL: You know, we heard about all of that stuff. And we were on our
way here when we saw it. But Coach Bennett, he kind of like reeled us back in
whenever anybody was kind of getting a little bit hyped. He told us it's not
about that. It's all about us. To stay poised throughout the whole game and
don't lose your mind out there. That's what we tried do throughout the game.  
  
Q. Anthony, second half, how did the defense interior change especially
regarding Okaro White?  
ANTHONY GILL: They were getting a lot of offensive rebounds and Coach Bennett
really challenged us at halftime to stop them from doing that. We did our
best, the X‑outs and everything like that on the ball screens, we tried to
focus in on that so he didn't get that 15‑foot jump shot.  
  
Q. Tony, can you talk about Akil on Okaro White in the second half?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, that was an important match‑up. One of Akil's strengths,
and I think Anthony has really improved in that, specifically Akil, his
mobility defensively, whether it's to guard a five, a mobile four, sometimes
even a three. And white can really‑‑ he's not shooting as many threes late in
the year, but he can stretch it with his long ball. And then he's quick off
the bounce.  
So you got to have a guy who individually can at least contain him a little
bit until our help was in position. I thought Akil's mobility and defensive
prowess showed and it was an important match‑up for us. That's why we stayed
out of foul trouble with them.  
Darion did a good job. I don't think Anthony‑‑ you didn't match up on him too
much. Those two guys, their quick ness and Anthony's mobility certainly are
important because he can get it going.  
  
Q. Coach, if you could just talk about first time since '95 that the
Cavaliers will be playing on Saturday and either Pitt or North Carolina
obviously the opponent coming up.  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, two good teams. Great opportunity. Post‑season is a
special time. To be able to come out after not playing our best against
Maryland, not poor but not our best, to come out and play a little more
indicative of how we want to play was important for us and then a chance to
advance. Knowing that this is a special tournament and for these guys to take
that next step is exciting and we'll play good teams. We'll be ready to go
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Tony, there have been a couple of reports that have come out that the ACC
tournament is close to finalizing a deal with the Barclays Center starting in
2017. What would you think of that move?  
COACH BENNETT: First of all, I would be the last to know if that was valid or
not. This is wonderful here. We'll show up and play anywhere, though. I'll
tell you that much. This is a special place.  
I went to the ACC tournament in 1995, when I was playing with the Hornets.
Mike Jaminski was my teammate and JR Reid and I heard those guys talking about
it. I remember I went in '95 with my fiancee at the time back then. It was
unbelievable. I remember sitting up there and I got my first taste of how
special the tournament is here.  
But post‑season play is special. And obviously whatever the ACC decides to do,
we'll show up and we'll be excited to play anywhere. It's going to be in D.C.,
isn't it, first in a couple of years? So I'll just focus on Greensboro and
D.C. for now. I got to slow down a little bit.  
  
Q. Joe, after the last two games, prior to the tournament you seemed to
struggle with your shooting stroke. A lot of balls were in and out it seemed
like. Today almost from the get ‑go, you seemed determined to lead the team on
offense. Talk about the mindset between that last game at Maryland and today.
  
JOE HARRIS: I would just say as a shooter, our coaches are always stressing to
have short‑term memory. You can't worry about however many shots you might
have missed in the past. Shoot the ball with the same amount of confidence no
matter if you missed eight in a row or hit eight in a row. I don't worry too
much about missing shots. I just try to go out there and I'm going to let it
go and whatever is best for our team in that situation.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

### [Dezmine Wells](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23451)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Florida State  65  
Maryland  63

  
COACH TURGEON: First of all, I'm really proud of my team. I thought we played
unbelievably hard. We didn't always play great, but we played hard. We got
down at the start, played a great first half. Dez was in foul trouble. We were
up two at half. Then we got down 10, I believe, and we really played hard, and
I thought we executed better.  
We lost to a really good team in Florida State. But it's just hard in the way
we lost. I really thought our defense was pretty good. We took Ian Miller out
of the game with that play. Charles stayed long, we zoned up, got a hand on
the ball, but kind of the way it's been all year, bounced right to their guy
and he laid it in.  
Give them credit; just another disappointing loss, but I'm not disappointed in
the effort and how hard our guys tried today because they really competed. We
executed, we just missed some open ones, just didn't happen. Some things just
aren't meant to be, and apparently today wasn't.  
  
Q. Evans' back spasms, how long had that been a problem and was there any
thought he might be able to go today?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, it happened Sunday in the game, he sat out Monday and
Tuesday, did a little bit yesterday, but we all assumed he was playing. About
40 minutes before the game, my trainer told me he wasn't playing or didn't
want to play, so I met with him, and he said his back was tight, so we didn't
play him.  
  
Q. How does this loss compare to some of the other ones you've had this
season, and how much did you guys think about the history of the ACC entering
this tournament?  
DEZ WELLS: Each loss hurts, man, regardless of the tournament that you're in,
or at least that's how it is for me. And I know for Coach Turgeon and the rest
of our guys, each loss hurts equally as bad.  
For the ACC, it was a great ride. There's no other way to put it, it was a
great ride. Me watching all the games growing up, all the rivalries and the
great games. I think this game will go down in history. I felt like our
defense, but it good enough. Fortunately for us, we've been on the other end
of those kind of plays where one of our teammates made a good play and it was
a game‑altering play. And we wanted a victory in and of itself, but like I
said, it was a great ride. We appreciate everything the ACC has done for us,
but I guess new beginnings now for us. And at this point, man, we've just got
to pick ourselves up and get ready for the next game.  
COACH TURGEON: Well, I've never been‑‑ we've lost a lot of games by two
points, one point. We had a big one Sunday, which was great. I was so happy
for the players that they could taste that.  
This one was hard because I thought we did everything right defensively, and
it kind of bounced their way. You know, at .4, why couldn't it take an extra
second and be late.  
But they all hurt, and because we were really invested‑‑ we knew what the ACC
meant to our fans, and we just weren't good enough to get the win today. But
it wasn't like we weren't trying. We competed. We knew what it meant to our
people. We're going to miss it. It's a great league, great coaches. We're
going to miss Greensboro. It was a great tournament, well run. We're going to
miss that part of it. But the good thing is we're going to another great
league, great coaches, great tournament.  
  
Q. I know last year you guys were able to get quite a bit out of that NIT
experience. Is this a team that you're hoping can get a chance to continue
playing this year?  
COACH TURGEON: I'm numb right now, so ask me in a day or two. Right now it's
been‑‑ that was tough. We'll see.  
  
Q. Dez, right after the game ended, obviously you slapped the floor and
looked really devastated. Was that the ‑‑ you heard coach say, .4, really? Was
that the first time today you thought this team really could lose or did lose?
Did you think you were going to win this thing the whole time until that
point?  
DEZ WELLS: I am never out of any fight, we are never out of any point. Even
when we took that last heave with .4 seconds, I still thought it was going to
win the game. So when it didn't go in, my heart dropped. That's the nature of
basketball. You can fight as hard as you want to, and sometimes you learn
lessons the hard way like we did today.  
Like Coach said, our defense was really good, but at times we had breakdowns
and they capitalized on the breakdowns we had and vice versa. When it came
down to it, today we weren't just good enough. Today, they were better than
us.  
  
Q. I don't know if this has been asked, but does the way the game ended sort
of sum up the way the season has gone?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah. It's been a tough year. You know, the thing I'm most
proud of, though, is a lot of teams would have quit. A lot of teams wouldn't
have played spirited basketball the way we did all the way through. We never
embarrassed ourselves since the Florida State game at Florida State where they
made 16 threes which probably would have embarrassed a lot of teams. We were
in every single game. We competed until the end. We had a lot of things to
overcome, and that's really what I'm most proud of with this team because a
lot of teams would have been so devastated they couldn't bounce back. We
continued to practice well. Our guys like each other. So that's what I take
from it.  
But I mean, come on, .4, the guy gets a dunk? I thought we played pretty good
defense and the ball was deflected. It's a tough year. Dez got all the way to
the rim and the ball rolls out, could have put us up two. We'll all take that,
but we wouldn't have been in that position with him playing the way he played
in the second half.  
  
Q. Last year you guys made a pretty deep run here and had a lot of momentum
going into the NIT. Do you expect it'll be tough to regroup if you guys have
to turn around quick or do you expect a similar intensity heading forward?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, I don't know what's going to happen but I imagine we're
going to, like we've done all season, hopefully get better, hopefully get
healthy.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Jim Larranaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13680)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

NC State  67  
Miami ‑ 58

  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, I think the game came down to one statistical category.
We did a lot of good things, but we just turned the ball over way too much.
They got 26 points off of our 15 turnovers. That basically means they went 13
for 15. Considering they made two‑point shots, we had a chance. We took the
lead. They went right to TJ Warren.  
Our intentions were to try to keep their best two players from hurting us. We
played a triangle and two the whole second half, and they still ended up with
24 and 22, so their offense was better than our defense, and our offense gave
them a lot of opportunities to score in transition. That basically was what
the game came down to.

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Brian Gregory](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19617)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Clemson  69  
Georgia Tech - 65

  
COACH GREGORY: Obviously a tough way to end a pretty good run. We did a lot of
good things tonight and it's been like many of the games that we played
against Clemson, back and forth. They had a lead and we had a lead. It usually
comes down to making plays at the end of the game. And they made more than we
did, unfortunately.  
You got some timely rebounds and some put backs and we missed some timely free
throws. At the same time, you know, our guys showed a pretty good amount of
fight and Daniel's shot there at the end of the game to send it in to overtime
and then we had a lead in overtime. A tough call there at the end. I haven't
seen it. So not going to comment on it.  
You got a lot of guys hurting in the locker room because I know the way we've
played lately and getting the guys back healthy, guys want to continue to
play. And it's unfortunate that it ends like this tonight. I appreciate
everything that Daniel Miller and Kam have given us, three years. And
unfortunately we didn't have Jason this year and then obviously Trae was a big
bonus for us and he's done a great job in our program. So those guys will be
missed.

### [Mark Gottfried](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13796)

### [T.J. Warren](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25964)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

NC State  67  
Miami  58

  
COACH GOTTFRIED: All right, first of all, let me say I'm really really proud
of my team. These young guys, most of our guys have never been involved in the
ACC tournament. They came over here and played with great courage. It was a
gutsy tough win.  
Miami I thought in the second half offensively played really good. We had some
trouble stopping them, but we stepped up and made some big plays late. TJ, as
he always does, put us right on his back. Ralston stepped up and made a couple
of huge shots for us. Key defensive rebounds late in the game I thought. We're
excited for these young guys to do what they've done this year. I'm really
proud of them.  
  
Q. Coach, the role of freshman, Ralston, he did a tremendous job tonight.
How could he handle that pressure as just a freshman scoring so many points?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Ralston is a junior. Ralston has set out transfer. All of our
guys, our point guards, Tyler and Cat combined, freshman and a sophomore, they
get 11 assists with no turnovers between the two of them. Cat had seven, Tyler
had four, but they didn't turn the ball over. Young players.  
We forget sometimes TJ is just a sophomore. He's just a young player too. Step
in this environment, in a tournament setting, Lennard played big for us. Kyle
made a couple of nice ones, all of those guys. So great to see the young guys
step up.  
  
Q. TJ, how much pressure does it take off of you especially when they're
playing box and one a lot for Ralston or somebody else to provide what they
did tonight offensively?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Ralston stepped up and made a lot of big shots. My teammates,
they do a great job finding me. I just keep working and keep moving with the
basketball.  
  
Q. Coach and TJ, can you talk about a second chance now with Syracuse for
tomorrow and obviously that was such a close game up there, I know you're
probably looking forward to a rematch?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: First of all, I think they're really a great team. They spent
more weeks I think at number one than anybody else in the country. We played
well up there. But we let one get away. We were in a position to win and we
didn't close it out.  
I think with Jerami Grant back now, he missed some time, I think they're
playing with great confidence and they're really good. And the only time they
really haven't been good is when he was out. So it's a great opportunity for
our players to play against a great team. So I think our guys are going to be
excited about it.  
  
Q. Coach, could you speak about your team's defensive effort tonight, mainly
with the disparity in turnovers that you created and also the number of points
you created from those?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Well, I thought defensively we were good at times. There was
a stretch in the second half we had a hard time stopping them. The good news
was we were scoring. That was okay. We were trading baskets, but we had a
difficult time.  
But I thought late in the game, in the last three minutes, our defense was
better. Probably the best it had been all night. Maybe the first couple
minutes of the game. Miami is a tough team to defend. They take the ball to
the basket really well off the dribble. They get you spread out sometimes. And
they're hard to guard. But I thought late in the game our guys stepped up
defensively and really did a nice job.  
  
Q. TJ, I think the previous question they wanted your feedback and thoughts
about Syracuse?  
T.J. WARREN: It's going to be a great opportunity to play them again. We're
going to be up to play them, we're going to come out aggressive, with a lot of
energy and be ready to play.  
  
Q. What did you learn from the last time you played those guys back at home
and how much motivation was the way that game ended for you guys tonight?  
T.J. WARREN: It was a tough one to take down. We just kept our heads up and
kept moving on. Looking forward to playing them again and it's going to be a
good one. Can't wait.  
  
Q. What did you learn from the first time you played Miami a couple of weeks
ago in Raleigh and how much motivation was the way that game ended to get
another shot at those guys tonight?  
T.J. WARREN: They still won at home. We didn't come out aggressive there. We
let them dribble drives and easy layups and we adjusted that on the defensive
end tonight.  
  
Q. TJ, the last three minutes you guys went on a run after you fell behind,
I think right around the three ‑minute mark. Did something kind of click there
when they took the lead that told you guys it was time to step it up a little
bit?   
T.J. WARREN: We adjusted that on the defensive end tonight and pretty good to
come out with the win.  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I don't know if there was any one thing. I thought
defensively we were a little better and, like I said, we stepped up and made
big shots. TJ had a couple, Ralston Turner I thought had a big three during
that stretch. Gave us some momentum, kind of got us lifted up a little bit.
But we buckled down late in the game. That helped us.  
  
Q. Mark, Miami obviously pretty aware of Ralston after some of the shots he
hit against them this year. They really seemed to chase him around. He still
was able to find some openings and some step backs, things like that. Was that
something that you had talked to him about coming in to the game in terms of
these guys are going to be on you? Is that something that he can take into
Syracuse or is that a completely different scenario with the zone?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Miami zoned us a lot both times we played them. And with TJ
and Ralston, those guys have seen the triangle in two, they've seen box and
ones. You know, we've seen that a lot this year.  
We keep emphasizing they got to keep moving without the ball. You can't allow
those things to slow you down. I think that's kind of how they got open
because they had great movement without the ball. Even if the ball went to the
post, just keep moving, keep cutting.  
TJ got a nice layup there from Jordan. With both Ralston and TJ, teams have
done that to us a lot. Syracuse is not going to do that. They're going to play
our normal zone. We've seen enough of that too this year we'll be prepared and
ready.  
  
Q. TJ, just like Coach was saying, you were moving a lot on the baseline and
working off those screens. When you think back to that Syracuse game, did they
make it difficult for you to get those same looks off the screens from one
side of the court to the other?  
T.J. WARREN: They adjusted some shots, but you just got to stay with it.  
  
Q. You called a timeout with 2:33 left in the game, the score is tied and
then you go to TJ and then you go to Turner over on the lane right in front of
you. Were both of those called plays that you were looking in both of those
situations?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Well, we were able with some timeouts left to call some
specific things. I wanted TJ to have the ball in the block. We were in the
bonus. I felt if he got it on the block he could score or get fouled, one of
those two things.  
Then we came down to the next one and called one for Ralston where we knocked
down the shot and hit the three. That's terrific execution. We've been in
close games. We know late in the game you got to really execute well and get
the right shots. I thought our guys did a nice job of that.  
  
Q. TJ, on the very first possession of the game, you had three different
Miami players guarding you man ‑to‑man because of some switches, and then
later it seemed like the freshman Davon Reed was on you much of the time a
least. Do you even notice a lot and change your approach depending on who's on
you or are you so kind of zoned in to your game that you're not paying
attention to that?   
T.J. WARREN: Just find out little ways to score on the basketball.  
  
Q. Mark, I apologize if somebody else asked this, were TJ and Ralston
playing off each other in some ways where the defense had to make a choice or
was there more balance on the floor?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I just think they both did a really good job of moving
without the ball. We emphasize that more than anything. We knew they might
play box and one or triangle or two. They've done it before. Make sure those
guys are still involved. I don't want those two guys to just stand and not be
involved.  
Ralston did a great job of that. I thought TJ did. Even when the ball went to
the post to Jordan, TJ kept moving, cut to the basket, got a layup I thought
at a key time. But the movement without the ball I thought was critical for
us. They did a nice job with that.  
  
Q. After the Syracuse game up there, I guess you guys fly back that night.
What is that night like for you? Are you up until 3:00 in the morning watching
film? Were you able to put it out of your head? What was that like once you
fly back and go to bed? What were you thinking about?  
T.J. WARREN: It was a tough one to think. You got to move on. There's a lot of
games to be played. So you can't be caught up on one game. You got to keep
moving forward. Stay positive.  
  
Q. The ACC started this season with a lot of hype, but it's been kind of a
top ‑heavy league in terms of the top four being ranked. How much do you feel
like the ACC's reputation could help or hurt you with the NCAA Tournament
chances? And how much do you think this ACC run could help you?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Here's what I have found interesting. I think as of
yesterday, there was nine ACC teams in the top 80 in the RPI. I look around
the country and I see some other leagues and I see teams that are 599 or even
below 500. I'm not sure our league has gotten the respect it deserves.  
For example, Boston College who was near the bottom can go to Syracuse and
win, as did Georgia Tech. Our league doesn't get the credit for the depth of
quality teams. We added Syracuse and Pittsburgh to a league that was already
good. We had 15 teams in our league.  
And the depth in our league, you know, go to Clemson and try to win at
Clemson, find out how hard that is. At Pittsburgh, or even go to Wake Forest
and try to win there, which they beat Duke, Carolina and NC State. Yet it
doesn't seem like our league gets credit for ‑‑ as you said, it seems like
it's a top‑heavy league. And I don't think it is.  
We have good teams at the top. Syracuse spent most of the year number one in
the country. I don't care who you are. Go try to beat Duke. At Duke you got
your hands full.  
This is a great league. We got good teams all the way down through and, you
know, hopefully we'll get rewarded for that. I don't know. We'll see.  
  
Q. Coach, I apologize if you already talked about Syracuse, but obviously a
chance to see them for the second time. I'm sure you didn't even talk about it
because you had to pay back Miami first.  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Well, it's not about payback. It's about opportunity. And
we've got an opportunity tomorrow that is golden. Couldn't ask for a better
one.  
I don't think anybody spent more time at number one this year than Syracuse.
We played them very tough up there. And we felt pretty bad walking out of that
locker room that night. So we get another opportunity and it's a golden
opportunity. So it's up to us and we got to come ready to play against a
really good team tomorrow. With Grant back, they're a Final Four team. They've
shown it all year long.  
  
Q. You had Ralston Turner get 22points. What does that say about the
perception that states a one ‑man team, you guys have depth and such?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Well, TJ is a great player. We all know it. Our players know
TJ is a great player. But he needs other people to help him score. Ralston
tonight stepped up.

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [Lamar Patterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24439)

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Pittsburgh  84  
Wake Forest ‑55

  
COACH DIXON: I'm just really proud of our guys and how we played. Really
unselfish was the first thing I said to them afterwards, 20 assists, and we
were still unselfish all the way to the end. It says a lot of things about our
team. I think our team is playing its best basketball. We've won four out of
five. We've now got as many wins on the road as anybody in the country. We've
played well away from home, and we're looking forward to the opportunity we
have tomorrow.  
But they played, they battled, and now we're seeing them at 100 percent and
back to where they were. Kind of proud of how these guys have played, these
two seniors, and looking forward again to a chance to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, Devin Thomas had a great game yesterday. How were you guys able to
slow him down? Looked like your length really bothered him.  
COACH DIXON: We were really concerned about him. Him and Williams were the
guys we were really focused on, and Thomas was a guy we wanted to double‑team.
Obviously, we came out, we were aggressive. And we wanted to keep the ball out
of his hands, but when he did get it, make it tough for him to play. And I
thought a big double‑team early when we got the steal, took it from him on the
double‑team was key. He's a very good player, very physical player, tough
player, but I thought we did some good things to take him away from it, and I
thought our defense was good on him for the most part.  
  
Q. Lamar, could you talk ‑‑ Talib got off to a real good start today. How
does that change your team when he's playing like that? How does it change
what you guys are able to do?   
LAMAR PATTERSON: That's what we want to do, we want to get him going. It's our
game plan every game. He's a big factor in what we want to do every game,
defensively and offensively. He got off to a great start. He's a leader, he's
a senior, and when you see him going, it just gets the ball rolling.
Everything was clicking.  
  
Q. Talib, what does a game like this do for you guys to get you rolling
headed into the rest of the tournament?  
TALIB ZANNA: You know, just get ‑‑ like he said, they come out focused and
ready. They really get us ready for this game, and we were really prepared and
focused. I think from the freshmen to the seniors, everybody was into it. The
energy, you can see the energy on the bench and everybody was really ready to
go.  
  
Q. Lamar, for you guys that have played so many close games, what does it do
for you having a 29 ‑point win?   
LAMAR PATTERSON: It feels good. We won convincingly. We were able to get some
of the guys who haven't played that much in there, and it gave some of the
guys who usually do play a rest at the end of the game. It was good. That's
how we want to win every game, but it's not possible in basketball. We'll just
take this and take the momentum and get ready for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jamie, you guys got a bunch of offensive rebounds real early in the game
and turned them into baskets. Did that sort of set the tone for the way that
you were able to play the rest of the game?  
COACH DIXON: We've made it very clear we've got to out‑rebound people, and
we've got to have good offense to get offensive rebound opportunities, so I
thought we ran good offense, good sets against the zone and got good looks. I
thought Talib was really good passing out of the high post area, got us some
good looks. And the shots we did miss, we knew they were going up, and we were
able to get to that weak side and offensive rebounding position.  
I just think really we moved the ball well. I was amazed at halftime at our
field goal percentage was 48 percent, and I felt, like, since we'd taken all
good shots, it would have been higher than that. But we had missed open shots,
but that allowed us to get offensive rebounds. But our execution I thought was
very good. Our unselfishness was evident from the start until the finish, and
that allowed us to get the 14 offensive rebounds, especially the bunch early.  
  
Q. Lamar, in the second half, your scoring really helped propel the lead
into the 20s and keep it there. Coming out of halftime, what did you want to
do to continue how you came into the half and then get out ahead for good?  
LAMAR PATTERSON: We just wanted to play our game, take the open shots, move
the ball. I was on the other hand of getting the easy looks and knocking them
down. And it was a good way to start the half for the team, and we did what we
were supposed to do, held onto the lead and got the W.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about whether you felt like this was back to playing
the way that you had prior to the injuries and the things that bothered this
team in mid ‑season? Did you feel like you guys were back to playing the way
that you had early in the season and the way you started ACC play?   
LAMAR PATTERSON: It was a good win. Yeah, I guess you could say that a little
bit. But like Coach said, everyone is healthy, everyone is ready to go. We're
dialed in. Today was just a sign of that. We've got to just bring the same
energy and same effort tomorrow, and then we'll see how it goes.  
TALIB ZANNA: You know, we came out, me and Lamar‑‑ middle of the season, Lamar
was kind of hurt. I was hurt from my ankle and his wrist, and I think we're
100 percent right now. We're ready to go. We've just got to come out ready for
tomorrow and get the win.  
  
Q. Coach, when you were talking about road wins and neutral site wins,
that's kind of Selection Sunday talk. Do you have a real concern that your
résumé is not getting the respect it deserves?  
COACH DIXON: Not really. I mean, we've done what‑‑ obviously 24 wins and now a
tournament win. I guess the message I was giving to our players is how well we
have played on the road, and now we're going to be playing on the road the
rest of the way in our minds. So that's what we've turned it into.  
We've won close games on the road, which is what you're going to need to do in
this tournament play. And that's really been our message going forward here.
We've won a lot of close games. We've beat good teams on the road in neutral
court situations, too, so‑‑ and I think it's a combination of we felt
confident, we've played well on the road. But we had some home games where
guys weren't healthy and weren't playing their best, and we obviously played
through it, didn't play as well, but now we are.  
  
Q. Speaking of tournament résumé, do you feel like today was a must ‑win
game in that situation, and do you feel like tomorrow is a game you have to
win to get into the tournament, or is it more just a matter of are you
focusing strictly on the ACC?   
COACH DIXON: Yeah, we're just trying to win every game like we always have.
We've obviously done a lot of things. 24 wins and now a 12th win in the ACC. I
think that goes without saying.  
Our thing is we're playing our best basketball. We've got to be playing‑‑
we're healthy now, we're playing‑‑ I don't got a guy sitting here with a taped
hand shooting jump shots, and that's never‑‑ a right hand taped is never a
good thing, and Talib is now jumping and finishing better. We're playing our
best basketball right now, and that's our feeling. Our practice has showed
that the last three days. We had three guys that had very good practices, and
everybody was out there. We hadn't had that. We were practicing without our
guys, without these two guys, and it caught up to us. Now we're back to where
we were, and it's evident by our wins.  
We lost to good teams, too, at the same time. We lost to good teams in some
close games.  
  
Q. This is obviously a new experience for Pitt as an ACC Tournament
participant. I don't know how much you see beyond the game itself, but you had
a lot of fans here. They were loud, they were proud. Do you have a sense of
how your travelling, the excitement level compared to what you were used to in
the Big East among Panther Nation?  
COACH DIXON: I think in a lot of ways this is going to grow for us, and I
think people are going to be sometimes surprised. I think we've seen it
already in games we've played on the road, whether it be at NC State or down
in Maryland. But we have a lot of Pitt people throughout the Southeast region,
and we've known that, and we've seen that. And our demand for tickets for the
ACC, I think, went beyond what we had in the Big East prior to. I think it's
hard to get to that Thursday game at noon or 2:00, but I think you're going to
see‑‑ because of a lot of Pittsburgh people moving south to the southeast,
we've seen a lot of fans and a lot of interest.  
It's different, there's no question. You've got different fans, I think, than
the regular fans. I don't have as many family members, so it's different in
that regard. But I think we're going to have the same numbers and maybe more
when it's all said and done, and once we've figured out the routine.  
  
Q. What do you remember about the first North Carolina game, and what will
you need to do differently tomorrow?  
LAMAR PATTERSON: What I remember is we just weren't as effective as we should
have been. We had a lot of early foul trouble in the first half, slowed us
down a little bit. But I just think that that game is going to be a nice
rematch to get back out there and play against them again. It should be
exciting.  
COACH DIXON: I remember we lost. That's what I remember. I think we're a
better team now than we were. Guys were struggling at that point. I think
we're a better team, and we need to show it. But it's easy to say: We've got
to go do something about it, and we've got to play well. They're good, very
good, and they're playing well, as well.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Jeff Bzdelik](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13815)

### [Coron Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26612)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Pittsburgh  84  
Wake Forest ‑55

  
COACH BZDELIK: Give Pittsburgh a lot of credit; they hit us right between the
eyes, and we were on our heels throughout the entire game. We had some shots
early on that fell for us yesterday and didn't fall for us today. And there
was separation because of the fact we couldn't keep them off the boards, and
tried a variety of defenses. We just couldn't keep them from getting to the
paint. I think they had 27 points on lay‑ups in the first half, and we never
recovered.  
  
Q. Jeff, did you see the energy today that maybe you guys had yesterday and
just how a bad start can have a domino effect a little bit?  
COACH BZDELIK: Yeah, we were always on our heels. All we did was discuss
rebounding, and that was the No.1 key. And I think they had, what, three
offensive rebounds in the first three or four minutes after we got stops. I
knew we'd have some match‑up problems defensively, so we went with the zone.
It was effective against Duke, and it just‑‑ we just couldn't stop them, to be
honest with you.  
And then the inability to make some shots and to score, we just lost some
confidence, and we've been fragile with that throughout the course of the year
at times. You got the score you got.  
  
Q. How do you foresee this next couple of weeks going? Will you meet with
Ron? Will you guys talk?  
COACH BZDELIK: I'm just going to answer questions about the game.  
  
Q. Jeff, after the way you talked about Travis yesterday and how much he's
meant to this program over the last four years, how disappointing is it ‑‑ or
frustrating is it ‑‑ to see him go out with a game like he had tonight?   
COACH BZDELIK: Yeah, I'm sure Travis had a lot of emotion, and you know, he
had some good looks, didn't go down. And, yeah, we have to remember these are
young people that care deeply, and we went from a very emotional high last
night, yesterday, to a frustrating, so to speak, day today. They're young
people who care deeply, and, hey, it's tough when you're out there and things
aren't going well for you to battle through it. Yeah, it's tough for Travis to
have a game like this at this point.  
  
Q. Jeff, was this Travis's and Coron's last game at Wake Forest, and would
you entertain the notion of a CBI invitation?  
COACH BZDELIK: That's for the administration. Our only focus really was today,
this game. We had intentions to win it, and to not even think about a CBI, for
example.  
Now, what the administration's feel is about that, I don't know, I haven't
discussed that with anybody.  
  
Q. Coach, we saw Pat Riley in attendance today. You had a couple stops with
him in your career. Was he here as a byproduct of his friendship with you or
was he here by chance?  
COACH BZDELIK: I didn't know he was here, and I'm sad that he was here to see
that. (Smiling).  
  
Q. If you had a chance to play again, would you like to play a postseason
game?  
COACH BZDELIK: We certainly don't want to go out like this.  
  
Q. Coron, what made things so difficult for y'all to find shots today? What
were they doing defensively to really deny you guys good looks?  
CORON WILLIAMS: I know from me, at times they were denying me, and when I came
off screens, you know, the guys were hedging real hard, so it was tough for me
to get good looks. But Travis had a couple open looks. He wasn't able to
finish those, and that's all we can ask for is just good, open looks.  
You know, I'm not going to be able every game to come out and have as many
open looks as I did yesterday, and other guys just have to step up.  
  
Q. Coron, it looked like, at the end of the first half, both you and Codi
were able to get to the basket a little bit. What happened there, and why
wasn't that as effective in the second half?  
CORON WILLIAMS: Well, they had a few breakdowns, and I found myself a few gaps
that I could get through, and Codi, he's great in transition, and he's a
driver, and he was able to get in the lane and finish like he usually does.  
You know, we just took advantage of their breakdowns.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Brad Brownell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21640)

### [DaMarcus Harrison](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26703)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Clemson  69  
Georgia Tech - 65

  
COACH BROWNELL: First of all, I want to thank those of you that are still here
following us. Really proud of our team. Just found a way to win when we really
weren't playing as well as we needed to to win.  
I thought Georgia Tech, give their kids a lot of credit, their coaches a lot
of credit. They outcompeted us the first 20minutes, really hurt us on the
boards.  
Thought we were a little nervous offensively and turned the ball over a lot
but settled into the game a little bit better and just tried to fight. Got
down I think it was 49‑40, got the guys into a timeout and somehow KJ and Rod
kind of rallied them a little bit, Damarc kind of rallied our troops a little
bit.  
We started to up our defense. I thought Damarc moving over to Golden helped
us. His size I thought slowed some things down for them. And then we just
found a way to get a few buckets and to find a way to win in overtime after we
lost the lead was really special, especially since we've been in a couple of
these kind of games last week.  
  
Q. To both Coach and Damarcus. How difficult was it to bounce back after
what happened against Pittsburgh? And, Brad, what does it say about your kids
that they were able to, when things got tough at the end, bounce back and pull
it out?  
COACH BROWNELL: Yeah, the Pitt loss was a brutal one in a lot of ways.
Obviously the inbounds play, the call at the end, questionable call at the end
on whether it was good or not.  
But to be honest with you, we moved past it. We had a meeting on Sunday where
we just talked about the regular season was over. And it was start of a new
season and we needed to play our best basketball now.  
We celebrated what we did during the season. We accomplished a lot. We did a
lot more than people expected and really most of it was just doing what we did
tonight. I don't know that we're more talented or better coached or anything
else. I think we out‑tough people sometimes and find ways to win and that's a
great characteristic to talk about with your team.  
DAMARCUS HARRISON: Like Coach said, we looked at it like it was a new season.
It's always great to be able to play another game after a loss like that. I
think we, in the second half, we came out and competed better. It showed like
we fought back against that loss against Pitt. We're still in this thing to
play a season and win the fight and win more games to have our goal to advance
in March.  
  
Q. Coach, KJ had a rough shooting night, 4 out of 15. First of all, what do
you think kind of led to that, secondly, how did he do it to be able to
overcome that and still have winning plays for you guys?  
COACH BROWNELL: He is battling right now. He's had a shoulder injury for about
a week now, or two. Unfortunately, I think it's progressively getting a little
more problematic.  
We're trying to rest him and do some things to help him with it. But there's
no question it's bothering him. So I think that was part of it. I think you
got to give the Georgia Tech coaches and players credit. We've played each
other three times now. When you play each other this many times, I think you
begin to know each other's strengths, weaknesses. You know a lot of their
plays and know what everybody's trying to do and it makes it hard. It makes it
harder to score.  
I think what needs to be pointed out is KJ found a way to get to the free
throw line 11 times, get fouled, attack the basket, make ten free throws and
still have 18points and six rebounds without playing his best.  
  
Q. Brad, there was a stretch with about six, seven minutes to go, you were
down by six, Jaron Blossomgame scored six points. I think he had a steal and a
rebound. Can you talk about that contribution and that stretch, how important
it was to get back in the game?  
COACH BROWNELL: I think it was critical. Jaron, he is a freshman who most
people don't know, Jaron, red shirt freshman, that broke his leg. He had the
Kevin Ware injury the bone broke, came out of his leg. He had to have two
surgeries last week, got infected. So he's battled, you know, through a lot of
difficult things and this year hasn't been easy for him at times. I think he
still sometimes isn't 100percent.  
But he's a competitive young man. He really fights. He's only six‑seven, about
215, and he's in there guarding guys six‑eight, six‑nine. I thought his
rebounding late on both ends of the floor were really big. He made three out
of four free throws, which we needed those. So I thought he and Damarcus made
huge free throws down the stretch. His play really gave us a shot in the arm
there down the stretch and helped us win.  
  
Q. Damarcus, can you think back to the Duke game? I know it was a long time
ago. Obviously you were excited about it at the time. Now in the context of
the whole season, what did that win mean to you guys?  
DAMARCUS HARRISON: I think that was probably like our best win so far in the
regular season. It was a big conference win for us. But I just think it was
big and it was important.  
But looking forward to the game tomorrow. I just think we just got to play
with energy. And I think that's what we did the first game that helped us beat
them at home. We had a lot of energy that game. I think we outrebounded them
and we hustled a lot more than they did.  
  
Q. Coach, can you kind of think back to the first Duke game and what you
guys did that day? Are you playing that way now, do you think, or what about
tomorrow nights's game?  
COACH BROWNELL: I don't know that either team is playing the way we did in
January. Hopefully we're both playing better. I certainly think Duke is.  
It was a huge win for us because it gave our guys a bunch of confidence. It
was early in the ACC season. I think the win reassured our team when we do the
things that we need to do and play at a high level, we can play with a lot of
teams in this league.  
Duke is one of the marquee programs in the country, not just in the ACC, and
to have a chance to compete against those guys is something you really look
forward to and respect. And so when you do play well and have a good result,
it certainly means a lot, not only for you and your team, but for your
program.

### [Boris Bojanovsky](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26660)

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

### [Aaron Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26661)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Florida State  65  
Maryland  63

  
COACH HAMILTON: Maryland was a very difficult game for us to prepare for
because they've got two powerful guys inside. They have three guys that can
really take the ball off the dribble in Wells and Faust and Allen. And then
what you normally have is some good perimeter shooters so they test all your
defensive principles.  
First half they had seven threes and obviously it concerned us. I think they
got one the second half. I think it probably made the biggest difference. They
had a couple good looks. The ball ‑‑ shots just didn't fall so we were very
fortunate.  
I thought our guys fought very hard and we did a good job of executing in
second half, a lot better than we did in the first half. First part of the
game I think we had five unforced turnovers and we gave up, I think, four or
five offensive rebounds in the first half, and they had scored on at least
three of those offensive rebounds. I thought we did a much better job in the
second half. When they missed, we got rebounds, and I thought we did a much
better job of executing and being patient. I looked down and saw we had 19
turnovers, but I still thought that we executed very well, especially down the
stretch.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations on the victory. I was wondering if you could take
just a second and talk about the final play as far as how it was set up and
how it looked to you from your seat?  
COACH HAMILTON: Well, what we wanted to do was run a double house screen, and
we just didn't want to call a timeout. They didn't have any more timeouts and
it allowed them to set the defense to tell them to do what we already told
them to do in the first place, so I thought our guys showed a lot of patience.
And I thought Ian showed a lot of experience being a senior. He was very
patient, and we got the double ball screen with just enough time on the clock
for us to get one shot up maybe and a rebound. That's what the plan was.  
When Ian came off the screen, he saw Okaro in front of the lane, and it was
not a clean catch by Okaro so he bounce passed the ball to Boris and he
finished the play, which was a very big play for us.  
  
Q. Boris, can you talk about the emotion? You were obviously fired up
getting that in the last second, just what was going through your mind at that
point?  
BORIS BOJANOVSKY: I mean, it was a great feeling. It was an important game for
us, so I was really happy.  
  
Q. Boris, you're obviously very tall, but there are some guys that they have
that are very physical, really strong players. How do you feel like you
handled that challenge getting thrown around a little bit?  
BORIS BOJANOVSKY: It is tough, you know, but if I want to play on this level
I've got to get used to it.  
  
Q. Boris, just as important, I guess, as the dunk were the two free throws.
Having missed the two previous to that, what were you thinking when you went
to the line?  
BORIS BOJANOVSKY: I didn't think about the two free throws before. I just know
I got to make them, so I was trying to be confident, and I hit both of them.  
  
Q. Coach, could you first address the next match ‑up with Virginia, and then
for Ian and Aaron, the importance of penetrating against that UVA defense?   
COACH HAMILTON: Well, obviously, Virginia was the No.1 team in our league. To
go through our league only losing two games is basically unheard of. That just
shows a little bit about the maturity of that team, how well they played
together. I thought they might be the most unselfish team in America where
they always are playing to each other and creating easy, high‑percentage shots
for each other. It's like they play without an ego but with a tremendous
amount of intensity and focus. They're very disciplined, and they tried to
take certain spots on the floor away from you, and they're determined. They're
sound. They don't make very many mistakes, and they don't beat themselves.
They deserve the season that they had because I felt the team really came
together, and I think they've taught a lot of us a lesson.  
We all want to try to get our team to that magic level, that mental, emotional
level, that allows everybody to be in sync, and that's the kind of team I
think Virginia is.  
AARON THOMAS: I think the first couple games as a team we didn't do a good job
of being able to handle their defense because they play that packed line
defense. I think now we understand and learned a lot from those two games. I
think we've got to do a better job of penetrating the pitch, because they play
that packed line defense.  
As long as we go out there, play team ball, make the extra pass, that's what
you have to do against Virginia, and I think we should be all right.  
IAN MILLER: First and foremost, I think Virginia is a great team and I've got
a lot of respect for them. But in the beginning of the season, I think we were
very young minded and didn't understand how to be patient against them. You
can't really play how we just want to go. You've got to really take your time
and really mentally prepare for it rather than just physically go out there
and play. We want to just go back tonight and get some treatment and watch
some film and get ready to play them.  
  
Q. Coach, in the current state of affairs where it's 24/7 around the clock,
are you in, are you out, I know that has to wear on you. My question to you is
what message will you tell your kids about the Virginia game versus the big
picture?  
COACH HAMILTON: To be very honest with you, we don't talk very much about it
because we're only worried about those things we can control.  
Now, obviously it's in your face every day, but bracketology in and out has
become a sport, and we all can play it, and we don't judge. We can be wrong,
we can be right, and it makes for great conversation. But most of the people
who are talking, they don't have a vote. They're not in the room, so it
doesn't really matter when it boils down to it. So we try to not pay a whole
lot of attention to it, but try to internalize our emotions and understand
that the only way we're going to have some postseason opportunities is to take
care of the task at hand, and that's been our approach all year long.  
  
Q. I think you had four guys with two fouls at the half. How important was
it to get through that half and still be in the game?  
COACH HAMILTON: That was probably my biggest concern of the evening, being
able to‑‑ I've got four guys, and we're not as deep as we've been in the past,
and it was a real concern of mine. It might go unnoticed but I thought Ojo
gave us some good minutes in there. He didn't have a whole lot of statistics
but he had four rebounds in, I think, eight minutes, and Joell Hopkins came in
the game and gave us three points at a critical point of the game. And Marquez
came in and really did a real good job defensively in the last minute, so we
were very fortunate with that many guys in foul trouble to be able to go in
only down two at halftime. That was a very important period for us.  
  
Q. For Ian and Aaron, Seth Allen had 32 against you in College Park and had
a big first half today. What did you guys do in the second half to frustrate
him?  
IAN MILLER: Had to man up. He was crucifying us. He's a great guard. We just
had to go in at halftime and regroup and play team defense like we usually
play. We didn't really change up the way we play defense, we just had to play
it a little bit harder and a little bit smarter.  
AARON THOMAS: That 32 first game woke us up. I think first half he came out
real hot, like Ian said, we didn't make no adjustments. I think we came out
second half, played aggressive and played hard, and was able to defend him.
You know, like I said, first half he had a real good half. I think second half
we played team defense and was more aggressive and played hard.  
COACH HAMILTON: I also think he was limping around a little bit. I thought he
might have turned an ankle or something. But I saw him a couple times
grimacing like maybe he had bumped his knee, so he wasn't quite as fluid as he
was the first half. It could have been caused by maybe a slight injury he had.  
  
Q. Coach, being from North Carolina, growing up and thinking about the
historical aspect of this game today, finishing off Maryland and the last time
we'll probably see them ever again in the ACC Tournament, just some thoughts
about the historical aspect of this game.  
COACH HAMILTON: To be very honest with you, I didn't have any thought about
that at all going into this game. We just wanted to win. It might be
historical to some other people, but it meant very little to us. We just
wanted to go win. It was a very important game for us in terms of where we
are. When you think about it, it might mean something down the road, but for
us we only was concerned with trying to win and move on to the next game.  
Now, when you look back at it probably as adults, Maryland has been a premier
program in the ACC for many, many years. And they've had some of the greatest
coaches with Lefty and his personality and what he brought, and Lefty coaching
at Davidson for a while and moving up to Maryland, kind of had a little North
Carolina flavor in it. And he was always a colorful guy, and I thought he
brought a lot to the ACC.  
And then Gary with his aggressive style, so Maryland has meant a lot to the
legacy of the ACC. But they're moving on, and we're going to wish them well.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2014

  

### [James Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19678)

### [Devin Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26615)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Miami  57  
Virginia Tech  53

  
COACH JOHNSON: That was a hard‑fought ACC Tournament basketball game. I
thought both teams came in and battled right down to the last play of the
game. I thought our guys came out ready to play right from the start. I
thought we got off to a good start, got the ball to Eddie. He knocked some
shots down. We got off to a good start defensively, took a lead. They fought
back, took the lead, and then second half they came out, took a lead, we
fought back, and then it was a great game down the stretch and they were able
to make plays.  
I thought their veterans, they stepped up and made plays down the stretch, but
got to give them a lot of credit. After losing to us twice in the regular
season, to be able to come out with the victory today. I've got to give my
guys a lot of credit. They fought, they competed hard all season long, and
they did it again tonight and left it all out on the floor, and we just didn't
make plays. But I thought the effort was there, and they really did a great
job competing. We just left a couple plays out there on the floor tonight.  
  
Q. Devin, obviously you guys missed four shots and missed a couple of free
throws there in the last three minutes. Do you feel like this is maybe a win
you could have had here, and what was the problem, kind of, scoring down the
stretch there?  
DEVIN WILSON: Yeah, for sure I thought this was a game we could win. We just
didn't seem to make the plays at the end. We've got to finish those plays,
which we normally do, but I give Miami a lot of credit. They played good
defense at the end, made us take tough shots, but we've got to be able to
capitalize.  
  
Q. With Joey going to the line, what was your thoughts? Obviously 36
percent, I think, for the year, and also how big an impact was the foul
trouble he got in in the first half?  
COACH JOHNSON: Yeah, the first question about him stepping to the line, I
thought that he was going to knock them down. At the Pittsburgh game he
knocked two big free throws down late in the stretch, and that basically was
going through my mind. I told him knock these two free throws down and then
we'll lead and go from there.  
Him getting in early foul trouble was a huge impact for us defensively and on
the offensive end. He's our go‑to guy right now in the post‑offensive end. And
he's a veteran guy in the middle of our zone or on the wing in the zone, and
him just sitting on the sideline being on the bench for so long hurt us on
both ends.  
  
Q. Coach, I was very impressed with your team's effort out there. I know
it's not a win, and we're not talking about moral victories, but what are you
most proud of what your guys did out there for 40 minutes?  
COACH JOHNSON: Just the most proud of the way they competed and they fought
and they gave effort, and that's something that those guys have been doing all
season long. They could have easily packed it in. They could have easily
packed it in. And we talked about this is a new season, and you come out and
let's play like it is. It's a one‑game tournament, and they laid it all on the
line and played hard, competed, played with a lot of effort, a lot of energy,
and they left it all out there tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, Jarell was able to find his shot, especially outside the first
half. Was there anything ‑‑ was it more defensively what they did or was
Jarell kind of‑‑ did he lose his hot streak in the second half?   
COACH JOHNSON: Well, I thought he had some really good looks in the second
half. I thought maybe fatigue set in, legs were a little bit tired in the
second half. Obviously had to play a lot of minutes, didn't come out of the
game. But they were wide open shots, shots that he probably, if he had them
again, he'll knock them down.  
  
Q. James, I'm guessing at the end there that's what you wanted. Devin, I'm
sure, intentionally missed the second free throw and Jarell got a good look
close to the basket.  
COACH JOHNSON: Yeah, we wanted Devin to miss the second one. We got a free
throw play that we worked on early on in the season, and we had to pull it out
tonight. Devin did a great job of missing the free throw, perfect. You've got
to miss it perfect. He did a good job of missing it. Eddie did a great job of
getting in there for the offensive rebound and had the ball ‑‑ didn't have a
good look, though. The trees were around him, and I thought he just powered
right up, and I was hoping we'd get a lay‑up or get a foul out of it.  
  
Q. Swoope, 21 for them. I think he had 20 points in the first two games.
Obviously it was a tough match ‑up for you athletically. What did they do to
feature him to self?  
COACH JOHNSON: He was more aggressive, and they ran the stuff they usually
run. He was more aggressive driving the ball to the hole, and I thought that
the veteran did‑‑ the old guy in him came out. He's a guy that's been around a
long time, and he played like he didn't want to go home tonight. He was a
tough match‑up for us. He drove the ball, and we knew he was athletic. He's a
driver, and he did a great job on the glass rebounding the basketball for
them, too.  
But I thought his veteran‑‑ his leadership and how he played like a veteran
guy that didn't want to go home.  
  
Q. Just down the stretch, the way you guys kind of mixed moments of great
execution and then moments of kind of head scratching. Did that feel like just
this last month in a nutshell, how the end of the game went where you couldn't
seem to catch a break even though you had an opening? How were those last
minutes for you?  
COACH JOHNSON: Yeah, you know, we've seen it in close games down the stretch.
We've seen it. We had some open looks that we thought we could have knocked
down, had some free throws on the line, had some free throws. But like I said,
give Miami credit; they made those plays and we didn't make those plays. It
may be a little bit of fatigue set in for us with those plays, but those are
things that our young ballclub will learn from, and we'll continue to move
forward with them.  
  
Q. James, last year you had the play at NC State on the free throw. Did you
have to change your missed free throw play after that or was it somewhat
similar?  
COACH JOHNSON: Yeah, it was somewhat similar. It was somewhat similar, the
same result. We got the rebound on both plays. We were able to put the ball in
the hole at NC State last year, and this year we missed it. We got the rebound
and just didn't get a clean look. They did a good job of just keeping their
hands up, not fouling. Jekiri, the 7 footer, I think, was around the ball.
Swoope may have been around the ball, not sure, but they did a good job of
keeping their hands up, playing big, and not giving us a clean look.  
  
Q. You guys shot 54 percent from the field in the first half but only 20
percent in the second half. Did Miami make some defensive adjustments on
you?  
COACH JOHNSON: I thought we got good looks, especially Eddie. I thought a few
of his were wide open, he just didn't knock them down. I thought Emelogu had
one in the corner that was wide open, just didn't knock it down. I thought we
had good looks, just didn't go down for us, and again, I think that, maybe,
has to do with a little bit of fatigue, legs tired. This guy beside me has
logged a lot of minutes this year, logged a lot of minutes today. Eddie played
the entire game today, had his shots, a little bit of fatigue, but just‑‑ got
to make those shots.  
  
Q. Devin, any noticeable differences from one half to the other?  
DEVIN WILSON: I think second half, we came out, we executed well. Like Coach
said, we weren't able to knock down shots, whether it was fatigue or Miami
just really making it hard for us. But I thought we executed well. We just
weren't able to get the ball in the hole.  
  
Q. Devin, there's been some talk about your coach's job and the future of
the program. What would it mean for you to have him back coaching the team and
coaching this group of young guys? Just tell me about him, why you think he's
the right man for the job.  
DEVIN WILSON: It would mean everything. He's the guy who brought me in here. I
was a little under‑recruited in high school, and he had faith in me that I was
going to be able to come in here and produce, so having him back next year is
going to be everything for us and the freshman class and the class that he's
bringing in, as well.  
  
Q. Coach, every coach meets with his AD at the end of every season. Yours is
a little tricky because you have a new AD and you've had two tough seasons.
How are you going to approach something like that?  
COACH JOHNSON: My first thing, I want to sit down and talk to my team and just
get those guys together and talk a little bit about where we're headed from
now. We've got to take some time off here as a team. We're banged up, and this
young man beside me played a lot of minutes and we've got a lot of injuries.
We want to give those guys some time off. And then I'm sure that Whit and I‑‑
he has been evaluating the program since he's taken over the job‑‑ and I'm
sure we'll sit down and talk and continue to evaluate the program and me and
where we go from here.  
I'm optimistic that I'll be back and I'll be the head coach here at Virginia
Tech, and I look forward to coaching these young men and us moving forward.  
I think we've got a good group of young guys. You look at Devin Wilson who
made the all‑rookie team, Trevor Thompson who really came on, Joey van Zegeren
is just a sophomore, Ben Emelogu, and then the incoming class we've got coming
in. The future is bright for us here at Virginia Tech. We've just got to go to
work, got to get back to work, take some time off and get back to work.  
  
Q. James, you held them under 60 points and they shot worse than 40 percent
from the field, Miami. Do you feel like this is like so many games late in the
season where the defense was there for you but the offense wasn't?  
COACH JOHNSON: Yeah, I thought ‑‑ we were sitting in there talking to the
coaches before the game, and just thought that 60 was the number. And 60 has
been the number that we needed to get to in the last 10 games or so, and we
haven't been able to reach it.  
I thought the defense‑‑ I was pretty confident about our defense showing up
and being ready to play. It's been like that. The second half of the season we
went to the 2‑3 zone. The guys bought into it and really did a good job of
executing the zone and the different things we did out of the zone down the
stretch.  
Just offensively, we've had our moments offensively. We looked good in spots,
knocking some shots down like we did in the first half. And then the second
half we shoot 20 something percent, and we've had those halves, too. You can't
have those halves like that playing in this league.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2014

  

### [Steve Donahue](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18240)

### [Olivier Hanlan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24978)

### [Patrick Heckmann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26635)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Georgia Tech  73  
Boston College - 70

  
Q. For either of the players, when you got to overtime and you went ahead,
did you feel like the momentum was on your side and things were going pretty
well?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: Yeah, I feel like the last two, three minutes of the second
half when we went on a little run and we kind of tied the game at the end to
push it into overtime, yeah, we obviously had a little momentum. But the whole
game I felt like we were missing some shots that we usually make and we didn't
get lucky in overtime.  
PATRICK HECKMANN: Yeah, I think we were playing pretty well in the second
half, and then going into overtime we got some stops, we got some scores, we
got some free throws, and then we missed some shots, like O just said, and
things didn't go our way the last one and a half minutes I would say.  
  
Q. Olivier, can you speak to the lift you got from Patrick, especially in
that 12 ‑0 run. He scored seven and it seemed at one point he had six in a row
and nobody could stop him going to the basket?   
OLIVIER HANLAN: Yeah, obviously Patrick started that momentum he had late in
the second half, and he was making pretty good shots and being aggressive on
offense, getting to the line, so he helped us a lot bringing us back into the
game.  
  
Q. After battling back as hard as you did and from as far behind as you did,
how frustrating is it to lose a game like that in overtime that you kind of
had in your hand?  
PATRICK HECKMANN: I think it's always frustrating to lose a game in overtime.
I mean, we were close a lot of times this season. We played a lot of close
games and lost them, unfortunately. I think that just‑‑ that's just something
that we've got to learn, even though we're all juniors and sophomores and
we'll be seniors. But that's just mental, and we've just got to stay focused
to win these games.  
OLIVIER HANLAN: Just like Patrick said, down the stretch we actually started
getting the momentum and we thought we were going to make a run in overtime,
and we got our chances to make shots and everything, but it wasn't going down.  
  
Q. It seems like Olivier may have a decision to make this year about his
future. Are you guys on the team trying to lobby him to find out what he wants
to do and if he can come back?  
PATRICK HECKMANN: Well, that wasn't‑‑ that topic hasn't come up the entire
season for us. We were focused on playing and winning games and trying to get
better, so that's up O. We're not going to‑‑ we obviously want him here. He's
a great player. He can help us next year, of course. It's up to him, and I
think that he'll make the right decision.  
  
Q. Coach Donahue, does it seem kind of like a broken record, getting close,
playing well, having something bad go wrong at the end for you?  
COACH DONAHUE: In some ways, sure. We talked about it a lot as a team. We've
done it in practice, simulating games and referring to the last three minutes
of the games of winning time.  
The issue, and the hard part with that is, when we go back over our games,
there's a lot of good that we do late in the games, as well, and I did it last
night. I was going to show our clips, so even a game like tonight, we did an
incredible job executing down the stretch, and for whatever reason, Georgia
Tech had the answer at the end.  
But it's not like, wow, you guys just totally fold at the end. It's not that.
It's a combination of a lot of things, and I don't think you can just put one
swipe of the brush and say that's why.  
  
Q. Coach, what did they do defensively that made things so difficult for him
tonight?  
COACH DONAHUE: Well, first, they've gotten to be a pretty solid defensive team
over the last month: Bigger bodies, they do a good job on the ball screen in
particular, kind of sag off it, and then you have two fifth‑year guys back
there that can block shots, so they kind of pull you into that trap a little
bit in the sense that you try to get to the rim. And they don't really give
you the big dive‑in or the fill guy or you're thinking you've got the rim, but
their size is an issue.  
I thought we adjusted and really got the ball moving away from doing just
that, and I thought it really messed them up. They ended up switching a lot,
too.  
OLIVIER HANLAN: Yeah, I thought they did a pretty good job as a team defending
me, and whenever I was coming off a screen or attacking my men, they were
right there. Every attack I had, they had me. Not necessarily double or
triple‑teamed, but running gaps and forcing me to pass it, forcing me to
second‑guess myself every single time, so I did a pretty good job.  
  
Q. This is 30 days where you beat the No.1 team in the nation. You won at
Wake and virtually every other game is single digits. Is there anything on a
team loaded with sophomores and juniors where there's a lesson to be learned
just how to win? You're close. There's just one more step. How has that worked
in your experience?  
COACH DONAHUE: This has been the craziest year in my 30 years of coaching in
the sense that ‑‑ I said this all along. I thought we played really good
basketball for the 19 games in the ACC, and I counted five bad halves. I've
done that before with teams and we have 13 or 14 bad halves and still have a
good record.  
The other way I look at things is this was another month of great growth in
our program. And I know it's hard for fans and alumni sometimes to understand,
but these guys have come so far over the last month, incredible growth, that
unfortunately the last place that shows is the scoreboard.  
But, essentially, four out of the top seven are freshmen and sophomores. We
haven't coached a senior here yet. I can't wait to get back on the court and
get better and get ready for next year. I just think we are so darned close
with all the things we discussed.  
  
Q. Steve, in looking at the sum total of the season for the way your team
played and as you said, league play, they battled, but what is your takeaway
at this point, season complete?  
COACH DONAHUE: Yeah, I think how I answered that last one. I told these guys,
incredible growth in our program. We played an incredible schedule, No.2
according to Ken Pom. No one played more away from home. I was just looking at
it, we played 18, this was our 19th playing away from home, before looking at
NC State game, they had played 12. I think it's going to make these guys
better, stronger basketball players, tighter unit. No one wants to go through
this kind of season, but we all know that if we fight through and stay the
course like these guys have, that you'll see great results at the end of it.
That's kind of where our focus is, and I've been very proud of this group.
There wasn't a day that I go into that gym that I didn't think they were ready
to go. And I'm sure from some people they would have a hard time understanding
how excited they were to play and get better, but they did, and it speaks
volumes to the character of the kid, and not only as basketball players but
people.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Georgia Tech  73  
Boston College  70

  
COACH GREGORY: First and foremost, I think as a program, as an institution, we
come here excited to play, and at the same time, down and out a little bit
because a guy who's very important to our program, Dr.King, our team dentist,
who's been to every ACC game that Georgia Tech has ever played, is home
recovering from a second surgery and was not able to make the trip. We talked
to our guys a little bit before the game. There's nobody who loves Georgia
Tech or Georgia Tech basketball more than Dr.King, and it's been hard this
year without him being around.  
But I know he listened and watched, and he's feeling very proud right now, so
it's important that we give a shout‑out to him and let him know that all the
guys, all the coaches are thinking about him.  
Tonight's game, we knew it was going to be a challenge. Boston College has
played exceptionally well and played those type of games all year long, as we
have. They're never out of a game the way they can shoot the ball, the way
they can change up their offensive system and put guys in different spots. It
really challenges your defense.  
I thought we got some key stops when we needed them. At the same time, you
know, they hurt us in some stuff. But we made a couple big defensive stops and
a couple big offensive plays down the stretch.  
Excited about advancing. It's the first time our senior class has won an ACC
Tournament game, so we've done a lot of good things in terms of firsts this
year, and now we need to move on and figure out a way to play well against
Clemson.  
  
Q. Trae, your basket there, the and ‑one, that broke a 10‑minute drought at
the end of regulation and overtime. What happened to you guys during that
stretch?   
TRAE GOLDEN: I don't think they were doing anything. I think we missed some
shots that we normally make. I think everybody was taking shots that they
normally take. I just think sometimes that happens, and that's something we've
definitely got to fix moving forward.  
But I feel like we made the plays we needed to get the win, and that's all
that matters.  
  
Q. Robert, you banked in a three from a pretty tough angle. Are you one of
those guys that believes when it goes in that way that maybe it's going to be
your day?  
ROBERT CARTER, JR.: Oh, yeah. I mean, I couldn't get one to fall straight in,
so going off the glass, I didn't try to do it, but yeah, like you said, when
that one went in, I felt like I could make anything now.  
  
Q. Coach, you have won three in a row with Robert in the lineup. You missed
him for a large stretch, obviously. Just remind us how that changes the
complexion of your team.  
COACH GREGORY: Well it changes it quite a bit. I think towards the end run
there with getting Robert back, we were just about to get Robert back, and
then Trae went out. So one of the problems is you never really get into a
really good flow or you never get to work on your team improving because
you're just trying to get guys back in or trying to get guys recovered, and
that's kind of where we've been at for the last two months, basically the
entire ACC season. It's only been over the last two weeks, and obviously we're
still missing Jason and Travis and they're out for the year. But over the last
two weeks, we've been able to practice and concentrate with these two guys in
the lineup in terms of what we need to do in improving. We're a different
team, there's no question about it. We still make some of the same bone‑headed
mistakes, but the game is mistakes, and we make less of them now than we did
before, and we have guys that can make some plays to kind of cover up some of
those mistakes.  
I said going into this game and the last four games, Robert has been at about
a 17‑9 clip. He was at that again tonight, and he missed some shots, that to
be honest with you, I'd take all day long. And hopefully tomorrow he'll make
those.  
The same thing with Trae: That shot that he made to win us the game, and you
can ask him, two weeks ago he couldn't make that play. He wouldn't have the‑‑
you can still see it sometimes, he's not as explosive as he was earlier in the
year, but at least every once in a while he was able to turn up the gear and
he was able to do that on that play, and that was a big one. We're a much
better team with those guys. I don't know exactly what our record is when
those two guys are playing together, but I would assume it's probably pretty
good.  
  
Q. Robert, during that stretch where you guys weren't scoring, I think they
scored 12 in a row, what did you guys do to keep from having that go the wrong
way on you where you were able to hang in there and go to overtime and
eventually win?  
ROBERT CARTER, JR.: Just talking to each other, encouraging each other,
letting everybody know not to panic, we're still up. We lost a pretty big lead
or whatever, but just coming in the huddle, making sure, like Coach said, in
the huddle we was together and we was trying to figure out a way to win. And
that's all we was worried about in the huddle was trying to figure out a way
to win, not let this one get away, and that's what happened.  
  
Q. Trae, after the Wake Forest game a little earlier today, Coron Williams
said he felt a sense of urgency because as a fifth ‑year senior it would have
been all over had they lost. Did you kind of feel that same thing?   
TRAE GOLDEN: No, you're definitely conscious of that, and I think that it's a
weird feeling, obviously, because it's something you're feeling within the
game when you look up and it's 62‑61 and they're up a point and you need a
basket.  
I think ‑‑ I know me and Dan and Kamm, we talk to each other a lot during the
games, like come on, man, it's our last game. Turning the ball over at the end
of regulation, it kind of snapped my head, like come on, you've got to pick
yourself up, go into overtime and help the team get this win. It's a great
feeling, and you do feel a great sense of urgency just knowing that it could
be your last college game, and you obviously don't want to go out in a
negative way.  
It's definitely a sense of urgency feeling.  
  
Q. Can you comment on defending Hanlan and how that affected the game?  
COACH GREGORY: Yeah, he's a heck of a player, and he's so good in the open
court, and he's just hard to stop. I think you've got to give a lot of credit
to Corey because he guarded him most of the game. But he's kind of that point
of entry in terms of our defensive scheme on Olivier, but then everybody has
got to help and do a good job, and I thought we did that. Daniel and Robert
and Kamm did a great job on the ball screen action that they run for him, not
letting him turn the corner. I thought even on that last one that he got
fouled on at the end of the game, our defense was pretty good on that play,
too. He just made an unbelievable burst there to kind of split that gap.  
But you've just got to make him earn everything, and we gave up one three to
him. He hit two threes. We gave up one three in the first half where we didn't
make him earn it. But other than that, he had to work for that stuff. Those
two guards, Hanlan and Rahon are pretty good and they're combined 7 and 3, and
we did a good job on those guys. The guy that hurt us was Heckmann, and he's a
touch match‑up for us at times.  
Our point of entry defense on the guards was pretty good today.  
  
Q. I don't know if you've commented on it, but obviously to win your first
ACC Tournament game and to move on to the next game, I imagine there's a sense
of relief. Daniel was talking about he wanted to get to the second day to
stick around. Can you just comment on that feeling of relief or success?  
COACH GREGORY: Well, you know, it was important, because we had talked about
that we had been playing a little better. Obviously, last week was a good week
with the win against Syracuse and then following up with the win against
Virginia Tech. I just felt our guys didn't want the season to end, they wanted
to keep playing, they wanted to advance and do something. As I told them
afterwards, this group, although‑‑ because of some of the stuff we've went
through, they've stayed strong and done a lot of good things.  
We won back to back ACC games, hadn't done that in three years. We've done a
lot of good things. We win three straight against Georgia, we've beaten some
ranked opponents on the road, and now one thing that wasn't up there was to
advance in the ACC Tournament. And so I think our guys have done a good job of
setting some short‑term objectives, and then when they meet them, still hungry
enough to try to set another one.  
Our guys have been good about that, and as I've said all year long, especially
during this stretch, we've had some tough times, and our guys have not stopped
fighting. They've shown, at times, unbelievable toughness and grit and
unbelievable togetherness in some adversity. I'm just proud of them because at
the end of the day, that's going to move the program forward, and that's going
to help those guys who are moving on, as well.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Clemson? You have some struggles there
with them, and you get a chance to also maybe get that monkey off your back?  
COACH GREGORY: You have to play really well because they're good. I don't know
how those guys figure stuff out, but that's, in my opinion, an NCAA Tournament
team. How many wins do they have in our league? 10 or 11? 10‑8; is that what
they were? You win 10 games in this league, you probably can win a couple
games in the NCAA Tournament. That's the way I look at it. I've coached in a
lot of different leagues, and that's one thing I would say. You have to play
extremely hard, and you've got to have great toughness because that's how‑‑
they're a tough team. They defend you well, they rebound the ball well, they
have one of the premier players in the league in KJ McDaniels. They have a
hard‑nosed point guard in Rod Hall, and they have a couple guys off the bench,
their second guards have always hurt us.  
Last game it was‑‑ who was it?  
  
Q. Harrison.  
COACH GREGORY: Yeah, I tried to forget that, Harrison. I'll remember it
tonight at 11:00 watching film. And Nnoko has made as big a jump as a player
as anybody in our league. They've got all the pieces: They're big, they're
hard to score on, and they're efficient on offense. We're going to have to
play a 40‑minute, hard‑nosed, very well‑executed game.  
How's that for the longest answer in the world on one team?

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2014

  

### [Jeff Bzdelik](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13815)

### [Travis McKie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25956)

### [Coron Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26612)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Wake Forest  81  
Notre Dame  69

  
Q. What kind of got you rolling tonight, and was it hitting early?  
CORON WILLIAMS: Yeah, I would credit my teammates finding me . I was able to
get some space in the first half. They lost me because I was moving, and guys
were able to find me, and I was able to knock down a few shots to kind of get
a flow going.  
  
Q. Coach, rebounding was significant for y'all. Could you talk about that?  
COACH BZDELIK: It's been our Achilles' heel all year long. We would get stops,
but we would never culminate those stops with defensive rebounds. Actually, in
pregame warm‑up we did a defensive rebound drill. I told my staff to do it.
Should have been doing it all year long.  
But yeah, I mean, we finally rebounded the basketball, and "no rebounds, no
rings" was the expression we had with the Miami Heat. We all know how
important rebounding is.  
We rebounded well and culminated stops. We shot the ball extremely well with
the exception of turnovers. I think we finished the first half. Our last five
possessions we turned the ball over three times. With the exception of
turnovers we played very well.  
  
Q. Jeff, would you talk about the performance from Devin Thomas, and are you
inclined to give him a day off a little bit more often now?  
COACH BZDELIK: Well, I can't tomorrow.  
No, Devin, as we all know, when he gets double‑digit rebounds, our record is
very, very good, and he anchors our defense inside. He was very aggressive
going to the rim. He felt very confident. He had a really good game against
Notre Dame the first time we played them. His quickness and explosiveness was
to our advantage around the paint area.  
We utilized that, coupled that with really good perimeter shooting started by
core on here. Miles followed, then Aaron followed.  
Just a good overall, well‑rounded game by our team.  
  
Q. Travis, I believe this is your first ACC Tournament win of your career.
What does it mean?  
TRAVIS MCKIE: It means a lot. You know, it's not only my first tournament win,
it's Wake's first win in about seven or eight years. We talked about that
coming into the game. We knew what we had to do. We had a great opportunity,
obviously, facing Notre Dame before and beating them. We just wanted to break
the streak not only for this team but for Wake Forest. We haven't done it in a
long time, and we wanted to continue rolling.  
  
Q. Coach, y'all were up 13, and Notre Dame got it all the way down to five
in the second half. What changed for you guys to be able to get some momentum
going for you guys?  
COACH BZDELIK: You know, we have an extremely young team with the exception of
these two young men to my left here. We have nine players that are scholarship
players that are freshmen and sophomores. And it's something that we've
focused in on all year long, dealing with adversity throughout the course of
the game, knowing that it's a heavyweight fight and you're going to get hit
throughout the course of that fight, and how you respond ultimately determines
your destiny.  
I'm really proud of our basketball team. You go back to when we beat Duke a
couple weeks ago‑‑ well, ten days ago, we were down, and we just came back. So
we're fighting through that. The maturity is starting to surface, now, to be
able to deal with adversity. Not all the time, but today we did a very good
job of it.  
  
Q. Jeff, kind of the same question that Travis got: What significance do you
see in a postseason break through for this program?  
COACH BZDELIK: Well, it's another step in the right direction, no question. We
talked about that. I'll just elaborate on it.  
It's about Wake Forest. It's not about any one of us. It's about Wake Forest,
tradition, history, how much it means to so many people, this tournament, and
it's something that is greater than ourselves, so we need to honor that and
just leave it all out there and play as well as we possibly can.  
  
Q. Coach, first of all, congratulations on the win. With the quick
turnaround, what is the focus going to be for the Pitt game tomorrow? When
does celebrating the victory stop, you turn to Pitt, and what will you be
focused on for tomorrow?  
COACH BZDELIK: I'll tell you exactly what our schedule is right now. We're
going to head back to campus. Our players stayed in the dorms. We weren't in a
hotel. They're going to have ice bath schedules, and they're going to each
take an ice bath. They don't know it yet, but they will.  
And while our coaching staff is going to go over our film from when we played
Pitt earlier in the year and then go over several of Pitt's recent games. I've
had a staff member that has been doing his work on Pitt, and I'm going to
listen to him. He's got the film work done, the scouting report done. We'll
bring the players back about 8:00 tonight at our practice facility, and we'll
walk through Pitt, watch film, come up with a game plan, and feed them and put
them down for the night. That's our schedule.  
  
Q. You talked about maturity and development. Can you talk about Codi's
development and his effort this afternoon?  
COACH BZDELIK: Well, you know, I go back‑‑ we were 14‑6 at one time, and I
remember a play late in the first half against Georgia Tech, and Codi went for
a loose ball and rolled his ankle pretty good. He really hasn't been 100
percent for a long time, and he's close to it, but he still isn't. He still
favors it.  
It really has slowed him down, and, of course, when you lose your point guard,
any team, it can affect you, and that coupled with a very difficult schedule
during that stretch put us on our heels. But we're starting to right the ship,
and everybody is starting to get back to being 100 percent.  
  
Q. Jeff, you talked about rebounding. How important will it be tomorrow
against Pitt, and what do you remember the first time you played Pitt?  
COACH BZDELIK: What I remember is getting beat very badly on the boards. I
can't remember specifically the numbers, but they pretty much manhandled us
around the rim. Obviously we're going to have to really do a great job
tomorrow of finding bodies, hitting them first, carving out space. Most
definitely, that's the biggest thing that I remember about that game.  
  
Q. Coron, did the basket look big to you today, and if so, why?  
CORON WILLIAMS: I wouldn't say it looked big, but I'll say this: I wasn't
shooting the ball well in warm‑ups today, so I was a little nervous going into
it.  
But after I made those first two shots, it began to look a little bigger.  
  
Q. Coron, expounding on that a bit, in 2012 you set an NEC tournament record
for most threes in one game. Is there something about the tournament setting
that brings out the best in you?  
CORON WILLIAMS: Desperation, one‑and‑done. If you don't come out here and play
your hardest, you can be done for the year. For me it's going to be my career,
so I want to keep on playing. There's a focus. There's a focus about it for
me.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about an ACC Tournament win as a step in the right
direction. How about the season as a whole, 17 ‑15, your first winning record,
and how many important ways do you see that as a larger step in the right
direction?   
COACH BZDELIK: Well, again, it's not about me, it's about the Wake Forest
basketball program. I have two responsibilities: I have a responsibility to
win; I get that. And I have a responsibility to protect the integrity of the
University, and I get that, and there can't be a trade‑off between one or the
other. We have terrific young men on this basketball team, and well we're
making steps in the right direction in terms of winning.  
So once again, with nine players on scholarship that are freshmen and
sophomores, an excellent recruiting class coming in, a couple of players
sitting out with ACL injuries, the future is very bright.  
But you know what, it's not about the future for next year, it's about the
future now, and these two young men sitting to my left have been just
tremendous. I can't say enough about these two guys sitting next to me in
terms of the impact that they've had. Travis, all four years‑‑ I told him in
front of the team, a lot of people run from adversity. We see it in college
basketball, what is it, maybe 40 percent of people transfer? Well, Travis
faced it head‑on, and he didn't run from anything. He went through some very
difficult challenges and adverse conditions, and I'm so happy for him the way
this is turning out right now, and he can look back and say, hey, I've been a
big part of the foundation.  
And then you take a young man like Coron who really hasn't even been on campus
a year, and the impact. I told him yesterday in a very emotional way that he's
had tremendous impact on the growth of these young players. Both these young
men have. So very, very proud of them. They stand for what Wake Forest is all
about.

## March 12, 2014

  

### [Rion Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25266)

### [Jim Larranaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13680)

### [Erik Swoope](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26616)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Miami  57  
Virginia Tech  53

  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, I thought both teams came out and played very well.
They shot the ball extremely well to start the game. We were in a zone; they
buried three threes. We had to adjust our defense, we did. Davon Reed came in
and really helped us by hitting four threes in the first half. It was like a
one‑point game at halftime.  
I told our guys, it's a great game, great environment. You've got to enjoy
this moment. We went out and I thought played a very, very solid second half,
did some very, very good things, both offensively and defensively, got
ourselves a chance to get a three‑point lead, and we decided to foul at the
end. They made the first, missed the second, and Eddie got the rebound. But
Erik Swoope was able to block the shot, secure the rebound, and make the free
throws to secure the victory.  
  
Q. Much has been said about them beating you guys twice before. Now that you
guys have a win, what is it about them that gives you so much trouble?  
COACH LARRANAGA: I would say there are a number of things that have happened
in both games. The first game they played man‑to‑man. We had a ten‑point lead
with five minutes to go, and we just didn't finish the game well, ended up
going overtime, and Jarell Eddie went off.  
So when we entered the second game, our goal was really to slow him down. We
thought if we could keep him to 10, 12 points, we'd be in great shape. But
their defense changed from being man‑to‑man to zone. And they packed it in,
and we just started shooting threes. They were there. Weren't terrible shots,
but we didn't have the balance offensively that we like.  
We took 34 threes, which is twice as many as we normally take, and we only
made seven. Had we made 12 or 14 of the 34, I would have been very happy. But
we didn't, and they ended up being able to hold on and win that game.  
Tonight, both teams zoned initially. We switched and went man‑to‑man. And I
think our emphasis in the second half, we went to a box and one on Jarell
Eddie. Was still keep Eddie under wraps and see if we can keep the other guys
from winning the game. That's really, basically, what happened at the
defensive end. And then at the offensive end, I think we attacked their zone
much better. We didn't settle. I can't see without my glasses. How many threes
did we take?  
So we still made seven. We're good at getting to seven. So we need to get to
15 so we're seven of 15 and not seven for 25.  
  
Q. I know Erik has had a pretty strong finish over the course of this
season. How influential do you feel like he was today, and Erik, talk about
how things have been going and how big that block was you felt, for you, there
at the end today.  
COACH LARRANAGA: A number of things: First, Erik is a really special person.
His attitude and his work ethic has never changed, whether he was playing like
he did today, probably 35 minutes or more, or if he didn't even get in the
game. That next day you wouldn't know whether he was a starter and played
every game or didn't play at all. That's a credit to him and his family as to
the kind of person he is and the kind of work ethic he has.  
He's persevered through a lot this year, but in the last month, he's been the
difference. The other guys have played similarly, but Erik gives us a great
defensive presence. He helps the other guys defensively extremely well. He
rebounds the ball. And on offense he's taking the ball to the rim extremely
well, at a very high level. And the other guys know he's capable of doing
that, so they have found him.  
Instead of us having another three‑point shooter, which that's what we've had
in the past, normally we've had another three‑point shooter, now we have
another driver. And by driving to the basket, Erik creates a different set of
circumstances for the defense to have to handle, and he's just been great.  
ERIK SWOOPE: As coach said, one of the main things I tried to understand was
trusting what I'm good at, what the coaches have pushed that I'm good at, what
my teammates had pushed, that I'm trying to get to the basket, trying to put
pressure on the front court.  
Going into the last few games of the season, my teammates have really been
pushing me to understand what that takes and what that does for the team. Some
of the early baskets I got this game, two pretty big‑time dunks that got
everybody going, it was huge because everyone‑‑ the momentum shifted in our
favor, we finished the half strong. That's been the key that I've just been
trying to understand, that I need to make that my identity each and every
game, and understanding that I have to push myself. I can't have lackadaisical
moments on offense and then on defense doing everything I can to help my
teammates. That's communication, that's rebounding.  
At the very end of the game I was actually frustrated with myself because we
knew they were going to miss that shot, and it tipped right out of my hands.
So when Jarell Eddie got it, I just wanted to do everything I could to help my
team win that game. Luckily I came out with the tipout and the rebound and
just wanted to make the free throw to seal the deal.  
  
Q. Mr.Brown, I thought the stat that jumped off the page to me was the
difference in the free throw shooting, and the game seemed to turn on the back
to back free throws, the missed pair by Virginia Tech, and then the following
pair that your guys sank. Again, the percentages showed how well you guys
executed at the line. I was wondering if Mr.Brown could comment on what he
attributes his success at the line to.  
RION BROWN: Well, this game I definitely just wanted to stick those free
throws. The last couple games I've really been struggling from the line, been
missing two or three which I'm not used to, so I was actually really
frustrated with myself.  
But after every practice I shoot 50 free throws, and I've really got a lot of
confidence after our last practice shooting free throws. The main thing was I
didn't want to be the reason, again, that we went home. So I stepped to that
line and just wanted to make them and shoot them with confidence.  
COACH LARRANAGA: You know, free throw shooting, I believe, has a lot to do
with confidence, getting to your routine. I thought Garrius Adams said it best
after our last game where he shot very well from the foul line and someone
asked him what were you thinking about during that time, and he said I wasn't
thinking about anything. That is the whole key, to be relaxed, just focused on
the process. These guys are good free‑throw shooters. The one thing you don't
want to be doing is thinking about the score, thinking about the
circumstances, and tonight we did a great job, 16 for 19 from the foul line,
and that was the difference.  
  
Q. Jim, you have NC State now 24 hours away. You just played them not a week
and a half ago. Does a lot of the same scouting report and knowledge of that
game work for tomorrow night?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, you know, we don't know what their game plan is going
to be, but ours is going to be basically the same as we've been playing the
last month. It really doesn't change much for the opponent before the game.
But once the game begins, then we have to figure out what we want to do. A lot
of it depends on how the other team is attacking us, what defense we'll use,
and on offense what defense they're going to use that we have to attack.  
But these guys now have played together all year long, and I think you'll
notice, I didn't substitute much. Every starter‑‑ well, four starters played
34 minutes, one played 28, and we only had one other guy off the bench and he
played 22. These guys are in great shape. I think they can play day in and day
out. They enjoy playing and not having to practice, just playing games. That's
kind of the way they grew up playing AAU ball. No one practices, you just
play.  
  
Q. Coach, it would really be a lot of fun as you face TJ Warren tomorrow if
you were the one head coach who did not pick him on his five ‑man first‑team
all‑ACC squad. That would be priceless. Is there any chance that was you?   
COACH LARRANAGA: No. No, he was definitely one of my five all‑conference
players. Are you trying to narrow it down? You have 14 other guys to ask.  
  
Q. It would just make for an interesting story line as you can imagine.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Yeah, well, be sure to write I had him on first team. I don't
want to give them any ammunition and bulletin board material. TJ Warren
deserves all the recognition. He's a great offensive player. He's an NBA
first‑round pick whenever he chooses to go.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2014

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Pat Connaughton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23387)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Wake Forest  81  
Notre Dame  68

  
COACH BREY: You know, I give credit to Wake Forest. They made really big
plays. We couldn't defend enough to get out of there tonight. You know,
Atkins' foul trouble in the first half probably wasn't the best of things for
our rhythm, but I think the answer has been really what's plagued us most of
the year, just haven't been able to get stops enough.  
Thomas is a bear; Williams hit some big shots to get them going. We went zone
a little bit, he banged down some shots. We tried to change defenses, and it
seems like every time we change defense, they go zone, they hit a three. They
made timely baskets, and we weren't efficient enough offensively to, kind of,
score enough, and I think you have to give Wake's defense credit for that.  
  
Q. What makes Devin Thomas such a tough match ‑up for you?   
COACH BREY: Yeah, he's scorched us twice. He's got great strength around the
bucket. He's able to drive it from 15, 18 feet. We've had no answers for him
twice. You know, we tried a lot of different guys on him, three of our big
bodies on him. We came down a couple times and doubled, and they'd kick and
hit a three.  
But he's really been‑‑ he's the guy that's really haunted us, and I think,
when I think about their season, when they've had success, he's played great.
He's really played well.  
  
Q. The impact of the early foul trouble on Atkins?  
COACH BREY: Yeah, I think it did affect our rhythm a little bit. He's been
such a key guy for us, scoring, jump starting us offensively, getting us in
stuff, and he was probably back on his heels, I felt. I was worried that if I
took him out, the thing may get away from us in the first half, and then he
gets his third. I thought he did a good job in the second half trying‑‑ his
motor was better.  
But I think in a tournament setting, and, for us, given this is our first
experience down here in this thing, we needed to get off to a better start to
believe that we could win a game here.  
  
Q. Mike, you mentioned this obviously being your first time in Greensboro
with Notre Dame. Can you kind of encapsulate what the season was like in the
ACC?  
COACH BREY: You know, I've said all week, for our program, big picture here,
forget the game today. We're very honored to play in the ACC Tournament, for
Notre Dame basketball to be part of the most historic‑‑ one of the most
historic things in college basketball, rich tradition. I've tried to educate
our guys over the weekend leading‑‑ before we came down here about just what
that means. We certainly would have loved to stay around a little bit longer,
but we're going to have other cracks at the ACC Tournament.  
You know, I think at times it was a year of adjustment for us on a lot of
fronts, some personnel losses and kind of new preparation, new scouting, new
venues, all of those things. I would hope we'll be better at it next year in
year two.  
  
Q. This is for Pat: You guys cut it down to five early in the second half
and Miles Overton hit the two threes from the left corner. The impact on the
game, what did you see there, Pat?  
PAT CONNAUGHTON: Well, like coach said, they hit a bunch of timely shots. At
the end of the day it comes down to our defense stepping up a little bit more
and making them miss shots and making them take tough shots.  
  
Q. Mike, I apologize if you answered this, but I know you emphasized
rebounding and defense during the week ‑‑  
COACH BREY: Very disappointed on that front. You know, we couldn't‑‑ we didn't
carry much over from what we talked about over the weekend. You know, that
cost us the game.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Roy, when you look at this season and everything that's gone on off the
court, your adversity, you've handled that. What can you say about your
players as well as your coaching staff?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, what I can say about my players is thank you, because if
it wasn't for the players and the time on the court, this would not be much
fun. But my players and the time that I have with them on the court is just
incredible. For some weird reason, I think that's what I was supposed to be
doing with my entire life. And if I was not coaching, I'd be getting a bunch
of guys together to go on golf trips, and I'd be trying to coach them.  
My staff, they know Roy Williams. They understand what's going on. They're
very proud of what we've done and what we're trying to do and what we will
continue to try to do.  
And then the other thing is when you walk on the court, you sort of get lost
in what you're doing, and I love that right now for maybe even reasons that I
shouldn't love it, but I do anyway.  
  
Q. With everything going on right now, what are some of your expectations
for the season?  
ROY WILLIAMS: You know, last year we had a little junk going on but it was
nothing compared to what we have going on this year, but boy, my team really
focused pretty doggone well on what we were trying to do on the court and
handled the adversity. I'm expecting and hoping and praying and pushing, I
guess all of those, that's what we'll do this year, as well.  
I've got a great group of kids. Bobby Cremins and Dave Odom, the guys back
there that I coached with or against, they would love my team. I mean, Bucky
would love my team. So that's what we're focusing on right now. Coaching is
trying to get kids with varying degrees of ability towards a common goal, and
that's what we're trying to focus on is making the sacrifices trying to get to
the common goal.  
  
Q. There's no question the ACC is the premier, one of the premier basketball
leagues ‑‑  
ROY WILLIAMS: You said it right the first time.  
  
Q. The premier basketball league in this country. However, largely
disappointed in March with only one team making it out of the first weekend.
Do you think the conference has something to prove, and do you think that your
team has something to prove?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Do I think the conference has something to prove? It varies from
year to year. I mean, we had a stretch where we won it in '05, '09; Duke won
it in '10, Duke it won it in 2001. Louisville won it a couple years ago. What
have you done for me lately? Last year we didn't do well and March everybody
wanted to play.  
I don't think my team has anything to prove. My team has to prove to
themselves we can be a pretty good basketball team, and you do that by getting
ready and doing the best you can every single day. If you prepare and work
hard as you can and get better each and every day, you've got a good chance at
the end of the year.  
  
Q. Looking at Brice and what he's been able to do, what can you say about
his leadership and where he's at for you right now as this team goes
forward?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Where he's at for me right now, he's somewhere talking to
another group of you guys is what he is. A wonderful kid, gained 15 to 20
pounds since last season. He's a gifted youngster. Got to get his motor going
at a higher rate and more consistently. He made a New Year's resolution
yesterday after practice that I'll probably hear again tomorrow after
practice, too. But he has an ability to score, has an ability to rebound. Has
to focus on the smaller things that will allow him to do that even better.  
A key to our basketball team is which post players or are there post players
that are going to step up and be big‑time players for us. Brice and Kennedy
are those two that are probably going to be asked to do more than anybody
else.  
  
Q. You gave us your personal reaction to last Wednesday on Friday night. Is
that something you've felt the need to address kind of directly with your
team? And then the second half of that would be what would make up the ongoing
skepticism that you didn't know the extent of what was happening?  
ROY WILLIAMS: You know, I called the team in early last week. I think
Wednesday is when that stuff came out, and I said, guys, do you have any
questions about anything? And they look at each other, they look at me, they
look at each other, they look at me. 15 years ago kids thought Michael Jordan
invented the game. Now it's Kevin Durant and LeBron James. "I've got no
questions." I said, come on, guys, you've got to have some questions. One guy
said, okay, what happened? That takes a long time to answer what happened
because I don't even know what happened, that kind of thing.  
But I think you have to deal with it. I've met with‑‑ we had some parents at
our exhibition game. I met with them to see if they had any questions and told
them what I knew, and then you've got to move on. I can't tell them things
that I don't know, and I can't shadow any guesses on what I don't know.  
The second part is something that Coach Wooden said one time about reputations
being what people think you are but character is who you are, and I feel very
comfortable about my character. I can't control what somebody else's
skepticism is. I know Roy Williams. I know I've never one day in my life
failed to do something knowingly that would hurt our student‑athletes. I've
never one day in my life did something that I shouldn't have done.  
If you want to accuse me of being naïve, go ahead. You can be as skeptical as
you want. But the people that know Roy Williams know that some of those things
that are being said are not fair.  
  
Q. When you add a new team to the conference like Louisville, what does that
do for you? Does it make things fun because now you're ‑‑ I know you've played
them before, but now you're scouting new teams. What does it do for you?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, there's no question it adds a little more excitement
because of the unknown, but it also makes you sit back and think, why am I
playing Kentucky at Kentucky? Why am I playing in Nassau with Wisconsin,
Florida, Oklahoma, UCLA, Georgetown? It makes you wonder why you're playing
Ohio State up in Chicago. We don't need anything outside our conference to
have a strong schedule.  
It's the best basketball coaches in the country. Is it going to be shown on
the court this year the first Monday in April? Who knows about that. But
adding Louisville, just like adding Syracuse, Pittsburgh, Notre Dame last
year, is exciting and scary both.  
  
Q. Kind of along those same lines, you mentioned the schools you guys added
last year. How competitive is this league going to be this year?  
ROY WILLIAMS: It's scary. I mean, it really is. It's scary. I felt like this
is the 12th year back, which is hard to believe that, too, but I thought every
year you had to be ready to play on game night, regardless of who you were
playing or where you were playing. If you wanted to win, you had to be ready.
Now it's gone another step because it's scary because you can get your rear
end worn out. You can get embarrassed if you're not really ready to play and
play very well, regardless of who you're playing or where you're playing.  
  
Q. You've got a very talented team coming back. What do you see your role of
your newcomers? Do you see them stepping in and giving you a big lift?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, I think we are gifted and talented in some places, but I
think those three freshmen are going to be a big boost for us because they're
gifted and talented, too. In the exhibition game, they got 18, 15 and 12.
They're going to be an important part of our basketball team.  
We have one scholarship senior on our club, so it's mostly a freshman,
sophomore, junior team. But I think those three kids can add something that we
might be missing. They all have ability to score and can help our shooting.
347 Division I teams last year, and we were like 340th in three‑pointers made
per games and 341st in free‑throw percentage. It's sort of a challenge to try
to do better than that, and I think those three guys will help us.  
  
Q. I know you talked about the overall depth of the ACC, but can you talk a
little bit about the coaching depth? It seems like night in and night out,
you're going against future Hall ‑of‑Fame coaches.   
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, you think about it, if you're coaching in the ACC, you
must be pretty doggone good or you wouldn't get the job to start with. I've
never felt like that I won a single game in my entire career. I really didn't.
I'm not being humble or corny or anything. I never felt like I won a game. The
players out there on the court, they determine‑‑ I coached two games against
Coach Smith, who I think was the greatest coach ever and 100 times better off
the court, and I coached two games against him, and I never looked at him
because it was the teams on the court.  
I have a great deal of respect and admiration for every coach in our league,
and no one can have more respect for fellow coaches than Roy Williams does.
But I'm a lot better coach if my players are really, really good and play
really well on game day.  
  
Q. Given the number of non ‑basketball questions you've had to answer, and I
know there's an irony in that, but can November 14th get here fast enough for
you and will a lot of that become background noise once the season gets under
way?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think for me personally and our school and what's
gone on is ever going to move very far in the background because it's a very
sad time. I'm very hurt by the whole thing, but we've got to move on. But
November 14th, the first game, I don't think in terms of it getting here
quickly enough. My gosh, I'm 64. The doggone time passes so quickly now, I
wish it would slow down.  
I want people to get to talking about basketball instead of questioning things
that I have no control over, no knowledge of or know when things are going to
stop or start.  
But the savior for me right now has already started, and that's getting on the
court with my team.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Obviously you did a lot of successful things at Marquette. When you look
at this team of Virginia Tech, the team said that you've brought a lot of
energy to them. What have you taken away from the team?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: They're as good a kids as I've been around in the long, long
time, and they've been very receptive to how we want to go about things.
They've been as coachable as any group that I've been around. They're aware of
the workload that's ahead of them.  
Having said that, they're really excited every day to go to work, and I think
that there's something to be said for that. I'm thankful for the chance to be
around them.  
I would rather be with them today than doing this.  
  
Q. The first thing that you did when you got there, the players said that
you introduced your wife and your kids to them. Talk about what that meant to
you to establish family first, and then the second part of it, why was this
the right fit for you to leave Marquette and make the decision to come here?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Well, I think that a lot of coaches, a lot of leaders in all
walks of business say that this is a family. I think a lot of people believe
that. It's just really important to me that I'm famous in my home, regardless
of my success or whatever success is on or off the floor. I want to make sure
that I'm the husband and father that I'm supposed to be, and so my kids are
around our players a lot, and I did want them to meet my wife, and I did want
them to meet our four children. And our players, whoever said that, is right;
as soon as my family got to town, I immediately took them to meet our team.  
I think that's what you're supposed to do. Instead of just saying it, you want
to be about it. I think that's what all successful people do in any walk of
life.  
  
Q. Now that you've kind of gotten to have practices with the guys, I think
we asked you a couple weeks ago, but now that you've had more practices, what
traits or characteristics can you tell about this team right now?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: We've had 16 practices as of yesterday. We'll go again twice
tomorrow. I would say the No.1 characteristic that I would say about the team
is they really care, and I think that's a great place to start. They're
working incredibly hard. They want to work. Their expectation is to work with
energy every day. They've been phenomenal in their ability to listen, to
execute what we're trying to teach them.  
They've been taught several things. Some of them have had three coaches during
their tenure, and so their ability to listen and be able to absorb that and be
able to execute it has been really, really good, but I think they're also
aware of how critical every day is for us as a program to continue to improve.  
I would say the first thing is that they really care.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of changes aside from the coaching staff. I'm talking
about players, people who have left, new guys coming in. How is this group
looking, and do you think the potential is there to outperform the preseason
rankings?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Well, we got 155 votes and Duke got 935, so the potential to
outperform what the expectations are, obviously we have multiple opportunities
to do that because we were picked dead last. It's hard for me to say, to be
able to answer your question in an honest way.  
I'm familiar with some of those teams that we've competed against in the past,
but I've been so consumed with trying to establish our culture and the things
that are really important to us that I've probably been negligent to some
extent on beginning to prepare for teams that we're going to play in January
and February.  
But we've just got so much work to do between now and then, it's hard for me
to say. And it's hard for me to compete, like, where are we in comparison to
other programs. Obviously I have a pulse on that because it's what we do, but
I didn't watch any tape from last year because I didn't want to pre‑judge our
kids that are remaining, and like you said, we've probably had more player
changes than we have coaching changes, if you want to count by numbers.  
I can say that the kids that are still there all want to be there, and there's
something to be said for that, and we're thankful that we are there, but how
do we compare to these other teams and where they're at with their roster and
their styles of play? We're behind in that, and we've got some work to make up
in that regard.  
  
Q. Now that the poll, I guess the preseason poll is out, I don't know how
much you really take into that. I'm sure you don't take a ton, but is that
something you use for motivation for your team, or is that a surprise, or do
you just kind of throw that out altogether?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Yeah, I hope that we're not motivated by external things.
Having said that, I'll tell them and show them. I'll text that to them
whenever you guys are through asking questions so that they know, but it's not
necessarily to fire them up, it's just this is what they said, sorry I'm not
there to tell you in person, but here's‑‑ I just took a picture, and that's
where we're at.  
  
Q. Hearing that you're not influenced by some of the external, from the
internal standpoint, how do you benchmark amongst your own crew?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Good question. Are we better today than yesterday, and then can
we be a little bit better Thursday than we were today, and then can those days
turn into weeks, and can we string together a few weeks and turn it into a
month, and are we distinctly better as 2015 starts than as 2014 comes to a
close.  
  
Q. How is Devin Wilson handling what you would like to do offensively?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Really well. He's a good player. I think that he could be a
really good player. I think the thing that he cares about most is he wants to
win. You can tell he's a former football player. He's not scared of anything.
He has great defensive instincts. He has improved dramatically as a leader in
the six months that we've been there. His teammates trust him. His teammates
rely on him.  
But I think in some of the things that we're trying to do offensively, it's
predicated on him being really good. I hope that we don't have to burn him out
and play him 38 minutes a game. There will be nights that I'm assuming that we
will. But we need to find somebody that can allow him to come get a drink of
water here and there, and we're trying to figure that out. We don't have an
answer to that yet. But he's been great.  
  
Q. Going back to your progress and talking about day ‑to‑day getting better,
I know you haven't played a game yet, but from the time you got here and
started working with the guys, how has that progress been?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Yeah, good question. Better question than your first one.
Really good. Really good, because those are things that we have evidence on.
I'm not trying to be sarcastic to you, but I can better answer that question
without giving you coach‑speak because I know where we were and I know where
we're at, and so I can answer the growth and the improvement.  
I think David Jackson has done as good a job as he can possibly do in the
weight room with our team. I think Ernest Eugene has been great in some of the
injury prevention stuff we do in the training room. I think our staff has been
great in what we do in pre‑practice and post‑practice, watching tape, things
of that nature.  
I think that more than maybe making a shot or a particular play, I think our
guys better understand the work capacity that we want and the energy level we
want during that work on a daily basis, and to be able to function as if every
day is the same day.  
I think it's an arduous process, all of this, and really what we want are
beavers. Beavers get up and chop wood every day. They do the same thing
wherever they are. And that's what we want to be. And I think our guys have
bought into that. They understand that, and they're to the point now where
they embrace that.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Ralston Turner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21856)

### [Kyle Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27796)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Some different faces, different looks this year. What has practice been
like preseason?  
RALSTON TURNER: Practice has been well going so far. We're excited to play a
game, but with that being said, I think that with all the young guys coming
along, I think we've been coming along pretty well.  
  
Q. Ralston, how do you define NC State basketball moving forward this season
knowing that you lost a big piece but what you see from yourself and the rest
of the team right now?  
RALSTON TURNER: Well, last year we had T.J. Warren, and in my opinion, he was
the best player in the country, the best player in the league. But with that
being said, he's gone, and we all know that. So I think the main thing for our
team moving forward this year is we've just got to step up and do a little bit
more, but also by committee.  
  
Q. One of the guys a lot of us are intrigued about is Malik. In practice
what are you seeing from this guy? Coach kind of raves about what he looks
like physically. Is he a guy who can immediately impact your team and the
league?  
RALSTON TURNER: Malik is a physically gifted guy, very athletic, works hard.
He has a motor. But with that being said, I think he'll be able to help us
this year. Obviously he's a young kid, so you can't really expect him to just
be LeBron James or anything. But he'll definitely be exciting to watch.  
  
Q. You say that the points don't necessarily have to be replaced by any one
person, but when you think about your game, do you need to step up the scoring
a little bit? Is there something different in light of the new makeup that you
need to do differently this year?  
RALSTON TURNER: I think that's one of the things I will need to do is step up
my scoring a little bit. But also, T.J., he did a lot of things well; he got
rebounds, he was in a defensive spot. Not only score, but also be able to
rebound more and do other things, as well.  
  
Q. The word is that BeeJay has gotten a little bit more fit for basketball.
Can you talk about his transformation?  
RALSTON TURNER: Yeah. Since the last time you guys have seen BeeJay, he looks
a little bit different. He's probably 50 pounds lighter. He's moving a lot
better right now. Hopefully what we're looking for this year is that he'll be
able to stay on the court a longer period of time than he was able to last
year.  
  
Q. How about your teammate Kyle Washington? Good preseason so far, what's
the expectation?  
RALSTON TURNER: I have some good expectations for Kyle this year. He's very
energetic. Last year he had some good games for us, so I'm looking forward to
playing with him this year, and I think he'll be better.  
  
Q. Who are the guys that are the leaders? I'm assuming you, I'm assuming
Kyle takes some of that role, and then who are the guys on the team that keep
you guys loose maybe in moments of stress, whether it's in practice, whether
it's in a game? Who will put smiles on faces?  
RALSTON TURNER: I don't think it's one or two guys. I think our group is like
that. I've had fun being around our group this year. I like everybody on the
team. Not saying I didn't last year; I've always liked everybody, but I think
as a group we all do a good job of keeping each other loose and grounded.  
THE MODERATOR: Let's bring up Kyle now.  
  
Q. Kyle, tell us about Ralston.  
KYLE WASHINGTON: What can I say about Ralston? Mr.Consistency. Humongous
leader on and off the floor. An honor to be his teammate. He's a big brother
to me in a lot of different ways. He was my roommate on the road last year. He
just taught me all the ropes. He said coming to practice every day, and he
said, "I expect you to be a leader in a lot of different ways, but I expect
you to go hard and show energy."  
You can look at his stats, you can look at his tenures at LSU and NC State,
he's just a huge leader and he leads by example. So I'm extremely proud to be
his teammate.  
  
Q. Kyle, as far as your improvements in your game, what can you say you've
done the best in the off ‑season practice going into the season that people
can expect to see from you?   
KYLE WASHINGTON: Just one thing is always respecting the game and always
making sure that I'm focused on what I need to do for my team. Just focusing
on over the summer and different things like that, just my right hand, just
being able to turn over my left shoulder a lot, making sure that I'm always
making the right plays because in our offense, if I don't ever the shot, then
I can get someone else the shot, and that will just open up my team that much
more.  
But just my right hand, just working on my strength and my core, I think Bob
Alejo did a great job this year just getting my core stronger, making sure I
have a stronger base so I don't get pushed off the post, pushed off of
rebounds and stuff like that.  
Last year I saw some success, but I think I can do just a better job on the
mental aspect of the game and stuff like that, just being consistent for my
team.  
  
Q. A common theme that guys are talking about in the preseason is how we're
not sure what we're going to see from you guys this year. Do you feel like
that in practice, or do you feel like you're an established team? Do you have
any sense of how you're going to do in the league?  
KYLE WASHINGTON: You know, people have their own opinion. The media has their
own opinion and things like that. But we're very confident. We're a cohesive
unit. We're in the locker room together, and we have no doubt about our
potential. We have no doubt about what we're going to do this year because
think about our team last year, we had a lot of different people that were in
spots that needed to be there for our team. Cat Barber, Lennard did a great
job last year as a freshman, BeeJay had his shining moments, myself, but we
were still a young team last year. You had the Player of the Year in T.J.
Warren.  
Coach brings in guys that want to be leaders. Coach brings in guys that want
to be in the spotlight and just want to prove their worth every night.  
We have no doubt. Everybody is excited. Trevor is excited to get out there.
Ralston is excited. Des is excited. Everybody is.  
  
Q. On the front line especially, you guys would kind of take turns popping
your head up and making big plays throughout the season last year. Do you feel
like the front line has matured and can be a consistent force this year and
kind of impose your will?  
KYLE WASHINGTON: Uh‑huh. Three out of the four bigs last year were freshmen,
and BeeJay was out of shape last year, and he still had his shining moments.
BeeJay is extremely talented, extremely gifted in the physical aspect. But
just his work over the summer, I was with him summer session one and two, and
he put together great work. Just his all‑around attitude towards everything
just changed, and you're going to see a big difference in that.  
Lennard expanded his offensive game. You know, he's going to be fundamentally
sound on the defensive front. He's going to be there for rebounds and just
doing his assignments on defense. But he's also expanded his offensive game.  
And just myself, just being accountable and keep on working, stay in the gym
every day, watching film, and just getting better. We really feed off each
other, like Ralston said. Malik is going to be a good part to our offense and
defense, and we're going to be excited to show what we can do, because
everybody is questioning what we can do.  
  
Q. Has Coach Gottfried tried to install some kind of an identity in you or
is that something you need to find over the season?  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: I think over the season our identity will form, but we have
a pretty strong base already because we're together, we're a cohesive unit,
and we really go off of each other. So if someone is hot, we're going to keep
feeding it to them, if it's on the wing or in the post. But like I said, we're
together, and we're just ready to play together because we're like a big huge
family. We're all brothers, and we all stick together. We're all together off
the floor, and we just love being together on the court.  
We already have that identity, but during the games, the games are so much
different. We'll probably form that identity over the season.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [John Swofford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15017)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
AMY YAKOLA: It's now my pleasure to introduce the Commissioner of the Atlantic
Coast Conference, John Swofford.  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: Amy, thank you. First of all, it's great to be here,
and I don't think there's any question but that there is certainly a lot of
excitement surrounding the 62nd season of ACC basketball. I appreciate the
opportunity to be with you, and I'd like to give a very special welcome to
those that are here for the first time, particularly those covering our newest
member school, the University of Louisville.  
This continues to be what I think is a terrific event for our league, and we
hope you find today helpful as we all prepare for the season ahead. Should you
need anything throughout the day or during the course of the season, please
don't hesitate to ask one of our ACC staff members.  
I want to specifically recognize a few members of the staff that handle
basketball on a daily basis. First of all, Paul Brazeau is our new senior
associate commissioner for men's basketball. He's in a meeting with our
coaches at this point in time, so he's not in here, but I hope that each of
you have the opportunity to meet him and get to know him, because he's a real
basketball veteran. He's a Boston College grad, and I'm extremely pleased to
have him with us. He had big shoes to fill when Karl Hicks left the conference
office, and Karl's here today to go with Stan Wilcox to Florida State
University, but as big as those shoes are, I think Paul's going to do a
terrific job for us.  
Brian Morrison, I know all of you know him, and he continues to do an
outstanding job as our associate commissioner for men's basketball
communications. John Clougherty continues as our coordinator of men's
basketball officials. He's also in the coaches' meeting.  
Lee Butler, we've added a new position in basketball as assistant commissioner
for men's basketball operations working with Paul, and Lee is a former
University of Miami player, and we're very pleased‑‑ he's been on our staff in
championships and we're very pleased to have added him to the men's basketball
staff. Is Lee in here? So that's a good thing, he's out working too, I
suppose. At least I hope that's where he is. (Laughs).  
Kara Tyree; some of you may have seen Kara at the Greensboro Coliseum. She has
joined our staff as well as a director of men's basketball operations, and
we're very pleased to have her and her experiences from the Greensboro
Coliseum, and of course, our senior associate commissioner for external
affairs, Amy Yakola who does such an outstanding job.  
They will all be available to you during the course of today should you have
any specific ACC basketball questions that are not covered during this forum.  
With that said, let me address a few topics and then answer as many of your
questions as possible.  
Today provides an opportunity to focus on ACC basketball, which is certainly
one of this league's most respected and tradition‑laden sports. This speaks
volumes when you consider the many facets in which this conference regularly
excels at the highest level. You hear me communicate many academic facts over
the course of the year, sometimes maybe it bores you, but I believe it's
essential to consistently keep the importance of our academic and athletic
balance in the forefront. It's this balance that the league was founded on
over 60 years ago, and that our 15‑member institutions are continuously
striving to uphold on a daily basis.  
I continue to be very proud of our collective member institutions and their
student athletes. The academic accomplishments on an annual basis again show
that the ACC leads the way among the power five conferences. The annual U.S.
News and World Report Survey of Best Colleges, released in September and their
member institutions, once again, led the way with an average rank of 54.8.
This marks the 8th straight year that the ACC has led the power five
conferences.  
Our student athletes also excelled recently in NCAA graduation success rates.
As teams from the ACC rank among the top Division I institutions with an
average graduation rate of 88 percent. While the NCAA graduation rate is 82
percent nationally.  
And just last week, former Notre Dame soccer player, Elizabeth Tucker was
named the NCAA Woman of the Year, one of the NCAA's highest honors.  
Each of the topics submitted surround our belief that we need to continue to
ensure that the student athlete experience reflects the needs of the 21st
century, and better addresses the challenges that our five conferences as well
as all of Division I face going forward.  
Hopefully this autonomy approach will help make the NCAA a more nimble and
effective organization as we move forward. As we move toward December 1st and
the specific legislation that's going to the NCAA from the various five
conferences, as we deal with autonomy.  
We've set up a methodology within the league to address autonomy in which we
put together our 5‑5‑5 committees where we have five athletic directors, five
presidents, five faculty representatives, and they will be developing specific
legislation based on improving the student athlete experience and moving that
legislation forward by December 1st. It will then be voted on in January in
Washington, D.C., the first opportunity for us to work with the new NCAA
autonomy process, and I think that will prove to be helpful.  
It's going to be a little bit of back to the old days where we're sitting in a
large conference room, except it won't be as large, and raising paddles in
terms of NCAA legislation. And I suspect the way we vote will be a little
different than raising paddles. I hope the technology will have improved some
for this particular session, but it will be sort of a back‑to‑the‑future
moment, I think, when all 65 institutions, and including student athletes
representing the various conferences and having votes are in that room with
the ability to impact and effect changes for the five major conferences. So we
look forward to that.  
Now, let's focus specifically on ACC basketball and the season ahead. As many
of you have noted, based on past successes, this may be the strongest
collection of basketball programs in history. I think historically it
certainly falls into that category. Obviously we need on the court to live up
to that. I think we have a great opportunity to do so.  
The teams, coaches and players that are part of the ACC are second to none in
so many aspects of college basketball. For instance, the current 15‑member
schools have combined for 565 NCAA tournament wins making the ACC the all‑time
winningest conference in the NCAA tournament. We have the highest NCAA
tournament winning percentage at 61 percent.  
Six of the last 14 NCAA basketball championships have been won by teams
currently competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference. That's twice as many as
any other league. Teams currently in our league have combined to win 15 NCAA
national championships, with North Carolina winning five, Duke four,
Louisville three, NC State two, and Syracuse one.  
We have three of the Top 5, four of the Top 9, and five of the Top 11
winningest programs in collegiate basketball history. This year we welcome new
head coaches at three of our programs, in Jim Christian of Boston College,
Buzz Williams of Virginia Tech and Danny Manning of Wake Forest. In addition,
we welcome Louisville's Rick Pitino as the Cardinals make their debut in the
league. Rick is also one of the league's four active Division I coaches that
are already in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, along with
Duke's Mike Krzyzewski, North Carolina's Roy Williams and Syracuse's Jim
Boeheim.  
While talking about these four coaches, it's worth noting a few of their
accomplishments that have set them apart across the entire collegiate
landscape. Duke's Mike Krzyzewski is 17 wins shy of becoming the first coach
in NCAA Division I men's basketball history to win 1,000 games in his career.
He and Jim Boeheim are the two winningest coaches, not only active, but in
Division I history. Among coaches with 20 or more years, North Carolina's Roy
Williams is the NCAA's winningest active coach with a 79 percent winning
percentage. Rick Pitino is five wins away from reaching the 700 win mark,
which would make the ACC the first conference in NCAA history to have four
active coaches with 700 or more career wins.  
Collectively our 15 head coaches enter this season with 6,427 wins, nine
national titles, 302 NCAA tournament victories, 80 Sweet 16 appearances, 30
trips to the Final Four, and 18 national title game appearances.  
I also want to congratulate Mike Krzyzewski and Jim Boeheim for leading Team
USA to the world championships this past summer. With such successful programs
and the great anticipation that we see year in and year out for ACC
basketball, I have no doubt that this season will once again be must watch.  
As was announced during our spring meetings last year, we will experiment with
using a 30‑second shot clock during the exhibition games this fall. The goal
of the recommendation, which came from our coaches and was ratified by our
athletic directors, was to see if this had the potential to increase the
number of possessions and ultimately speed up the game. And we look forward to
sharing whatever experiences we have with that with the men's basketball rules
committee at the end of the season.  
In addition to the teams, coaches and players that make this league special in
basketball, we have many venues that are regularly featured as the most
difficult home‑court environments for opponents. These venues are unrivaled
when it comes to tradition, history and passionate and dedicated fans. Last
year our 15 schools combined to set a single season attendance mark with over
2.8 million fans. Three of our current teams finished last season ranked in
the top four of Division I basketball. Syracuse led the way, and also owns the
on‑campus attendance record for a game with over 35,000 against Duke in last
year's very memorable game.  
Syracuse led the nation and set ACC records in both total attendance and
per‑game average at 26,250. Louisville at 21,282 was third in per‑game
attendance, and North Carolina fourth at 18,025.  
Five ACC teams are in the Top‑25 rankings for the best home‑court winning
percentage, which again illustrates, I think, how difficult this league is to
play in game in and game out, and I think we'd all agree that that's part of
the fun that we have with ACC basketball.  
For those not able to attend in person, every ACC‑controlled game will again
be available nationwide. Our relationship with ESPN allows us to maximize our
reach and bring ACC basketball content to fans wherever they are across a
multitude of devices, whether traditional television or national digital and
mobile platforms, such as ESPN3 and watch ESPN, ACC content is truly available
everywhere. Last year we were the highest rated conference on ESPN, which is
certainly a tribute to the competition and the quality programs in this
league.  
Highlighting our appearances on ESPN this year our top matchup is slated for
big Monday marking the second consecutive year that the league has been
featured. Every game on the Big Monday schedule will include at least one team
ranked in the ESPN.com preseason Top‑25 poll and will be televised nationally
by ESPN or ESPN2.  
The 16th annual ACC BIG TEN Challenge will now include 14 games, and all will
be available on ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPNU. This has been a great competition for
both leagues as it brings national attention in the early season to our
players, coaches and programs.  
In addition to ESPN, the ACC Network, through Raycom, continues to be broader
than ever before, with a reach of over 93 million households in over 80
percent of the United States. The ACC Network is available in each of the Top
10 television markets within the U.S., and in 17 of the top 20. With no
geographic parameters as it once had for distribution, the ACC Network has
grown 192 percent in the past four years.  
We're also extremely pleased that our partners at Fox Sports South will again
be broadcasting ACC basketball across the Fox regional networks, completing
our very comprehensive television coverage.  
From a digital standpoint, the ACC continues to develop offerings that allow
fans more access than ever before. This includes expanding content offerings
in the official ACC mobile app, the introduction of the football challenge
gaming app, and coming soon a new responsive website.  
The ACC Digital Network is flourishing, and its unique video content is now
distributed to over 400 million fans. The ACC DN Game Highlights, Must‑See
Moments and other feature content is distributed On Demand across a multitude
of platforms.  
Moving forward, we continue to have productive and insightful discussions with
ESPN about the potential of an ACC channel, and I'm pleased with how these
discussions continue to progress.  
With the most television households and highest population of any conference,
we're in a strong position, and we remain committed to providing ACC content
to fans anytime, anyplace, anywhere.  
As was announced this past May, and I'll use this phrase again, in a
back‑to‑the‑future way, and for the first time since 19 81, the ACC tournament
will have a Saturday Primetime final, and Friday night Primetime semifinals.
The Tuesday through Saturday format, we think will be terrific for our
players, coaches and fans, and we're pleased to once again have every game of
the tournament broadcast nationally on both ESPN and the ACC Network, with no
blackouts.  
Since we were together at last year's operation basketball, we've also
announced a number of our future ACC basketball tournament sites, which
include a combination of outstanding venues, and I think reflects the ACC's
expanded reach. This rotation respects the past history of this event, and
yet, embraces our current footprint, so we've got a blending over the next six
years of the past with the present.  
Following this year's regular season, the ACC tournament will be held at the
Greensboro Coliseum. That's a venue in which we have had great success and
more than 2.2 million fans over the last 25 years.  
We'll also be back in Greensboro in 2020. In between in 2016 we'll move to the
Verizon Center in Washington, D.C., which last hosted the tournament in 2005.
The feedback that our schools and fans provided about that experience was
extremely positive, and we look forward to returning to the Nation's Capital
with our signature event.  
In 2017 and 2018 the ACC tournament will be played at Barclays Center in
Brooklyn, New York. Barclays Center has quickly emerged as one of the premier
sports and entertainment venues in the world, and Brooklyn is a hotspot within
the New York marketplace, which of course, is now an important part of our
league's expanded footprint.  
In 2019 the tournament will be held at Time Warner Cable Arena here in
Charlotte. Charlotte has hosted our tournament on 12 previous occasions, and
interestingly enough, in three different arenas. Time Warner Arena is a
state‑of‑the‑art facility, and there continues to be a strong relationship
between the ACC and the city of Charlotte, which also, of course, does a great
job hosting our ACC Football Championship game.  
We feel that the ACC basketball tournament is the premier collegiate
basketball tournament, and these destinations will benefit our teams, our fans
and alumni.  
In closing, and I know many of you have some questions, and I'll get to as
many of them as I can, but first I want to again thank each of you for your
coverage of college basketball, your coverage of the Atlantic Coast
Conference, our schools, our players and our coaches. Amy?  
  
Q. In the wake of last week's North Carolina report, I presume you've read
it, were there red flags there that as you look back on your tenure as
athletic director, that you could have or should have seen?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: David, I don't think so. I think if you look at that
report there, in my last few years there, there were some, in terms of
numbers, very relatively minimal, independent study classes and AFAM, but that
really took off in about 2000. So it never came up while I was there as an
issue from any source. If it had, obviously, we would have addressed that with
the appropriate people. But it never arose as any issue at all.  
  
Q. While you were the athletic director there, you created separation
between academic support and the athletic department. Why did you do that, and
again, in hindsight, was the distance created not great enough, and if so, why
do you think that distance created was not great enough?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: Well, I don't know‑‑ you know, there are two things you
have to look at, one, the system and what's systemic, and the other is, you
know. You can have the best structures and setup in the world with anything.
But if you have some individuals who choose to, you know, do something outside
of the mission, so to speak, or in a different way, then that can undermine
that.  
I asked that we move our academic counseling program for athletes out of
athletics and into the college of arts and sciences, not because I saw any
particular problems with it. It just philosophically was and still is
something that I believe in, because I think there needs to be a certain
separation of church and state, if you will, when it comes to academics. And I
think that's the appropriate way to, you know, to help make that happen.  
Obviously you've gotta‑‑ you need to connect the two, and you need to
understand what student athletes go through and their time demands, but they
also need to be free to major in what they want to major in and to have as
many opportunities as is possible that universities present while they try to
compete at the highest level.  
And you know, I just always felt that a separation there is just
philosophically and fundamentally healthy. Different schools do it different
ways. You know, that's simply a personal view that I have.  
  
Q. John, will the ACC have a representative at the committee on infractions
meeting with Syracuse this week?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: We will.  
  
Q. And any concerns just overall with that investigation wrapping up with
the North Carolina investigation underway for the overall reputation of the
conference?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: Well, obviously the two don't have anything to do with
each other, and I really can't‑‑ you know, we‑‑ the NCAA asked us not to talk
about ongoing investigations, so we never have done that, and I won't do that
in this case.  
But you know, anytime one of our schools has a compliance issue, it's of
concern regardless of what it is or who it is, and you want to see as few of
those as possible. And if you look at this league, over the past decade, the
past two decades, the past three decades, what you'll find in terms of major
NCAA violations is that we've had fewer than any of the other power
conferences, and wept to keep it that way, because that's been a part of our
culture, and it's an important part of our culture.  
  
Q. John, with the Carolina stuff and Syracuse and the Miami football thing,
I mean is there a concern that the league's academic athletic model is somehow
being eroded? Is there any response to that?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: Well, I don't think it's being eroded. I think
obviously there are a few issues now. There was a previous issue. You know,
you mentioned the three. And that's not something you want. But, you know, our
cornerstones in this league are the balance of academics with nationally
competitive athletic programs, doing it with compliance‑‑ you know, in
compliance with NCAA rules.  
And that won't change. I think what you do when you have these problems as an
institution is identify them, correct them, make changes that need to be made,
bring them to closure, which is sometimes very challenging, and then move on
in a stronger and better way.  
So I think when these issues come up as a league, it just, frankly,
strengthens our resolve to make certain that we‑‑ you know, wept‑‑ there's one
thing we want to lose on, and that is we want to have the last number of
compliance issues. You know, you usually want to win these things. That's one
we want to lose, and we're used to losing it, and we want to make certain that
we continue that.  
  
Q. How big a concern is it for the league that there may be further and more
substantial sanctions placed on UNC because of the Wainstein report, and
including potential for banners coming down?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: I really can't comment on that at this point in time
because that's a hypothetical right now. We'll just‑‑ you know, obviously you
don't want any of your programs hindered by NCAA penalties, but you know, if
you have some that are, you move on, and that institution moves on.  
  
Q. John, you found the UNC report disturbing and troubling and shocking. I'm
not getting any kind of sense of what your personal reaction was as the
commissioner of this conference? I mean, are you just disgusted by that
report, what you found in there, revolted? Seemed like athletes were kind of
given a disservice here by people that just wanted to keep them eligible. What
were your personal feelings about that report?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: Well, I'm not going to get into my personal feelings
about it a great deal. From a commissioner's standpoint, it's something that,
you know, you don't want to see. I think Carolina through this last report has
addressed it with a great deal of transparency and thoroughness. Now it's time
to‑‑ for that institution, with the NCAA, to bring the NCAA investigation to
closure, and then that‑‑ and I think they're on their road to that now.  
And then with whatever that brings, then move forward, as I said earlier, move
forward, make the changes that need to be made, strengthen yourself, set in
motion things that will guarantee as much as you possible can, that something
like that will never happen again, and, you know, and learn from it.  
And one of the things about being in a conference, and I think particularly
this one, is when there are issues, and fortunately we haven't had a lot of
them, so anytime we have a cluster of them, it seems like a lot of them, but
when we do, when it's over with at each institution, that institution sits
down with the rest of the league and says, here's what happened; here's why it
happened, we believe; here's what we learned from it; here's what we've
changed. And take this and apply it to your particular situation, and maybe it
can be helpful to you. We do that every time there's an NCAA problem of any
significance.  
And you know, that's part of being a conference, and it's something that I
think is a positive part of our culture.  
  
Q. Were you disturbed or mad?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: I'm not going to put‑‑ I don't like it. There's‑‑ but
I'm not going to stand up here and start throwing adjectives out. I don't
think that serves any purpose, you know. What I want to see now is, you know,
bring it to culmination, improve what needs to be improved and let's move
forward in a more positive way.  
  
Q. This is a turbulent time, not only for the ACC but college sports as a
whole with questions about whether athletes should get paid. What do you feel
about cost of living stipend for athletes?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: Well, first of all, I do not think athletes should be
paid, and I think‑‑ I believe in the college experience, the collegiate model,
if you want to call it that. I think it has been a very important part of the
culture of this country. It's unique in the world. It's not perfect. It needs
to be adjusted. And I think we have an opportunity now to bring some things
into the 21st century, mainly related to what's best and right for our student
athletes.  
And I think the new structure in the NCAA will give us the opportunity to do
that. With opportunity comes responsibility, and so the collective five
conferences, as well as all of Division I when it's legislation outside of the
five, you know, we need to take this very, very seriously, because we're at a
point in time where college athletics is being‑‑ is sort of under siege from,
you know, whether it's the courts, potentially whether it's Congress, you
know, whatever it might be. And I think anytime you have those situations, it
can be uncomfortable, it can be problematic, but the way to look at it is that
it's an opportunity. It's an opportunity to make something better.  
I think if you're going to go to college and play sports, you should be a
student, as simple as that sounds, but I also understand that the scholarship
has not really been adjusted since the early 1970s. So that needs to happen.
With some of the litigation that's going on right now, we don't have the‑‑ by
we, I'm talking about conference to conference, institution to institution, we
can't collectively converse about some things that we are used to be being to
converse about.  
And you know, I think what we will have, I'd be shocked if we don't end up
with full cost of attendance as the definition of the scholarship, and I think
that'll happen in January. I think you'll see‑‑ right now a lot of people
don't understand this, but four‑year scholarships are‑‑ our institutions can
do that now, if they choose to do so.  
But I think you'll see more and more of that. I think you'll see a commitment
to the continuation of scholarships beyond eligibility so that student
athletes have the opportunity to come back and get their degree, or possibly
even get their degree at another institution.  
A lot of our schools feel that, you know, that should be a part of it as well.
I think we'll see more freedom in terms of insurance, loss of value insurance
as well as medical insurance. You know, I think all of those things are
coming, and I think they'll be very beneficial to our athletes.  
But I think we've got a model that's fundamental to this country's culture
that I'd hate to see us lose, and you know, when you start making players at
our institutions employees, you know, in just about every poll that I've seen
taken from the public is that that's not what people, you know, want to see.  
And you know, the reason I went into this profession is because of my belief
in the marriage, if you will, of academics and athletics, and how special that
can be when it's done correctly. When it's not done correctly, it can be ugly,
but when it's done correctly, it can be a beautiful thing, in my mind, and I
think, you know, we don't want to end up taking opportunities away from
Olympic sport athletes that are currently there. So I think we have to be
careful with that.  
You know, I hope we will always have something resembling the collegiate model
that we have now, but it does need to be‑‑ the situation for our student
athletes does need to be enhanced, without question, but I think you can do
that without it being pay for play. You know, I think it needs to be done in a
way that is education connected. Sorry for the long answer.  
  
Q. John, in 19 82 when you were still athletic director at North Carolina
and the NCAA brought down sanctions on Clemson university one year, you
advocated that the conference add an additional year or more to Clemson in
light of all of the new sanction ‑‑ or all of the new allegations against
North Carolina, will you advocate more sanctions against the Tarheels?  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: Well, first of all, I didn't advocate in 1982. That was
a situation at that point in time where even if I had, I don't think anybody
would have listened to me, because I was the rookie in the room.  
But that was a situation and a time when the conference, through the faculty
athletic representatives and the presidents would take a look at every NCAA
sanction that came down. Not that‑‑ again, not that there were very many, and
decide whether the conference should add to that. We no longer do that in the
Atlantic Coast Conference.  
The presidents decided that that wasn't something they wanted on the books any
longer, that they would accept whatever the NCAA sanctions were and would not
take those sanctions any further.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you very much.  
COMMISSIONER SWOFFORD: Thank you. Anything else you need through the day, let
us know.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [James Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24440)

### [Cameron Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27799)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Cameron, just what you've been able to take away from your teammates and
how they've kind of upped your game and helped you to play better, what can
you say about the guys that surround you?  
CAMERON TAYLOR: You know, I love all my teammates. We have a really great
relationship. I've never been a part of a team that has been so close in all
my life. I'm really looking forward to getting out there on the floor with
these guys.  
  
Q. This is one of the programs that probably has the fewest numbers of
freshmen for this year, a lot of experience. Can you comment on the
experience?  
CAMERON TAYLOR: Well, yeah. A lot of returning guys. Obviously we lost two
great players in Lamar Patterson and Talib Zanna, but we have a lot of
returning guys who have been in this program and are ready to step up and be
leaders and to lead this program.  
  
Q. Cameron, obviously with Pittsburgh having played in the Big East, you're
known for the physical style of basketball that you've had. Do you feel that
that's translated over and you've been able to have that defining piece of
your team in the ACC?  
CAMERON TAYLOR: Oh, yeah, for sure. Being physical isn't something that you
lose. We definitely have taken it into the ACC, and like I said before, we're
really excited and anxious to get out there this year.  
  
Q. Cameron, was playing in the ACC what you thought it might be or
different? What were the ways it was different, and how much adjustment did
you have to make if any?  
CAMERON TAYLOR: Honestly, basketball is basketball if you ask me. The game is
a little bit faster, but I enjoy playing at a fast tempo. My teammates are
extremely athletic and versatile, and we've all adapted and evolved into the
style of play of the ACC.  
  
Q. When you think about the season that you had last year and you think
about this season, how do you define a successful season here in 14 ‑15?   
CAMERON TAYLOR: Successful season would be having great practices every day,
taking it one step at a time, and obviously everybody wants to be No.1, at the
end of the year, being the conference champions and then going to Greensboro
and finishing at that No.1 spot and going to the NCAA Tournament. Would be
ideal to win that, as well.  
  
Q. As you're watching these players here in preseason, how would you define
the personality of this team?  
JAMES ROBINSON: I think we have a really competitive personality amongst our
team and coaches, really. We've had two blue‑gold scrimmages that really felt
like games almost, and even the coaches that were coaching us really wanted to
win, and I think that just is going to be beneficial to us late in the season
where them games get tough, and it comes down to who really just wants it
more.  
  
Q. James, what can you say about playing with Cameron, what he's taught you,
what you've been able to take away from him?  
JAMES ROBINSON: Playing with Cam, he really makes the game easy for me. I know
where he's going to be at on the court, he knows where I'm going to be. He's
an active defender, and I can find him, and I know he's going to finish and
make the best play.  
  
Q. 7.6 points for you on average per contest last year. Does that number
need to go up? Is it about right given the offense?  
JAMES ROBINSON: I think I'm just going to be as assertive as I can. I'm going
to be aggressive, and I think Coach Dixon just wants me to be a threat this
year on the offensive end, being aggressive, getting into the lane, taking my
shot and finding the open man. I think I just really need to work on that.  
  
Q. James, what has Coach Dixon really taught you? How has he taken who you
were in high school and improved you at this college level?  
JAMES ROBINSON: I think just this year he's been telling me to get in the best
shape I can, and I think that's really helping me become a better player and
just being as aggressive as I can. I'm going to make some mistakes, and I've
just got to learn from them and keep on moving forward.  
  
Q. You're in a really neat position where you've been able to play now in
two conferences. Last year was there a place or two that was fun for you to
visit?  
JAMES ROBINSON: I think every road game is unique. I think every time we get
to come out and compete against another team, it's fun. It's fun preparing for
them. Obviously we didn't win every game, but it was still fun being out there
playing, and I think our coaching staff did a really good job preparing us for
the games, and as players, we've just got to come out and execute a little bit
better.  
  
Q. We know it's one game at a time, but are you looking forward to Hawai'i
this year?  
JAMES ROBINSON: Definitely. That's going to be a really fun trip for us. We
have some work to do, but when we get out there it's going to be a business
trip, but we're also going to enjoy the experience.  
  
Q. Do you have to win the tournament out in Maui in order for it to be a
successful business trip?  
JAMES ROBINSON: That's our No.1 goal is to go out there and win. I think we're
going to go out there and compete as hard as we can, and everything will take
care of itself.  
  
Q. You're going to have a chance on January 19th to play at Cameron.
Somewhere in the back of your mind will that be a highlight?  
JAMES ROBINSON: Definitely. That's one of the more legendary places in the
country to play. I've never been there before, so it'll be new to me, and I
think we're all looking forward to it, but at the same time we know we have
other games on our schedule that we've got to take care of.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Rick, what does it mean to you to be a part of this conference? I talked
to you a couple years back with the Big East. Now that you're here, what can
you say about this chapter for Louisville?  
RICK PITINO: You know, everybody knows that I grew up in the Big East and was
close with Dave Gavitt at Providence College and then entered with Louisville.
It's almost like when you change jobs, there's a certain curiosity. There's a
certain intrigue that goes into it and an excitement level, and that's what
happens when you change conferences to this type of conference. Because for me
personally, there are about seven, eight places, Virginia, Virginia Tech and
Duke and Florida State and Clemson, North Carolina State, that I've never
coached at these places. So that's very exciting, stimulating, and I'm very
enthusiastic about it.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about your style of basketball and all and how it's
going to be playing in the ACC with the way you play.  
RICK PITINO: Well, I think you've seen this style of play with other teams.
Maybe not as much full‑court pressure, but you've seen it.  
We're an up‑tempo team, very similar to a North Carolina, and we pressure a
great deal, full court, and I think it's exciting for the players. It's
exciting for the fans because there's a lot of scoring involved. There's a lot
of pressure involved in trying to beat the full‑court press, and it adds to
it‑‑ when you do beat it, it adds a lot of dunks and exciting plays.  
I think it's a new dimension for the conference that's going to bring a level
of excitement.  
  
Q. Certainly a lot of excitement building up to today, but did it get maybe
even extra exciting, you walk into the room and there's Coach K and there's
Williams? Did it become even more real that Louisville is a part of the ACC
today for you?  
RICK PITINO: You know, the ACC is not necessarily great for men's basketball
at Louisville because we had great competition in the Big East with
outstanding coaches. But it's so awesome for the university to be recognized
with those great academic universities. It's great for football. I mean, for
us and football, tomorrow we're going to play Florida State, the No.1 ranked
team in the nation, and the whole town is excited. It's great for all our
other sports that have not been at the level of men's basketball with the Big
East.  
It's been a Godsend for the University of Louisville. We're very excited about
it academically, athletically, to be with the North Carolinas, the Dukes, the
Virginias of the world, the Wake Forests that have achieved so much
academically as well as athletically. There's no better than Mike and Roy and
Jim Boeheim, and for some of you who don't know Buzz, I've coached against him
at Marquette. He's one hell of a young basketball coach. He's terrific. I'm
looking forward to coaching against Tony Bennett, who watching on television,
is as good as it gets.  
  
Q. When you look at the fact that Montrezl decided to come back instead of
going to the NBA and being a Cardinal again, what has it meant to you and the
team as you see them move forward together?  
RICK PITINO: You know, we're playing three Big Ten schools. We open with
Minnesota, we play Indiana in the Jimmy V Classic, we play Ohio State, we play
Kentucky, plus Carolina twice, Pittsburgh twice. Our schedule is incredible. I
was thinking the other day watching practice, without Montrezl Harrell, we may
not win five games with this type of schedule. Looking back on it, I didn't
realize it was as significant as it really is. As you look as our schedule and
you look at how good a first team he is, consensus All‑American in the
preseason, it's really, really important that we have him in our program. It's
euphoric to have him suiting up again this year.  
  
Q. If you had to use one word to describe this team, what would it be, and
how would you define a successful season?  
RICK PITINO: You know, we're not as good as we've been the last three years.
The last three years we've won our conference, our conference tournament.
We've gone to a Final Four, a National Championship, a Sweet 16. We don't have
that type of team. And what I'd say is going into the last three years, I knew
what type of team I had.  
Now, we may be as good as we were those past three years, but I just don't
know. I know our starting five is very good, but then we have six freshmen,
and just don't know what to expect from them.  
We've built a reputation of playing great defense, having a high‑octane
offense, and I don't see it with this basketball team in terms of ‑‑ I'm just
really unsure of what they bring to the table, and we won't know until we play
Minnesota, a team that's won 25 games, an NIT champion with three players
back, but one, how good we really are.  
  
Q. The international flavor on the roster, Norway, Australia, Egypt, both on
and off the court, what type of presence do those young men bring to your
program?  
RICK PITINO: We don't have them any longer, those players. I sent them back.  
  
Q. I apologize.  
RICK PITINO: No, I said to our young Egyptian basketball player who's studying
engineering, I said, "You're a great student. What would it be like for you to
go back to Egypt for not playing defense? How would that be publicly?" He
said, "I don't think it would be pretty good." I said, "It's going to happen.
It really is going to happen." He didn't see me laugh so he didn't know
whether I was serious or not.  
The thing about foreign players that I've found out is they're a joy to coach
because they're very humble and very hard‑working. At least the Africans were
that way. To have a Norwegian is a lot different than the Africans because
basketball is not prominent. It's more ice hockey, so it's different having a
Norwegian and seeing him interact with basketball because there are no Kobe
Bryants in Norway or there's nobody he can really look at. He's an unusual
event coming out of that country.  
He's a work in progress as well as the big Egyptian player, Anas, but they're
refreshing. They're sponges. They want to learn. They want to work. They're
highly intelligent. But they're going to need a lot of time.  
Mangok is there now. He's had two years of it. He's ready to go.  
  
Q. If you could, just speak a little bit about Syracuse, a familiar foe for
you. Talk about that battle for you.  
RICK PITINO: You know, I really don't know their team this year as well as
past years. They've lost a lot. They're different. They're like us a little
bit. We have Russ Smith gone, Luke Hancock gone, Gorgui Dieng and Peyton Siva
from the year before. So we have new players.  
I know about of course their coaching staff and what they're going to do, but
I don't know their parts real well.  
  
Q. I posed this question to the Commissioner and also other coaches: College
athletes are in a state of flux right now. How do you feel about pay
‑for‑play? Do you think that there should be a cost‑of‑attendance stipend for
student‑athletes?  
RICK PITINO: Well, I definitely think there should be changes. How it's
regulated, I'm not sure. I think players should be allowed to‑‑ at the end of
our year when our players move on, they have autograph sessions and they get
paid for it. Can that be done and regulated in the regular season? I'm not
sure, because then probably somebody would have to make their schedule in
terms of being agents, and you'd have to pay them.  
I don't know how it's all regulated. I do feel we're behind the times in
certain areas, and one in particular is if we're making all this money in the
NCAA Tournament and you are not allowed to fly their families in and pay for
their hotel and give them a stipend for per diem for food is just, to me,
really behind the times. I cannot fathom how we haven't done that yet. With
the NCAA making so much money, how we can't fly our athletes' families in and
put them up in hotels is just mind boggling to me. That's one area I
definitely think we're behind the times in.  
  
Q. You mentioned Tony Bennett before, coaching against him. What is it about
his style of coaching that got your attention?  
RICK PITINO: Well, it's very similar to Jamie Dixon at Pittsburgh. They guard
every possession with their life on the line. They play excellent help
defense, and they don't give you good shots. Sometimes the way to beat those
teams, if you're not as good defensively as they are, you're not going to win
that game, because they're not going to turn the ball over much. They're going
to play excellent defense. They're going to be fundamentally sound in most
areas, and if you're not as fundamentally sound, if you're not as good
defensively, you're not going to win the game.  
So that's what you have to strive for with your basketball team, and then
you'll go and play somebody polar opposite in North Carolina and the way you
have to play transition defense to stop them.  
I think that's the great thing about a mega conference like this, that every
night you may have‑‑ you may have Pittsburgh, Florida State and then Virginia,
and then you'll have North Carolina, Duke and Syracuse. It's so exciting
because you're going to be up to the wee hours of the morning trying to figure
out your game plan to stop these great basketball teams. So I'm real fired up
about that.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Codi Miller-McIntyre](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27803)

### [Aaron Rountree](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27804)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Codi, obviously the elephant in the room is this is the first year under
the new coach, Danny Manning, and the change in philosophy from what you had
with Coach Bzdelik.  
CODI MILLER‑McINTYRE: Coach Manning is very assertive, which is a different
feel that a lot of us haven't had. He is very, like‑‑ he's very oriented
around attention to detail and intensity, meaning in practices and workouts,
everything is back to back to back, and pays a lot of attention to details,
and that's one of the biggest things that as a group and as a team that we
have to focus on is details because that's what wins games.  
He is also very humble in a sense, but he will get on us like no other, and
that's definitely a big difference for us because we never really had
something like that, and the fact that he's played in the NBA for the amount
of time that he has and has succeeded there, great college player, obviously,
when he tells us something, it's almost like, okay, we have to listen, not
just because he's our coach but because if we have any dreams of going
anywhere farther than college with basketball, out of anybody that we know, he
is a person that would know how to get us there.  
  
Q. Codi, when you look at Danny Manning, what's he done to change the
environment for Wake Forest, not just on the court but off the court, as well,
as a leader for you?  
CODI MILLER‑McINTYRE: Well, one thing that I see with Coach Manning is he is a
people person. I say that because I've been walking around campus with a group
of friends, and he will come up and sometimes won't even speak to me first.
Won't even say what's up, Codi. He'll introduce himself to my friends and ask
them about their majors and little things like that. I think that's one big
thing that he does which will get the community more involved and coming out
and supporting because now the fans aren't really looking at him as this is
Danny Manning. It's more, okay, I met him at subway or met him at Benson or in
The Pit or little things like that.  
  
Q. So much was made of your freshman class, and there's been a lot of
change, obviously, in the last two years. How do you see your progression? How
do you see your evolution both as a person, a basketball player? How have the
last two years been for you?  
CODI MILLER‑McINTYRE: The last two years have been full of good and bad
experiences, which ultimately allow me to mature as a player and as a person
off of the court. With the group that we came in, we were all freshmen at the
time, we really didn't know much. We had the fact that we were freshmen as an
excuse, but going to the ACC for two years and having the ups and downs of it
now as juniors, we've matured so much, which means little things don't affect
us the way it did, and now that we attack the court, we come on the court and
we have certain games, it's more of a business feel now, it's not just we're
just playing just to play and we can lose today and tomorrow come back and
win. No, it's more of, no, this is what we have to do. If we want to get to
where we want to be, we have to do certain things.  
  
Q. How different is the offense that you'll be running this year than what
you're used to?  
CODI MILLER‑McINTYRE: Right. Actually it's very similar. The biggest
difference is that we're going to try running a little bit more‑‑ we're
actually going to run a lot more and get up and down the court more, and now
with Coach Manning, one thing he's big on is taking the thinking aspect out of
the game where we don't really contemplate, we just go out and play. If we
make the wrong pass in a set that we call, there's an option that we can run
into automatically. We don't have to make the wrong pass and reset a different
offense. I think that's one of the biggest differences is that now we have
that option of, okay, let's say we messed up and I forgot to play, but now
it's an action if I pass it here and everybody on the team has to know that
action.  
  
Q. Not only do you have to get adjusted to the new style of coaching, you've
got a group of freshmen that have to get adjusted to the new style of life, so
you have to watch out for yourselves and the freshmen. How is that merging
going?  
CODI MILLER‑McINTYRE: It's going a lot easier than what I first expected
because now it's been two years on and off the court at Wake Forest, and I've
found the way to balance basketball, school and social life, so it's easy for
me to do that without really thinking about it, and now that I have freshmen,
it's almost like they're like my little brothers, which is weird to see, and I
can help them, teach them things that I did to help me get by from day‑to‑day.  
  
Q. What are some of the growing pains associated with having a new coach
come in midway through your college career?  
CODI MILLER‑McINTYRE: The biggest thing with me was the relationships. I try
to build strong relationships with anybody who's close to me, so seeing the
coaches that gave me the opportunity to come into Wake Forest, allowed me the
chance to play in the ACC and seeing them leave kind of hurt a little bit, but
at the same time we also understand that it's a part of life. It is a
business, and that's one of the things that hurt the most, but at the same
time being able to learn, learn from new people and get to know new people is
also a very good thing.  
THE MODERATOR: Aaron Rountree now with us.  
  
Q. Aaron, Danny Manning, what he's meant. You heard your teammate talk about
him, but what he has meant to you and what you feel the environment of Wake
Forest has been since Danny has gotten there.  
AARON ROUNTREE: Well, Coach Manning has instant credibility. He's the national
player of the year, won a national championship, Danny Manning the Miracle,
the list goes on and on. But for us he's just brought in a winning culture and
just a new level of excitement, almost like a breath of fresh air.  
  
Q. Following up on that breath of fresh air, how badly was that needed? It
seemed the last couple years under the previous regime it was a little
stuffy.  
AARON ROUNTREE: It was a lot of things going on outside of basketball that
were completely outside of our control as far as basketball players go, but we
were just trying to focus on basketball, and now it'll be a little bit easier
to focus on just being good and trying to win every game that we go out and
play.  
  
Q. What have you been doing to show that you belong on the court for more
minutes at a time? Last year two minutes here, three minutes there, but rarely
long stretches, so what are you doing to get on the court and stay there for
stretches?  
AARON ROUNTREE: I think a big difference between this year and last year, last
year I played behind Travis McKie. There weren't very many minutes to be had
as far as him coming out of the game, and also I've just been working on
developing on the offensive side of the ball and just working on taking shots
when I'm open and knocking down shots and doing what I do best, getting to the
rim and offensive rebounding. But also stay aggressive on defense and being
disruptive on that end like I've been my first two years.  
  
Q. Does Wake have anything that they have to prove this year?  
AARON ROUNTREE: I don't think we have anything to prove to outside people. I
just think the most pressure put on us is internal pressure. We just want to
go out and be the best team and give wake the product on the floor that the
fans and the student body deserves and keep up with the tradition that
Randolph Childress and Chris Paul and Tim Duncan created.  
  
Q. How will you know if you're successful in all that?  
AARON ROUNTREE: I think a benchmark of success would be making it to the big
dance. That's obviously the goal for every team is to make it to the
tournament, and then anything can happen from there. That's our goal, to go
out there and be as good as we can be every game and make it to the
tournament.  
  
Q. What do you like about your college experience to this point?  
AARON ROUNTREE: As far as college experiences go, college has been great for
me. I've had a chance to meet new people, play in some of the greatest
basketball coliseums in the world, travel to the Bahamas, the Virgin Islands,
and I've just enjoyed college basketball and playing in the conference that I
grew up loving.  
  
Q. You were asked about playing behind Travis and the minutes weren't there.
Those minutes will be there now, but you lose so much in leadership. How do
you replace that void from Travis?  
AARON ROUNTREE: It's definitely a void to be replaced. Travis was a big time
performer in the ACC for four years, but I spent two years learning as much as
I could from him, and we have five juniors that are still on the team that
have all played in meaningful games and played a lot of minutes. Just trying
to take everything I watched and learned from him and pass it on to the
younger guys on our squad.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Sheldon McClellan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24433)

### [Angel Rodriguez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23548)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Angel, talk about what this season is going to mean to you to get back on
the floor, be out there for Miami and what the expectation can be for you.  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: It means a lot, obviously, sitting out a year was pretty
long, not playing a game. Obviously working on your game, but it's going to
mean a lot, especially playing in front of a lot of friends and family
members, and it's just a new beginning for a new coach, new team. I'm very
excited and expectations are always going to be high. You can't have low
expectations because you already get on the field before the batting even
started.  
  
Q. As far as what you were able to take, even though you were sitting out a
year, you were around your teammates, got to learn who those guys were on and
off the court. How have they helped you to grow to be prepared for this
season?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: It was a great learning experience because obviously you get
to work on your game, but like you say, you learn from your teammates'
mistakes. Obviously it was tough not being able to help them on the court, but
it's definitely going to carry on to this year because we don't want to make
the same mistakes and have the same things happen to us this year. We've got
to learn from them.  
  
Q. Are you a patient person? Did you have to learn patience through all of
that?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: Yeah, no doubt, and that happens because when you first get
to college obviously the upperclassmen have to be patient with you, and
obviously you appreciate that and now that I'm an upperclassmen, I need to
learn how to be patient with the newcomers because I was in their position
once.  
  
Q. The roster has a lot of diversity to it, international flavor. What is it
about the makeup of the team that allows you to expand your mind a little bit
to maybe form relationships that you never thought about? How does all that
translate into a successful basketball team?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: I think having a good relationship with your teammates is
definitely a key to your success. Same thing with the coaches. Obviously we
took a trip to Spain, and that kind of helped a lot with team bonding with the
new guys, and I mentioned before, it doesn't even feel like we've been around
each other for a couple months. It feels like we've known each other from a
long time, and that helps. That makes the job easier because it's easier to
say‑‑ it's easy to tell your teammate when they've got to step it up, when
they're doing something wrong. It's easy for them to tell you when you have to
step it up as a leader.  
Having a good relationship with your teammates and coaches is definitely a key
in order for you to have success.  
  
Q. Since you were around the program and the league last year and at least
got to observe what it's all about, how much of a transition will it be for
you if any coming from a different conference and a different school into
Miami and the ACC?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: Well, you know, the Big 12 was very, very competitive. They
had a lot of very good teams, so I think the level is still going to be the
same. It's going to be as high. But it's a new experience because pretty much
every team I have not played against yet besides Virginia Tech my freshman
year. So there's a lot of new faces, maybe a new style of play. I don't know
if the tempo is faster or whatever the case might be, but I'm still playing at
the highest level, so there's not much you should adjust to. I guess it's a
new experience just because you've got to scout new teams and new players that
you never faced before, so you don't know their tendencies.  
  
Q. Do you think you'll have an advantage because you are also new to them?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: Not really. By the time you start conference play, everybody
knows the scouting report and everybody will know what you like to do and what
don't you like to do. It's just a matter of players, whether they want to pay
attention to the scouting report or not. Some players don't appreciate it as
much. I take it serious. I think it gives you an advantage if you pay
attention to it. It's up to whoever is looking at the scouting report.  
  
Q. Sheldon, what have you seen in Angel so far?  
SHELDON McCLELLAN: I've seen a pit bull. Just from Miami, my freshman and
sophomore year at Texas, just a bulldog on defense and just playing with a lot
of fight and just wants to win.  
  
Q. Sheldon, you're in the same boat as Angel, getting out there now for the
Miami Hurricanes and just what you've been able to take from having to watch
and having that transition period.  
SHELDON McCLELLAN: During my year off it was tough to watch the games, to
watch my teammates struggle. But me and Angel and Coach Caputo, we worked on
our game continuously the whole year off. It was a positive side. You can't
just look at the negative side. We got better individually, and that was the
whole point of taking a year off.  
  
Q. With having the advantage like Angel does of not really knowing what to
expect from the ACC teams that are going up against you, what can you say
about your expectations of yourself and how you maybe have an advantage there
that players don't really know what to expect from you right now?  
SHELDON McCLELLAN: The expectations for myself are always high. I always set a
high standard for myself. And as far as playing against new players, new
players not knowing about us, like you said, the scouting report comes in by
the first conference game. It's just a matter of who wants it more.  
  
Q. Sheldon, since this is almost a completely new team with just a couple of
guys back, who is emerging as the leaders? Is that becoming clear at this
point?  
SHELDON McCLELLAN: It's still a work in progress. Obviously Angel and I are
looked at as two of the leaders on this team, and as far as us being leaders,
we just have to guide the freshmen in the right direction. We're just being
confident and staying positive with the freshmen. We don't want to get too
hard on them or whatever where they'll lose their confidence.  
  
Q. If you started a new Facebook account for Miami basketball and you had to
write a profile, a description describing the team, how would you describe
Miami to the rest of the world, Miami basketball to the rest of the world?  
SHELDON McCLELLAN: I would say with this team we have now, we're very up‑tempo
from the results we had in Spain, we love to get up and down, and that's
something we didn't do last year, and we're going to play defense every night.
That's Coach L's biggest concern, and that's what we work on in practice,
getting consecutive stops because that's what's going to win us games. We have
a lot of steps on the offensive end, and that's not going to really be a
problem, but we have to focus on defense.  
  
Q. Do you have to make it to the NCAA Tournament to make it a successful
season?  
SHELDON McCLELLAN: I'm not sure really. We're just going to take one game at a
time right now. We're not going to look above any team. We're going to treat
each team with the same amount of respect and take one game at a time. Of
course we want to get to the tournament. I'm pretty sure everybody does, but
right now we're just going to take one game at a time.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Danny Manning](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23674)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Obviously with everything that you've done in your career,
professionally, your players earlier today were talking about that they
respect you not only as a coach but because they know that you've done it
right. How do you feel the environment has been for you and what you've seen
from the players and their responses?  
DANNY MANNING: Well, I think that's one thing that we put together our staff,
we wanted to put together guys that could have an impact on young men's lives.
We want to teach the game of basketball and we want to share our experiences
there, as well. But we want to make sure that these guys understand that at
some point in time, the air is going to go out of the ball. Your body is not
going to allow you to play, and you have to be ready to adapt and survive in
the world, and that's something that we share with our players because we've
lived that life.  
  
Q. On a personal note, what's it like to be back in the Piedmont?  
DANNY MANNING: It feels great. I spent a lot of my formative childhood years
in Greensboro, and I've been very fortunate and blessed to be able to go a few
places because of the game of basketball. It come back, it feels good, and I'm
excited.  
  
Q. You entered the situation at Wake Forest after some lean years under the
previous coach. Do you feel like you have to rebuild this culture at Wake
Forest and kind of reestablish what Demon Deacon basketball is all about?  
DANNY MANNING: You know, for me, I can't worry about what happened in the
past. I can just go from when I got the job forward. The way that we're going
to work, the way that we're going to carry ourselves and what we expect from
our young men in our program won't change.  
Basketball‑wise, we expect to win every game. Every game that we play, our
expectation is to go out there and win, and that's no different than anybody
else. We have to make sure that we put ourselves in that position in terms of
our work ethic, our attention to detail, and making sure that we go out there
and we do everything we can to sacrifice for the betterment of our team.  
  
Q. Obviously not having played a game yet, coaching this team, what have you
been able to see from what they have given you, the talent that you have? How
would you really define who you have on this squad right now?  
DANNY MANNING: Well, right now we're still a work in progress. We're like any
other team in the country. Where we're at today will not be where we're at in
March, and that's always the case. I do like our junior class. Our junior
class is the backbone of our team. We have five guys that have been in the ACC
action for a while. They understand the rigors, they understand how tough it
is to be successful in this league, and they're sharing that message with our
newcomers and our young guys, and hopefully this year will be the year that
all those experiences pay off.  
  
Q. Do you have to prove anything this year?  
DANNY MANNING: I don't know if "prove" is the right word. I mean, we expect to
win every game, and that's our mindset. We have to go out there and put
ourselves in that position once we step out on the court. But "proving" is not
the right word. I think we as a program, and this is any program, you have to
get better day by day, and you've got to see where you stack up at the end.
But it's the day‑to‑day improvements that you don't notice until a month or so
later when you see improvement.  
  
Q. In a league as tough as the ACC, what do you see as being your biggest
challenges in rebuilding this program?  
DANNY MANNING: You know, the ACC is the premier basketball league in the
country. Everybody knows that. That's no secret. For us it's just going out
there and competing. It is what it is. I mean, you've got Hall‑of‑Fame
coaches, you've got great players, you've got rich traditions, and that's what
makes the ACC so special.  
For us and any other team, we've just got to go out there and bring your
hardhat each and every game and compete.  
  
Q. You touched on the junior class being the backbone. Specifically, do you
have one guy that you've seen in practice so far that's kind of taken the lead
and being the guy to maybe be your on ‑floor, I guess, coach during play, that
type of player?  
DANNY MANNING: Well, the way that I coach, everyone has a hand in the
leadership. I believe in balance. I believe in versatility. There will be
young men that start the game for us that won't finish. There will be guys
that don't start that do finish. And so the bottom line is our team being
successful. That's the only thing I care about. I don't care about anybody
getting 20 points or 30 points. That doesn't matter to me. All I want us to do
is win ballgames. I think the chance of doing that is through balance, because
you can never come back from an injury, so to speak, if you have somebody that
you need 20 points or 25 points a game from and that person goes down, it's
hard to replace that.  
And so balance and versatility in our system is very important.  
But all those guys have had their days. There have been days when Codi has
been the guy to be the catalyst. There have been days when it's been Devin or
Madison Jones or Aaron Rountree. Everyone has a hand in it each and every day.
You just have to give us the best that you have that day and help us be
successful.  
  
Q. What have you learned about yourself as a head coach and how you've kind
of challenged yourself early on in your career?  
DANNY MANNING: Well, for me, it's no different than when I was a player. I'm
competitive. I want to win. But I know you have to prepare to win, and you
have to take every opportunity that you get, and you have to go attack it, and
that's my mentality coaching.  
I want to push our guys. I want to challenge our guys. But at the same time, I
enjoy the game. I love the game. I'm going to smile. I'm going to laugh. But I
also know that you have to put forth the work, and that's something that we
share with our guys. This is something that we enjoy doing. This is something
that we love doing, and you have to enjoy the process.  
  
Q. What goals have you set for yourself this season and for your team, as
well?  
DANNY MANNING: Win every game. That's the goal. I mean, every time we step out
on the court, we want to win. When it's all said and done, we'll see where we
stack up. But there are no moral victories, there are no, "we were close",
none of that. We want to win games. As a coach, my first charge is to help our
team be successful and win games.  
My second charge is to make sure that we help prepare these young men for life
or in the sport of basketball. There have been a lot of great coaches that
helped prepare young men for life that don't have jobs anymore because they
don't win enough. You've got to be competitive, and that's just the nature of
our business.  
  
Q. To circle back on the coaching question, you were a long ‑time assistant,
and assistants typically sit throughout the ballgame. Have you developed your
personality of who you are on the sideline, the type of demeanor? Are you
there yet knowing what your coaching style is?  
DANNY MANNING: Yeah, I know what my coaching style is. I need to figure out a
way each and every game to get the most out of our team. The one thing I don't
get in coaching is a setup in coaching, like the benches are made for little
dudes, and a lot of times I'd just rather sit on the scorer's table because
it's a shorter distance to get up than a full squad for me when I sit in a
chair like that. I like standing and leaning on the table.  
You know, for me, I just want our guys to go out and be unselfish in their
thoughts, in their actions. I want them to play hard. I want them to buy into
what we're doing and kind of go from there. But my coaching philosophy, it's a
little different. I mean, every practice that we go to, I put somebody on the
hot seat. I want a player to be out of his comfort zone.  
During the game, we're trying to find a way to win the game and be successful.
You know, probably a little bit more laid back during the course of the game,
but in practice every day, somebody is on our hot seat, and we're trying to
take them outside of their comfort zone to make them a better player.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Jim Larranaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13680)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. With two of the guys, Sheldon and Angel, coming on to the team this year,
they're obviously here to learn and practice and grow, but what can you say
about what they can bring to you having that time under their belt to learn
what they need to?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: It was absolutely great having them. Angel is a great leader,
on the court, off the court, very inspirational, very vocal. He's a pit bull
on defense. He's a floor general on offense. He can deliver the basketball to
a great three‑point shooter or to a big guy near the basket. He handles the
ball beautifully. He loves to take and make the big shot. He can make threes,
he can make layups, he can make free throws. He's going to be a terrific
player in the conference.  
And the great part for him is he's got a guy like Sheldon McClellan, who's a
tremendous offensive player. He's very, very gifted athletically. He's got
tremendous skills, he's gotten a whole lot stronger in the year we've had him,
and they've had a chance to practice together for more than a year now, and I
think that's going to give us a great one‑two punch on the perimeter.  
  
Q. Your programs all seem to have a very distinct personality. Is it tough
for you to adjust to the different personalities every year, or are you at a
point now where you sort of roll with it?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: No, we've had so many different personalities and so many
different kinds of players and we've had to change our style accordingly, but
they've all had one thing in common: They were all great kids and a lot of fun
to be around. Anybody who has spent time today with Angel Rodriguez and
Sheldon McClellan have found out they've got great personalities, they've got
great energy. They smile a lot. We've had a lot of those guys, Shane Larkin
and Durand Scott are that way. The kids I was not able to bring today, kids
like Tonye Jekiri and Manu Lecomte are both playing great right now. They're
an awful lot of fun to be around. I'm a very lucky guy.  
  
Q. As far as the defense that you've been able to put together in Miami,
what can you say about the personnel that you have this season knowing that
even going into the Dome against Syracuse you were able to hold teams low and
really be effective on defense?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: Well, we'd love to be a great defensive team, but we really
don't want to be the kind of defensive team we were last year. For the first
time in my coaching career, we employed a zone as our primary defense. That is
kind of philosophically against my own thoughts. We want to be a man‑to‑man
team. This year we will go back to the man‑to‑man as our bread and butter
defense.  
But you have to always have a strategy that gives you the best chance to win.
So whether we're playing man or zone, it's going to be a defense that my
coaching staff and I have decided gives us the best chance to compete with the
best teams in this league.  
  
Q. Free ‑throw percentage last year was not favorable for your club.
Adjustments, extra time in the gym? What are your thoughts about some of those
smaller areas of your game this year?   
JIM LARRAÑAGA: Well, the free‑throw shooting is not going to be improved by
drill work. It's improved through recruiting. Sheldon McClellan and Angel
Rodriguez are both great free‑throw shooters. Manu Lecomte was our best
free‑throw shooter last year. Someone like Tonye Jekiri has improved his free
throw shooting. That will help. But we've got a host of guys who are very,
very good at making free throws, and more importantly, getting to the foul
line on a regular basis.  
  
Q. Coming off the great season two years ago, you had a lot of players that
had to learn new roles for the team last year. What do you think that they
learned from the season last year?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: Well, you know, what we learned last year is that you need
veteran players to win in this league, and last year's team was made up of
older guys who had very little experience. Our leading returning scorer last
year only averaged six points a game, and he had been our seventh man. This
year's team we were very fortunate that we had two guys sitting out that both
averaged double figures, one at Kansas State and one at Texas. And they're
going to be two of our go‑to guys this season.  
And then we have three returning players, Tonye Jekiri, Manu Lecomte and Davon
Reed, all of whom had very good seasons last year, and they'll have some
experience. But we still have nine new guys on our team, nine guys that never
wore a Miami uniform.  
So we're still going to be very young, but hopefully this year will be the
start of a program, rather than just having a good team, of having veteran
players and having a well‑balanced lineup. This year we only have one senior
on our roster, but next year we'll have four, and then our classes should be
much better balanced. I think we will be able to be more consistent.  
  
Q. Puerto Rico, Belgium, Spain, what are the benefits of the international
infusion for your team, both on and off the court?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: Well, first of all, the University of Miami is located in Coral
Gables, Florida, just outside of Miami, Florida, and it's an international
city. The diversity of our community is something that attracts international
students, and that's what we were able to get Ivan Uceda from Spain, Manu
Lecomte from Belgium and Tonye Jekiri from Nigeria and Angel Rodriguez from
Puerto Rico. It is a melting pot. But we also have been able to recruit some
very good in‑state kids and players throughout the United States.  
But we want to build consistently by recruiting and attracting players from
the state of Florida but also up and down the geographical footprint of the
ACC, that eastern seaboard. We feel like we're a very viable option for the
top high school talent in that area.  
  
Q. Overall what's it going to take for you to be happy with the season at
the end of the season?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: Well, I'm always going to be happy.  
  
Q. As far as like wins ‑‑  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: Being satisfied with wins and‑‑  
  
Q. Correct.  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: It's all based on improvement. We're okay right now. We should
be okay to start our season. We played four games in Spain. We're going to
have an exhibition game and a scrimmage, so we'll be okay, but not nearly as
good as we need to be, and we're going to have to improve an awful lot to
satisfy me and my coaching staff and our team.  
But our guys are working hard. They are improving steadily, but we have so
many areas to improve in that it's going to take quite a while for us to get
as good as we can be.  
The first thing is we're going to need to be at full strength. Ivan Uceda is
6'10" and is a very skilled player, he's not available to us. He won't play
until our 17th game of the season. Davon Reed, who is one of our three veteran
players returning, he sustained an injury, had surgery, and he's out for an
indefinite amount of time. When those two guys come back, we'll be a much
better basketball team offensively and defensively.  
But until then, the other guys have to improve and get us to the point where
we can compete with some of the best teams in the country.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Mike, when you look at this team, obviously Tyus Jones and Okafor coming
in, with Amile and with Quinn, they talked a little bit about how they've been
challenged by the new guys. What have you seen in practice as far as those
challenges?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, our practices have been very competitive, and we've
been lucky that we've had 16 practices and everyone has been healthy, so that
makes it even more competitive.  
We only have 10 scholarship players, but all 10 kids can play, so when you go
five on five, they go after one another.  
One of the neat things is that I don't think our players look at it as
freshman, sophomore, junior or senior. They've really come together as a
group. They're a really good group of guys. Most of them would like to be on
the team that has Okafor on it. I think they feel that makes them a little bit
better.  
  
Q. This league has great teams, great coaches, great environments to play
in. What do you enjoy most about coaching in this league and about coaching at
Duke?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I like coaching at Duke because it's a great school and we're
able to get good guys to come to it, and they've been supportive of me for 35
years.  
The league, you know, when I came in, and looking out in the audience, two of
my really good buddies in Bobby Cremins and David Odom, we were in the league
in the '80s when it was the best, and there was a brotherhood in the league,
and it was really genuine. That spirit and that camaraderie and that
excellence has only been enhanced as the league continues.  
We're now at a time where it has a chance to really go back to the level,
really being the best, because it was the best in the '80s. It's been one of
the best since then, but there's a chance to be the best. When you add
Syracuse and Notre Dame and Pitt and Louisville and these teams, you've added
the best of the Big East to the ACC.  
I think it's time to really get this league at another level. I think it'll
bring out the best in all of us. I think more teams obviously will make the
NCAA Tournament. I think that more of us will be hardened, toughened by the
fact of going through that that way.  
I know during the '80s and early '90s, when you got to the tournament, you had
played a hellacious schedule against great teams, and I think it helped. I
know it helped me at Duke in the development of my teams.  
  
Q. Talk about Quinn Cook. He's a senior this year. He's shown flashes but
has been inconsistent during his career. Talk about his development during the
off ‑season. And then also, do you think this team has something to prove?   
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, I'll start with the second one first. They don't have
anything to prove except what they're doing this year. If we won the national
championship, they wouldn't have to prove the national championship again.
What you did in one season is completely irrelevant to what you're doing in
this season. If you take anything from the last season to the next season, I
think it's a mistake.  
You have to start out fresh. Each guy starts out fresh. We're not going to put
the score of the Mercer game on the scoreboard or anything like that. Just
like after 2010 we didn't flash our national championship rings. You've got to
concentrate on who you are right now.  
In Quinn's case, Quinn has been a really good player for us. He's started
probably in 60 percent of the games he's been at Duke, so I wouldn't call him
inconsistent. I would call him a good player who's been good enough to be a
starter at Duke in 60 percent of his games. He's been a winner for us. He,
like everyone else, has got to learn what their role is going to be on this
team and embrace it, and how you use it to enhance what your total effort
should be, and that's you winning as a team and not any individual thing.  
Quinn is a great kid. He's one of our co‑captains along with Amile, and we
look for big things from him.  
  
Q. You've obviously groomed players over time ‑‑  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Did you say ruined players?  
  
Q. Groomed players.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Oh, I thought the question was to Cremins. (Laughter.)  
Q.With the players that you've been able to groom over time and the climate
now, it's more one‑and‑done, you have the opportunity that that might happen
on the team after this season. How have you embraced the fact that there is
some change and that the NBA is always right there knocking on the door?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, it's not just‑‑ it's been a fact of life for us for 15
years, over 15 years. I mean, we're accustomed to guys going one‑and‑done,
too. That's just the way it is. It's nothing new. That's what you have to do
is you have to cram in more in a short period of time, and I think you have to
be more tolerant of slippage, that there's going to be slippage, it's not
going to be perfect, and try to get as much in and not overdo it, like give
them enough where they're still instinctive, the least amount of slippage, and
where they can be instinctively reactive offensively and defensively as a
team.  
That's what we try to do now. We really have a different team every year. Our
team this year is a lot different than our team last year and how we're going
to play defense and offense. We have an inside presence now. We have great
depth on the perimeter. We're so young, but it's different, and so you don't
try to cram‑‑ don't try to fit it in how my '92 team played or '98 or 2004.
Those days are not‑‑ those aren't the days. Do what you need to do today, and
that's what we're trying to do with this group.  
  
Q. Just to kind of piggy ‑back off the last question, as a coach, would you
like to see a rule implemented to help keep players around longer than just
one year?   
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: You know, we have no control over that. We don't make the‑‑
now, we do have influence on new rules to enhance what will happen for the
student‑athletes we have and the rules of the game. But the NBA and the
Players Association are the ones who decide what happens. I think the NBA
would like to have two years, and I'm not sure that the players' union would
want that. So we're really a slave to whatever they want.  
I do think if we had someone in charge of college basketball that that person
should develop a relationship and be the face of our sport and talk and
develop relationships with the NBA and the players' union and figure out
what's best for basketball. That's not done, so we're reactionary instead of
being part of the process. We are reactionary.  
Adam Silver has tried to involve college basketball really as much as he can,
and he gets a group of us together to talk about it, but it would be better if
we had like a person who just does that, just‑‑ it's been a frustrating thing
for me for 25 years, so I don't know why we haven't done that.  
  
Q. The Syracuse ‑Duke rivalry got off to a really good start last year. How
do you see that rivalry evolving now over the next few years?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, I think that's one of the great things of expansion is
that you bring storied programs like Syracuse, Louisville and these teams in,
and we have storied programs, a number of them, in our conference, and when
you put them together, something new and good can happen. In the case of Duke
and Syracuse, it wasn't a‑‑ they weren't two great games. They were two great
events. And so our conference, it's not just producing games. These games,
they end up being events. For years people have talked about Duke and Carolina
as being an event.  
I think our conference is not one‑dimensional right now. It can have a number
of them, and I think that's great for the game, and I know Jim and I have
talked about it. We're lucky that we're a part of that right now, to be a part
of two events like that. Those two days were great for college basketball and
great for the ACC. I think it was great for Coaches Versus Cancer because in
one of them Jim auctioned that coat he threw off for I think $14,000 that we
got to raise. So I think we're going to take turns on who throws a coat and
try to auction it off each year.  
  
Q. How hard is it to get the high school kids that are the great players? It
used to be in demand at the high school level to blend in and play team ball
at the college level.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I think it just depends on who the kid is. For the four kids
we have in this freshman class, it's not hard at all. They're more than
willing to do whatever the team needs, and I think that's part of the
recruiting process in any kid, whether he's identified as a top‑20 player or
not. To make sure that they want to be a part of something bigger than them.  
When these kids are ranked and that, that's not their final rank. Like I just
got through coaching a U.S. team where three of my top players were Kenneth
Faried, Klay Thompson, and Stephon Curry, and coming out of high school, none
of those guys were‑‑ I think Faried was the 124th rated power forward. But
they're great pros.  
That's why there's a lot of good players, and how they develop and how long
they stay and how long you have them, it's produced an amazing amount of
parity in our sport, and that's why there's so many teams that can win the
whole thing now, because of this constant change that's going on.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Will Johnston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27802)

### [Adam Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27801)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. What can you take from Buzz Williams being your new head coach and what
has he meant so far?  
ADAM SMITH: I mean, he just brings excitement, you know. Everyone is really
excited about the start of the season. We've been excited since he got in, and
just something he brings to the table is just you learn a lot from him, just
kind of being around him. If you shadow him, you just learn a lot. He rarely
sleeps. He's really big on work ethic and hard work. That's kind of his
mentality, just working hard every day, getting better.  
  
Q. Adam, Buzz Williams said a couple weeks ago that he still hadn't figured
out you guys' identity, maybe how to play or anything. I know it's only been a
couple weeks but are you getting closer to figuring out what this team will
look like and what style of play you guys are going to be playing in going
into the season?  
ADAM SMITH: Yeah, I think we're getting closer. Three‑hour practices every
day, you've got to improve on something.  
Yeah, I think we're getting there. Like I said, we're learning a lot every day
trying different stuff, figuring stuff out. We'll be there soon.  
  
Q. After finishing last in the conference last season and the year that you
had last year, how eager are you guys to get out there and start anew?  
ADAM SMITH: I think we're just looking like forward, you know what I'm saying?
We're just kind of building. It's something new. Not really going off what we
did last season, but we have new players, new staff. Like I said, we're just
kind of focused on the present moment, kind of just preparing for the future,
not really looking in the past.  
  
Q. Last year Ben as a freshman was a captain and then you had some senior
leaders leave. Who's stepping into the leadership role this season?  
ADAM SMITH: I think our returners, like all of our returning players. With a
new coaching staff and then having five freshmen coming in, it just has to be
like some kind of camaraderie, and I feel like the returners really set the
standards for that. Everybody just kind of meshed as soon as they came in,
like we're a family now. I feel like all of our returners are leaders in one
aspect or another.  
  
Q. Do you have to prove anything this year to anybody?  
ADAM SMITH: I don't think so. Because we're at the bottom of the conference,
we have like a lot of doubters, and not too many supporters. But I think it's
more about proving ourselves right than kind of proving everybody wrong.  
  
Q. I think you probably you and Will look at it differently being seniors
but I think a lot of outside people see this as a rebuilding year or don't
expect a whole lot. Do you consider this a rebuilding year, and how do you see
the outlook of the season with so much uncertainty right now?  
ADAM SMITH: No, because we're seniors we don't want to look at it as a
rebuilding year, because rebuilding, it takes a long time. It's a process.
We're ready now. We're trying to make noise now as soon as possible.  
  
Q. The last couple of years the season has started fairly strong. Is it
important to get off to a fast start this year? Do you have to be 11 ‑1 or 9‑2
to get started?   
ADAM SMITH: Yeah, I think that's very important if we want to be 11‑1 starting
off, why not. But the big thing is I think just taking one game at a time.
11‑1, you focus on the next game and just keep it going. I feel like that's
really important.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll make the switch. Thank you, Adam. Will, talk a little bit
about Adam and his importance to this program.  
WILL JOHNSTON: Adam provides a lot of leadership for us. You know, he's a
veteran guy. He's played the game a lot. Not only that, but he can really
shoot the ball, and that's going to be really important for us this year
because within our offense we're going to be shooting a lot more threes than
Coach Buzz is probably used to. That will provide a lot of importance for us.  
  
Q. Will, kind of going off the same thing, with Buzz Williams being new here
and coming in an instituting what he wants from you, how would you define him
as a coach and as a person?  
WILL JOHNSTON: As a person, he's like a father to us almost. You know, the way
I think about it, he is like our dad and like my teammates are like my
brothers. As a coach, he brings a lot of energy, and he's very consistent.
He's the same person one day as he is the next, and that's really important
for us because what he does off the court, it doesn't really matter because
once he gets on the court, he's going to be the same person every single day,
and we count on him for that.  
  
Q. Will, with so many new pieces and new coaches, you guys had only a couple
guys returning from last year, is there anything you guys can build on from
last year, or is it a completely new slate starting over, everything going
into this year?  
WILL JOHNSTON: I'd say it's a completely new slate for us, just because
completely new coaching staff. Yeah, we have a couple returning players, and I
think one person, Joey van Zegeren, he's the main person I would say can build
off last year because he had a really good end to his season. So if he can
pick up where he left off, that would be great for him.  
But for the rest of us, we're kind of starting brand new, and just taking
whatever Coach Buzz tells us and running with it.  
  
Q. With everything new, new coaches, new players and everything, how has the
transition been? How have you guys all been meshing so far?  
WILL JOHNSTON: Really well. Right when Coach Buzz got here, the first thing he
did, it wasn't about basketball or nothing like that. He introduced his wife
and his four kids, and it was all about family, and for us, that's what we've
built our base on. We're just a really tight‑knit group, and like I said
earlier, he's like our dad and my teammates are like my brothers.  
  
Q. So if you're just proving to yourselves based on what your teammates
said, if you think about the season, what is going to make this season
successful, again, using the word new, with all the newness that's around?  
WILL JOHNSTON: I guess just not judging off wins and losses. It's kind of just
playing hard and playing within the system that Coach Buzz gives to us. He
wants us to be predicated on toughness, mentally tough, physically
conditioned, not Xs and Os and plays and stuff like that.  
So if we can do that, I think we can consider our season a success.  
  
Q. What do you think is going to be the biggest change as far as your style
of play? I know you just said you're going to be shooting a lot of threes.
Talk about what you guys are planning to do out there.  
WILL JOHNSTON: We're going to be playing really fast‑paced, and because we're
undersized, we're going to have guards guarding other teams' 4 men. So we're
going to have to play really fast‑paced, and then, like you said, we're
probably going to be shooting a lot more threes than we have in the past.  
  
Q. Along those lines, has there been a lot of conditioning for that?  
WILL JOHNSTON: Yeah. We had individual workouts where it was like hours and
hours of work every single day, just to get through it. And then the hardest
thing we did was boot camp, and that was about a week, two weeks where we
didn't even touch a basketball. It was conditioning stations, basketball
stations without using a basketball, and then just straight sprints. We just
kept running and kept running until we got the sprint over with. With Coach
Buzz, he holds us 100 percent accountable every day, so if we didn't get one
sprint, we couldn't move on until the next one, so we just had to keep running
and running, and now we're in the best shape of our lives.  
  
Q. With so many unknowns this year, what's already going to be maybe the
biggest challenge or some of the biggest challenges you feel like you guys
will need to overcome going into the season?  
WILL JOHNSTON: I would just say the biggest challenge with us this year is our
depth and our size. Like I said, we don't really have a 4 man, and we just
have two 5s. Being able to overcome our size challenge is going to be
difficult, but at the same time, we're going to try to use it as a strength
for us.  
We're going to have to guard, like, other teams' big men, but at the same time
they're going to have to guard us on the perimeter, so that's going to be
tough for them.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Brice Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25959)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Tell me what you think about this upcoming season.  
BRICE JOHNSON: It's going to be a great one for us.  
  
Q. What's going to make it great?  
BRICE JOHNSON: Well, I mean, just knowing that we have a lot of returning
pieces to the team from last year, and we have great freshmen coming in. We
have all the pieces that we really needed that were missing last year. It's
going to be a big help from them.  
  
Q. Brice, when you look at Marcus and the backcourt, how would you define it
and how much has Marcus helped your game?  
BRICE JOHNSON: Marcus has really helped my game a lot because he looks for me
down low, so he passes me the ball and we're able to score. The backcourt last
year wasn't as strong as it should have been, but this year with the new
incoming freshmen, we should see a new look at it. I mean, we should be all
right. If they play well as we think they should, we can really go as far as
we want to.  
  
Q. Brice, your development is a real key, and now it seems like it's your
time. What has been the biggest thing that you've felt like for you to become
a first ‑team All‑ACC player? What's the key thing you need in your game that
you've been working on?   
BRICE JOHNSON: Consistency. I mean, I can sum it up in one word. It's
consistency. That's the one thing Coach has been preaching to me for the last
two and a half years, that I need to be consistent with my play. He's been
saying that I've had good times, and I've been doing some great things, and
then all of a sudden one day I just go backwards.  
So I just need to be consistent with my play and keep doing those great things
and not go backwards and just show him that I can be that player that he
really needs.  
  
Q. Last year your free ‑throw percentage could have used a little bit of
improving. What have you done over the off‑season to make sure you're a little
bit better at the line?   
BRICE JOHNSON: Shoot a lot of free throws. I didn't really go to the line as
much last year, so I didn't know what to expect every other game. I'd go once
every two or three games sometimes, but I've just been shooting a lot of free
throws, and Coach Davis has really been helping me with my free‑throw routine
and stuff. I've just been working on it all together.  
  
Q. Brice, you guys obviously prefer to get up and down the court, and the
ACC last year was literally the slowest league in the country. Are you guys
aware of that out there? Is that a constant frustration?  
BRICE JOHNSON: Yeah, Coach really preached that to us. He said we got away
from the way we play. He kept preaching that we need to run more. This
preseason we've really been running a lot in practice. We just have to turn it
back around the way that Coach wants to play. That's the way he wants to play.
He wants to be a run‑and‑gun team and run it up and down the floor.  
  
Q. You've picked up weight since your freshman year, and then on the
flipside, Kennedy Meeks has dropped weight. How has that changed you guys'
game?  
BRICE JOHNSON: Well, for myself it's really given me an edge on the offensive
end and defensive end knowing that I can't get bullied around like I have been
the past few years. And for Kennedy, it's a plus for him because he can move a
lot better than he did his freshman year. I mean, I just feel like it's just a
really big plus for both of us in numerous ways, just have to find out when
the games actually come around.  
  
Q. Brice, you mentioned that there's a lot of good freshmen coming in. Talk
about them a little bit and what they've shown you so far.  
BRICE JOHNSON: They've shown me some great things. Justin Jackson is a great
scorer, could be a very good defensive player, can get you some stops. Joel's
a very, very good facilitator, can also score. Theo Pinson, great rebounder,
very athletic. They all bring a key piece that we were missing last year from
guard play. I really look forward to them helping us out this year.  
  
Q. It was Marcus who closed games for you guys last year. Everybody would
like to think they have that ability. Do you have guys, other guys on the team
this year that have that game ‑closing ability do you think?   
BRICE JOHNSON: I don't know. We'll have to see. I mean, Marcus has proved
himself at the end of games. We just have to find somebody else that can do
it, too. He did win us some games, and he did finish them well because he shot
the best percentages of his career in the second half. This year we're just
going to have to see what close games we get to and see who's going to step up
if it's not him.  
  
Q. Fill in the blank: Our season is successful this year if we do what?  
BRICE JOHNSON: What Coach tells us to do. He preaches that to us every day.
It's a proven fact. The teams that do what Coach told them to do, they've been
winners.  
  
Q. The schedule shakes out pretty well. Fun schedule to start the trip for
Battle for Atlantis. I know players take it one game at a time, but are you
circling those dates on your calendar?  
BRICE JOHNSON: No, just like you said, we're taking it one game at a time.
It's a long year. When it comes around, we'll be ready for it. We've just got
to look forward to our first two games before that and be ready for those.  
  
Q. Brice, it seems the pattern with Coach is that there's a lot of
experimentation with lineups in kind of the non ‑conference and eventually
you'll settle down. Is there any frustration as players that as one of the
five best in your case, that you're not just getting starters burned
constantly, or are you guys comfortable in that setup?   
BRICE JOHNSON: Well, just me being there for a while, I'm used to it. I mean,
that's just what Coach does. He like to experiment with it just to see who's
the best and see who's going to‑‑ he likes to get reactions from other people,
too, just to see how they'll react to not probably being in the starting five
or being on the blue team because that's what he does. He just wants to get
the best out of everybody. He wants every day in practice to be a competition,
so he tries to even out the teams as much as he can to be able to get the best
out of everybody.  
  
Q. What's the hardest place been for you guys to play on the road?  
BRICE JOHNSON: Well, you have to restate that question after saying Cameron
Indoor because that is the toughest place to play for me, just because it's
such a small arena. The students are right on top of you. It's very loud in
there at times.  
Probably the second would be Syracuse because it's such an open environment.
It's so big, it's a lot of people in there. That was my first time playing
there, so I was a little nervous playing there.  
  
Q. Carolina has been in the news a lot since the report that was released
last week. Have you seen the environment change around campus regarding the
student ‑athletes?   
BRICE JOHNSON: No, I haven't. We just move on. I mean, it's not really going
to affect us. It's a report. I mean, that's all it is. It doesn't faze me. I
mean, it does faze me, but I'm not going to let it faze me. At the end of the
day, that happened years ago, and I'm here now, so I have to worry about
what's going on now and not worry about what was happening in the past.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. I asked your players about you earlier and they immediately smiled. You
seem to be the type of guy that is able to bring out the best in his players.
They play very emotionally for you on the floor. Talk about how you connect
with your players on that level.  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, I've been very fortunate to have a great relationship
with my guys. I try to be extremely patient and hold them accountable for the
things that I expect them to be executing. Sometimes it works a lot better
when they're older and more mature. We have a certain level of talent, and I
think we do a great job as a staff evaluating who we are and what we are. We
have been a pretty good basketball team when we've been inexperienced. We've
tried to anchor our team with a sound fundamental defensive philosophy.  
Now, I feel that we have improved our offensive skills, and I think we'll be
able to complement the defensive stops that we get off a lot better. I feel
very good about this particular basketball team because we have a blend of‑‑
we have one senior and five juniors, and when we've been‑‑ when you look back
at the last three years at the three teams that have won the ACC Championship
have all been teams‑‑ we had six seniors in 2012, Miami had five seniors in
2013, and last year Virginia had a great mix of seniors and juniors.  
So I think that when our guys like Aaron and Montay, they respond a lot
better, they're a little more confident, and I think that's who we are now. I
think one of the reasons we've been able to get our guys to play with so much
passion is because we have to. We have not been the most talented team in the
ACC, but I think we've been able to respond appropriately and win enough
games. Now hopefully with a little more depth and improved offensive skills,
this will be another year where we will surprise a lot of people.  
  
Q. Even though the season hasn't started yet, how do you feel your team will
stack up with the rest of the conference?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, like I said earlier, we're extremely confident. Our
system has worked well for us over the last nine years. We're the third
winningest program in the ACC only behind Duke and Carolina, but we're not
satisfied with being third. I think our goal is to be the top team in the ACC,
and we're moving in that direction, but what is happening is everyone is
getting better in the ACC. You can no longer just rest on your position that
you're in because you can go in the wrong direction.  
So we know we need to turn it up a notch, but it does give us a certain amount
of confidence that we've been able to be successful when we are playing the
style that we think is necessary and we're consistent with it.  
Now, I think we have a level of maturity. One reason why I think we stack up
pretty well is that we have an experienced bunch back, and now the challenge,
the biggest challenge for us, is to bring our inexperienced players up to the
level so they can be contributors as freshmen and sophomores, and I think that
would make the difference in how successful we are as we move through the
season.  
I think we have a pretty clear understanding of who we are with our older,
more experienced players, but like most coaches, we're a little anxious with
the freshmen that we have coming in that we need to really, really perform at
a solid level in order for us to be successful. I have a hunch that we're
going to be just fine.  
  
Q. When you look at this team, what have you taken away the most yourself?
We talk about players learning, but what have you learned about your coaching
style and your ability and how the team has responded to you over time?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I think we have tremendous chemistry with this team. I have
three seven‑footers that all love each other. They push each other in
practice. They go at each other. They correct each other. They hang out
together. There's competition among them, but there's no jealousy. They
encourage and they lift each other up.  
Our two power forwards are a sophomore and a freshman. They get along just
fine. They battle each other fiercely in practice, and they respond very well
to their teammates.  
So I feel that the chemistry on this team will allow us to accelerate the
process a little faster because they're responding and they're hungry. We went
to the NCAA Tournament four years in a row, won the ACC title, and we lost our
veterans, and now we've been a little inexperienced and we've come close, but
we have not gone back to the NCAA. They realize now the culture that we've
been able to establish at Florida State is at a point now where this needs to
be our year for us to get back on track, so all those things I think are
working in our favor.  
  
Q. How would you define Florida State basketball knowing that football is so
prominent around the country? Where do you feel Florida State basketball is at
compared to where you want it to be?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, if you look on our campus now with all our sports, I
think maybe we might have lost two games, maybe three, with all our fall
sports. So not only is football good at Florida State, our athletic department
and all our teams have done very well over a number of years. I've always been
in my whole coaching career, I've been at schools that play tremendous
football: Oklahoma State, Miami, Ohio State, so I think it really is an
advantage for me to have that good name recognition with schools that go out
and compete at the highest level in football, it keeps a good name in front of
the public, and I think it makes it easier when you're out trying to sell your
basketball program.  
But I'm not competing against our football program. I'm competing against the
basketball programs in the ACC, and I think we all will say this, it's the
No.1 college basketball conference ever assembled in the history of college
basketball. Those are the guys who I'm competing against.  
It's an advantage for me to be at a school that has all of the sports
participating at a high level. There's nothing but positives that come out of
that.  
  
Q. With all the great teams and all the great players in this league, talk
about how hard it is to prepare for all the different styles of basketball
you're going to see this year.  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, to be very honest with you, even though you have to
prepare, all the games on TV, we all have statistical analysis on every one,
so that's the fun part of being prepared when you play against your opponents.
But we've played basically a man‑to‑man defense, and we don't make‑‑ we make
game time adjustments, but basically our defensive system would be basically
the same.  
Offensively obviously we study our opponents. Someone plays us zone, someone
pressures and someone plays us in man, that's why you practice all those
things in the preseason so that you can make the adjustment when the season
starts. But this is a great conference that's tremendously loaded with skill,
talented players. That's why it's the best, and it's exciting from a player
standpoint and from a coaching standpoint to have to match those wits with
some of the best college basketball coaches and against some players at
schools that are so rich with tradition it makes the atmospheres when you go
on the road at such a tremendous level.  
So it's exciting, it's fun, it's tremendously challenging, but it's tough.
That's why I say sometimes only the strong survive, but I think it's
motivating, and that's why kids come to the ACC, to play in that type of
environment.  
  
Q. If you were to give out a Most Improved award dating back from the loss
in Minnesota to yesterday, whether it's conditioning, whether it's on the
floor, who would you give that award to?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: There's no question that our conditioning level has
improved, especially with our two international players, Bojanovsky and
Michael Ojo. Michael, we had an event the other night, and Michael had the
microphone, and he said he's glad he's at a point now where he can go up and
down the court more than three times and ask to come out of the game. But most
of his was emotional, and he gets excited. The game means an awful lot to him.
But he's improved his vertical, he's improved his conditioning level.  
Bojanovsky has gotten much stronger where he's not being pushed around quite
as much, and he goes against Michael Ojo every day. Michael is about 305
pounds but 4 percent body fat. He's the strongest person I've ever been
around, and Bojanovsky is holding his own, and Kyle turn up is seven‑foot,
250, so there's a lot of physicality going on in there, but I think we've
gotten stronger.  
I think overall our team has improved mentally and emotional where they're a
lot more mature, I think they're more focused. I think they're hungrier. The
practices are with a lot more intensity, and so I think we've improved in
those areas. It would be very difficult to single out any one particular
player, but Aaron Thomas, I feel that he's taken his game to another level.
He's solid, always been a very good defender, but offensively he's shooting
well. He's doing all the little things that I think we're going to need for
him to do in order for us to be successful.  
  
Q. Do you benchmark after each practice? Do you benchmark after each month?
How do you rate the performance level of your team throughout the year?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, we keep statistics on all jump shots, all free throws,
turnovers, rebounds, and those things in practice. At the end of the day I
always evaluate them and tell them where they are and how many mistakes
they've made, how many times we turned the ball over and try to keep them
focused. We'll go back and watch films and kind of see where we are. Last
week, for instance, I didn't like‑‑ we didn't like the progress we was making
just in terms of us understanding what we should be looking for on the
offensive end with the talent that we have.  
And so we've changed our focus. We have agreed where we had things that we
have to get in every week. We kind of slow things down a little bit and want
to go back and‑‑ and I think we came out of last week with a much better
understanding of what we should be trying to accomplish on the offensive end.
Our defense is a lot better. The challenge that we have now, we've got to
become a better rebounding team, and we've got to take care of the ball. We're
still turning the ball over a few times too many, but I think a lot of that
was because we have two fresh young point guards that we're trying to break
in, Rathan‑Mayes and Dayshawn Watkins, who guys who are not only trying to
learn to play the point guard but they're trying to learn everyone else's
position.  
That's the challenge we give our point guards so that they know what everyone
else is doing, and they'll become accustomed to being aggressive offensively.
We find them maybe being a little more aggressive offensively as opposed to
creating for their teammates, and I think that's created a learning curve that
we've got to overcome.  
  
Q. Besides Aaron Thomas who you alluded to, who else has really sharpened up
their offense?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, Devon Bookert has been more of a pass‑first point
guard. I think he averaged eight points a game last year for a sophomore, we
think that was pretty good because he was like the third or fourth‑leading
scorer on our team. He's very capable. He's shot close to 50 percent for his
freshman and sophomore year from the three‑point, and I think that tells you a
lot that he's capable of doing a lot more for us offensively, but he's
sacrificed because he's been our point guard.  
With Rathan‑Mayes, we can playboth of those guys off of the ball, which will
give us a little bit more opportunity to turn Devon loose a little bit more
and let him be a lot more aggressive offensively. And by nature we think Mayes
is a very aggressive offensive player who's capable of giving us double figure
points.  
Montay Brandon, who plays the wing, averaged about seven, eight points last
year. He's right under 6'8". He's a much improved offensive player, so I think
we're going to get more production from those guys, and just with the natural
maturation of Bojanovsky and Michael Ojo and the return of Turpin, who has
given us good solid play, we think that we'll have enough offense, if we play
good defense, to be successful.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Rod Hall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26732)

### [Landry Nnoko](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27794)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Rod, the seniors line the backcourt for you. What can you say about the
veteran leadership of yourself as well as the rest of the guys on the team
right now?  
ROD HALL: We have a good returning class. I think everybody is going to be
more comfortable because everybody got a chance to experience playing in a
game. So me being a senior, I think I'm going to have to hold myself
accountable to get everybody good shots and make sure we get a shot every time
we come down the court.  
  
Q. Rod, last year free throws at times seemed to be a problem for Clemson.
Has there been a focus on that either in the off ‑season or early on in
practice?   
ROD HALL: Yeah, we focus on free throws a lot, getting extra shots all the
time. I mean, we focus on it. We take time out of practice and just do a
segment of just shooting straight free throws. I mean, we punish each other
for it, make sure everybody runs, and just hold each other accountable for it.  
  
Q. Rod, you guys made it to New York last year. Talk about that run and how
that might help you guys make it to the Big Dance this year.  
ROD HALL: We had a good run last year in the NIT. I mean, our main focus was
making it to the NCAA Tournament but we didn't make it there, so we just made
the best out of it and just tried to do the best we could in the NIT. It's
going to have our confidence built going into next season because everybody
played pretty good, even though we didn't finish the way we wanted to.  
  
Q. You lost a really great athlete in K.J.; what will make up his loss
leaving early? How do you guys feel you'll take care of business without
him?  
ROD HALL: I mean, K.J. is going to be a tough loss because you can't replace
the blocked shots and the put‑back dunks that brought the energy to the team.
But we have to focus on the team we have now. Everybody got better over the
summer, and we moved the ball pretty well. I think it's going to be a better
opportunity for everybody to just take a chance with the ball and just get a
good shot.  
  
Q. You've kind of always been the floor general for the team, but do you
feel like you need to increase your scoring this year with 17 points and
everything that K.J. produced?  
ROD HALL: I mean, I don't think nobody really averaged 17 points this year. I
think it's just going to be pretty much balanced out. I mean, I think I'm just
going to take care of the things I've been doing, getting everybody shots and
taking shots when I'm open. So that's going to be my main focus.  
  
Q. The ACC is arguably if not the best college basketball conference. Talk
about what it's like playing in the ACC. What do you like about it?  
ROD HALL: The thing I like the most is every team you play against is going to
be a competitive game. There's no games you can really go out and take a game
off and just kind of like go through the motions and win the game. Every game
you play, you've got to play your best and just compete the best way you can.  
  
Q. With K.J. being gone, that's 17.1, 17.4 points gone per game. Who fills
in? Where do those points come from?  
ROD HALL: I think it's just going to be spread out. I don't think nobody is
going to get 17 points a game. I mean, everybody gets an extra bucket or two
somewhere, we've got guys coming off the bench that can shoot the ball, so I
think that's kind of going to make up for it.  
  
Q. You've seen the ACC kind of change over the last few years with new
teams. What do you think about Louisville coming into the league this season
and just having another quality team in this conference?  
ROD HALL: I think they had a good program going on. I seen them play a couple
times when Russ was the point guard. I think it's going to be a good change,
another competitive team coming in in the ACC that we're going to have to
really focus on and scrap up and play hard against them.  
  
Q. Have you had a chance to think about this being your senior year and what
that means?  
ROD HALL: I kind of thought about it. My senior year came kind of fast, and I
grew over the years, and Coach really worked with me. So I just want to have
the best senior year I can and help my teammates have a good season.  
  
Q. What did you learn from a year ago when the preseason people didn't think
you were going to do very good in the league and you ended up winning 10
games, going from five to 10 wins in the league? And maybe were some people
surprised you finished sixth?  
ROD HALL: We didn't really focus on that because we had a poor season before
last year, so we kind of had a feeling like people was going to kind of put us
at the bottom. But that wasn't our focus, we were just going to come out and
play the best we can and prove everybody wrong and try to be at the top of the
ACC.  
THE MODERATOR: Landry, your turn. Tell us about Rod. What does Rod mean to
this team?  
LANDRY NNOKO: Rod means a lot. He's probably the most important piece. As far
as me, he holds me accountable every day at practice. I really like playing
with him. He gets my team its shots, and he's our leader.  
  
Q. Landry, how do you describe not just the defense but the offense, as
well, for you on this team with you in the middle, the pieces around you? How
do you look at the front court right now?  
LANDRY NNOKO: We shoot it pretty good. I feel like we have a lot, all our
players came back, besides losing K.J. I feel like me being in the middle and
knowing what to do and having all those guys around me, it should be just as
good as we were last year on defense.  
  
Q. It seemed like toward the end of last year, maybe a light came on for
you. Do you feel like you can make a significant stride this year to kind of
fill that gap of K.J.?  
LANDRY NNOKO: Yeah, that's definitely going to be one of my areas of
improvement, and what I've been working on all summer just trying to improve
and trying to help my team in some way, especially on the offensive end and
trying to contribute every night.  
  
Q. Landry, you mentioned your development. I know you've had moments where
you showed greatness, and so what's the key for you to become a great
player?  
LANDRY NNOKO: Right now I think it's just listening and just improving, trust
the process and listen to my coaches. I don't have it figured out. I've just
got to keep listening, honestly. That's all I've got to do.  
  
Q. Do you have a sense for the ball? Is the defense set up in a way that
allows you to get to the ball with your ability to shot block? Do you have a
nose for the ball?  
LANDRY NNOKO: It's our defense. It's our guards. They put a lot of pressure on
the other guards, so usually they just put their head down and try to drive to
the basket and dunk. They usually don't make a decision at the rim.  
  
Q. How often do you get home? And what do you miss most about it?  
LANDRY NNOKO: I really miss my family. It's tough. It's been tough, especially
the past three years, because everyone is home. My dad just moved back in, and
just being away and talking to them, I mean, it's tough.  
  
Q. K.J. is gone, but you've got new freshmen that are coming in and
integrating. Are there one or two players that stand out right now that maybe
we'll be talking about by the end of the year?  
LANDRY NNOKO: Probably Donte Grantham. He's really good. He can pass the ball
and dribble. At 6'8" it's incredible the things he can do. He can shoot the
ball real well.  
Also Gabe DeVoe. He can shot the ball and get to the basket real well. Those
two guys are good pieces for us, and they're definitely going to contribute
right away for us.  
  
Q. What do you want to do this year?  
LANDRY NNOKO: As far as like our team?  
  
Q. Sure.  
LANDRY NNOKO: Just making it to the Tournament and having the chance to play
in March Madness and compete for the ACC Championship.  
  
Q. Obviously the top end of this year is really good with the Dukes and the
North Carolinas and those guys. Where do you feel like this team fits in this
year?  
LANDRY NNOKO: I feel that we're going to be real good. We've just got to keep
working. We have a lot of momentum coming into this season, especially after
the run we made in the NIT. We've just got to keep working and try to get to
the top.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Brian Gregory](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19617)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
BRIAN GREGORY: I look at this year, and the term I keep using is
"opportunity". I think we have an unbelievable opportunity to take another
step forward in the rebuilding process. You know, an opportunity as our first
recruiting class is now juniors, and this is the first year that everybody in
the program has been recruited by us, for us to really kind of forge that
identity of what this program is all about.  
I think we've taken some good steps to go from 11 wins to 17 wins, and then
have a chance maybe last year to accelerate that process. I'm not sure‑‑ I
know as a coach, I didn't think maybe with our first recruiting class being
sophomores that we would be in a position to be a postseason team, but then as
the year started last year, I said, you know what, I think we have a chance.  
You know, you lose 65 games due to injury, it puts you in a tough spot. But in
this league I think one of the things you learn, if you're not a team that can
fight through adversity and if you're not a team with a high level for resolve
and resiliency, then you're really in a tough spot.  
But the opportunity to take another step forward, to build on the identity of
the toughness and the physicality we need to play with, the discipline we need
on offense and defense, the unselfishness on offense, I think that challenge
is exciting not only to me but to the players.  
The opportunity to play in this league where every single night you've got to
be ready to go, and the opportunity for some players like a Marcus, a Demarco
Cox, a Charles Mitchell, guys like that, where they have to take a totally
different role, a new role, and find a greater purpose in their impact that
they can make on this team. All those things put you in a position where you
head into the season with a high level of excitement and you're kind of fired
up about it.  
  
Q. Do you feel that having your team together for three years will give you
a slight advantage over a Duke or a Syracuse, teams that have one ‑and‑done
players?  
BRIAN GREGORY: Well, I don't think there's any question that one of our
formulas, and you've seen that, the last three ACC champions in terms of
Virginia, Miami and Florida State, I don't know the exact number, but I think
there was only one first‑round draft pick on those three teams total. They won
with upperclassmen, and I think as you rebuild, I think that's where you need
to get to. You need to be playing juniors and seniors. Our first class is only
juniors. But we've brought in some guys with some experience, and I think
those guys will make a huge impact for us.  
  
Q. As far as Marcus and also with Corey being here today, what can you say
about ‑‑ you talked about physicality as well as discipline. Where are they at
with that for you and how do they fit into this leadership role that you
need?  
BRIAN GREGORY: Well, as I said, Marcus Georges‑Hunt every day has to walk
around like he knows he's one of the premier players in this league. His
assertiveness and aggressiveness has to be at that level. As a junior now he's
proven that.  
He's a physical player. He'll play some at the 2 this year, and obviously even
at the 3, a very physical player.  
And Corey at both guard spots adds that physicality and that toughness that is
so important to me as a coach.  
I always say when people leave the arena, I want them to say, man, that's the
hardest playing team I've ever seen. That's a physical team and they're not
afraid to knock somebody down once in a while or take a hit or whatever needs
to be done, really rebounds well, stuff like that. Those two guys have to set
the tone.  
Now, we also have in Demarco Cox a fifth‑year player and Charles Mitchell
someone who's no stranger to the ACC, two post players that have to do that,
as well. Those four guys need to set the tone and tempo every day for the
physicalness that we're going to play with, the toughness that we're going to
play with. I always mention the resiliency and resolve you need to play with
in this league.  
  
Q. Has their weight training, their conditioning over the summer gotten you
to this point where you can say with confidence, yeah, we're there?  
BRIAN GREGORY: Well, I think we're pretty close right now. Marcus has lost 20
pounds since last year but has gotten stronger. Corey has lost 21 pounds but
has gotten stronger. I think we have a dynamic freshman in Tadric Jackson. I
think he's going to be a special player for Georgia Tech. Coach Cremins is
here. Coach Cremins always said you've got to get guys that can score the
basketball, do things that you can't teach, and that's exactly what Tadric
does. He scores in a variety of ways. I remember seeing him, and that's not a
great comparison because he's not a guard, but when I saw Tadric as a
freshman, I said, he's an ACC caliber guard. He's in the mode of the Kenny
Andersons and the Stephon Marburys and all those guys, and that's a tough
group to put him in, but I saw him, and he was only a freshman in high school
at that time, as a kid that could come into this league and score 12, 18
points a game, and it's going to be interesting to see if he gains the
consistency in his performance to do that.  
But all freshmen and all newcomers, they usually have to lose weight or gain
weight, and they have to learn how to play at a high energy level every single
day in practice, especially the young guys, and that will be Tadric's greatest
challenge this year.  
  
Q. Last year you won three of your last four, obviously with the last one
being an overtime loss in the tournament. Does any aspect of that carry over
to the season or is that sort of on the shelf?  
BRIAN GREGORY: No, I think it carries over. Again, I think one of the most
challenging aspects of rebuilding in a league like this, and so now you start
the rebuilding process and you get the great news that four top‑25 teams are
joining the league, two of them led by Hall of Fame coaches. So now the job
gets a little harder.  
Sometimes the biggest challenge is the tangible evidence that you need. We're
a much better team than we were three years ago. We score more points per
game. Our defensive field goal percentage is less. We rebound the ball better.
We shoot the ball better from the free‑throw line, and the key big for us,
assist‑to‑turnover ratio is dramatically improved. So there's no doubt‑‑ but
the problem is you have to have some tangible evidence, and like it or not, in
this profession the only tangible evidence is wins and losses.  
To go into Syracuse and win that game last year, to win three out of the last
four, I think that was the healthiest we had been since December. So I think
our guys took a look and were able to step back and say, okay, we couldn't
control some of the stuff that happened, but when we did have everybody, this
is what we did. Let's make sure we use this summer and fall to prepare
ourselves to take another big step in this process.  
  
Q. You have an infectious personality on the sideline. Do you think any of
your players pick up on that personality? Do you sort of recruit towards that
type of energy?  
BRIAN GREGORY: Well, you know, I think one thing in the recruiting process,
you want guys that you feel comfortable with, guys that understand what you're
all about and what's important to you, so I think that's‑‑ there is a piece of
that in the recruiting. We have some guys that are a little more reserved and
so forth. But that doesn't mean they can't play with the passion that they
need to play with. I think Marcus is a reserved kid, but his passion is never
questioned as a player. It would be interesting if the officials felt that my
personality was infectious on the sidelines, as well.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Mark Gottfried](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13796)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. What you've seen from the team heading into the season? Obviously you
don't have a Warren anymore. The guys here talked about finding it in each
other and maybe by committee a little bit. What have you been able to take
away from them in practice and where you're heading from here?  
MARK GOTTFRIED: Well, for us we're obviously a lot different. The one thing
with TJ that a lot of people don't realize is he led the nation in field goals
made last year. He made more baskets than any player in the country, so when
you take a guy like that out of your lineup and he's now in the NBA, you've
got to figure out how are you going to find some of those points and baskets.
So I think with our team, the question is going to be, can everybody
collectively step their game up and do a little bit more? Ralston Turner
averaged 11 points a game. Can you get 14, 15? Can a guy that averaged five
points a game become a 10‑or‑11‑point‑a‑game guy?  
So our team is much different. We've relied heavily on TJ, but we needed to
last year. Other guys weren't ready as young players to maybe do that every
night.  
Now we're a little bit older. We've added in a couple new faces. But I think
for us, especially offensively, is going to be how well we can find scoring
from other guys that maybe haven't scored that much in the past.  
  
Q. TJ made it look so easy last year. You obviously, as you just said, don't
have anything like that. In his absence who's the most efficient scorer in
your mind that you have right now?  
MARK GOTTFRIED: I'm not sure we have one guy that's the most efficient. A
player like Trevor Lacey, who's played two years at Alabama, was a very good
player there. He's going to give us a lot, I think, from an offensive
perspective. But we've got four interior guys, BeeJay Anya, Lennard Freeman,
Kyle Washington and then a freshman, Abdul‑Malik Abu. All four of them are
very different. How much scoring can we get out of that group? It'll be
interesting to see. Really for me that's the question. Every day I think we
can become really efficient offensive team.  
But we're at that point where you've just got some guys that have to step up
and be a lot different than they were in the past.  
  
Q. Ralston actually had a pretty good quote about Abu. He said, "He's not
going to be LeBron James, but he'll be exciting to watch." You've been very
complimentary and optimistic about him physically. Where is he along that road
now?  
MARK GOTTFRIED: Well, he's like a lot of freshmen. Some days looks really
good, some days a little bit lost, and that's not uncommon. He's got all the
physical tools. He's a terrific athlete. One thing I love about coaching him,
even early on here, he's tremendously eager. Every day when he walks in, he's
hunting for something. He's hunting for coaching every day, and that's
exciting for me and our staff.  
So he's got a chance to become special. Again, he's got three sophomore
forwards ahead of him that are there, but he's going to come pretty quick.  
I don't know for sure yet. We'll see. But he's got a chance to become real
special.  
  
Q. How would you define this team moving forward? Kind of where NC State is,
the talent keeps improving; Louisville is now part of the conference. Are they
at where you need them to be? Are you going in the right direction even though
you don't have Warren?  
MARK GOTTFRIED: You know, when I took the job three years ago, now four years
ago, we were at a place at NC State where they hadn't been in a tournament in
a number of years, not a lot of momentum, and we've been fortunate to go to
three straight NCAA Tournaments. Now the question for us is, can you get back
in it, but how do you go to the next step? How do you become a team that can
be a Sweet 16 or a Final Four team? We may be a year away. Our guys are still
pretty young. We've got a young team.  
But for us, that's the question for me. So when I ask myself every day, how
can we get a little bit better? What can I do as a coach to help them get
better? Some of it is recruiting good players, and some of it is what we do as
coaches. So we feel good about what's happened, but it's not where we really
want to be. We want to do something more special than that.  
So that's what kind of drives me every day, drives our coaches every day is to
figure out how can we take that next big step.  
  
Q. Do you sense an adaptability in your team without having to lean on one
person, just manage and make adjustments?  
MARK GOTTFRIED: Well, I think the sign we all like as coaches or the thing we
like to see is when our teams get better from the beginning to the end. That's
what as coaches we all take this group of guys, and every year is a little bit
different, and I can go through the last three years at NC State, and they're
all completely different. Our personnel and the ages of our guys and how many
young guys, and so each year is different.  
But for us, it's how do we keep getting better, how do we improve throughout
the year to where we become the best team we can be? How is that going to
happen for our team?  
So yeah, some of it's adaptability. You've got to figure out who can do what.
They all think they can score 20 points a game, but they can't. They all think
they can do certain things, but they really can't. Part of what we have to do
and the guys who are really good in our profession, are really good at it, is
trying to figure out their team and figure out how that team really needs to
play for them to be successful.  
So for us, it's a little bit of a challenge this year because we've got a
number of guys that are unproven players. I think they can take that step and
be an efficient player, still shooting a good percentage, still being a good
defender, but we'll see. Some of that the jury is out, and so we've got to
figure that out this year with our team.  
  
Q. Your student ‑athletes smiled this morning when asked about BeeJay Anya.
They're happy with his progress. How do you feel?   
MARK GOTTFRIED: You know, it's a good news, bad news. The bad news was he got
up to 350 pounds, which is not good for a college athlete. The good news is
he's dropped about 60 pounds, and I think what happens with a guy like that,
with BeeJay, number one, he's a sophomore now, he's still young, but at least
he's got a chance now to get better, where I thought last year with his weight
where it was, it was really even hard for him to begin to really improve, and
so now he's taken that big step. Now he's got a chance, and now we've got to
continue to help him develop and grow. But he's in a much better place, so
we'll see how that works out.  
  
Q. You've got four freshmen, one with a really familiar last name this year,
Martin.  
MARK GOTTFRIED: Two of them.  
  
Q. Two of them, I'm sorry.  
MARK GOTTFRIED: Well, we've got three freshmen guys we've brought into our
team: Caleb and Cody Martin, twins. They shave the same, they look the same.
I've told people many times, if one is really playing well and ends up in foul
trouble, at halftime we'll change jerseys. But they're good players.  
And then Abdul‑Malik Abu has got a chance to be really special. We've talked
about him.  
And then with the addition of Trevor Lacey, who sat out last year from
Alabama, that gives us four new players for this year's team.  
  
Q. Kyle said earlier during his session that the team is so confident and
cohesive and he thinks you recruit guys who want to step up and be leaders. Do
you coach confidence to a certain level beyond Xs and Os trying to instill
confidence in players?  
MARK GOTTFRIED: Well, I think we all do that. We all try to do that. We're not
always successful doing that. I've tried to recruit guys, and while we've
recruited them, I've tried to find guys that want to accept the challenge of
going to NC State. I live in a tough neighborhood, college basketball, and
I've got neighbors down the road that have been pretty good. And we've tried
to challenge guys in that if you choose to come here, you've got to accept the
challenge, that to stand on the top in this league, it's tough. You'd better
be willing to pay a price to do it.  
So we'll see. I think Kyle is a guy that he mentioned to me being confident.
He's very confident. I think our team is that way. As coaches we always try.
Sometimes we're not as successful as we want to be in getting a team that
become that way.  
And success usually breeds confidence. When you have success, you get a little
bit more confident, and so as your team gets better, you gain that confidence.
So we've been able to do a little bit of that. Now we've got to do a little
bit more.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Marcus Georges-Hunt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24992)

### [Corey Heyward](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27798)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
MARCUS GEORGES‑HUNT: I've been there for three years now, going on three
years. I know what Coach Brian Gregory wants to do, and I know his system very
well. So me being able to teach the younger guys and the transfers will be
great for our program.  
  
Q. How do you feel the team has been, like you said, some of the transfers
and the new guys, as far as being receptive to what you're trying to teach?
How do you feel they've responded to you so far?  
MARCUS GEORGES‑HUNT: They've responded great. They come to me, ask questions.
They're hungry to learn. They're buying into Coach Gregory's system. So far
practices have been going well, and it's been real productive.  
  
Q. What do you want out of this season?  
MARCUS GEORGES‑HUNT: I want to win. I would love an ACC championship, and make
it to the Big Dance.  
  
Q. We asked a question earlier that sometimes the student ‑athletes take on
the personality of their coaches. You've got a pretty fiery coach. Are you a
fiery team?   
MARCUS GEORGES‑HUNT: I wouldn't say fiery team, but I would say blue‑collar
workers. Our coach is pretty fiery. He's real big on defense, so we're going
to be a great defensive team because we focus a lot on defense.  
Offensively we have a new system, so that's going pretty good. We've been
practicing on it, and we're enjoying it. We're enjoying it so far, and we
think it's going to be real productive.  
  
Q. Marcus, among the guys coming back, who do you see as maybe the most
improved player, somebody who's really going to take a big step forward this
year?  
MARCUS GEORGES‑HUNT: For us?  
  
Q. Uh ‑huh.   
MARCUS GEORGES‑HUNT: You said a big step, meaning on the team?  
  
Q. Yeah, somebody who maybe was a contributor last year but he's going to be
a really key player this year.  
MARCUS GEORGES‑HUNT: Well, being that we lost a lot of people, I feel like
Corey Heyward will make a big step, being that he has one year under his belt
playing the point guard position. So he's going to run the team and instruct
us and lead us the way‑‑ playing the point guard position. I think he's going
to make a big jump and contribute.  
  
Q. Corey, Marcus talked about being a leader or being more of a leader.
Describe his personality on the floor and in the locker room.  
COREY HEYWARD: Marcus on the floor is definitely‑‑ you can always count on him
if he needs to hit that big shot or get that big rebound. Off the court, he's
definitely from example in the classroom. He takes extra steps, especially on
the court, and to get in the gym. He's got his body right, into the best shape
as possible for this year, the upcoming season. He's been a very key leader so
far.  
  
Q. Corey, how do you define Georgia Tech going into this season? Obviously
there's been some adversity over the years, but what you can see in this team
and how you view yourselves from the inside out.  
COREY HEYWARD: I see ourselves as a team that's fighting to make an imprint,
especially in the ACC and college basketball, and we are a team of guys that
want to fight and sacrifice and kind of your guys that will‑‑ blue collar,
definitely, and we're also kind of‑‑ we have something to prove, especially
with the new guys coming in, as well, have something to prove and kind of be a
big impact on the team and the conference, as well.  
  
Q. Six freshmen are on this roster. Obviously in time they're going to be a
major impact to the program. Can you give an assessment right now of what they
seem like and what they're performing like.  
COREY HEYWARD: So far each freshman has surprised us. Everybody brings
something different to the table. Tadric can shoot the ball. He's definitely
going to be a key piece on the offensive end as well as defense, because he's
very athletic. And then our two big men with Abdoulaye and Ben, who are
probably the best passers on the team. They can score, they're long, athletic.
And Travis coming back from his ACL has been a true surprise, and he's been
doing a really good job, and they're ready to kind of lead them and show them
the way.  
  
Q. Corey, what do you see as the steps that you've taken in the areas, the
biggest strides that you've made in improving your game this year?  
COREY HEYWARD: Improving my game, especially last year, I was a little more on
the heavier side coming back from an ACL injury. And when you haven't really
played a year long of basketball and when you're lifting weights and eating,
you usually put on those pounds. This past off‑season Coach Gregory just told
me I needed to cut some weight, get the body fat, it would be easier on the
knee, and I've lost nearly 20 pounds so far. It's been a great transition.
Athletic ability has came back, and it's been great so far.  
  
Q. What was the toughest thing you had to give up?  
COREY HEYWARD: Toughest thing I had to give up, certain foods. I probably
couldn't tell you the last time I went to McDonald's. That's been a great key.
Listening to my strength and conditioning coach, who's been an excellent
resource, and just listen. You have to listen to your body, and sometimes you
have to do the extra things, if. It's after practice get on the treadmill, get
on the stair master, you have to do that.  
  
Q. This is just like a general basketball question, but Georgia Tech has
obviously been affected by it: What's it like with so many kids transferring,
and you lose some and you get some new. What's that been like, the transfers
for Georgia Tech?  
COREY HEYWARD: So far for Georgia Tech, with each transfer that's coming in
we've treated them as a brother and they've bought into the system. Especially
this year I felt like they've been with us for the past three years.
Especially Chuck who was from Atlanta, we already knew who Chuck was. But
Demarco has molded into I wouldn't say a father figure, but someone you can
look up to and get a lot of answers from him, because he's played a lot of
basketball.  
And Josh, I feel like he's just been one of us from the start, and just the
entire team was recruited by Coach Gregory, and it's the first year of that,
so that's been key.  
  
Q. How is Rob doing?  
COREY HEYWARD: Rob is doing a great job. He runs the floor extremely well,
blocks shots, has a wing span of I don't know how long. You can find out when
you try to take a three‑point shot and he blocks it when he's jumping from the
block. He dunks it any time he gets it. He can shoot the ball really well.
He'll be a stretch forward. He'll be a good key for us.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Just how you see this team this year and what you've been able to take
away from some guys like James and Cameron that are here today, just how you
see the team going this season.  
JAMIE DIXON: Well, I like the group. They're working hard. It's a really good
passing team, and that's exciting. With that, you've got some guys that kind
of have a feel for the game. They understand spacing. They understand hitting
the open man, shot selection I think to a pretty good degree at this point. To
me, understanding the game allows you to get better, improve, and we can try
to put some concepts in defensively that we can grow and get better with.  
Excited about that. Obviously we've got to get Cameron out there. It's
interesting practicing this entire time without your leading returning scorer.
But guard play should be good, point guard play specifically with James and
Josh Newkirk, so that's unique I think having two point guards back with a lot
of experience. Cameron, another guy who can play the point, just gives us good
decision making.  
Perimeter, we've got some depth. We'll put some bodies out there. Durand is
not where we thought he would be. The ankle has been added to the knee. It's
been more of a challenge than we thought. And then obviously the big guy
situation, we've got some guys returning. We added some guys, and last year I
thought we got a pretty good effort out of our front line considering we only
had really one returning player in Talib. A lot of excitement about our five
sophomores. All of them are good players.  
  
Q. Last year you got to play some new teams, play in new places. What was
the biggest thing you learned about playing in this league last year?  
JAMIE DIXON: I mean, a little less zone than maybe we were used to as far as
coming from the Big East. I thought we‑‑ that was the biggest thing. I think a
lot of the places we were familiar with because of former Big East teams, so
that wasn't as much of a change as people were making it out to be.  
But I think the biggest thing was just seeing less zone. We just didn't see as
much as we had seen in the past, and with Louisville coming in, though, we
think we'll see some more zone, and it's something that we need to be prepared
for and do a good job against.  
That's the biggest challenge.  
  
Q. You just brought it up; with Louisville, can't get away from Rick Pitino.
His talent and the level, whoever he has on the team, you know the type of
coach he is and what he's able to put together.  
JAMIE DIXON: Yeah, because they joined the Big East a couple years after I'd
been there and been the head coach, and I didn't realize the tradition, the
resources, the following that Louisville and the program had until we started
going down there and playing against them and seeing the commitment they had
to basketball, college basketball and their program. And now we're in the same
ACC together.  
It is amazing how it works out. It is remarkable that we're now in the ACC
after Maryland leaving; who could have predicted that? They're here, and
they're obviously very good. They recruit very good players. They've gotten
players from Seattle, Washington, and they've gotten players from all over the
world, so they obviously can find players and attract players from different
parts of the country and the world. And they bring a little bit more zone to
the conference, which is something we were so used to in the Big East, and I
think they're going to bring a bit of physicality and aggressiveness to the
conference, as well, that will be a bit of a change obviously with the rules
and how they're calling the game. We're going to see how it all plays out with
that, if it continues with the tight calls, the hand checking, and where the
officials go with that as we go forward.  
  
Q. Last year one of the odd things about your conference record, you were 7
‑2 on the road and only 4‑5 at home. How did that happen?  
JAMIE DIXON: It's remarkable. We've been talking about we had the best record
on the road in the conference, which should mean you're going to be winning a
conference championship, and we're known for our home record at Peterson Event
Center. We had five bad losses at home, and any loss at home is a bad loss. If
you want to win the conference, you've got to win your home games, so we
played good enough on the road to win the conference, but we didn't get it
done at home.  
That's something that we lost close games. We lost two games at the buzzer,
and if we win those home games‑‑ we were talking about RPI. You just can't
lose your home games and play out all the things that we did. We win those two
games we lose at the buzzer, all of a sudden we're not in the 8‑9 game, we're
not playing Florida in the second round, the best team in the country, or the
third round, whatever you want to call it at this point. You've got to win
your home games, and we've got to get back to doing that because that's what
we always did in the Big East.  
But we lost some close games, and we lost some games we shouldn't have to be
honest. We lost to good teams, though, in every case. We lost to good teams.
But you've got to win the home games, and it's something we're very much aware
of, but we'd like to keep the 7‑2 record at home, as would anyone else in our
conference.  
  
Q. Given all the changes within the league over the last couple of years,
you think about the defense, the offense, the quickness, what will this season
‑‑ what will the personality be for the ACC this year as people think about it
in March?   
JAMIE DIXON: I think‑‑ I don't know. That's always the thing that you hear in
this conference. The conferences are so big now, and there's 15, and there's
16 teams. To say that you can have a personality or a style of play, I don't
think it's possible. You see all different styles of play. We saw that in the
Big East. We saw it with all the different defenses, the zones, the different
types of zones, the man‑to‑man, the pressing teams, the walk‑it‑up teams.  
It's funny how it is. Sometimes I'm amazed, too. Sometimes teams get labeled
something that they're not. We got‑‑ sometimes people say, I had somebody just
ask me about us being a team that walks it up, and I asked them who were the
top three leading scoring teams in the ACC this past year, and of course we
were one of the three. He didn't figure that out when I asked the question,
but that was my point. I mean, there is‑‑ we were one of the three leading
scoring teams.  
You know, you're going to get all different styles, and I know we want to be
labeled and that's what people look to do, to sum it up in one sentence, but
this is going to be a conference of really good teams that all play different
styles.  
  
Q. You have the Maui tournament coming up, and other than hoping to come
back with a championship, what do you hope the team will teach you and what do
you think the team may do even off the court?  
JAMIE DIXON: Well, there's nothing they'll be doing off the court. It's about
getting ready to play basketball. We're going to play an extra game; we're
going to play Mercy of Hawai'i. We've got four games and then one game at home
as part of that tournament. It's five games really in total, and we're excited
about the opportunity. We haven't gone out there. I coached out there,
obviously, as did Coach Pitino way back when. He seems to‑‑ whenever I bring
those days up, he laughs about it.  
But it's going to be a great event. It's going to be a great opportunity. It's
our first time playing out there. As much as I like going back and visiting
out there, playing there is not something I've always wanted to do. But our
guys are excited about it. It's going to be a great event.  
I think Cameron, we don't know when he'll be back, around that time or
something, so we are in a unique situation when your leading scorer is going
to be out all that time and then going to be coming back around that four or
five games we're playing as part of that event. We'll see how it plays out.
We're still a team that's finding our identity, finding our rotation, as are
all teams at this point, but a few injuries have allowed us to get some guys
some reps but also have slowed down the progress of some others.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Quinn Cook](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25286)

### [Amile Jefferson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27800)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Amile, we've heard a lot about Okafor and what he can be to this team.
How have you pushed each other in practice so far?  
AMILE JEFFERSON: Every day in practice we're doing a lot of things to compete,
a lot of drills, and right now we're pushing each other by communicating and
talking a lot and making sure that we're fighting and everything we do. Off
the court we're all best of friends, but when we're in between those lines,
everyone is fighting and trying to win.  
  
Q. After the disappointing loss to Mercer in Game 1 of the NCAA Tournament
this year, do you feel that this team has something to prove?  
AMILE JEFFERSON: You know, I think what happens is people take that loss as
that we had a bad season, but we really didn't. We actually had a pretty good
season, and it's just the nature of the beast. March is brutal, and if you're
not hungry, things like that will happen.  
It's more about getting our team to be hungry and worthy of winning in March
right now than proving something to someone. We have something to prove to
each other that we are worthy of winning, but for our group right now, it's
about being worthy and getting ready and having that hunger right now, so when
March comes, it's just innate. It's in our nature to be that good.  
  
Q. With the young talent that's come in as well as other guys that have been
on the squad before, how do you feel the balance is right now as far as how
you guys have taken in the guys that are new?  
AMILE JEFFERSON: The balance has been great. I think that's partly due to how
close those guys were when they came in. You know, their bond was something
special even before coming to Duke. They were already best friends. So it was
kind of like we just all fit around that, around that real close‑knit bond
that they had, instead of it being vice versa, and I think that really helped
for everyone to become really, really tight and really, really good friends on
and off the court, and that really helped the balance, so it wasn't like
upperclassmen head‑butting with the younger guys. It was just like everybody
coming in as a collective unit.  
  
Q. As a captain on a team that's stock full of freshman talent, what type of
knowledge do you impart to them? What do you say to them going into this
season?  
AMILE JEFFERSON: For me it's just about being really, really vocal and telling
them all that I've learned from our previous leaders, like Mason, who was a
leader that brought in every day and really made sure before practice that
guys were ready. Now that it's my turn to be a leader, I really try to make
sure that each and every day guys' heads are where they need to be so that
young guys don't have bad practices or come into practice with extra baggage
like maybe I did bad on this test or I'm having problems back home. When we're
in practice, we're in practice, and that's what guys have to focus on.  
I take it upon myself as my job to make sure that everyone is ready once we
start for the day.  
  
Q. After Countdown to Craziness the other night, you said that you had some
things to learn. We saw some game action in front of people. What are some
things that you discovered on Saturday?  
AMILE JEFFERSON: I think that we discovered that we can be really good and
that we have a lot of talent. But the things we have to learn are definitely
on the defensive end, communicating with each other more, making sure that
everyone is in the right position on defense, and then just playing
fundamentally sound and making sure guys are rebounding. But from Countdown, I
think everyone saw that we have a talented corps, and playing around Jahlil
and making sure all our pieces complement each other is going to be really
good and help us have a really, really good unit this year.  
  
Q. Talk about Matt Jones and his work during the off ‑season. His shot
looked improved the other night, as well.   
AMILE JEFFERSON: You know, and watching Matt in high school, he was a
knock‑down shooter, and it was great to see. At times he struggled, but he
worked so hard this summer on his shot. I think everyone can see that it's
much better, and it feels like‑‑ it seems to me like he's back in that
comfortable state that he was when he was shooting the ball really well. So it
was really exciting to see someone get back into I guess you could say like
their swagger or their comfort zone where they're just playing how you know
they can play.  
For me it's really exciting to see him play the way he's been playing.  
  
Q. How did you guys possibly allow Marshall Plumlee to win the dunk
contest?  
AMILE JEFFERSON: I'm pretty sure Marshall won like a City of Palms back in
high school, so he had the championship belt before. He has won on a big
stage. He's seven‑foot, and he jumps just like his brothers. I think a couple
guys missed a couple dunks that would have really wooed the crowd. But I think
it was much deserved for Marshall.  
THE MODERATOR: Quinn, you're up. The comment was just made about Marshall and
his ability to get up. Grayson Allen I think surprised a lot of people by his
vertical. Are there other elements to Grayson Allen that are going to surprise
some people do you think?  
QUINN COOK: His ability to shoot jumpers, to knock down jumpers has really
impressed everybody on our team. He's a heck of an athlete. When we did our
testing and stuff for our strength and conditioning, he placed in the top
three in everything we did athletically, so that says a lot about the gifts
that he has. He works hard. He works extremely hard. All the things that he
does well, it obviously pays off.  
  
Q. Quinn, with you and Tyus, just how he's pushed you and you've pushed him
so far and what the expectation can be of the backcourt featuring both of
you?  
QUINN COOK: Yeah, this preseason and all summer it's been great just getting
each other better, working hard, him showing me things, myself showing him
things and things like that. It's been good for both of us. We want to play
together in the backcourt. He makes the game easier for everybody. You know,
he gets guys the ball, and it's been fun thus far just getting to know each
other and getting acclimated with each other's playing styles. Hopefully we
can be really good this year.  
  
Q. You came into the program highly touted with great expectations. You've
shown flashes of greatness. Talk about your consistency and what you've worked
on this off ‑season and what you expect out of your senior season.   
QUINN COOK: Just hopefully this year being the most consistent. That's been
the biggest thing for me. I think just the up and down, like you said, I've
had good times and I've had some bad times. Just stringing a lot of positive
things this year, just growing up, being mature and knowing that this is my
last year and playing with a sense of urgency. I want to leave here as a
winner, and just myself and Amile being captains, just helping these guys out
and just us leading by example and get being out there and getting the job
done really has been my biggest focus, and just having fun.  
  
Q. It seems the early indications are that you might be part of the group
that's coming off the bench. Is that accurate in your view, and how do you
embrace that role and what can you bring in that role?  
QUINN COOK: Yeah, we don't have a starting lineup yet. Different guys, we have
like a white and blue team different guys are put on the white team, different
guys are put on the blue team. So we'll know soon, but whatever Coach wants us
to do, I think everybody will buy in because he obviously knows what he's
doing. We all have to buy in and just put personal sacrifices aside.  
  
Q. Given the depth that you guys have, how many different variations of
starting lineups are possible, and will we see a number of different
combinations of players on the floor this year do you think?  
QUINN COOK: Yeah, it's a lot of different combinations that we'll be seeing.
We have 10 guys that can play and contribute immediately, I think. I don't
know if we'll do five and five like we did last year a couple times, but we
have guys who can play, and that's been motivation for everybody to not take
days off because you can't take a play off because you're going to get exposed
in practice. It's been good, competitive energy in practice. Everybody has
been getting better. All 10 guys are ready to start playing.  
  
Q. Rasheed Sulaimon is one of those guys that was up and down last year, as
well. What type of off ‑season did he have?   
QUINN COOK: Rasheed has been practicing great. He knows he didn't have the
season he wanted to have last year, just being up and down, and he had such a
big freshman season. He knows what he had to do this summer and he's been
playing great, and he seems more mature. He's been good.  
  
Q. How would you define a successful season for Duke?  
QUINN COOK: You know, win the regular season championship, win the ACC
Tournament, and win the national championship. You know, I think guys are
based on how much they win here at Duke. I don't think it's based on how many
points you average or your personal. Guys want to leave here as winners, and
the most loved guys at Duke history, they've all won. I mean, we want to go as
far as we can.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Pat Connaughton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23387)

### [Jerian Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23464)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. You had some players that were ineligible and now they're back. How is it
having those guys back?  
PAT CONNAUGHTON: It's very important to our team. I think it's going to be
something that really helps our team and is going to be something that we need
for the season and that is going to help this season be much better than last.  
  
Q. Before the season gets started there are obviously things every year that
each program needs to work on. What is it right now that seems to be the focus
of concentration?  
PAT CONNAUGHTON: I think the focus for our team is defense. I think if you
look at the box scores from last year and just the games in general from last
year, there are only a few times where we really weren't in games and there
were a lot of games that came down to the last few minutes, last few
possessions, and we couldn't seem to get that one stop that we needed. We've
been working on it all off‑season, we worked on it in our foreign tour in
Italy, and it's the thing that we're priding our team on throughout the year.  
  
Q. You led the team in rebounding last year. In fact, you're the ACC's
leading returning career rebounder. At 6'5 ", how do you do that?   
PAT CONNAUGHTON: It's just having a nose for the ball. I think rebounding has
been something I've always kind of prided myself on because it's something
that arguably you can control. It's something that you can‑‑ it's an effort
thing. It's something that on the defensive end you can box out your man and
you can just attack the ball. It's something that I look to improve on this
year and have better numbers at this year.  
  
Q. How does your baseball help your basketball and your basketball help your
baseball?  
PAT CONNAUGHTON: So my baseball definitely helps my basketball just because
when you're on the mound pitching, you're really the only one out there, so no
matter how you perform, you have to learn how to pick yourself up and learn
how to calm yourself down in important spots and really focus on how you're
going to proceed and succeed, even when you're not having the best of success.  
And then vice versa, you just don't see as many athletic pitchers, and I think
basketball has really helped me with that, just to show my athleticism, gain
my athleticism, and incorporate it on the mound.  
  
Q. Your decision to come back and play basketball knowing that you have
interest on the baseball side, what made you want to be where you are right
now? And how do you feel about your decision in hindsight?  
PAT CONNAUGHTON: Well, I think what made we want to be where I am right now is
just the fact that I love both sports. I love playing both sports. It's
something that I've done for my entire life, so it's something that I've kind
of always wanted to do.  
And then my decision to come back was more or less just because I want to see
what I can do with basketball. I know there's baseball interest and that's not
something I take for granted by any means, but at the same time I've been
playing both sports my whole life, and I mean, I'm here on a basketball
scholarship, so I wasn't ready to put down the basketball and to end my
basketball career. I want to see where that takes me, as well.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts about practice so far, your game speed? How is
everything shaping up for you?  
JERIAN GRANT: It's going pretty well. Italy definitely helped. We had a
foreign tour this summer, got to play four games. So going out there and being
able to get back on the floor with the guys definitely helped me out to be
able to start the season quick.  
  
Q. Having the game taken away from you, what did that teach you and what do
you bring into this season knowing that it was away from you for a little
bit?  
JERIAN GRANT: It was definitely. You definitely learn not to take the game for
granted. I had to play every game like it was my last, and I played pretty
well, and it was tough to leave the team and see them struggle like that. Just
being able to bring it every day in practice and every day in the game and
help to lead the team.  
  
Q. What do you really like about this team right now?  
JERIAN GRANT: Defensively I think last year that was our main offensive
struggle before and after I left, so just focusing on defense this year;
everybody has gotten better at it. So I think that's where we'll be able to
improve.  
  
Q. Jerian, did you learn anything by forced into being an observer last
year, the things that you watched in practice and in games? Did you pick up on
some things that maybe you wouldn't otherwise have?  
JERIAN GRANT: Yeah, I think I got to know a lot of my teammates' tendencies a
lot better. Being on the court you kind of want to learn on the fly, but being
able to watch them you figure out how you can help them and things they need
to work on and things that they're good at. Those are things you can help with
on the court with their strengths and weaknesses.  
  
Q. As far as obviously basketball being in your family, what did your
brother Jerami teach you and how has he helped you through this, knowing that
he was here last year and now has gone ahead to the NBA?  
JERIAN GRANT: You know, he just lets me know that my time is coming. He's at a
place where he wants to be in the NBA and he's excited for it. He's excited
for me to have an opportunity to get there, too.  
  
Q. You averaged 19 points a game before the season sort of ended for you
last year. Do you feel like you can reach 19 a game again this year, or do you
feel like you even have to, given the talent on this team?  
JERIAN GRANT: I don't think it's something I have to do, but it's definitely
something that I think I can do, and just we have a lot of talent on our team
that people don't know about. A lot of people didn't get to see a lot of faces
that are out here or they got `to see a lot of young guys that have really
matured after all last season and the foreign trip.  
You know, we definitely have a lot of talent on the team, but at the same time
I definitely expect myself to be even at a higher level than I was last year.  
  
Q. Call out one or two of your teammates. Who will shine by the time we get
to January, let's say?  
JERIAN GRANT: Well, definitely our starting point guard Demetrius Jackson, and
then the big guy Zach Auguste, those two have come a long way from the mental
lapses and the struggles they had last year to be two guys that defenses are
definitely going to have to look at throughout the season.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Dennis Clifford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27792)

### [Olivier Hanlan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24978)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Olivier, how would you describe your new coach Jim Christian, and how
would you define him right now?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: He has a lot of energy. He loves what he does, and he's been
doing a good job with every single player on the team. He relates to the
players well, and he just finds a way to get the most out of each player in
terms of it could be a big man or a shooting guard or a guard. I just feel
like he makes everybody play 100 percent.  
  
Q. Is that to say that everybody has adjusted their personalities, everybody
has figured each other out?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: I like to think so. I just feel like, like I said earlier, he
just does a good job in terms of relating to each player and each different
character player. He's been doing a good job in terms of just getting
everybody used to his style of play and just making everybody get used to him.  
  
Q. Olivier, looking at the fact that you were the go ‑to guy last year, who
do you feel has really stepped up in practice in the off‑season, working out
together with you? Who do you feel can get the job done this year and take
some pressure off of you?   
OLIVIER HANLAN: We have two fifth‑year guys in Dimitri and Aaron. Aaron came
from Southern Miss, and he does a pretty good job on offense. He just knows
how to play the game in terms of defensively and offensively and just getting
me easier looks, and he's definitely a pretty good shooter.  
And Dimitri is just an athletic wing guard that can go up and down and get
scores. Obviously having Dennis Clifford back this year makes it easier on me
in terms of the pick‑and‑roll offense and just knowing that I have a true 5
that's playing down low with me.  
  
Q. You averaged 18.5 last year. Do you feel like you need to average that
again this year?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: I'll definitely have to score a lot of points this year, but I
just feel like these last few weeks, just having a guy like Dennis back and
the few fifth‑year guys and just everybody kind of stepping it up this year
will make it a lot easier on me in terms of scoring‑wise and obviously
defensively everybody is on the same page when it comes to getting stops this
year.  
We focus on a lot more defense this year than last year, so we kind of make it
one of our main focuses.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you've kind of flown under the radar up to this point in
your career, and how has that affected the way that you play the game?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: It doesn't really change much for me. I've been used to it
since my early days when I was in Canada, and after that I went to prep
school, and after that I got a few scholarships and went to BC. So I'm kind of
used to having that‑‑ not necessarily that title, but people underrating me or
not looking at me as much as at other players. I kind of use it as motivation
and it's kind of a chip on my shoulder, to be honest.  
  
Q. What makes this season successful for you guys this year amidst the
change and the different personnel?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: I just feel like we have an old group of guys. We have a lot
of seniors, we have two fifth‑year guys, so we're a pretty veteran team when
it comes to just the ACC itself. I just feel like if we just put everything
together and we kind of gel at the right moment this year, we can do some good
things.  
  
Q. Talk about Dennis Clifford.  
OLIVIER HANLAN: He had a bumpy year last year but had one of the best summers
in terms of team‑wise ‑‑ in terms of him getting better, him getting back on
the court. He's been playing pain‑free and he's been having a good time with
it, so I'm happy to see him out there.  
And it just makes it so much easier on everybody when you have a seven‑footer
in the key.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Dennis to come up. Thanks, Olivier.  
  
Q. Dennis, what do you think about your teammate Olivier?  
DENNIS CLIFFORD: Obviously he's one of the more polished scorers in our
league. It's just been a joy practicing with him, working with him, seeing how
confident he approaches the game. I think that really helps the rest of the
team.  
  
Q. Dennis, how frustrating was it for you last year, just not to be ‑‑ you
had a great preseason, and that trip that you guys took, I think it was to
Greece last year?   
DENNIS CLIFFORD: We went to Spain sophomore year. That was two years ago.  
  
Q. And then you got hurt. Just not being able to get on the court, what was
that like, and how do you feel now?  
DENNIS CLIFFORD: Well, I'll start with sophomore year because that's when we
went to Spain, and after Spain, I was real successful overseas, just like
gelling with the new teammates. That was when O was a freshman, and I think we
were starting to establish something really positive, and then that's when I
got hurt in the preseason, and I ended up playing my whole sophomore year
hurt.  
So I think that was the most frustrating part of my career so far.  
And then last year was also very hard to kind of sit out and just ride the
sidelines while I was red‑shirting, just watching people go through like a
different struggle than me as a team collectively. So I think that was very
hard.  
I'm feeling 100 percent now, and I'm just really thankful that I get to play
the game again the way I want to, kind of move around the way I want to, and I
think I'm really looking forward to competing now.  
  
Q. You kind of talked about it a little bit with your injury. How do you
feel you've responded to the adversity, and what has it taught you to have to
watch as opposed to playing the game you love?  
DENNIS CLIFFORD: I think I've learned a great deal. When you have to sit out
and watch the game, it kind of teaches you a lot of lessons, just like seeing
what was going on with our team and stuff like that. I kind of learned how to
slow myself down when I'm on the court personally. I think that was very
important for me to learn, and that was definitely the first, like, major part
of adversity that I've ever faced on the basketball court. I've always been
pretty successful in my individual play and my team.  
I think it taught me to be grateful, definitely, every second that I'm on the
court. So I think that's definitely pushed me harder in the last few months
that I've been healthy.  
  
Q. And then as far as your new head coach, what can you say about Jim
Christian so far and how you've taken his personality?  
DENNIS CLIFFORD: He's definitely been great so far, just like O said, adapting
to all the players, and not only adapting to their personalities but he sets a
standard off the court. And he tells us repeatedly, "If you don't meet this
standard, you're not going to play."  
Sometimes being the new coach, we've been there more than he has, but we've
definitely had some repeated mistakes that we need to fix. There's only one of
him, but there's like 16 of us, but he definitely stresses holding us to that
higher standard. It kind of pushes us to the next level.  
  
Q. Assistant coaches never seem to get any love. Tell us about the
assistants that are in place now, and how are those personalities working.  
DENNIS CLIFFORD: I love all of our assistants. They definitely fall under the
category of energy that Coach Christian brings to practice. They basically
come running into the gym yelling and screaming every single day for practice,
and I think that's very important for the players to see. Some days you go
into practice, maybe you're sore, you're hurting, but when you see a bunch of
old guys running to the gym yelling and screaming, getting excited for
practice, it makes you want to practice even harder.  
  
Q. Dennis, what makes this a successful season?  
DENNIS CLIFFORD: I think a few people have mentioned that we lost nine games
last year by under four points. I think this season it was very important for
us to get some extra stops on defense, and that's definitely what we've been
working on so far. If we're very competitive on the defensive end, I think the
offense will come with us, especially with having Olivier. I think we should
be all set.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Rakeem Christmas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23638)

### [Trevor Cooney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26112)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Trevor, this season a lot more has been asked of you this year. Last year
you had to step up, as well. As you progress throughout your time at Syracuse,
what can you say about how you define yourself and how you look at the
leadership role?  
TREVOR COONEY: I mean, this year I know I'm going to have to step up and the
ball is going to be in my hands a little bit more this year. I knew it was
going to be last year, so I worked on it a lot on the off‑season, and I
expanded my game. I made huge improvements last year, and I look to make those
improvements this year.  
On the leadership role, I took a big step in being a big leader last year on
the team and being another older guy on the team. I look to take the same
approach this year.  
  
Q. A lot of people have the expectation of the three ‑point shot, but people
that know your game know you can do a lot more defensively, as well as attack.
What have you done to work on that in the off‑season and in practice to be
more of that all‑around player?   
TREVOR COONEY: I mean, I like to hang my hat on defense. I know that defense
is going to keep me on the floor and keep me playing and keep me in the games
rhythm‑wise. And if you can play good defense, you're going to be in any game
that you're playing in. That's what Coach Boeheim tells us, and we go out
there and we want to execute the 2‑3 zone well.  
If you're going out there and playing hard, defense is going to win you games.  
  
Q. Trevor, what's going on at the point guard situation? Are you going to
play point? Is somebody stepping up? Right now who would be the starting point
guard?  
TREVOR COONEY: Right now I believe it's Kaleb Joseph and then Mike Gbinije are
our point guards. Kaleb is a new freshman this year, and he's really good.
He's really talented. He's really explosive, he's quick, he gets up and down
the floor. He's really fun to play with. He's just another good point guard
that we have at Syracuse.  
  
Q. Louisville in the ACC this year. You've played against them. What's it
like at the Yum! Center?  
TREVOR COONEY: They're a great addition to a great conference, really. It's
great to play them again. They're very well coached, great players, and we had
a little rivalry with them in the Big East, so we look to continue that in the
ACC.  
  
Q. Trevor, obviously the first three ‑quarters of last season were
phenomenal. The last one‑quarter probably not the way that you would have
liked to have ended the season. Does what happened towards the tail end of
last year have any type of motivating factor for the start of this year?   
TREVOR COONEY: Absolutely. In the season a lot of times teams lose games
within the first 10, first 20, but we were 25‑0 and we didn't get to learn
from our mistakes early, and we had to learn from them late, and that was
tough for us to rebound. You lose a game, next thing you know you're in the
ACC Tournament, you're in the NCAA Tournament, and that was tough for us. And
we didn't get to learn from our mistakes early.  
But losing how we did towards the end of last year, that's definitely a huge
motivation for us in the off‑season, and it's definitely carried into practice
and into the preseason.  
  
Q. Are there things that you really, really like right now, and are there
things you really know you need to tweak?  
TREVOR COONEY: I think defensive‑wise. Our defense has been pretty good, and
it's getting better. The 2‑3 zone is tough to play, and we have some new
members on this team that are understanding it and learning it and getting
better every day with it. It's something that we work on every day, and as
long as we keep doing that, it's going to be good because when our 2‑3 is
good, it wins us a lot of games.  
  
Q. You've played with a lot of different point guards at Syracuse. What can
you say you've taken away from the guys that have been there? And what you've
been able to take away from Kaleb so far?  
TREVOR COONEY: Yeah, I've played with almost a different point guard every
year, which has been good. That's a good thing, I guess. But I mean, all those
guys were great players. They all worked really hard, and you take a little
bit from each one of them. I've kind of done that and I pass it along to Kaleb
and just tell him to stay positive and keep working hard because if you do,
good things can happen on the floor and good things off the floor, as well.  
  
Q. What type of impact do you think Rakeem will have this year?  
TREVOR COONEY: Rakeem will have a huge impact on the floor. I think this year
he's a little bit more vocal and he's a little bit more of a leader, and I
think he's taken that role on really well. We've got a bunch of new guys,
especially in the post, and he's really taking that role on and taking them
under his wing, and I look forward to him having a huge year this year.  
  
Q. I know you guys are primarily focused on yourselves, but you have some
awareness of the other teams in the league, too. Who do you think look like
the teams you'll be competing for a top ‑tier position with?   
TREVOR COONEY: I mean, from top to bottom, this conference is unbelievable. I
mean, at the top you've got Duke, North Carolina, Louisville, NC State, all
these teams are really good. I mean, you have to bring it every single day.
Virginia is really, really good. You've got to bring it every single day to
beat these teams and even compete with these teams. We're looking forward to
getting into conference play later on this season.  
  
Q. Trevor, with a year under your belt now in the ACC and playing some of
the big venues, seeing all the teams, what are the expectations for your
second year?  
TREVOR COONEY: Expectations this year, I mean, I answered that question last
year, and it's just to get better every single day when you come out there and
you practice. And once the games get started, you focus on one game at a time.  
Last year we didn't have any expectations to be 25‑0 or start really hot or
anything like that. You can't have expectations like that. It's just got to be
to go out every single day and get better and work hard, and when you do that,
good things happen, and you do end up 25‑0\. You've just got to stay focused
on the season.  
  
Q. Was it fun playing in those different venues last year?  
TREVOR COONEY: It was. I mean, playing in the Big East my first two years and
then switching to the ACC, the Big East was more kind of NBA arenas. You
played in big cities, so a lot of the schools are a little bit smaller. So you
played in the NBA arenas. And now yet you have bigger schools and you're
playing on campus.  
I think the students play a big factor in ACC games than in Big East games
since the venues are right on campus. It draws more students, which makes it
tougher.  
THE MODERATOR: Let's switch to Rakeem. Thank you.  
  
Q. There's a general dearth of big men in college basketball, but the ACC
has some awfully good ones. Are you looking forward to the match ‑ups with
guys like Harrell and Jahlil Okafor at Duke this year?   
RAKEEM CHRISTMAS: We plan on coming out there and give it our all. I've been
working hard this summer just to try to be more aggressive and putting on some
weight to go up against them and stuff like that.  
  
Q. Rakeem, not having Keita anymore, what have you done to improve your
game? Because obviously you've been able to play off each other in the past?  
RAKEEM CHRISTMAS: In the summertime working on my conditioning, getting ready
to play longer minutes, working hard on defense, trying to stay out of foul
trouble, just working on stuff like that.  
  
Q. As far as offensively, what can you say you've expected from yourself and
kind of worked on in the off ‑season and in practice to know that you want to
be a little bit more consistent on that end, as well?   
RAKEEM CHRISTMAS: Offensively been working hard in the post, making better
decisions, being more aggressive, trying to find open players like Trevor and
Kaleb on the wings for open shots and trying to get into rebound position
after that.  
  
Q. Trevor said some really nice things about you. What do you have to say
nice about him?  
RAKEEM CHRISTMAS: He did. Trevor is doing great in practice. He's been making
a lot of threes. He's been taking care of the ball. He's been making better
plays and running plays along. And just like you said, I've been trying to
make other big men under my wing and he's doing the same for the guards. Kaleb
came in and helping B.J. and Ron step up, too.  
Trevor has been doing a great job, and we're happy to have him.  
  
Q. Your scoring average of 11 or so per game last year, do you have to be at
11 this year? Do you have to be more or can the ball be distributed more
often?  
RAKEEM CHRISTMAS: I think I have to be more this year. I have to step up as a
leader this year, me and Trevor. So this year I'm going to try to give it my
all and go as hard as I can.  
  
Q. As someone who got to experience the Georgetown rivalry quite a bit, can
Duke ‑Syracuse kind of replace that for you all? And can that be the next big
rivalry for college basketball?   
RAKEEM CHRISTMAS: Those two years against Georgetown, those were some big
years for me. That was a big rivalry right there. Playing Duke last year those
two times, those were some tight games, and being able to play in those,
that's history right there. If that starts a rivalry there, that could be
good, but Duke has their rivalry with North Carolina, and we don't want to
mess that up for them.  
  
Q. Do you have to start out again 25 ‑0 to be successful again this year?   
RAKEEM CHRISTMAS: No. Like Trevor said, we didn't have on our mind we wanted
to start out 25‑0\. Sometimes teams need to lose the first few games to know
what we need to work on. When we lost those first games after the 25‑0, it
messed us up a little bit and we had to catch up from that. So we had to learn
from our mistakes and put those games behind us.  
  
Q. Kind of looking at this team and defining it, like you said, last year
you didn't expect to start 25 ‑0\. How do you define the team this year
knowing that the expectations for you may be a little bit different than they
were a few years back?   
RAKEEM CHRISTMAS: We have a great team. Like I said, we have new players,
Kaleb and Chris, got a lot of players stepping up, B.J., Ron. We'll be fine.
We've just got to come out here and play our game and we'll be fine. Listen to
Coach, and we'll be great.  
  
Q. Rakeem, how is Dajuan Coleman looking this year? How much will you two
guys be on the court at the same time, and what can you do as a combo in
there?  
RAKEEM CHRISTMAS: Dajuan has been working hard trying to come back from his
injury. He's still working hard, and we don't know as yet when he'll be back,
but he's working very hard to come back as fast as he can.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Jim Christian](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18217)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Jim, I talked with your players a little bit earlier about how they've
responded to you. How do you feel the team has, from your perspective,
responded to what you're trying to institute in Boston?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Well, you know, I think right from the beginning, I think that
the message that I sent to them, it's an unusual group I inherited because
there's six seniors, and I think right from the beginning the point I made to
them is my job is to have them enjoy and make the most of their senior year,
and I think they were kind of taken aback by that. But I think a lot of times
they expect the coach is going to wait to get his own players and then create
things, and I didn't do that. I went right to getting to know them, getting on
the floor with them and getting them right away to understand what I was
trying to do, and for them to have the best senior year that they could have,
and I think they've really responded to that very, very well.  
  
Q. How would you define the Boston College Eagles right now as far as your
expectations and the environment that you've been trying to create?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Well, you know, for us right now it's establishing the proper
habits and a big understanding, but the expectations for us are the same as
the other 14 teams: We're trying to make the NCAA Tournament. I inherited a
very experienced group of guys, a group of guys that hasn't had success, but I
think there's talent. We've had the emergence of some guys. We've added some
new pieces that I think have changed our culture immediately. Obviously we
added a great player in Olivier Hanlan and he's got the attitude that you'd
want for a great player. But I think a Dennis Clifford, who hasn't played in
two years, to see him play pain‑free basketball and enjoy the game the way he
has has been rewarding. And then the two fifth‑year guys we added, Aaron Brown
and Dimitri Batten, they've changed our culture because they're competitive
guys who have won, and because of that, they've influenced practice and we're
establishing the habits that we want.  
  
Q. Talk about playing in the ACC. You can have a good basketball team and
still finish in the middle of the pack or even lower.  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Yeah, it's a difficult task. Obviously it's an unbelievable
league from top to bottom with power, and you have to stay the course. That's
the first thing I gave this team was these bands that say "Stay Positive"
because it's one of those leagues, and I agree, you could play very, very well
and lose. If your confidence wavers or your belief in what you're doing
wavers, you can't go forward.  
Hopefully our experience, the number of games we've played, even though we
haven't had success, if we can change the mentality, that'll be a strength for
us. But it's definitely a very difficult task because of the unbelievable
challenge night in and night out, different styles of play. Every league has
different styles of play, but in this league the styles of play that you're
playing, they do it better than anybody in the nation, and that's the unique
challenge.  
  
Q. Coach, just a question about Syracuse, your thoughts on them.  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Again, I mean, I'm not as familiar right now with the
individual pieces other than watching them for years and years and
understanding the tremendous amount of success they've had year in and year
out. It seems like the players' names change, but the success level stays the
same, the philosophy stays the same.  
And again, I was speaking a little bit with Coach Boeheim earlier. What he's
done, even if you took half the years, what he's done in college basketball at
one university, playing, coaching, being part of it the whole time, it's an
impossible task that will probably never again be duplicated in this game.
It's a program year in and year out that can and will compete for national
championships.  
  
Q. It's been such a long time since people have seen a healthy Dennis and
what he can do. What can he do now? He says he's feeling 100 percent, so what
do you look for from him?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Well, for me, when I took the job, I heard all these stories
about Dennis Clifford, that he can't do it anymore, his career is over, and
then when I started doing the workouts, I had a friend of mine come in, and I
said, "There's a guy out here who hasn't played for two years. Can you pick
him out?" It took him a couple guesses to get Dennis. That doesn't say much
for the other guys right now.  
But for Dennis he's a guy that can run the floor unbelievably well. He's got
great hands, he has great touch, he has good feel. For a big kid he can pass
the basketball, so you can run offense through him. He's seven feet, 250
pounds for a feet that really struggled in the interior defensively and
rebounding the ball on the interior. He just gives us help.  
And the other part of that that goes with that, you know, is sometimes when
there's changes, guys emerge. They get a different outlook, maybe a clean
slate or maybe a part of their game emerges that didn't emerge in the past,
and I think we have some of that, which is exciting for me.  
  
Q. In the short time Steve Addazio has brought a little bit of swagger back
to B.C. football. In a couple of years as you establish your program, what
might be the word you would use to describe your program?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: "Swagger" is a good word, but I want our basketball team from
the minute we step out there for people to understand how hard we compete and
how much we are passionate about what we're doing and the amount of time we
spend in developing our players. I think over the course of my time, that's
the things that I've taken the most pride in is that people from other
programs that we play, the one thing they say about our team is that from year
in and year out, our players get better. That just is a compliment to our
staff and the amount of time we spend on that.  
  
Q. Do you like the schedule that you've inherited?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: It's a schedule‑‑ again, the non‑conference schedule is one
that I had to inherit the majority of it. It's not easy, but it wouldn't have
been probably the way I would like to set up, but the schedule is the
schedule, and the ACC schedule, there is no easy ones anyway, so whenever you
play them you play.  
I'm more concerned now about the developments of our team, our understanding
and what the foundation of our program is going to be and their understanding
of what the foundation is and not worry about stuff like that.  
  
Q. Is there something you really, really, really like about the program
right now in practice?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: I really believe it's just the coachability of our players. The
energy they bring every day and the attitude with which they show every day
is‑‑ when you inherit a new program, that's always a concern. Am I going to be
able to get through to these guys and get them to buy into what we're trying
to do? And right from day one, which is a credit to them, that they've bought
into everything we've asked them to do on the court, off the court, and
they've responded very, very well.  
  
Q. Will Olivier Hanlan, do you expect he'll continue to score at a similar
pace to what he's done his first couple of years?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Again, I think he'll probably‑‑ he's our primary ball handler
now, and I don't know if he was that. Again, I didn't watch any film of them,
so I'm going by what I've been told. He's a guy that can score the ball, and
he's great in the open floor. We play probably a little bit faster than they
played, so he'll have a lot of opportunities. But he's been a great scorer.
But he's also a guy that can get other people shots. He's also a guy when he
breaks the defense down is getting better and better at reading the situation
and knowing when to get rid of the ball, which is probably‑‑ knowing who to
throw it to is important, knowing when to get rid of it is even more
important, and I think he's developing.  
  
Q. Momentum is a really big deal obviously in sports. You've got great
momentum coming in as a head coach based on your experience at Ohio. What type
of advantage do you have based on the last three seasons or so to get B.C.
rolling?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: I think really we've just taken the approach that we're all in
this together, and they understand that all of us have questions to answer.
Coaches have questions, players have questions, and we just kind of dove into
doing this thing together and understanding step by step what we're trying to
do. I have a very mature group of guys. We probably‑‑ I haven't looked at it,
but chronologically we might have the oldest team in the country. It's been
great because there's a lot of conversation and understanding. They're not
afraid to ask me questions, which is great, and there's been a lot of time
that we've spent developing relationships with those guys, which was priority
No.1, has really paid dividends.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Brad Brownell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21640)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
BRAD BROWNELL: Well, I agree with Rod. I don't think we have a guy on our team
that's going to be first‑team All‑ACC and average 17.7 rebounds and lead the
league in blocks. Hopefully my guys are out recruiting somebody to take his
place.  
But I do think we have guys in the program that are ready to take the next
step. Landry Nnoko could certainly become a double‑figure scorer. I think Rod
is probably going to stay close to what he did last year. He's not a guy
that's as aggressive and sometimes I would like him to be, but he's
unbelievably steady and great teammate and a guy our guys enjoy playing with.
I think some of the scoring is going to fall on other players, whether it's
Jaron Blossomgame, Damarcus Harrison, Jordan Roper, maybe freshman Donte
Grantham. I think those guys all have opportunities to take shots this year,
to run a few more actions for them.  
We're also going to run a little more motion offense than we have the last
couple years. More like my first two years because I think our team personnel
dictates that.  
The last couple of years we've played a little more pro style set offense,
slowed things down a little more with Devin Booker, K.J. McDaniel because they
were better in those systems.  
  
Q. There's a lot of great teams in this league. Only one of them can win the
championship. What do you judge your team on being a successful season?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Well, we don't necessarily just look at wins and losses. I
certainly want to see the development of my team throughout the course of the
season. I want to make sure that we're playing better basketball in February
and March than we do early. We do have goals of trying‑‑ the next step as a
program. We certainly want to be part of the NCAA Tournament, and we know we
have to play well.  
At this early stage of the season, though, I think it's premature to be
talking about long‑term goals like ACC championships, NCAA Tournament berths.
I think you just need to talk about getting better and what you need to do. I
think we're all finding out about our teams, what we do well, what are things
we need to improve on, what guys play well with others, and so for me, it's
let's get better at that. Let's figure out our own team, our own identity,
create an identity for this team this year, and as we do that and move through
some games, we'll have a better opportunity to understand what it is we can
actually accomplish.  
  
Q. Can you tell us a little bit about what you've seen from your two
freshmen so far and what you expect from them this year.  
BRAD BROWNELL: Well, Donte Grantham is a talented guy, 6'8", he's more of a
basketball player than an athlete. I mean, he really can dribble, pass and
shoot. He's a skill guy that can play some different positions. Needs to add
strength and certainly needs to learn our system, but really pleased with his
approach. I think the year in prep school really helped him, and I think it's
going to help him have an opportunity to play a great deal as a freshman.  
Gabe DeVoe is a guy with good physical strong body and an attack mentality to
score. He's probably close to 6'3" and 195 pounds, and he likes to shoot. He
likes to drive. He likes to attack. Those are all good things.  
He's got to learn the subtleties of the game on offense. He's got to learn our
system. But his biggest step is defense. I don't put many guys out there that
don't defend, and he's a guy that's a little bit behind from that standpoint,
but he's making progress. He's a bright young guy. He's just got to learn to
compete as hard as he needs to on every possession. He can't take possessions
off.  
I think one of the biggest things you deal with with young players is they
know how to play with the ball because in high school they dominate the ball,
but you come to the next level and you rarely have the ball. On defense you
never have it, and we play a team defense, and you've got to learn how to
rotate and do things for other people. And then on offense we're running a
system where the ball moves through other people's hands and he has to learn
how to get himself involved when the ball is not just in his hands.  
  
Q. Right before Leonard Hamilton talked about the FSU football program and
the other fall sports; the better they do, the more it helps to recruit other
people coming in. As far as everything that Clemson does on the football
field, does it help that coaches ‑helping‑coaches climate at Clemson, as
well?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Well, it certainly does. We talk a lot about the Clemson
family. We're very supportive of each other. Coach Swinney, Coach Leggett, all
the coaches, I think we have great relationships on camps. We really share
ideas. We appreciate each other's successes. We try to help each other when
somebody is struggling, and I think that's true of the athletes. It's one of
the unique things about Clemson where we make Clemson people feel special. If
you're part of the Clemson family you're made to feel special, whether you're
a regular student, a student‑athlete, a faculty member. It's part of what we
talk about.  
When there is success in our sports in the fall, our soccer teams are both
doing well, our football team is off to a great start, it creates a buzz on
campus, and so when you bring recruits on campus, there's a positive vibe
there. And certainly when we bring basketball recruits to Death Valley to
watch a football game, there's no better tradition in college basketball than
watching guys run down the hill and seeing the excitement and enthusiasm and
the spirit that our school has. Our school spirit is, in my eyes, second to
none, and certainly we sell that in recruiting.  
  
Q. Your trademark is your teams play great defense. How hard is it to bring
in a high school kid that's always been taught his offense first, defense
second, to buy into your defensive scheme?  
BRAD BROWNELL: It just depends on the young man and how much he knows coming
in and how committed he is to what we're trying to teach him, how coachable
they are. There's varying degrees of that. I think we're probably a little
more complicated defensively than most. I don't know that we're extremely
complicated, but we guard some things differently. We make you think. We
certainly guard as a team, and it's a priority from day one. You earn your
spurs that way through me.  
I think teaching defense builds toughness. I think it also builds team. And if
you can be a tough‑minded team, if you can be a true team into January and
February, your chance of success is much greater than others.  
To me, that's where I've always started as a coach is on that end of the floor
because I want to build toughness and I want to build team. Whether a young
man is ready for that right away or not kind of depends on the young man.  
  
Q. Brad, if you can keep your defense where it is and that kind of intensity
and statistical excellence, how much better do you think you need to be
offensively to take that next step?  
BRAD BROWNELL: We have to shoot the ball better from three. We were a poor
three‑point shooting team. Actually I was really disappointed that we didn't
improve more in that area. We actually worked on it some. We don't have a lot,
a lot of lights‑out shooters. We have some guys that can make threes, but we
didn't shoot the ball with three‑point consistency that you need to be
successful, to be good. If we could have been a good three‑point shooting team
last year, we would have been one of the best teams in this league. We led the
league in free‑throw shooting. We got to the line. We didn't foul a lot. We
rebounded reasonably well, and we guarded.  
The next step for us is to become a better three‑point shooting team. I'd love
to tell you that I just had a sniper out there that just makes threes because
I think that's really what we need to be focusing on a little bit in
recruiting. We need to recruit a guy that can just really shoot the ball. I
think we have guys that can make shots, but I'm from Indiana, so my idea of a
shooter and a lot of people's idea of a shooter is very different. I don't see
very many guys that shoot like I want them to, and obviously that's a
challenge in recruiting.  
  
Q. You had a very unique tournament in the Paradise Jam early on in the
season. Obviously you hoped to come home with a trophy, but is there a bonding
element that you hoped to also accomplish during the course of that trip?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Yeah, every time you go on a trip like that, you're trying to
put your guys in a position where they can learn some things about a culture.
You hope to show them some things that helps them appreciate the life they
have a little bit more, and at the same time it puts you in a situation where
you're going to deal with some adversity in terms of officiating, you're going
to deal with crazy game times, no locker rooms. I mean, the game might be half
outdoors, half indoors, whatever it is. But at the same time the lesson is
that you've just got to play and you control your own destiny, and certainly
it's a beautiful place to go for vacation. I don't know that any of us really
want to go there and play basketball games that count, but that's part of the
deal.  
So we've got to find a way to be motivated and focused enough to play well on
a trip like that, while also having a little bit of fun.  
  
Q. Being a defensive coach, how satisfying was it to you last year to have
one of your players be selected to Conference Defensive Player of the Year?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Well, it's very rewarding, and certainly we had a little bit to
do with K.J. being in the right spot to do some of the things he did. But I
didn't have a lot to do with him blocking all those shots. That was his mother
and father, the heredity, the genes that came from that really got him to
allow him the ability to block all those shots. We hopefully got him in some
better positions.  
But what K.J. did, there's a lot of things K.J. did that you don't coach: The
alley‑oop drunks, the blocked shots, the tipped dunks, that's just a guy that
has special talents and special instincts. I think one of the things I'm proud
of is one of the main reasons K.J. McDaniel drafted into the NBA was because
of his defense and his mentality, and that was because of his decision to come
to Clemson.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Mike, obviously having some experience in this ACC, what can you say
about how your team has responded and how they look going into the season?  
MIKE BREY: Well, we certainly got baptized by fire last year, and it was a
rude awakening being a newcomer in this league. But I think we have a little
better feel for the league now. You know, when you're in the Big East all
those years, you have your breakdown drills before you play Georgetown and
before you play Connecticut, and we really didn't have that.  
But what really helps us is we have this guy named Jerian Grant back with us,
and he's really a key guy for us. And with him and Connaughton as seniors, I
think those are two of the 10 or 12 best returning players in the league.
Pretty good place to start.  
I feel we have a better feel for the league. I certainly have some real good
senior leadership and talent in those two guys, and we feel we can play our
way back into the mix of things in this league.  
  
Q. As we move into this new era of autonomy and trying to do more for the
student ‑athletes, if you were still at Delaware, how worried would you be
about this new system and trying to compete?   
MIKE BREY: Yeah, great point. You know, I think if I was still sitting in
Newark, Delaware, we'd be worrying about a huge separation in things. But the
thing that I think would always give you peace of mind is access to the NCAA
Tournament is not going to change. Still, if we won our league, the old
America East, we could get in and become part of the NCAA Tournament.  
When I put myself back in that spot, you were able sometimes to steal a kid
that maybe should be playing at the ACC level. Maybe you wouldn't be able to
do that as much anymore with the resources that the Power Five are going to
have. And you know what, you deal with it accordingly. I'd still take a lot of
transfers from that level, when they didn't play at the highest level. But for
those people, they have access to the Tournament, and they still can get in
and be part of it. I think that's what you've got to hang your hat on.  
  
Q. Coming from someone that just made the move to the ACC, how hard is it to
do it as a team and what can the Cardinals expect?  
MIKE BREY: Well, it's interesting with Louisville because of style of play.
You know, they're a little bit different with that pressure, and maybe the
impetus will be more on the people in the league dealing with them. But I
mean, there's going to be‑‑ I think there's a thing of familiarity that you've
got‑‑ there's an arc of that that you've got to go through. They certainly
have a heck of a talented team to enter the league with, and if they stay
healthy, they're going to be one of the better teams in the league.  
But their style of play is different than anybody else in the league, and it's
unique, so they're probably going to be able to take advantage of that.  
  
Q. You mentioned the fact that obviously you have Grant back this season.
What did he learn from having basketball taken away from him that you can see
out of him now?  
MIKE BREY: I think he's come back more like a young man. I told him on the way
down here, I feel like I'm talking to a young man now and not a boy anymore.
He's come back as a leader and a captain.  
We had a foreign tour this summer that couldn't come at a more strategic team
for our program. With him back, with the year we had, some young guys that
have to grow up, but he's come back very focused. I think he feels he owes it
to his teammates and some people to really get us back in position. And even
though we're a Catholic school, I don't want him to feel like he's at
confession every day. I'm trying to take the heat off of him.  
He's one of the better guards in the country, and we had a lot of close games
last year. Grant was a close‑game closer for us throughout his career, and I
sure hope we're in those positions more with him this year.  
  
Q. Given your play internationally over the summer, what is very important
for you right now pre ‑season in practice?  
MIKE BREY: Well, we had to be better defensively. We were horrible. We were
really disappointed, and starting in the spring‑‑ it was funny, in our spring
workouts after the season, I didn't have Connaughton because he was pitching
with our baseball team, and I didn't have Grant. So we had six guys in our
workouts, and it was a lot of three‑on‑three different defensive things. It
was great to have Connaughton and Grant back in June and through summer, and
we just have to be better there.  
I think we can be better there because our ball pressure will be better with
Demetrius Jackson, the sophomore guard, who now takes over as quarterback.
Kind of had an up‑and‑down freshman year. But the best thing for Demetrius
Jackson is Eric Atkins is playing in Athens, Greece, now, and he gets the ball
and quarterbacks the team. And he's playing with some veteran guys, playing
with Connaughton and Grant. So he's really a talented young man, so I think
that helps us. That's been our focus defensively.  
We shoot it well. We're back kind of playing how we've played when we've had
success. We can spread the floor. I worry about us defensive rebounding long
term, but I do think we can score it and spread people out. And that's been a
style of play that's been helpful for us out there.  
  
Q. You've got quarterback, pitcher and forward all in the same answer ‑‑  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, I got it all in.  
  
Q. I know you've had some good battles with Syracuse over the years in the
Big East and once again in the ACC. They lost a couple key guys from last
year, but what do you think of the Orange going into this year?  
MIKE BREY: They're still going to be right there. I've been in this cycle with
them in the Big East where they've lost guys and everybody said, oh, man, what
are they going to be, who are they going to be. At the end of the day, their
culture is so well established. It's a confident culture. They win. It's a
tricky place to play.  
One of the things I've learned about being in the ACC is it's much tougher to
win on the road than it was in the Big East, so holding serve at home becomes
so important. The road in the Big East, you were playing Villanova down where
the Sixers play. You were playing Seton Hall in the Rock, Georgetown ‑‑ when
we played DePaul, our people bought all the tickets. That's not the case in
this league.  
Because they really are tough to deal with in the Carrier Dome, that's always
a great place to start.  
  
Q. What did you take away from your experience flying with the Blue
Angels?  
MIKE BREY: Well, I didn't pass out or throw up. One of my former walk‑ons is a
Blue Angel pilot. He's been working for me about a year. He said, "Coach, we
give these guest rides. You've got to come down to Pensacola." He got me at a
weak moment. The week before I was definitely trying to get out of it. I
thought maybe the Ebola scare would be a reason. I was looking for anything.  
We were up for 45 minutes. We pulled 7G's one time. I got close to passing
out. We went the speed of sound. We were flying upside down. There's a great
video on it, and I got through it, but it was an amazing experience.  
I used to get a little nervous with turbulence on a commercial jet. That's
nothing now. I'll sleep right through it after that.  
  
Q. Do you have to make the Tournament in order for you to call it a
successful season?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, you know, us getting back to the NCAA Tournament, we had been
to four in a row and six out of seven before last season, and we had been to
14 straight postseason appearances, which was a record, NIT or NCAA, and we
did neither.  
Getting back and being part of the NCAA Tournament is‑‑ you know, one of the
things I said on our media day, I'm proud that that's been kind of the bar
we've set. We've been disappointed when we don't make the Tournament. When I
got there, we hadn't been in the Tournament in 10 years. So we've created
that, and I think certainly for Grant and Connaughton, they want to finish
their career playing in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Having been an assistant at Duke, how big was it last year one of your
first big ACC wins was against Duke?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, that's all we show in our highlight tape from last year. We
just show clips from that game. It was a heck of a way to get your first ACC
win, the first ACC game in the history of our program, and certainly beating
them‑‑ great win for us. I compared it‑‑ when I got to the Big East and we
were trying to find an identity, when we would beat Syracuse or Connecticut or
Georgetown, those were program wins that kind of gave your program
credibility. You get into this league and certainly when you can beat a Duke
or a North Carolina, I think it gives you great credibility. I've got two guys
sitting here that certainly can relate to that; Coach Cremins and Coach Odom
remember that well.  
But it was great. I just wish we could have maintained the momentum a little
better off of that.  
  
Q. Obviously I know this is outside of your program and I'm sure in your
mind fortunately not something you have to deal with, but given what Carolina
is going through right now, how good is that for Williams? And as a coach how
would you approach a situation like that?  
MIKE BREY: Well, my situation, I wouldn't comment directly on the North
Carolina situation, but I dealt with an academic situation losing Jerian Grant
last year, and it was a pretty powerful loss to our team and at a key time. So
it does become a distraction.  
I think as coaches, you're always trying to eliminate distractions for you,
and then certainly then for your players. I think for Coach Williams, that's
probably going to be the biggest challenge. As a matter of fact, at lunch he
even kind of alluded to that, focus on the season, because they've got a heck
of a basketball team.  
I dealt with it last year, and then throughout it, you're working to get
Jerian Grant back. You're trying to keep that line of communication open when
he's away, yet I'm coaching the team I have. All dynamics that guys that are
in coaching, you've got a lot of balls in the air at times.  
  
Q. I asked this of Commissioner John Swofford: College sports in general is
in a state of flux right now. What do you think about paying athletes or cost
‑of‑living stipends? What's your thought on that?   
MIKE BREY: I think it's in a state of good flux in that the autonomy that's
coming with the five power conferences and certainly our league being in it,
being able to do some things for our student‑athletes that should be done. I'm
not a pay‑for‑play guy, but cost of attendance certainly should be
entertained. Being able to take care of them more, flying their parents to
postseason.  
We did a foreign tour this summer, and I asked my compliance officer
yesterday, I said, with this new autonomy, I could go on a foreign tour every
summer, right? He said, probably will. That's an unbelievable experience for
our guys.  
I think we're going to be in a position, if you're in one of the Power Five,
to do some things with your student‑athletes that they deserve. The thing that
we talked about at lunch just 20 minutes ago was we need to do a better job in
basketball getting together the five power conferences, game rules, points of
emphasis, officiating, how we take care of our guys, travel. I think we've got
to get more organized because we've been given the green light for this
autonomy. You saw the rule change where we could feed them differently. We
need to be suggesting some things and be on the front edges.  
I think it's a good time. I just think as the basketball industry‑‑ we've got
to get as organized as the football industry. Those football guys are really
good, man. We've got to get as organized as far as what we need, dictating
different things. But I think it's a good position with the state of thing,
the change.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Montay Brandon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27793)

### [Aaron Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26661)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Having three seven ‑footers on the team, not a lot of teams can say that
in college basketball. What can you say about your teammates there down low?
  
AARON THOMAS: I think it's going to help us a lot. We've got Kiel Turpin, Ojo,
Bo. Those guys have got a lot better, so we've got high expectations for them.  
  
Q. What are you working on in practice right now?  
AARON THOMAS: Just working on just being connected, all getting on the same
page. We're doing a lot of pick‑and‑roll things, getting our big men involved
more. Coach stressed that a lot, getting our big men the ball more, so we've
been working on that.  
  
Q. As far as defining Florida State basketball, obviously football is well
known around the country. What can you say about the strides that you've been
taking and the team has been taking to be relevant, as well?  
AARON THOMAS: We've just been focused. We came up short last year, so I think
this year we're just focused on the NCAA Tournament and just focused on that.  
  
Q. The three freshmen, how well are they blending into practice and this
team?  
AARON THOMAS: Oh, they're looking real good. Those guys are willing to learn.
They're asking questions. They're actually learning quicker than what Coach
Hamilton thought. They're working really hard, so those guys can bring a lot
to the table.  
  
Q. When you look at the roster and you look at what the possibilities are
this year, when you get to the end of the season and look back, how will you
know if you were successful?  
AARON THOMAS: Just have we done everything we said we was going to do going
into the season? Like I said, just all on one page.  
  
Q. What is it about your game that needs to get everybody on the same
page?  
AARON THOMAS: Just being that leader, not just focused on me, worried about
everyone on the team. Like I said, just being on one page. Just being a
leader.  
  
Q. Aaron, there's some guys who are not around this year: Ian Miller and
some other guys who provided a lot of scoring support and things like that. Do
you feel like you'll have to step up your scoring even more this year, or how
do you see your role?  
AARON THOMAS: I'm not even focused on what I have to do. I'm just focused on
us as a team and what we have to do.  
  
Q. Tell us about Montay's preseason right now.  
AARON THOMAS: Montay has been doing a real good job. He's gotten a lot better.
He's been focusing on things he needs to work on. He's becoming a better
leader. My expectations for him are high.  
THE MODERATOR: Montay, tell us about Aaron.  
MONTAY BRANDON: Aaron had a great preseason. He's always been extremely
focused. So this summer he had no different perspective on what he had to do
this summer. He worked hard, becoming more of a vocal leader and also helping
the younger guys come along, too.  
  
Q. What is your role this year on the team?  
MONTAY BRANDON: Just do a little bit of everything, be the tool guy, a couple
points, rebounds, steals, try to guard the best player on each and every team,
do a little bit of everything to help the team out.  
  
Q. Montay, how do you view the team this year? How would you define Florida
State basketball?  
MONTAY BRANDON: As mature. We've all grown up now. We've been here for three
years. We have five juniors that have had a significant amount of playing
time, and we have Kiel Turpin back. Plus we've integrated three new guys that
are going to be very talented. So we feel we're going to be very good this
year.  
  
Q. Leonard Hamilton's teams always seem to have high energy, always big on
defense, and you guys seem to have fun. Talk about what it's like playing for
him.  
MONTAY BRANDON: Playing with Coach Hamilton is awesome. I know he doesn't
smile too much to the media and on game days, but off the court he's always
cracking jokes, making everybody feel comfortable. So we play as hard as we
can for him, because we know he truly cares about all of us.  
  
Q. A lot of people say that student ‑athletes will sometimes take on the
personality of their coaches. Coach Hamilton has a lot of fire in his belly.
Does that translate to you guys?   
MONTAY BRANDON: Oh, definitely. On the court we know that once we step out
there it's war. With the pregame talks he gives us, we're all out there ready
to prepare for battle.  
  
Q. Montay, you're listed as 6'8 ". A 6'8" guard, there are not a whole lot
of those around. How do you feel that helps you playing outside like that?   
MONTAY BRANDON: It helps me when it comes to finishing. As you know, Florida
State is a defensive school so you can guard the 1 or 2, and get rebounds for
us, extend possessions for us, and just anything possible at that height, at
my position, helps us in a great way.  
  
Q. Florida State performed pretty well last year against the newcomers in
the league, and now Louisville comes in for the '14 ‑'15 season. Do you think
Florida State's success against the newbies will hold up?   
MONTAY BRANDON: I definitely feel that way. We know Louisville is a tough
team, with a good pedigree in Coach Pitino. If we bring our "A" game, we can
compete with anybody in this league. So we definitely feel like we're ready
for the challenge.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Talk about Trevor Cooney and Rakeem; what can you say about their
demeanor and their poise going into the season?  
JIM BOEHEIM: You know, both guys have had tremendous starts to their careers.
They really have. Trevor is in his fourth year. He's only a junior
eligibility‑wise, but he's been with us four years, and of course Rak has been
with us four years. They've brought a lot to the program, but I believe that
they've got a lot more in them.  
I just think they'll have tremendous years this year. They've been great in
practice. Their leadership has been great, along with Mike Gbinije, another
four‑year player, we've got three guys that have been in college basketball
for four years, and that's probably better than a lot of teams in terms of
experience, and obviously we need our young guys to play well, but that's
pretty much true of every program in the country.  
  
Q. You've got a year under your belt now in the ACC. What was the biggest
thing you learned playing in this conference?  
JIM BOEHEIM: I just thought it was a great experience. I really thought, you
come from a great conference and you're in a great conference. A lot of times
you'll see a different level, something like that. It wasn't like that at all.
It was a great conference. We had great games in the conference from top to
bottom. There really were no easy games in the league last year. I mean, we
had a great start, but we're really winning games by the thinnest of margins
against everybody, not the good teams‑‑ not just the good teams, but
everybody. It was a constant battle.  
I think we expected that going in. It wasn't anything that was unexpected, but
it was just a great year in terms of competition within this league and pretty
much what you would expect coming in.  
  
Q. You lost a lot of key players from last year. What will be this team's
identity, and then if you had to name one player that would be an X factor,
who would that player be?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Well, that's a great‑‑ you made a great point. We've lost more
than we've ever lost in terms of our offensive production. I didn't know that
until I read that someplace the other day. But obviously our two freshmen have
to step up. Last year we had a freshman point guard at this time of the year,
we were asking him to step up, and it's the same thing this year. We have a
freshman point guard that needs to step up. Certainly as I mentioned, our
veteran players are going to have to be there, but it's not any one guy. It's
really the group of young players that we have. They really all have to step
up a little bit.  
  
Q. Kaleb Joseph will be your starting point guard at this point; is that
pretty much the case?  
JIM BOEHEIM: We haven't said that yet, but yeah, I think that's a pretty
good‑‑ he's the only point guard we have. I guess he'd better start.  
  
Q. With the way Tyler developed last year and became one of the great clutch
players in the ACC, I know it's real early and maybe you don't have the answer
to this yet, but does Kaleb have any similarities to that?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Well, if you watch practice this year and you watch what Kaleb
has done and you watch practice last year and you watch Tyler, you would
think, man, these guys are both good players. They both play‑‑ they're both
good. You wouldn't necessarily think, well, there's a big difference. They
play a little differently, but they both have a big impact on practice. They
make good plays, good decisions.  
I think the difference, and this is something you never know, when the games
started, Tyler rose‑‑ took his game up to another level. He played even
better. Usually that's unusual for a freshman to actually play a lot better in
games, in big games, than he would in practice. But that's what he was able to
do, and I think Kaleb certainly has the tools and the ability to do that.  
It's just, let's see how it all goes, see how the games come.  
Tyler Ennis, he led the league, a very good conference, in assists and steals
and assist‑to‑turnover ratio. He just had an unbelievable freshman year. I
think Kaleb Joseph is certainly capable of doing things like that, and we
would certainly like to see that.  
  
Q. With the hearing coming up tomorrow, is there a hope that it's finally
all going to be over? Is there a sense of nervousness or concern?  
JIM BOEHEIM: As you well know, I'm not going to talk about that.  
  
Q. Mike Krzyzewski was talking about his relationship with you through USA
Basketball a little while ago, and I was just wondering, I know on the court
you guys are trying to beat each other's brains in, but between you and Mike
and Roy and now with Rick coming into the league, guys who have been around a
while, do you have any kind of bond off the court that kind of precludes the
whole competition on it?  
JIM BOEHEIM: You know, everything off the court‑‑ I've been playing golf with
Roy Williams for over 30 years. We started playing golf together at least
30‑plus years ago, and I hired Rick Pitino 38 years ago, 39, and I've known
and been good friends with Mike for 30‑some years.  
When we play, I'm trying to beat Duke. I don't think about Mike. I really
don't. I'm worried about the guys they've got on the court and how they're
doing. It's not head to head in the sense that everybody else thinks it is. It
really isn't. It's not ever about that.  
I'm trying to coach against Duke's players. Mike is making no shots. He's
making no passes. We're trying to beat Duke in every way we can, and he's
trying to beat Syracuse in every way he can. That's what we are. That's what
we're about. There's no coaches in this business that aren't competitive.
There might be some of us that take it to another level, because I never let
my daughter beat me in Candyland, and I never would, and she knows that.  
  
Q. Coach Williams on the golf course, who wins on the golf course?  
JIM BOEHEIM: We don't even disclose our golf games anymore. At one time we
actually could play. Now we're not good enough to even worry about it.  
  
Q. When you look at the committee of B.J. Johnson and Tyler Roberson and
Chris McCullough coming in new, what can you say about them in practice and
how they're gelling together?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Well, you know, everybody looks good in practice. I think
sometimes we get fooled a little bit, and we forget they're playing against
each other. They're doing what they can do. They're working hard. I'm happy
with what they've done.  
But you know, you really don't know about your players individually or you
really don't know about them as a team until they come together, until they
get in competition. I'm excited, Sunday we're playing a team that should have
beat us last year. We had a pretty good team last year, and they should have
beat us. They were 10 points with four minutes, three minutes to go in the
game, and they're better this year. We're playing an exhibition game against a
team that's better than us, I think. Hopefully that'll be a good kind of a
benchmark for what we need to do, and it's always good for players to see
that, because players think they're good.  
Sometimes that's why losses really help you more than wins. When players win
games, they think they're good. Even if they didn't play well, even if it was
a bad team. When they lose, they look in the mirror and they start to realize
they've got to do something to get better.  
But I'm happy with what our freshmen and sophomores‑‑ they've worked hard,
they've put the work in, they really have given every effort. There's been
nothing that I would ask them to do that they haven't done.  
  
Q. As a coach, do you feel it's hard to build a program with players one
‑and‑done and then moving on to the pros?  
JIM BOEHEIM: That's just the landscape now in college basketball. Guys are
going to leave. You have to try to prepare for that. We've been pretty
successful in doing that. When Carmelo left, we had Hakim and Gerry. We had
replacements. When Wes Johnson left, we had replacements. This year Tyler is
leaving. We do have a point guard that we think is good. You'd obviously
always like for those guys to stay a little bit longer, but that's the nature
of college basketball. You have to be prepared for it.  
I remember one year we brought in a couple freshmen because we thought we
really needed them, and then two guys stayed that we thought would leave, so
we had an extra guy or two that year. It's hard to balance it.  
  
Q. Over the years you've wanted Rakeem to be more aggressive, more
assertive. Do you feel like this is the year that he finally does that for
you? And how much more important will it be this year given the fact that you
have a lot of young guys?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Well, Rakeem, you know, has been in a position where even last
year, C.J. Fair was our first option on offense, and Trevor was always a big
guy that we wanted to get going, and then Tyler started to be more offensive
minded as the year went along, and Jeremy was‑‑ so Rakeem was really down the
list in terms of options.  
I don't think we've really been able to get a good indication of just how good
he is offensively because we have not really got him the ball as we got those
other guys the ball. And that's not unusual for a big guy. Arinze didn't get
the ball very much until his last year. I think Rak will have a good year this
year offensively because he'll get the ball, and I think he's more ready for
that role, and I think he will be aggressive.  
I think last year at the end of the year when Baye didn't play, he learned how
to play 30 minutes, 35 minutes a game. So I think he understands what he has
to do to be in the game for 30‑35 minutes. I think he's better offensively and
I think he'll get the ball in more situations this year. He had more shots in
a scrimmage the other day than he's had since he's been here in a scrimmage.
So I think he's prepared for that.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Wayne Blackshear](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25250)

### [Montrezl Harrell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25090)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Wayne, what have you done from last season to this season in your
workouts to get better? What are some of those areas you wanted to improve on,
and what have you done to improve?  
WAYNE BLACKSHEAR: You know, basically trying to get my body back in shape,
slim down a little bit, but the main thing I really focused on was my ball
handling; trying to create a lot more for my teammates and get involved on the
floor a lot more.  
  
Q. As far as this being the first time in the ACC for Louisville, what can
you say about some of your opponents, some of them that you know very well?  
WAYNE BLACKSHEAR: Yeah, you know, obviously from the Big East we played
Syracuse and Notre Dame and Pitt, so we're kind of familiar with those guys.
Well, some of us, me and Montrezl‑‑ and going into the ACC, we know it's going
to be tough every game. We know what's ahead of us, and we know what we have
to do.  
  
Q. What excites you most about getting to play in a new conference like the
ACC?  
WAYNE BLACKSHEAR: You know, everything. You've got a lot of teams,
Hall‑of‑Fame coaches, top prospects that go to the NBA. You can only be
excited to play against those guys and just compete. I mean, it'll bring the
best out of you and your game.  
  
Q. You guys have been great. Do you feel like this team can maintain what
Louisville has been about the last few years?  
WAYNE BLACKSHEAR: I don't think we're going to take a drop. I think we can be
a great team. I know we have a new team with six freshmen that's coming in,
and we've got some veteran guys that have been through all the wars almost. I
think if we just keep teaching our freshmen and listening to Coach, I think
we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Coach talked about the type of schedule. Your first loss last year was
against North Carolina. Now that you're in that league, does that sort of
resonate with you? Is there any carry ‑over from the first part of last year
as you think about getting into the ACC schedule?   
WAYNE BLACKSHEAR: Definitely we got our first taste against those guys, and we
really do want to play them again, but we know they're not the only team in
that conference that you have to worry about. We really know what's ahead of
us this year, and we have to stay focused and really know what games we're
going into and just stick to scouting reports and everything.  
  
Q. How does being in a conference with so much talent and where games are so
tough, how does that help you get set for the NCAA Tournament and tournaments
down the stretch of the season?  
WAYNE BLACKSHEAR: You know, just going in night in and night out, competing
with other teams and games coming down to the wire, you know, it really shows
how tough your team is. That's how the Tournament is going to be, except if
you lose, you're out.  
I think these games can prepare us in a lot of different ways and just get us
better.  
  
Q. What do you need to do to get better personally?  
WAYNE BLACKSHEAR: You know, obviously Coach made me the captain. I think I
need to be more vocal and just be out there and just be more active on the
court to try to help my team out.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Montrezl?  
  
Q. Montrezl, this is a little bit of a different animal for you to be
joining the ACC. What does it mean to be playing the big teams from your home
state?  
MONTREZL HARRELL: I can honestly say it's going to be very special this year
being in the ACC, but we've really been in three different conferences in the
past three years. Making this conference jump is really nothing new to us, but
we know that coming into the ACC, that we've got to be ready to play. We've
got to be ready on any given night because we know this conference is a real
powerhouse conference, and on any given night you can get beat.  
  
Q. You've played in tons of big places and huge stadiums and storied places
already. Is there anything uniquely special to you about looking forward to
getting a chance to play against the Carolinas and the Dukes and the ACC
Tournament and thing like this?  
MONTREZL HARRELL: Honestly, I'm looking forward to our whole schedule. Our
first game we actually start off playing in Puerto Rico against Minnesota. So
I honestly can say from our opening start, our schedule is going to be
exciting.  
We've got to be ready to play from our opening tip. This is not the conference
we was in last year where we had 30‑to‑40‑point blowout wins. We know it's not
going to be like that in this conference.  
  
Q. Montrezl, sitting here as opposed to getting ready for an NBA game,
looking back on your decision to stay, what can you say about being a Cardinal
again?  
MONTREZL HARRELL: I honestly feel I made a great decision. I was kind of back
and forth with what decision I was going to make, and I can honestly say about
me coming back to school, getting another year of experience under my belt,
playing under Coach P again, I can honestly say it's going to help me out a
lot in the long run. I feel like it's going to prepare me for what's at stake
going into the NBA.  
  
Q. One of your teammates said the ACC looks a little bit like the Big East
to you because of the opponents you faced there, what can you say about the
ACC and the challenge you'll have of being in another conference now?  
MONTREZL HARRELL: I can honestly say I agree with him to the full extent. It
feels like a remake of the Big East with all the powerhouse teams in this
conference. You really can't look so much past so many‑‑ you really can't look
past any teams in this conference, like I said, because there's a lot of great
teams in this conference, and we know we're going to have a lot of tough
games. We know that we have a lot of young pieces on our team, and we've
really got to get prepared and really be ready to play.  
  
Q. You mentioned that you made the right decision staying another year. How
do you think your game will evolve during this year in hopes of making the
jump to the NBA next year?  
MONTREZL HARRELL: I think my game is going to evolve a lot. I've added a lot
of different things to my game that I didn't have, first coming into college.
I feel like I've really taken this summer to really get better with my ball
handling and being able to shoot the ball more consistently. I can honestly
say there's a lot of different small things that I've added to my game that's
going to make me a better player but also make our team better.  
  
Q. How does a young man who probably spent your childhood watching ACC
basketball on TV wind up at Louisville?  
MONTREZL HARRELL: My transition into Louisville was kind of crazy. Coming out
of high school I really wasn't heavily recruited like that by any big teams,
either in North Carolina or outside of it honestly. And when I made my choice
my senior year to go to Hargrave Military Academy, I was already committed to
go to Virginia Tech at that point in time. And when Coach Greenberg ended up
getting fired and they didn't really give a reason as so why he was fired, I
felt like if I'm going to go to a school where it's a brand new coach, why not
start fresh?  
So I ended up getting my letter of intent back and reopened my recruiting, and
that's when I started getting recruited heavily by a lot of North Carolina
teams. But I just looked at the roster and just looked at all the teams and
the key pieces that they had, and I really felt that Louisville was a better
choice for me. I went up there and took a visit, and I kind of felt the same
way I did when I went to Virginia Tech. I kind of felt like it was a home away
from home.  
  
Q. With that said, having been not looked at by a lot of these schools, does
that mean you're extra motivated to play these schools this year?  
MONTREZL HARRELL: I mean, you can say that, but I mean, I'm motivated every
game to play because I go out on the court and give it my all every
possession, every game. I don't take off any game because of the team that
we're playing. You can't play down to the level of your competition, no matter
who it is. I'm looking to play every team and just get out there, honestly.  
  
Q. What do you really like about this team this year?  
MONTREZL HARRELL: You know, I really feel that this team has a chance to be
special. Even though we have a lot of younger guys on our team. I feel like
that they're willing to work. They're willing to get better. We still have a
lot of core key group of guys who have been to the Final Fours, to the
National Championships, and I feel like if these guys really buy into the
Louisville way that Coach P wants us to do, then we really have a chance to be
special this year.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. When you look at this team, I talked with Malcolm a little bit about the
resolve of the team and response to resiliency, you lost a couple guys, but it
seems like you still have that veteran leadership that knows how to win maybe
when people have counted you out and just go into that atmosphere that you've
created.  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I think that's our formula for success at a place like
Virginia to get a group of guys, to grow them up, turn them into upperclassmen
and rely on that experience because there's no substitute for the games under
their belt, the tournament play, the experience that they have, and then you
rely on that. We're not like a lot of other programs where we have a lot of
one‑and‑done guys, but you rely on guys who understand your system, who are
battle‑tested, and I think that's going to be a key for us this year heading
into it.  
There's a couple of those guys. We don't have a close for Joe Harris or a
clone for Akil Mitchell, so we'll be different in some ways, but there will be
some constants that will remain, and I think that will give us a chance to be
as successful as we can.  
  
Q. Your team was one of the surprise teams last year, and now putting the
nation on notice, how do you feel your team will handle the level of success
coming into this season?  
TONY BENNETT: You know, it remains to be seen. I think all you can do is
really embrace and accept the challenge of the moment, and then you'll deal
appropriately with the aftermath. That's really all you can do. Expectations‑‑
I think we make a mistake if we try to compare ourselves to last year and say,
last year at this time we were at this point. Forget all that. I told our
guys, come together. I said, as good as you can be this year, they'll never
take away what happened last year. And perhaps that might be better than last
year and you might go further. Perhaps you won't be as good and you won't go
as far. It doesn't matter. You get as good as you can be. Challenge each
other.  
We know how we have to play. We know we're not a knockout‑punch team. We don't
have these huge runs. We're as consistent and physical and sound on both ends
of the floor, and when you do that you have a chance. That's what I want them
focusing on. I've quoted Oregon football, if you've ever heard that "win the
day", that's their theme, and that really is. Good programs, great coaches
back here, they'll tell you, you just get in line with the process. You stay
true to that. You fall in love with it, and all the end results take care of
themselves. You don't worry too much about it. Have aspirations, have goals,
you have to. But that's the separator. The other stuff, that can be a
distraction if you get too caught up with compare yourself or what you're
there to.  
We've got challenges in front of us and wonderful opportunities, but
experience will be key.  
  
Q. The ACC is the premier basketball conference in the nation, if not one of
the, but in March you guys were the only team that made it past the first
weekend of the NCAA Tournament. The league as a whole, do you think that the
league has something to prove?  
TONY BENNETT: Well, I think a chance to represent yourself all the time, if
you look at the history, we've got some talking points when we come in, but
it's obvious, there's six national championships in the last 14 years, and
that's taking into account certainly Syracuse and Louisville. But it's been
successful.  
But I think right or wrong, teams now are judged, coaches, in large part teams
are judged, conferences are judged by how many, how deep you go in the NCAA
Tournament. Certainly we want to make that, and with the depth of the
conference, with the talent in it, I think we are in a spot where if we can do
that, it will show that the ACC is elite.  
I know a lot of the coaches said this is similar to what the Big East had when
they got multiple, multiple teams in. You've still got to prove it. It's
what's before us. But I think there's a great opportunity for that and we want
to keep going, but there's so much parity in college basketball. I played at a
mid‑major in college. You can't be so naïve to think that you're invincible. I
know our team is beatable, and our guys have to understand, whoever we play.
When our guys understand that, that makes us better.  
I think just because we're in the ACC, just because you're in a power
conference, when you step in to play, when you play in the NCAA Tournament, if
you're fortunate enough to get there, you've got to produce and play. The
separation is smaller and smaller now. If we can get multiple teams further
in, that will certainly enhance. That's what it's about. You want as many
teams as you can get for a league like this, because you're going to beat
yourself up, and you need that, so I think that will certainly help.  
  
Q. When you look at your time at Virginia, what have you learned the most
about yourself as a coach? And then on the other side of it, how do you see
yourself as a teacher? How do you view yourself?  
TONY BENNETT: As a coach, I know I've got more questions than answers. I think
I've learned as a younger coach, I remember I was kind of‑‑ you heard that
saying here, jack‑of‑all‑trades, master of none. I remember I took over for my
father, I'm like, okay, this is good, I've got my dad's stuff, we're going to
press, we're going to run some sets, we're going to have a zone. I'm going to
do all these things. I'm going to do more stuff and we're going to be a little
more exciting. I realize, first of all, there's not enough time in practice to
get all of that done. Then I'm like, we're not very good at anything, we're
just kind of blah in the middle.  
And I think as I've matured as a coach, you kind of strip away all the stuff
that doesn't matter, especially when you come into a league like this and
you're building it, you say what's going to give us a chance? And let's be as
good as we can, and I'm all simplified as I've matured as a coach and just
said, let's do a few things as well as we can with extreme execution, because
that's what it comes down to. You cannot trick people now, not with all the
great coaches in the league, with the Synergy, all the video stuff.  
I think I've learned to not overcomplicate it, and then I describe myself as a
teacher. I think that's what a coach is. He's a teacher. Your job is to
inspire, it's to correct, it's to motivate, it's to hold guys accountable. The
main thing I think is to push guys out of their comfort zone because it's not
natural for a team to do as well as we need them to do, to play as hard
defensively or be as unselfish as perhaps we think we need to be to be
excellent.  
You've got to challenge guys and push them out of their comfort zone, but then
you've got to come back and you've got to encourage them. So it's a whole lot
of stuff, and when you screw up, you apologize and then you pick it up the
next day.  
I don't know if that describes me as a coach, but it's just, I've had one of
the greatest coaches, in my opinion, modeled before me in my father, and I've
gotten to coach for a couple years under Bo Ryan. I observe people that take
programs and they somehow get a maximum out of their players, and I try to
really be attentive to that.  
  
Q. This appears to be the deepest, maybe the most talented team top to
bottom coming off the last few years of steadily improving the quality of the
team and then the big success. How do you plan to balance play time and
develop chemistry at the same time?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I think depth is good if there's foul trouble or injuries,
but when guys are healthy, it can sometimes be a challenge. I think some of it
will reveal itself as we compete and get into games, and every coach, maybe
you have to adjust. Last year predominantly I played about an eight‑man
rotation. I think you can play comfortably five guys on the perimeter for
three spots, and probably four for the two forwards or front‑court players, so
that's obviously nine. Again, if there's injuries or fouls, so be it.  
But you just get the nine best guys and they play, and that's what‑‑ everybody
wants a big role, but that's where you find out. Do you have a team that it's
bigger than themselves? Are they really willing to want to be a part of that,
or is it going to be your own little agenda? And those are hard things. They
really are. It's the hardest thing in coaching because you recruit these guys
and you want to see them do well, but you have to say, now is not your time.
Will you be patient? Will you wait? And some guys choose to wait and it's
really rewarding, and some guys say, that's not for me, and that's become more
of the norm in college basketball.  
We'll see. I'm going to play as a coach the guys that I think can help us win,
and it might vary, but it's about a nine‑man rotation.  
  
Q. London Perrantes has seemed to gain more and more confidence this last
season. What do you look for him to improve confidence ‑wise and
execution‑wise?   
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, London hasn't practiced yet this year. He's had a foot
injury, so it's been challenging for us and we've been wobbly at times. I
think of all of our guys, we have a lot of upperclassmen, and I think they
have to improve in little ways. You don't have these big jumps going into your
junior and senior year, but London may be able to take perhaps the biggest
jump but I don't want him to lose who he is as a player. His greatest strength
is his feel for the game, his composure. He lets it come and he knows what
needs to be done. But there are some areas where maybe he could be more
assertive, and he needs to kind of explore that, because I think he could make
up or pick up some slack where we need some areas to be picked up.  
I think I want him to certainly lead, be more comfortable and assertive
without losing that beautiful feel that he has, because that's what sets it
apart for‑‑ any coach knows, when you have your point guard with that kind of
feel, it can make a big difference for you.  
  
Q. How long was he out?  
TONY BENNETT: I hope he's going to be practicing real soon, but he hasn't
practiced yet. He had a foot injury, and it looks like he's been doing more
and more, and we're hopeful in the next couple days he'll be out there.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 29, 2014

  

### [Darion Atkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27795)

### [Malcolm Brogdon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26754)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. What did you learn about your teammates that returned with you as well as
yourself and what Virginia basketball truly is?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I think we really established our identity last year, which
is playing within yourself, playing with humility, knowing who you are, and
priding yourself on defense. I think that's really what took us to the heights
that we saw last year, and I think with that confidence instilled in us, we
will be able to have a successful season this year.  
  
Q. I just asked Trevor Cooney who he anticipates will be the toughest teams
in the league, and he named four before he remembered to say you guys,
especially after what you accomplished last year. Do you feel like you're
constantly proving yourselves?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I don't think that's a bad thing. I think it's something that
this program that has as of late thrived on, being an underdog and being
underestimated. And I think we have a chip on our shoulder, and that only adds
to the fire that we have going into every season.  
  
Q. Malcolm, what is the key to maintain what you guys have done last year?
You see a team now and obviously you knew your team last year, what's the key
to try and duplicate what you guys did last year?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: Ignoring expectations, ignoring hype, and blocking out the
distractions.  
  
Q. You never looked rushed last year, the team, I mean, always looked under
control, patient, even in tight situations. Where does that come from?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I think it comes from a couple places. I think it comes from
Coach Bennett. He's very calm. He's not a guy that panics when we make
mistakes, when we get down in a game. I think it comes from our point guard
London. He came in as a very mature freshman that showed a lot of poison the
floor, and I think it came from our leaders last year, Joe and Akil, who led
by example and were great leaders for us.  
  
Q. You just said the names Joe and Akil. We know how important they were to
the success last year. Who steps into those roles? And are they capable of
filling those kind of shoes?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I think myself, Darion Atkins and Anthony Gill will step into
those leadership roles this year. And I think we are capable. I think we'll
all lead in different ways. But I think we are capable of leading this team to
the best of our ability and to the extent to which this team needs to be led.  
  
Q. Malcolm, how long did that Michigan State game stick in your craw over
the summer? And is it still something that in a way can motivate you guys?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: Definitely. You know, they're a very good team, and we're
hoping we play them again this year in the Big 10‑ACC Challenge. We didn't get
them, but we hope we see them again in the NCAA Tournament.  
But we don't overlook anybody. We know right from the very beginning the
non‑conference games, we have to go in knowing that we have a target on our
back, but play like other teams have a target on their back and go at people
from the very beginning.  
  
Q. With Akil and Joe gone, how confident are you guys in the new group of
guys that you have? And how you guys are meshing together so far?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: Very confident. I think we have great chemistry already, and
I think we're gelling very well together. We have four new freshmen, five new
guys, including a transfer, that really have already bought into the system
that understand and they just want to learn. They want to find their role on
the team. And I think as long as we have guys that are receptive to advice and
receptive to leadership and how this program is run, we're going to be
successful this year.  
  
Q. Last season Virginia was never out of a game. You always found a way to
come back for the most part. As far as the talent on the team right now, what
can you say about having that ability to face adversity and still stay in the
games, like you did before?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I think you're right. I think we're a very resilient program.
We pride ourselves on that, not backing down. I think for us last year, it was
a matter of having great leaders that their mood never changed. They never got
too high or too low, and this year I think it will be the same. I think we'll
have great leaders that will exemplify those same qualities.  
  
Q. Take us back to the championship ACC game last year. What did it mean
after all the stories have been told about Virginia not being back in the
finals?  
DARION ATKINS: I think everyone was surprised that we had the season that we
had, especially in the ACC Tournament and having the run that we did in the
NCAA Tournament. It was a great year with the championship. It was a lot of
fun. It was a great experience, a great journey, and people thought we were
the underdog coming in, which we were, and we were glad that we were.  
We just had a lot of fun doing it.  
  
Q. With all the talent in the front court for Virginia, how do you view
yourself in the mix and kind of work off other guys?  
DARION ATKINS: I view myself as a person who's going to be a key guy in the
mix. Our front court is really good. We're really talented and experienced.
Me, Mike Tobey and Anthony Gill, I think we're going to do a lot of damage
this year. We can mix and match with me and Mike or Anthony and Mike or me and
Anthony, and I think we're going to do really well.  
  
Q. When you talk about yourself being a big part of the mix, how would you
define your game and your elements that you really bring to Virginia?  
DARION ATKINS: Well, sort of the same things as Akil. I can rebound. I'm a
really good rebounder defensively and offensively. I can run the floor really
well, I can defend really well, and I've added some more to my offensive game.
I didn't really get to showcase that last year and I'm pretty eager to do it
this year. I've developed my jump shot inside and out, and I've been working
on my post moves a lot.  
  
Q. Tell me if I'm wrong, but part of the genius of you guys seems to be how
all of you accept your roles so thoroughly. Is that something that Coach has
to instill in you when you get there or does he recruit guys that fill those
roles?  
DARION ATKINS: I don't know if he recruits guys. I think it naturally happens,
because if you're part of the team that we have, he instills it in you, and
it's just something that you buy into, and you just get comfortable with it.
You accept it. And without everyone accepting their role, we won't have the
team that we have or that we should have and that we did have last year.
Because if everyone is out for themselves or being individualistic, it's just
not going to work, everybody with the team that we have.  
  
Q. You guys kind of shocked the ACC last year, and out of all the great
teams that were in the NCAA Tournament, you guys were the only ones to make it
past the first weekend. What do you do to make sure that there is no
dropoff?  
DARION ATKINS: You stay calm and confident basically. You keep your energy and
morale up. You just don't lose sight of the big picture, and you just go out
and play the game of basketball. You don't get caught up in the hype and the
expectation or the pressure, and you just come out and you just keep doing
what you're doing basically.  
  
Q. You and Malcolm both have overcome injuries during your careers. You seem
to be healthy now, and your team seems to be, by and large, healthy. Talk a
little bit about the changing role of being now more of the hunted as opposed
to being the hunter. Because no two ways about it, as ACC champions, it's a
different world.  
DARION ATKINS: Well, to be honest, being the hunter versus being the hunted, I
mean, I kind of see it as the same thing. Me myself and speaking for my team,
I don't think we necessarily get caught up in the hype. I don't know, we're
just a basic group of hungry guys, humble guys, and we just come out and we
play and we don't really think too much of anything, whether we're ranked
No.8, whether we're ranked 50. It doesn't really matter what it is, we just
come out and play and abide by principles, and that's something Coach Bennett
instills in us.  
  
Q. How much did your run last year increase your confidence as a team? And
how eager are you guys to get back out there and have a run like you did last
year?  
DARION ATKINS: Oh, yeah, it definitely increased the team energy and our
eagerness to be able to come back and get ready for this season. I think
that's natural for any team. I think you can say that for anyone.  
We have a chip on our shoulder. We're ready to come out and show everyone that
we can build off of last year and that we can go deeper in the Tournament, and
hopefully get to where we want to be, and that's a National Championship.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 15, 2014

  

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
COACH WEBER: Obviously, we're excited. Last year we had probably half our team
was new. We had five freshmen last year and some transfers, so it was a little
tougher transition, especially coming off a year where we had a very, very
experienced team when I arrived at K‑State.  
So now these guys are a year older. It makes it a little easier for us,
obviously, with practice, and just the preparing. Just feel like we have some
good pieces. I don't think we've arrived by any means, but if some things
happen‑‑ injuries, I think, is a big key point with us, staying healthy and
getting everybody healthy. Probably the development of the point guards will
be a key for us, their maturity, how fast that comes.  
And then just dealing with the schedule. Our schedule, we made it much more
difficult in the nonconference, and then obviously the league is going to be,
if not the best again, one of the best in the country.  
  
Q. Bruce, do you feel like this is your deepest team in terms of talent this
season?  
COACH WEBER: Well, two years ago, obviously, we had great experience, and you
had guys that had played a lot of minutes. We don't have quite that, but we
probably have more players, or a similar number of players, where we can
probably go two deep at each position.  
Again, that's‑‑ you know, just keeping guys healthy, staying healthy, that
will be very important for us, but it's definitely much better than a year
ago, where at times we had trouble‑‑ especially if we went on the road, we had
trouble having five‑on‑five in practice. We just didn't have enough people.
Our walk‑ons had to play an instrumental role.  
So more depth with the big guys, no doubt about that. If we keep everybody
healthy, I think we'll be fine with the depth as far as the other positions
go.  
  
Q. Bruce, you mentioned the point guards. How do you see Nigel and Jevon
playing that? Do you see both of them playing a lot split time, or do you
really want one guy to emerge and get a lot of minutes?  
COACH WEBER: Ideally, I'd like them to both play good quality minutes and get
into that rotation. That means they're both playing well. I think they pushed
each other in practice. Each one did some good things last year. Jevon,
without practicing those first four or five games, he was pretty good. Then
all of a sudden‑‑ then lack of practice and habits and fundamentals probably
caught up with him, and then he lost his confidence.  
Then Nigel kind of stepped up. He started okay, and then kind of when Jevon
came back, he hit a little bit of a lull, and then Nigel got going.  
But both of them quickness, athleticism, pressuring the basketball, pushing
the basketball. Nigel probably shooting, Jevon probably penetrating. So
hopefully, we have a good mix between the two.  
  
Q. Bruce, tell us about Justin Edwards. What kind of player is he, and
what's the expectation?  
COACH WEBER: We're very fortunate to get a transfer from Maine. I believe he
scored a thousand points there in two years. I know he scored a lot. He was
one of the better players in that conference.  
He wanted to take a chance to play at a higher level, and some different teams
in our league around the country, when he announced he was transferring, got
involved. I flew to Bangor, Maine, and that was‑‑ I didn't know there was such
a place, to be honest. We went up and visited with him and got him on campus.  
Very explosive. He gained 16 pounds last year, a lot of it through weight
training that he hadn't done much in the past. He can get to the basket.
He'll‑‑ I promise you one thing, he'll have some dunks that we'll get on ESPN.  
As far as all the other stuff, that's where he's got to develop, just a
day‑to‑day guarding people, staying intense, those are the things that he'll
continue getting better at, I hope. If he can do those things, he's going to
give us a lot‑‑ give us another option scoring‑wise for Marcus Foster.  
  
Q. Coach, I was just kind of wondering. You know, it's easy for fans and
people to relate to, when you recruit a top ten guy and he comes in and he's a
big star. Marcus Foster, I don't think he was like one of those guys. So I'm
just kind of wondering, how does that kind of guy come in right off the bat
his first year and develop into a star? I guess, why wasn't he a more heavily
recruited player?  
COACH WEBER: I think it kind of tells you‑‑ so many kids around the country,
the recruiting guys that do the ratings, they can't see everybody. And then
they may see him one time, and he might have played poorly. Now they mark down
whatever rating they have, they give him some rating, they saw him one time.  
So we‑‑ right when I got the job at K‑State, he was one of the first people we
called. We knew we wanted to get in Texas. We were looking for guys that we
probably weren't going to‑‑ it was too late to get involved with the top five
or so. So now you went to that next group.  
The first time I saw him, man, he's pretty good. He didn't have a great
summer, and part of it, they had too many players on his summer team, his AAU
team, and he kind of got lost in that mix. But when he got to campus, we like,
man, this kid's pretty good. He should have been a top 100 kid.  
It's fine. I think guys like that, probably a little more drive, a little more
hungry. He was in the gym more than anybody last year. The big thing now is to
keep that drive. With him, like a lot of guys that have success early, are you
still hungry? Are you pushing for more? That will be the key to his season, I
would say.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 15, 2014

  

### [Tubby Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13960)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
COACH SMITH: Good morning. It's good to be back here in Kansas City. I know
it's a special time with the baseball playoffs. So with the Orioles in town,
the team from my home state, but I know they're in a little bit of trouble.  
But it's always great to be a part of another basketball season. This is my
39th year. So we're real excited to get started.  
  
Q. Good morning, Coach. I'm just wondering how all of your new players have
adjusted during the first week of practice.  
COACH SMITH: It's been good. I've been very pleasantly pleased with our
progress, especially with seven new faces, five freshmen. So we're a young
team that's‑‑ the good thing about it, we've had opportunities in the fall
with the individual workouts to develop some individual skills, but I've been
impressed with their coachability and their willingness to learn and accept
teaching and coaching. So that's a big start.  
  
Q. Tubby, can you just go down the conference and give us your overview on
what's going on here.  
COACH SMITH: It's, again, as balanced as it has ever been. I know we lost some
very talented players last year out of the league, but the Big 12 is a
conference that year in and year out you're going to be‑‑ you're going to find
a lot of talent. Certainly, the teams that have been picked to be at the top,
Texas and Kansas, Kansas State, Oklahoma, they're teams that are really
returning solid programs‑‑ Iowa State. I think all the teams that went to
postseason play are teams that can make it back to postseason play.  
Having seven, eight teams in a ten‑league conference go is quite a feat. So we
know it will be a very challenging league, once again, if not the best league
again in the country.  
There's a lot of new and bright stars that have been recruited at the upper
echelon programs. So we know we've got to be able to‑‑ if we're going to try
to make a dent, even though it's a work in progress, even though we're a young
team. And we were competitive in most games last year. This year we're going
to have to find a different way to be competitive.  
But the league, top to bottom, is as balanced as it's ever been.  
  
Q. Tubby, how do you go from competitive to turning that into W's?  
COACH SMITH: That's something we all are challenged with, especially in our
coaching staff and at Texas Tech, having had such‑‑ we've had a tough time
over the last few years. So changing that culture, which I think we've turned
the corner. We've lost a lot of close games. So finding a way to win close
games, that boils down to execution and talent. As a coaching staff, we've put
people in the right spots at the right time.  
So Toddrick Gotcher and Rob Turner, two young men that we have with us for
media day. Those are two returning starters that will have to carry a big load
for us this year in leadership. I think that's where you first start, within
your team.  
But we have added some depth in the backcourt so that should help in the
execution of the offense and trying to finalize games, where we can win some
close games. We lost about four or five games last year, where we thought we
had opportunities to close out. That's always tough for a team that's had
trouble winning.  
  
Q. Coach, after your first year in Lubbock, what's been the hardest part
about changing the culture there?  
COACH SMITH: I don't know that it's‑‑ it's always a challenge wherever you
are, year in and year out, to try to‑‑ I think‑‑ you know, keeping players
believing. We lost some talented players through graduation and to transfers.
So getting those guys to understand that you've got to trust in the coaching
staff, trust that we're going to get things done, trust in the administration
and the things that we're doing, that we're making the necessary changes or
improving the areas that we need to improve on to recruit the talented
players.  
The biggest challenge is to get everybody on the same page, from fans right on
down to‑‑ up to the administration.  
  
Q. Tubby, just look at the recent coaching history of Texas Tech, just the
fact of having some continuity there. How important do you see that from the
standpoint of your players?  
COACH SMITH: Consistency and continuity is the key to any program that has had
long tradition and built tradition and success over a long period of time.
You'll find that a coach has been in place for a long period of time, and
they've been able to grow their program.  
So those things are going to be critical. I guess this is the first time in
five years the coaches will have been there for two years in a row. So we'll
see how it goes.  
Again, there are a lot of things that take place, and you can pinpoint whether
it's in basketball or any sport where there's a lot of transition from coaches
to players. It's hard to get that consistency and that continuity. So it is
critical that we continue as people want to‑‑ they want to focus on what's
happening at the time, especially with players. They're the ones that have to
adapt and adjust to a new system and a new style.  
But with another year under our belt, hopefully, our guys‑‑ and I can see it
already. We have a lot of new faces. The returning players and the veteran
players understand the drills and what we want done, and they're able to
communicate that to the other players.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 15, 2014

  

### [Curtis Shaw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25991)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
CURTIS SHAW: Thanks for letting me spend a few minutes. We started this last
year, and I thought it went over well with the changes we're making in college
basketball. So I kind of want to do a little quick recap and tell you where
we're headed.  
Last season, when we stood up here, we talked about changing the physicality
of the game. I think there was a little gloom and doom between some media and
some of the coaches that it will end up all free throws, we're going to chop
the game up. Actually, the exact opposite happened. We ended up freeing up the
basketball game, allowing our teams and our athletes to play basketball, to
get in their motion, to get in their systems, and we got the results we
wanted.  
The results were not necessarily more shots a game, but better shots a game.
We didn't allow them to get physically beat up. They could get open looks, and
it helped the basketball game. Scoring went up a little over five points a
game, and the fouls only increased by about two a game. So they had the
desired results.  
Due to last year's results, the positive aspects we got from the media, from
the fans, from the coaches, from the players, the rules committee and the
men's basketball committee decided to expound on that. The NCAA, we can only
have a new rule change every other year. So this is a non‑rule change year.
But we are allowed to change our emphasis and take parts that are already in
the rule book and really bring them to the front and enforce them in a
different way than we ever have before.  
With the success of the play on the ball last year and the results that
occurred, we decided to expand that. We want to take that to all perimeter
players. With or without the ball, allow them to cut, allow them to move
without being impeded, allow them to move without getting held, and take that
part of the game to allow teams to, again, continue to get off better shots,
not just necessarily more shots.  
The rules committee also took a look at the post play. When we started to
review, we found out that 65 percent of the fouls called in the post against
the defense were because we missed the first foul against the offense. We were
allowing offensive post players to come down the floor, blow the defender off
the blocks, get an illegal post‑up possession, and then hold them off that
post‑up position.  
Then when the defender would come over the top, come back to where he needed
to be, we would get them for a foul. So we realized we were penalizing the
wrong person in allowing the freedom of movement in the game. So we focused on
the perimeter players without the ball, the post players being legal from the
initial start and maintaining the legality during the play, and also continue
to enforce on the ball. Not allow the point guards, the man with the ball, to
get physically beat up every play.  
The rules committee feels like, if we will do these same things this year, it
will help increase scoring again. There's been talk about lowering the shot
clock. There was all kinds of talk about things to do to try to get more
excitement in the game. With the results that we had last year of scoring
going up, with what we think can occur this year with scoring going up, we
really don't have to worry about shortening the shot clock or anything like
that. That might get us more shots, but they might not be better shots. That
doesn't help scoring.  
The last thing we did, and we'll look at a few clips, was try to straighten
out the blocked charge. We have tried for three or four years to figure out
the terminology on the blocked charge that makes it teachable for a coach to
his defenders and makes it a play the referees can do. Last year we butchered
it. What we intended to do in June got changed in September, got altered in
November. By January 1st, I could watch film and couldn't tell you if it was
right or wrong.  
So we had to go back and find a way to simplify the rule for what its
intention was. The whole idea of the airborne player, blocked charge rule, was
really put in for safety. We don't want players sliding underneath a
defenseless airborne player. We started with a three‑foot restricted area arc,
which helped a little because now the defenders had to be there quicker before
the guy got airborne. We're looking at expanding that arc to four feet next
year, which we think will help even more.  
But we still have too many crashes that, when you watch film, we weren't
getting correct. This year we went back and simplified it. Instead of worrying
about upward motion, instead of worrying about primary defender, secondary
defender, we said, that's too much to try to figure out in a split second.
What can we do to help the game? Very simple, we put in the rule, or we
interpreted the rule, it doesn't matter if you're a primary defender. It
doesn't matter if you're a secondary defender. When the offensive player
leaves the floor, the defender can no longer move other than to cover up and
protect themselves, maybe retreat a step because they know they're going to
get plowed. That sounds like a little thing, but it's great, because we can
teach referees to be refereeing the defensive player, peripherally you see the
offensive guy. When his foot leaves the floor, if he moves again, it's got to
be a blocking foul.  
So we don't have to worry about primary, secondary, were you legal? Can you
slide to maintain it? Makes it easy for referees. It's also made it easier
with our coaches because they can now teach their defenders, if you can't get
there and be still before you leave the ground, don't try to because you're
going to get a blocking foul. Go up, verticality, defend the rim, but don't
try to draw a blocked charge.  
So the intent of the rule for safety, the intent of the rule for not allowing
our great athletes to be up in the air and get undercut, this will make it
easier to get the play right. If they get a blocking foul or two, they tend to
quit helping out. They'll get their legal, they'll go up and defend the rim.  
So I think this year, the whole idea of the rules committee, let's continue
the freedom of movement. Let's open the game up. Let's see if our scoring goes
up, like it did last year. We'll get the desired results without having to do
something drastic like changing the shot clock.  
Let's look at a couple of plays just to give you some ideas, and we'll take
any questions if you have them. This is the freedom of movement we've been
talking about off the ball. A lot of times people in the media, the fans, you
never pay‑‑ sorry about that. You never pay attention because you're always
looking at the basketball. At a time when I started refereeing, one of the
things we talked about, if the ball's on one side of the floor and something
occurs all the way across the floor, do we really need to interrupt the game
and call it because it's not affecting the play? When talking to coaches and
watching the plays, it does affect the play.  
So even though the ball's not involved, if we don't allow this man right here
to run his offense, they can't make their play. They can't get off the type of
shot we need.  
So we really focused this summer in our training sessions and the sessions
last weekend with the NCAA, to take the responsibility of watching all the
players off the ball. That's illegal contact. We want that called. We want it
enforced from the start. We're not going to stand there and talk to you all
day, let him go, let him go, don't hold them, we're going to call that. We
want them to be able to run their offense.  
Play two. Another example about plays away from the ball that we're not used
to looking for, but if you look down here, the guy's trying to cut to get down
to the wing pass, and that past that probably would have gotten away with. We
probably would have allowed this defender to bump him and hedge him, but he's
never legal. He keeps him from getting out to get the pass. He slows down the
offense, keeps it from getting into rhythm. These are the types of plays that
we're going to look for to call every possession this year.  
Same thing on this type of play. Basketball's on the other end of the floor,
but as we try to cut through, we're holding. We start holding down here on the
baseline. We don't allow him to ever get to the pick to run his offense
because we're fighting through the pick by moving him out of the way. These
are the type of plays we're going to focus on from the start off the ball to
try to help our teams get into a better offensive flow.  
I may have told you last year, but one of the members of the rules committee
said three years ago our time in the weight room became way more important
than our time on the practice court. That's not the intent of basketball. The
instates helped a little bit by allowing our coaches to work with them more
during the summer, to have some practice time, to have more preseason practice
time with them. So all of that's helping instead of just hanging out with the
strength coach all year. But we have to continue to do our part to keep this
freedom of movement.  
Here's the post play we were talking about. If you watch the illegal post‑up,
what we end up calling, we've got a defender who's holding him, holding him,
holing him, and we finally get the offensive guy for saying get away from him.
We have to see this play from the start. The minute we see the defender's
hands go behind him, that has to be a red flag he's holding. Now he's
illegally butting him off his spot. Now he's illegally swim stroking his arm.
Now the offensive player finally says leave me alone, and we get it. So we
miss four fouls before we get the wrong foul.  
We have to do a better job, and we really focused on not allowing the
offensive player to post‑up illegally, and not allowing the defender to hold,
causing the offensive player to react to the play.  
This play here, it's hard plays because the ball gets swung going around.
Watch this play on the post here. We'll see it in slow‑mo, but we've allowed
this offensive player to create three different fouls so his team ends up
getting about six shots off before we have a rebound. But it's simply because
we tend to let him play too much. So a play gets saved. Right now the offense
is illegal. That's the first thing you want to look for.  
Now the defender's trying to get around, and we end up with a wrestling match.
Now the offensive player comes back, sets an illegal screen to allow the point
guard to go to the basket. We haven't done a good job of making our offensive
post players be legal, and it will be a big focus this year.  
See that first move on the offense, and we end up calling a foul on the
defense. Watch his initial post‑up. Never legal. Goes into him. Throws into
him. Throws the legal defender out of the way, and somehow we get a foul on
the defender. That's the play that we taught referees to quit watching the
basketball. Focus on who created the initial contact, and penalize the right
player. If not, we end up with a post player on defense who's now got three
fouls and has to go sit down, and we know the kid on the bench isn't as good.
It doesn't help our game. It disrupts the flow even more. We have to take care
of the initial contact by the offensive player that's illegal.  
Here's the blocked shot we talked about. Here's a play that last year was very
hard to referee because you're trying to figure out if he's a primary
defender, secondary defender. If he's primary, he can continue to move to
maintain his position. If he's secondary he can't. Or when you see this view
from the side, it's going to be pretty obvious this year it's going to be a
lot easier to referee. A lot easier. They want to run a charge, trying to
figure it out, watch the defensive player. All I have to do is watch him. He
leaves the ground, he is still sliding sideways, I've got an easy blocking
foul.  
The coaches need to teach this kid don't try to draw in front of the charge.
You're not going to get a charge at this point. Just go up with verticality.
It will make for cleaner plays, and it will limit the safety factor by
undercutting an airborne play.  
These are the types of plays that we've done a poor job again of penalizing
the offensive player when the defense does nothing wrong. We teach referees,
if the defender does nothing wrong, no matter how ugly a play looks, it can't
be a foul on the defense. It may be an offensive foul. It may be a no call.
But it can't be a foul on the defense. We've got a perfect case here where the
defensive player does a great job rebounding positions, long rebounds so they
don't get it. I get perfectly set before he ever leaves the floor. I
definitely get displaced because he leads by dropping his shoulder, and I
don't reward him. That's a poor job by the referee of not rewarding the
defensive player. That's what we teach them.  
If you know what the defensive player is doing, if they're illegal as all
times, you'll know what happened on the play and caused it to happen. No, that
was an obvious charge. That was an obvious charge that we had a no call on.  
Here's the play we talk about because of safety. This is really why the rule's
in and really why we're going to increase this restricted area size. This is
the player still stepping up and under, go down, we've got a chance for a
major injury. This is a play we won't stop. Obviously, when he leaves the
floor, he's trying to get out of the restricted area, he's still taking that
last step forward. It doesn't matter if he got hit in the chest. It doesn't
matter that he was squared up. He's moving when he leaves the floor. A lot
easier to referee, and a lot easier to teach as a coach.  
When you get outside the area or even if you're in the area, if you go up
verticality, that three‑foot restricted area doesn't matter on the play. There
is no blocked charge area if you are vertical. Teach the players to go up and
defend, teach the referees not to let them move at all, and that helps our
flow of the game.  
I think that's all with the film clips, trying to explain what we're going to
do this year and the new parts of what they tasked us to do to help the flow
of the game and scoring to continue.  
Any questions about it or comparing last year to this year and where we ended
up?  
  
Q. [ No microphone ].  
CURTIS SHAW: I don't think there's an ultimate number. I always like to say,
always remember it's not the referees. We only do what the NCAA and the men's
basketball rules committee makes us do‑‑ makes us. Encourages us to do. And
the rules committee is made up of coaches. So they're the ones who decided the
game didn't look well.  
I think the Connecticut‑Butler game in the Final Four a couple years ago,
everybody said this is enough. We're not playing basketball anymore. So they
try and adopt things that we can enforce to help the game. There is no magic
number. Some coaches said we can't play defense anymore. Absolutely, you've
always been able to play defense, but you're supposed to play defense by
sliding your feet, keeping your body in front, not physically man handling
somebody.  
If the scores get in the 70's, the 80's, whatever happens, as long as it's
free flowing, as long as it's legal, and as long as it allows us to get off
better shots, not necessarily more shots, I think they're happy.  
  
Q. [ No microphone ].  
CURTIS SHAW: I would say that. We don't care what the points are. A team‑‑
let's take for example, Rick Burgess, the chair of the rules committee this
year, he's the coach at Belmont University. He plays a very flowing, they take
off 30, 35 seconds off the shot clock, but they end up getting off good shots.
If we physically don't allow them to get into that play, we're really
disrupting the way they want to play, and the scores may be in the 30's. May
be in the 70's. But as long as they can run the play freely and get a good
look, that's the intent.  
  
Q. [ No microphone ].  
Can you tell us what the percentages were of blocked charge calls from two
years ago last year and what the expectation might be for this year?  
CURTIS SHAW: We did such a poor job last year, that by the end of the year,
everything was blocked. A defender, just like we saw on the one play where the
kid is standing here and gets plowed, we either no called or called the block
because we can't know what to do. What we're trying to do is reward legal
defense and allow undercutters, and it ended up we just penalized the offense
all the time or penalized one game the defense all the time. If coaches
couldn't teach it, we couldn't do it.  
So it's hard to say what our percentages were because I don't think we got
half of them right last year. By February, when I was watching film, trying to
watch a game, I could slow it down, and with the interpretations we had, I
couldn't figure it out. So I know they couldn't split second on the court.  
The intent is not to have more charges, not to have more blocks. It's to make
the defense be legal and help the safety factor to allow our athletes to get
to the rim to teach players to play vertical instead of undercut.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 15, 2014

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
COACH SELF: I'm excited. We're obviously a much different team than what we
were last year, lost three quality guys, but we recruited fairly well and have
four newcomers who we think will all be good players, and our returning guys
have improved. So I think we'll be a fun team to watch play, a lot different
than what we've been in the past because we don't have the same size we've had
in the past.  
But certainly a team that will play a little different and hopefully rely on
our speed a little bit more than we have in the past.  
  
Q. Good morning, Coach. How about those Orioles, huh?  
COACH SELF: They're pretty good.  
  
Q. Every year you are charged with the task of making guys become better,
improving their game. How do you reenergize each and every year to rise to
that challenge?  
COACH SELF: I think that's what‑‑ how does anybody reenergize themselves to do
their job? I mean, that's our job. The other thing is it's not really work.
It's something that we love, to be a part of what we feel like is the greatest
game on earth.  
So I don't think that's very difficult, but it is fun to watch guys get
better. We take a lot of pride in, wherever they come to us as, whether it's a
Wiggins or maybe a Brady Morningstar or Tyrel Reed, our job is to get them as
close to their ceiling as possible and as quickly as we can. That's something
that our coaches work very, very hard to do.  
  
Q. Coach, going back to your reference to Wiggins, I mean, obviously he got
a lot of attention as a scorer, but he was also your number two shot blocker
last year, and I think he was tied for second as a defensive rebounder. In
what ways do you feel like the new guys will be able to compensate for some of
the void that he left as a defensive player?  
COACH SELF: He was‑‑ Joe, I think, got voted as best defensive player in the
league, but Wigs was our best defender. Joe blocked the most shots.  
I think we'll do it by committee. I think that, as a team, we were probably as
poor defensively last year as we've been in a long time. I think this year's
team has maybe a different mindset, maybe more capable physically to be better
defenders, but we do not have a rim protector like we had last year.  
We'll do it by committee, and there's enough competition in the gym, I
believe, that that will force guys to become better defenders because of the
fact that the guy that they're competing for spots with or competing for
minutes with will probably do what we ask them to do.  
  
Q. One of the big stories in college sports right now are autographs and
authenticating autographs. What do you tell your guys? How do you deal with
this issue?  
COACH SELF: We've actually run it through our compliance in the past and have
ways to handle it, but it's not ever going to go as scripted. Somebody asks
for an autograph, the perfect thing to say, who do you want me to make it out
to? If they say, well, don't, just sign your name, well, then, you
automatically know it could be for sale. And with you having no knowledge of
it.  
Our guys sign autographs for an hour, 30 minutes after every game. We try to
limit it to one thing and have it be a child as opposed to an adult, but
there's no telling how many times you have children come bringing you ten
items to sign that isn't for them, it's for the adult that told them to go do
it or paid them $5 to go get it done.  
It's a tough deal. I don't understand those cases at all, but it's a little
bit different when you're signing randomly than it is if you're actually
sitting down and somebody's handing you an abundant amount of things to sign.
That would be a little bit suspicious to me.  
But try to educate our players, hey, if it you want an autograph, just ask who
to make it out to. If they say, don't make it out to anybody, then there's
really absolutely no reason to sign it.  
  
Q. Obviously, the Big 12 conference has been ‑‑ it's been highly contested
for years. A lot of people are vying for the top spot. Do you feel like this
year there's more parity in the conference compared to past recent years?   
COACH SELF: I don't know. The appearance is there's going to be a lot of good
teams in our league. Last year our league was fabulous. It was arguably the
best league in America, and statistically it was the best league in America.  
This year I've seen a lot of the preseason publications, and a lot of them
have five teams that are preseason top 25 teams, but to me, that really
doesn't mean anything either. A lot depends on how we do nonconference. Let's
just face it, we need to play well nonconference because that sets your RPI up
for the entire year.  
But there's multiple teams that would have a legitimate shot at winning our
league this year.  
  
Q. You've got a lot of moving parts in the backcourt, a lot of guys that
were highly sought out coming in. How is that competition shaping up? When do
you feel you might know who's going to get the bulk of the minutes there?  
COACH SELF: I think there's a chance Wayne's going to play a lot. Truthfully,
we've got seven good perimeter players‑‑ I didn't say great, but really good
perimeter players. There is a lot of competition there because you can't play
seven perimeter guys. We'll play five and maybe six in certain situations.  
So I think practices are a little bit more heated. I think the guys are
competed against each other, but it will probably be at least two or three
weeks before I have a feel for how we'll start the season, and how we start
the season, I guarantee, won't be how we finish it because we've got some
young kids. When they figure it out, they're going to get pretty good.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 15, 2014

  

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
COACH KRUGER: First of all, go Royals. Is that appropriate?  
THE MODERATOR: I think that's appropriate.  
COACH KRUGER: What a great story, fun to watch, having grown up in the area
for sure.  
Great time of year. Otherwise, practice this time of year is the best. Guys
come with great enthusiasm, great energy. We've got a lot of guys returning
from last year. So they've got a little better idea of what to expect, and the
leadership has been outstanding with Buddy Hield and Ryan Spangler, Isaiah
Cousins, three juniors for us that have been through a lot of Big 12 games and
other venues as well.  
They've done a great job in the off‑season with their investment of time and,
again, the leadership. They don't just do it verbally. They do it with their
actions and been outstanding.  
Been through seven or eight practices now. We're off today but resume
tomorrow. First exhibition game is November 7th. Comes on very quickly, but
again a fantastic time of year.  
  
Q. Lon, you've taken the step of getting Oklahoma back into the NCAA
Tournament as a player and as a contender in the Big 12. But what's the key to
taking that next step, of contending for a championship and also having an
extended stay in the tournament?  
COACH KRUGER: The key is always players. The experience that they gained from
last year, I think, will help. They know how tough it is to win conference
games. They know how tough it is to win postseason games. They want to do
that. They worked awfully hard in the off‑season in preparation for the start
of practice.  
Again, the leadership of this group with Ryan and Buddy and Isaiah is
outstanding, and Jordan Woodard, as a sophomore, understands more clearly what
Big 12 games are all about and how tough it is. As good of a freshman year he
had, I think we'll see a big jump going into his sophomore year from him.  
The perimeter depth is good, and that's always important to win games in
postseason.  
  
Q. Do you get a sense that the team will buy in defensively a little bit
more this season than perhaps last?  
COACH KRUGER: I do. That's an area that we have to do a better job with. Last
year we knew we could score. We had confidence on the offensive end. I think
that took away from the sincerity a little bit on the defensive end, and we
can't afford to do that.  
So we've got to cover better. We've got to get stops. We've got to rebound the
ball better, be a little bit more physical in that way. I think our guys do
have a much better understanding of the value of all of that.  
  
Q. Lon, Buddy took a big step last year scoring. I don't see him taking ‑‑
you know, adding another nine points to his average, but where can his game
go?   
COACH KRUGER: Buddy had a good summer. He did well in K.D.'s camp, did well in
LeBron's camp, representing the Bahamas in international competition and did
well there.  
I thought as a freshman, Buddy was a little bit more aggressive in attacking
the rim and going to the offensive boards. Last year a little more perimeter
oriented and shot the ball and had a good year. I think we'll see him combine
the two and attack a little bit more off the dribble and make him more
effective in shooting the ball. I think we'll see a more well-rounded game out
of buddy. He's worked awfully hard at it.  
  
Q. I just wanted to ask you a question about the incoming freshmen and what
you expect out of them this season with such an experienced team.  
COACH KRUGER: Khadeem Lattin and Jamuni McNeace, two guys that are rangy and
athletic. A lot of energy, a lot of enthusiasm on their part. Great for them
to come in and play every day in practice with Ryan Spangler, TaShawn Thomas,
D.J. Bennett, three older guys that they'll learn from every day and go up
against every day and really benefit from that.  
They've got great upside. A lot of excitement about watching them grow and
develop as young players.  
  
Q. Lon, what do you think of the development of Jordan Woodard in his second
year as a collegiate player?  
COACH KRUGER: Jordan had a really good freshman year, but probably‑‑
typically, they make the biggest jump from freshman to sophomore year. Buddy
did that. I thought Isaiah did that. I think Jordan will do that.  
As good of a freshman year as he had, I think we'll maybe have the greatest
impact, relative to change, of all the guys. He's shooting the ball more
consistently. He's making good decisions. Again, he's worked awfully hard in
the summer and in fall in preparation for that.  
  
Q. Lon, apologize in advance if I miss this, but you referenced TaShawn, and
just more about his situation with the NCAA, if you've heard anything back. Do
you have any kind of ‑‑ I know these things tend to be a little bit nebulous.
Any kind of timeline as to when you expect to hear something on his situation?
  
COACH KRUGER: Expect to hear something soon. Don't know what that means
exactly. We kind of thought that the last ten days or so, but really do think
it's soon now.  
Don't have any idea. We feel like he's a great kid, on course to graduate,
done everything right. He's represented well, and, again, we're hopeful of an
additional eligibility, immediate eligibility. We'll find that out soon. Don't
have any idea.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 15, 2014

  

### [Trent Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18247)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
COACH JOHNSON: My thoughts on the upcoming season, I've been asked this
question on a couple of occasions, why am I so happy? Why am I so excited?
Number one is, for the first time I've been at TCU, we've had nine practices,
and I have a full complement of players, 13 guys on scholarship and 3
walk‑ons, and we're healthy.  
Obviously, we've improved from an athletic standpoint. Some of the guys we had
sitting out on our basketball team, some of the guys we signed from a
recruitment standpoint. So our practices are much more competitive. We're a
lot better. Our skill level is a lot better. We have an opportunity to compete
at a high level.  
We've established ourselves in terms of how we conduct ourselves socially and
academically and all those kinds of things, which I think are really important
in college athletics. So the next step for us is winning our share of
basketball games.  
I am happy until we play our first game, and then we'll find out from there.  
  
Q. Do you see any benefit from being under the radar for a year or two?  
COACH JOHNSON: A benefit to being under the radar for a year or two? No, I
don't really get caught up in that. This is not coach speak, but for me, it's
about being as competitive as you can be and overachieve.  
For me, when I speak to our players and speak to the teams we've had in the
past, it's about being the best possible player, person you can be day in and
day out.  
So under the radar, if you look at what is going on in college athletics
across the board, I don't think there's anything that's under the radar. If
you look at games like that, like you're under the radar, that speaks volumes
to where you are or where you aren't as a competitor. So I don't think in this
league, for the most part, because there's a lot of guys in this league that
know what they're doing, there's a lot of talented players in this league. I
don't think they look at this game, as you're playing TCU or you're playing
this team and think that you're going to have an easy win.  
So from my standpoint, under the radar? No.  
  
Q. Hey, I'm always interested in new guys. Your optimism, it sounds like
part of that has to be because you've got some transfers who probably factor
in right away. Can you just talk about Zeigler and Washburn?  
COACH JOHNSON: I'll start with Trey, who's played a lot of basketball. He's
one of our leaders. He's a guy that's got to perform at a high level, and I
think he's excited about this, it's his last go around. But he'll play the two
for us, he'll play the three, and sometimes he'll be in situations where he'll
play the one.  
He's a guy that can create for himself. He's a scorer, not a shooter. He's a
guy that can create for himself and can create for others.  
Chris Washburn, I've been very pleased with up until this point. Obviously,
his last time playing competitive basketball was at El Paso. He gives us a
lift at the four spot because he can pass it and he can rebound it. He does
all the little things in that involve winning that go unnoticed sometimes. He
sets great screens, he makes the pass that leads to the pass that leads to the
score. Those two are going to have to have good years for us.  
Along with that, there's a kid by the name of Kenrich Williams from New
Mexico, who's probably going to be one of our better defenders with time. So
we're in a position where, just in the short, that this team is capable of
defending and rebounding at a high level, and that's how we can keep ourselves
in games versus high caliber competition and have an opportunity to win some
of those games, which we haven't had the opportunity in the past.  
  
Q. Coach, when you're establishing a new team, is defense the first thing
that comes around for you generally?  
COACH JOHNSON: Regardless of whether it's a new team or an old team, it's
always been your ability to defend, your ability to rebound, and your ability
to take care of the ball. I think, in general, kids in this day and age, they
all want to play fast. They all want to run. To me, I tell them, if you
rebound, you can go as fast as you want as long as you can make good
decisions.  
It's all relative regardless of the sport, but to win at the championship
level, you need to be able to play on the half‑court. You need to be able to
defend, and you need to be able to rebound. Good teams aren't going to let you
run. Great teams aren't going to let you run. Mediocre or poor teams, you'll
be able to get out in transition.  
As limited as we've been in the previous two years in terms of our talent
level, I think for the most part we've had to slow the game down as best we
could on offense, and defense we try to stay in front of people and grind.
We've been mismatched from a talent standpoint. I think we've done a decent
job. For now, I fully expect this group to be able to defend at a high level.
That would generate more fast break opportunities, and we can make decent
decisions and score the ball from there.  
  
Q. How much of this team's success do you put on Kyan's shoulders?  
COACH JOHNSON: Kyan, he has better players around him. What he did last year,
for a team that was decimated by injuries, was pretty impressive because he
always kept playing and kept competing, and his percentages, whether it was
scoring or shooting free throws, will improve.  
The big thing for him, which is the big thing for us, is being able to defend.
I think we're going to have an opportunity to score. He's a leader of this
basketball team, and the next thing he needs to do is improve his ability to
guard, which will improve our chances of winning. If you can defend at the
point and defend at the post, which is Kyan and Karviar, I think we'll have a
chance. Both of those guys are very capable and both of those two guys on this
basketball team that, when we went to conference play, their statistics
improved. To me that's how you measure if a guy can play or not.  
Kyan and Karviar, both in nonconference they were so‑so, and when they got to
conference play, they improved.  
I'm looking forward to him having a good year. He's enjoyable to be around
right now. My first two years, I don't think he enjoyed me, and I don't think
I enjoyed him, but we have a pretty good relationship right now. I'm saying
that because he's sitting over there in the corner listening. That's okay.  
You guys must think we're going to be good too. Last time I got two questions,
and I was off the podium and gone.  
  
Q. Is confidence building a big part of the job for you this year?  
COACH JOHNSON: For me or for the group? I've never lost confidence. I mean,
how can you lose confidence? This is not my first trip. I've always felt for
the kids. I try to pride myself on being realistic and proactive. Realistic to
what we have and proactive to where we're going. What this group went through,
and this is the last time I probably want to talk about this year. I think
they have a level of confidence where we're healthy, if we do certain things,
we'll have a chance to win some games. But also that can be false sometimes
because the reality is you're only as good as your win/loss record, and what
went on last year, we need to carry over and understand that, if you don't do
certain things at a high level, you're going to be back in that same position.  
For me, personally, I've never lost confidence. It is what it is. We run the
same stuff I ran with certain other teams when we won a lot of games, won
championships, and we're going to do the same thing we've always done. I just
think, for the most part, you're talking about a basketball program that
hasn't had any basketball tradition and hasn't won a lot of games. We don't
talk about that. We just talk about the opportunity we have in front of us at
this level of play in this league to be good.  
A lot of exciting things going on at TCU. When you look at all other sports in
our athletic department, they've always won at a high level and been very
consistent. It's time for us to start doing our share of the work.  
  
Q. With the majority of your roster being freshmen and sophomores, what do
you expect out of them this season?  
COACH JOHNSON: To understand what we are doing, Number one. Number two, to
push the upperclassmen, when you say the majority of our rosters is freshmen
and sophomores. We've got our classes staggered. We have got three seniors who
are very capable, very talented players. We have two juniors, six sophomores
that are going to be the mainstays of our program, and three freshmen that
came in. We think we have, in terms of our roster, staggered, our recruiting
class is staggered, but we have to continue to get good players.  
Whether you're a freshman or sophomore, experience doesn't mean nothing to me
if you can't play. I fully expect those kids to fully be in a position where
they're competing every day and challenging the guys in front of them. It's
nice to see we have that. We have a very competitive practice. We've got guys
who are healthy, and our recruitment has improved. It's going to continue to
improve.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 15, 2014

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Your thoughts on the upcoming season.  
COACH HUGGINS: It can't get here soon enough. We're whatever we are, a couple
weeks into practice, and it starts to get mundane and even boring for coaches.
We've got a scrimmage coming up which we're looking forward to.  
I like our team. I like the enthusiasm they bring every day. I think we're
finally maybe going to try to guard somebody, which would be something new.
Actually, maybe try to run to the rim and shoot a layup.  
We've been kind of like your dog, you know, with the electric fence. We run
right to that three and kind of stop right there. So we're going to actually
try to run in past the three‑point line this year and see if that works.  
  
Q. Coach, when you talk about in what ways has Gary Brown matured in his
time with the program, and what do you expect of him as a senior in terms of
leadership and so forth?  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, I think Gary's always brought a lot of enthusiasm and
toughness. Gary is kind of like a dog chasing a bone. I mean, wherever the
ball was, he chased it and with total disregard for where his man was, but
he'd always made some plays and stole the ball. So I guess that was okay.  
It's just hard to do that at this level, and I think he's become much more
disciplined at the defensive end. I think he's become much more disciplined at
the offensive end. He kind of understands kind of what he can and can't do. I
think he's done a much, much better job of accentuating the positive.  
  
Q. Bob, where do you want to see Juwan's game go this year?  
COACH HUGGINS: I kind of want him to do the same thing he did a year ago. I
just like to get the same kind of production with not as many minutes. I think
he wore down a little bit at the end of the year playing all those minutes.
I'd like to be able to rest him some more, have him fresher at the end of
games, I think.  
And I talked to him about this. I think there were times where he was just
spent at the end of games. Where we really needed him sometimes to go and get
the ball, he just couldn't. I think, if we could keep him fresher, we want the
ball in his hands, obviously, at the end of games. He's a guy that can make
free throws down the stretch, and he's a guy that's not going to turn it over.  
So we want to rest him more but still get the same kind of production from
him. I think he's shooting the ball so much better. I don't know if he's
shooting it better. I think he's shooting with so much more confidence. He
could shoot it last year. He just, I don't think, had enough confidence to do
so. But he's put a tremendous amount of time in the gym and worked really hard
at it, which, I think, has really helped his confidence level.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach? We're not going to let him off that easy?  
COACH HUGGINS: After Rick Barnes, they already figured everything out. I spent
five minutes with Rick, and I feel smarter.  
  
Q. Last year you came with the cardigan, this year with the bow tie, a nod
to Gordon Gee? Or is this a fashion statement?  
COACH HUGGINS: A tribute to our president, yeah. It just kind of seemed like
the right thing to do. And I'd kind of like to keep you guessing. I don't
really‑‑ I mean, I don't want people to think they've figured me out yet.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more basketball questions for coach?  
COACH HUGGINS: I appreciate you being concerned about my wardrobe, though.  
  
Q. A lot of players down low last year were brand new to the program, guys
who you had to count on simply because you needed them. To see Devin Williams
coming back this year, Brandon Watkins, what do they bring this year that
maybe they weren't capable of last year being forced in there?  
COACH HUGGINS: We're certainly hoping that Devin's a guy that we can throw the
ball to that can score it close. I think we basketball being a game of runs,
to try to stop runs, and we obviously couldn't do that at the defensive end.
So we just tried to keep pace offensively, and when we started missing shots
that we really didn't have, there was no second option.  
I think Devin spent a great deal of time this summer with K.J., Kevin Jones,
and I don't think anybody has ever maximized their potential better than what
Kevin Jones did and really learned how to use his body and shield people off
the ball with his body and being able to score it around the rim by just using
those big shoulders.  
I think Devin has made tremendous progress in that area. I think he scores the
ball so much better around the basket. It's nice when you can throw it close
and kind of stop the bleeding, so to speak, when people are making runs. I
think Dev can do that for us.  
And Brandon's worked really hard on‑‑ you know, you want him to have a go to,
something that they can go to, and he's worked really hard on being able to
jump hook the ball with either hand. He's a guy that you probably‑‑ he's just
not as strong as Devin yet. So he loses post position a little easier. But
when he catches it there, he scores it at a very high rate because of his
ability to‑‑ his length and then ability to throw that jump hook.  
It's a good thing you two guys are here. I'd feel like a lost soul. I do
anyway.  
  
Q. In what ways do you feel like your nonconference schedule prepares you to
play in a league that some of your colleagues are saying is arguably one of
the country's best?  
COACH HUGGINS: I don't know the answer to that. I've done this for a long
time, and I think there's been a time where we've over scheduled, and I think
there's times when we've under scheduled. I think the problem is we do the
schedule a little bit ahead. Like I would probably have done some different
things after having two weeks of practice than what I did last year when we
were trying to make the schedule.  
I think there's times when you ought to back off a little bit. You have young
guys like we had a year ago, to try to develop some confidence. And there's
other times where you have veterans and you need to consistently challenge
them.  
I'm just making all that up because I really don't know what to say. I
appreciate your writing it down, though. And try to write it like I really did
know what I was talking about, but I really don't. I don't know that there's
really a good answer sometimes.  
Honestly, you look at some of those teams that they end up going a long way in
the tournament, and they play just a horrendous nonconference schedule.
Everybody says it makes you better. It only makes you better if you win.  
  
Q. Coach, going back a couple of years where you had so many true freshmen
in Gary Brown's class, and now you have a lot of new players, but a lot of
them have played at least college basketball before. How different is this
transition compared to that, when these guys should have a little bit better
understanding of what will be expected of them?  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, obviously, I hope we're a whole lot better. A lot of it
is having people who kind of fit together. I think this group really does.
They seemingly like each other a lot. As I said earlier, they brought great
enthusiasm, I think, to every practice, which makes it a lot more fun. I think
everybody enjoys it more. I certainly enjoy it more.  
We've spent a lot of time trying to explain to them that it's hard to coach
effort and basketball at the same time. If you're constantly coaching effort,
you don't coach a lot of basketball. I think to this point their effort's been
pretty good and we've been able to actually go in and coach basketball, which
is seemingly what they're supposed to want and certainly what we want to do.  
So we're way ahead in that area. And then having a guy like Jonathan Holton
who just‑‑ I don't know that I've had many people who have the enthusiasm that
he has on a day‑to‑day basis. He just comes in every day just excited to play,
loves to play. And he's a guy that you don't have to run things for him to
score.  
A lot of guys‑‑ Joe Alexander had a great year for us, but we had to run
things for Joe. I think Jonathan's a guy who can score the ball without
running plays for him. He's a guy who's going to get it off the glass. He's
going to get it in transition. He's going to make open shots. And he's a guy
that you don't have to say this is Jonathan's play for him to score, which is
kind of refreshing. Seemingly in an era where everybody wants to catch it and
dribble it 74 times before they pass it, he doesn't do that.  
He's a guy that I think at some point in time we're going to have to tell him
to go ahead and try to look to score more. We can throw it to him in the post,
and he passes it out of the post to open people. He's just‑‑ he's not your
typical modern day kind of guy. He's kind of a throwback kind of guy, which is
fun.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 15, 2014

  

### [Fred Hoiberg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21399)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
COACH HOIBERG: We're very excited about this upcoming season. Had a special
year last year. Lost two guys that had a tremendous impact on our team, two
all‑Americans, DeAndre Kane and Melvin Ejim, which will be very difficult to
replace. I'm excited about the group I have. You don't replace those guys with
just one or two players. You have to do it by committee.  
The thing I've been most pleased with our practices to this point is just how
competitive they've been, the way guys have been getting after each other. I
think we'll have a little more depth this season. We'll have the ability to
play 10, maybe even 11 guys, and we'll have versatility to play different
types of lineups. You can go small. You can go big. It's a group that's going
to go out there and compete any time they take the floor. It's just the makeup
of our guys.  
Whether they're out competing two‑on‑two in a shooting competition or going
out to compete on a Monday in the Big 12. It's a good, exciting team. We have
a good mix right now, good freshmen, returning players, and also a couple of
transfers we'll sprinkle in.  
  
Q. Coach, typically, in the past couple years, you've been sort of a four
out, five out type of offense. This year you guys have a little more height.
How do you sort of balance what you've done in the past with now maybe being
able to do some things that you weren't able to do for more of a traditional
offense standpoint?  
COACH HOIBERG: That's a great question. We'll continue to do what's made us a
successful offensive team by playing with the court spread. We are able, with
the makeup of our group, to run some more quick hitters and take advantage
maybe of some mismatches because of the size of our players.  
Our biggest emphasis right now on the offensive end, we haven't put in many
quick hitters yet. It's just been how are we going to flow into our offense,
and how are we going to recognize mismatches that will occur at any time
during the possession.  
I've been really impressed with just the IQ of our guys to recognize who's got
the best mismatch out there, whether it's in the post or whether it's on the
perimeter, and we give a guy a side and space the floor on the weak side. It's
something that will evolve, I think, with this group, but right now it's been
a lot of flow. We'll start sprinkling in the quick hitters and get the zone
offense a lot because we're going to see a lot of zone early on in the season.  
  
Q. Just talk about Bryce and what do you expect from him. And following
that, the two guys you do lose were so much a part of what you did, especially
with leadership. I wonder if this is related.  
COACH HOIBERG: Yes, that will be, I think, as big of anything we miss out of,
DeAndre, Melvin is leadership. There's a lot of things said about DeAndre Kane
going into the season. He was an absolute pleasure to coach. All throughout
the season. In the leadership he brought to our guys, shoot, he's 24 years old
and a lot of life experiences. He really helped with that. Again, that will
evolve as the season goes on, who will take the role of leader. Again, I think
we've got a group that will lead by committee instead of just one or two guys.  
As far as Bryce, he's been awesome. The thing I'll say about Bryce as a
basketball player, there are things you can't teach. He's extremely athletic.
He plays above the rim in transition. The thing we're trying to talk to him
about is missing and taking shots on the floor. He's getting better at that.
He's a guy that you can use all over the court. You can post him. He's every
bit of 6'6". He's a very good midrange shooter. We talk about not taking a lot
of contested, two‑point shots, but he finds a way to make him. So you have to
let him shoot some of them, and then he can shoot the three.  
He's a guy you can use all over the floor, and he's fit in very well with our
group at this point.  
  
Q. You've had a lot of success building your team around some Division I
transfers. Why has that worked for you? Maybe what are some of the pitfalls
that come with trying to do that, with guys cycling in every year?  
COACH HOIBERG: As far as pitfalls, we haven't had any to this point, as far as
what could potentially happen. Such an open mind when we bring these kids into
our program, and they've really bought into what we're trying to do. When you
have guys like Melvin Ejim and George Niang and now Monte Morris, Dustin
Hogue, they've got to conform to what you're doing.  
As far as why we've had success with them, they've really come in with the
idea to win basketball games. It's not about individual agendas, and you have
to have that. We're talking about chemistry all the time. If you're going to
win and beat teams that have more talent, you have to have great chemistry.
Our guys have been very pleased with the players we've brought in because
they've bought into that idea very well.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 15, 2014

  

### [Travis Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18471)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
COACH FORD: We've been going for about a week, full practices. It's been a fun
group to work with. Very hungry group, very competitive team. Very aggressive
basketball team. We've got a great mix of basically seven returners with
experience and seven new guys, whether it be incoming freshmen or junior
college transfers or a transfer from LSU.  
Our team's going to rely‑‑ we've got four guys with great experience. You look
at guys like Michael Cobbins, who's back and healthy, been a four‑year
starter. Le'Bryan Nash will be a four‑year starter for us. Phil Forte, who
started last year as sixth man of the year in the league. And Anthony Hickey,
who's been a three‑year starter at LSU. So these are four guys who bring us
very good experience, who have played a lot of big games in their career, and
these are the guys that we need to lead our basketball team.  
These are four veteran guys. All four guys, we talked to, need to have the
best years of their career at this point.  
The young kids on our basketball team have showed a lot of‑‑ we keep calling
it grit. They've been very aggressive, a very aggressive group in practice. I
like our basketball team. I think we have a chance to be very good
defensively, very good. We've got a lot of good pieces. Anthony Hickey is one
of the better on‑the‑ball defenders I've coached. He's a very, very good
defender on the ball, really sets the tone.  
We've got some wing players who really understand defensive rotations and
understand what we're doing. Then we've got the best shot blocking group I've
coached in Michael Cobbins and Anthony Allen. One kid we brought in from
junior college that led in blocked shots last year. We've got quickness that I
hope should hang its identity on defense.  
We're impressed turning people over in practice, and hopefully the defense‑‑
we can hang our hat on defense.  
  
Q. More on Hickey, a lot of times when you have a Division I transfer, you
get to practice with the team for a year. That's not the case here. How is it
going to blend?  
COACH FORD: Again, good point. One thing that helps is we get to work with our
players in the summertime. One thing we did was mostly team workouts. We used
the summer to really bond together as a team because we to have new players
that are going to play significant minutes, and we've used most of the
preseason starting in August and September and early October for individual
workouts.  
One thing I've been impressed with the team is the chemistry thus far. It's
been impressive. So hopefully, we can continue that. Hickey, one thing I've
seen is he seems to be very hungry for this opportunity to be able to play in
the Big 12 and play at Oklahoma State in a system, I think, that's going to
fit him pretty good. He's been obviously a big addition or our basketball
team.  
I was excited about a lot of our players, but we did have that inexperience at
the point guard spot until we've got him. Now we go from having some guys that
have been playing the position that didn't have experience to a guy that's
been a three‑year starter at the highest level. Played in tons of big games.
In high school, he's Mr. Basketball, Kentucky, won the state championship in
Kentucky.  
So he understands what he's walking into. He fully grasps what this is all
about. And in practice, to be honest with you, with how he's played, he looks
like he's been there for a couple of years, how he's led and talked to guys.
But when you're a three‑year starter in the SEC, you immediately get that
respect. You get that respect.  
He led the country in steals, led the country two years ago. So he's a really,
really good defender.  
  
Q. It seems like every team has a Division I transfer these days. Iowa State
has really built their program around some of them. Kansas State has one. How
has that changed the way you approach recruiting, the way you approached
building a team the last few years?  
COACH FORD: That's a great question. I know a lot of teams this last summer in
July, you almost have to keep a scholarship available for the springtime. You
could almost do all your recruiting in the spring, as many good players were
out there, as we call difference makers. There's a lot of difference‑maker
players who were eligible right away that will be playing this season that
transferred.  
Now, with that said, I don't think you can change your recruiting a lot
because all the talk of changing the rules. They're going to make everybody
set out. You hear that. I don't know if it's going to come into fruition or
not. There's a lot of talk of stopping the immediate, players being to play
immediately.  
With the rules the way they are right now, to be able to get players to play
immediately, you almost want to keep a scholarship available because there was
an enormous amount of players that can help your team at any level that can
play right away. A lot of them. And we got one.  
We were in a position to get Anthony Hickey, which was a spot we needed, and
got a heck of a basketball player, got a heck of a player. So we benefited
from it. But it's going to be interesting to see how they change the rules. If
they don't change the rules and we stay the way we are, I think you'll see
recruiting change. I think you'll see everybody trying to hold onto a
scholarship, have it available, maybe even two the way it's going.  
  
Q. Travis, for the last couple of years, the identity of your program, or at
least the outside, was shaped around Smart, an All ‑American, and now you're
having to reshape the identity without that. Tell me about that.   
COACH FORD: That's good. You're exactly right. Obviously, a lot was centered
around Marcus Smart and things like that. This team, we've got more depth than
we've had. Probably more depth at this point. Hopefully, we can stay injury
free‑‑ than I've had at Oklahoma State.  
Now, do we have that preseason All‑American and all that? No, but I think
we've got great balance. This team seems to be very hungry, from what I've
seen in the first week. They read everything and all that. As I tell them,
what they say about you is where we're at. So it's‑‑ embrace it. Enjoy the
challenge of it. Don't think any different. We don't want to take the‑‑ we're
not taking any approach of, oh, we're better than this. No. These are the
facts. Let's deal with it, and let's get after it.  
They've kind of taken that little bit of a chip on the shoulder attitude to
the point, even in drills, I mean, we've‑‑ after the first couple days of
practice, we had to change some drills because we're afraid to get guys hurt,
how aggressive and physical guys have been. So I like that. That's my
mentality.  
There doesn't seem to be any egos on this basketball team. That's been fun to
work with. But, no, this team has to go out and create its own identity. No
question, the identity of our team last year was Marcus Smart, and we had guys
returning, things like that, understandably. But this team, I think, is eager
to develop its own identity.  
One thing I do like, though, is we do have four people‑‑ I think people forget
we have four very experienced players who have all been starters for basically
three years on a BCS team, whether they be in Oklahoma State or LSU. Now, we
rely on these guys. These guys are some of the best players we have.  
If we can get that out of them, then Leyton Hammonds, who got some good years,
especially late in the year, right now he's fighting for a starting spot. He's
playing very well. Jeffrey Carroll, who we had sitting out last year, can be
one of the better shooters in the country, at 6'6" and athletic.  
So we've got some pieces. They're just not proven pieces exactly yet. I like
the mentality of our basketball team right now with where we're at and all the
different things. It's what you would want out of your basketball team, the
hunger part of it and playing with a little bit of a chip on his shoulder. So
hopefully we can continue that and continue to develop that chemistry.  
Again, I think we could be special defensively. We're going to have to figure
out where all the points are going to come from. We've lost a lot of points.
It's not a concern so much as just figuring it out and getting guys in the
right spot. But we have some pieces. We've just got to put them all together
and develop them.  
Our preseason schedule with four nonconference is going to do that. It's
tough, extremely tough.

COACH DREW: I know everyone is excited about those Royals. Good to see
everyone this morning. A lot of exciting times at Baylor. You got a new
football stadium. A great football team. I know with our basketball team we're
excited with practices under way. When you lose over 50 percent of your
scoring and your rebounding, coaches are excited because that means you have a
lot of things to work on and a lot of opportunities to help new guys take a
step forward.  
With that being said, I do like the highlights a little bit better being
played right now than the last time we were in this gym and lost the
championship game in the Big 12 Tournament.  
  
Q. Jonathan Motley, what impresses you most about him, and how is he going
to help you this season?  
COACH DREW: The first thing is he's really improved his body. Charlie Melton,
our strength coach, has done a great job with him. Johnathan's worked hard in
the weight room. He is up to 237. As most coaches will tell you, that freshman
year, if you redshirt and you're able to focus on academics, adjust to college
socially, be able to understand time management, and at the same time, be able
to go against Cory Jefferson and Isaiah Austin every day in practice, that's
really going to be beneficial.  
Definitely this year he'll be able to show all the hard work he's put in.  
  
Q. Scott, you talked about the scoring that you lost. Is it more scoring by
committee, or are you looking for a couple of guys that can give you 15, 20 a
night?  
COACH DREW: I think with our team this year, the great thing is we have a lot
of versatility and a lot of depth. So I would think we'll be a team that will
be tougher to prepare for because there won't just be one or two people you
can focus and key on. I think every coach will tell you preparing for a team
that has six double figure scorers is tougher than if there's just one or two.  
I think this year's team, they compete, they work hard every day, and at the
same time, really all of them enjoy seeing their teammates score. There's not
a ball stopper or someone that really demands the ball.  
  
Q. You've got your returning players. How comforting is it that one of them
is a senior point guard like Kenny Chery?  
COACH DREW: Any time you have two great senior leaders like Kenny Chery and
Royce O'Neale, both diligent players, hardworking players. They represent the
program and the school the right way. Servant leaders. Everybody on the team
looks up to them because they care about everybody, and they're not I guys or
ego guys.  
When you have a senior point guard, like in football if you have a senior
quarterback, it just makes things move a lot better. Kenny is someone that's
become a lot more boisterous in practice. So he's done a great job of helping
the young guys on where they need to be and how they need to do things. Very
excited about his senior year.  
  
Q. A little off topic here, but obviously in college sports with what's
happened with Todd Gurley, with what's happened with Jameis Winston,
autographs have become a hot topic. You've had a number of high profile guys
go through Baylor. I'm sure you'll have some in the future. What do you tell
those guys when they're approached about autographs? You want to accommodate
the fans, but you also don't want to see stuff on eBay as well.  
COACH DREW: I think that's really your compliance office and how well they do
making sure that information gets passed on to the student‑athletes. And then
as coaches, obviously, any time there's situations that occur, we make sure
that we reinforce that with our student‑athletes. It's much better to learn
from someone else rather than your own mistake.  
So any time that we have a chance to educate our student‑athletes, we're going
to do that, and again our compliance office meets with the student‑athletes
every year at the beginning of the year, summertime, at the end of the year,
and just make sure they're reminded of all the rules.  
I think it becomes more real, in reality, when you have high profile players
such as the two you just named being questioned.  
  
Q. I think you've had about a week with them. What have you seen from the
newcomers? Are the freshmen still wide ‑eyed, or are they going to be able to
contribute this year?   
COACH DREW: I think, when you have a chance to work with guys in the
summertime, that really helps and gives them a chance to be successful come
fall when you start practices.  
So with Damien Durham and T.J. Maston that were here this summer, that makes
it easier for them come summertime. With Deng Deng‑‑ you can call him Deng or
Deng Deng ‑‑ a junior college player, and he was coming off surgery, and he
wasn't able to do much this summer because he was recovering from that. So
he's really progressed in the last month tremendously from being back out on
the floor and getting a feel for playing with the guys.  
Lester Medford, our junior college recruit, wasn't here this summer either.
He's somebody that in September was able to, through the strength and
conditioning and the individual workouts was able to get himself in shape, get
himself acclimated, get used to playing with the guys.  
To answer the question, the two junior college guys are coming along, two
freshmen. Summertime definitely helped prepare them.  
We'll know more about our team the next couple weeks when we have our
scrimmages and get a chance to see what direction and who's stepping forward
then.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 15, 2014

  

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
Q. Coach, can you let us know about the Martez Walker situation?  
COACH BARNES: He withdrew from school. He was not allowed to come back on
campus. At that point in time, also getting behind academically, he felt like
it was best for him to withdraw, and that's what he did.  
  
Q. You allow yourself to have high expectations for Myles Turner?  
COACH BARNES: I would say that we do, but I think we've got high expectations
for all of our players.  
But certainly Myles is a player that we're excited about having and a player
that we really appreciate the way that he has embraced this situation that he
walked into in terms of right from the beginning, through the recruiting
process, we felt like‑‑ and he told us this‑‑ that he wanted to be a part of
the program where he could be a part of it but not necessarily him be the
program.  
I think he would also tell you that, when he visited campus, the one thing he
felt was that he was able to be around other players that felt the same way,
that they just wanted to have a great team. They wanted to win, and they would
know that their individual goals would be met by buying into each other and
really wanting be to the best team that they could be.  
  
Q. I guess two ‑parter about Isaiah. First of all, how's he feeling? I guess
he was supposed to be here and took a little spill in practice. Second of all,
when you look at your point guard situation, how does he factor into it, and
how much has he improved from last year as a freshman playing the position?   
COACH BARNES: I can assure you, he wishes he were here now. Right at the end
of practice, we had a time set that we were going to leave, and we weren't
going to wait on them to do the things they need to do. He told everybody this
morning that he's fine.  
Where Isaiah has improved most of all is he's become more verbal. He's really
starting to understand what that position calls for. People have always
questioned the fact, can he shoot it? He can shoot it. We told him a year ago
that we need him to shoot the ball when he's open, but his idea was always to
try to get into the lane, try to penetrate, and create for his teammates.  
He does have a really need midrange floater type game. He's great around the
basket, but he is willing to shoot the ball, and he's capable. He's a guy that
we really believe, when he shoots it, it's going to go in. So he's improved
there a lot.  
His teammates will tell you that he's a player they have a lot of confidence
in because he's a confident player. He's a player that he wants to win. He's
very, very competitive. But the biggest change that I'm seeing right now is
the fact that he's become much more verbal in practice talking.  
  
Q. Last season, the basketball team had great games at home, but they would
be a different team on the road. How do you improve on your road performance
this year, especially in conference?  
COACH BARNES: First of all, our league is very, very tough. It's tough to win
at home, but it's really tough to win on the road. But what I would like to
see us do, probably more than anything, is play with the same mentality that I
think that we play at home, and I think most teams are probably a little more
aggressive in playing at home, maybe the word is relaxed.  
I want to see us be able to handle situations like, when we get down on the
road, when we're down at home. We seem to handle those situations of adversity
a little bit better at home than we did on the road. We need to get off to
better starts. We didn't do that sometimes on the road.  
We're a year older, and I would expect some of the experience that we gained a
year ago that we'll hopefully benefit from this year.  
  
Q. Seeing Jonathan Holmes and Cameron Ridley, two honorable mention all Big
12 players coming into the season. The way they complement each other and what
you expect from them down low. What do they bring to the team this year?  
COACH BARNES: John really gives us the opportunity to be a versatile team. He
can play both inside out, and arguably over the four years‑‑ and he's really
our lone senior this year‑‑ he's been as hard a worker and as committed to our
program as any player that we've coached. He really is a guy that is focused.
He's done a tremendous job of getting himself in shape. I think he's changed
his body greatly, and I think that's going to give him the opportunity to let
us be more versatile in terms of because we do have a big team, a tall team,
and a long team.  
Cam made great improvements from his freshman to his sophomore year. We need
him to do that again this year. So when you couple that with Prince Ibeh,
Connor Lammerts, and Myles Turner, it does give us a big front line. Connor
has improved a lot. Connor Lammerts might be the most improved player from a
year ago. John is the guy that we can play on the inside and outside. Some
people will question us about our shooting, and he's a player that takes care
of that because he's as good a shooter as we have. He's got deep range. When
he gets set, takes shots, he's going to shoot at a very high percentage.  
  
Q. But that needs to improve, doesn't it, the shooting?  
COACH BARNES: I think, when you look at it statistically, you would say that.
I think, when you go back, if you analyze our team from a year ago where we
have to improve, we got hurt defensively with transition defense, and that was
a direct result of not taking care of the ball and, I think, our shot
selection.  
We know we've got to improve there, and I do think we have guys that can shoot
the ball. They take good shots. I think it's hard when they take bad shots and
expect to make them. Isaiah has the ability to score in some traffic and so
some of those type things. I think we can shoot the ball. That really is not‑‑
I'm not concerned about it. My biggest concern, again, is understanding good
shot selection and protecting the ball from the offensive side.  
  
Q. Coach, just kind of wondering. The Big 12 traditionally hasn't been known
as a league that's big, strong front lines, post players. I'm just kind of
wondering, looking at your breakdown this year and obviously add Myles to what
you already have, is it tough adjusting to playing in this league when you
have a strong front line, or is it a matter of trying to make teams adjust to
you? What's it like playing as one of the big, strong power post teams in this
league?  
COACH BARNES: Again, that's a good question because we know a lot of teams
have gone more to the spread game with a step out forward, which we do that as
well. We do that. I think the key is defensively. I think where we've‑‑ the
second part about analyzing our team where we have to improve is our ball
screen defense. Not just the rotations that we have to get better with, but
it's our post players stepping out and helping our guards, giving them the
chance to get back in front of the ball.  
So I think defensively, that's where a player that's accustomed to playing
down low has to be able to step out and help. Cam Ridley, Prince Ibeh, John
Holmes, and Connor Lammerts have the ability to obviously do that because they
play out there.  
I think that's one of the biggest things Myles is learning right now, how he's
got to go from one play to the next play. I'm watching that happen with him,
and I'm watching him get better every day with it.  
So, yeah, we want to play inside out. We do. We want to put it in there, and
when you do that, you hope to get fouled. You hope to get to people's benches.
On the other hand too, you've got to make free throws, which we did a better
job of that a year ago. We have to continue to improve there because we
definitely want to get fouled and get to people's benches.  
  
Q. [No microphone] obviously, had a great freshman year. What has he been
working on this off ‑season?   
COACH BARNES: Well, physically, you would expect all of our players to
continue to get better, and he is. He's a player that he works. He does. He's
gotten better physically, but the biggest thing is that we, as a coaching
staff, we continue to talk to him about shooting the ball when he's open.
That's a big key because we want him to shoot the ball because we know that he
can.  
Again, he's a player that his whole life he's been able to get the ball pretty
much where he wants it, and he does have really a good midrange game. I think
he's terrific across the baseline. When he's open on the perimeter, when we're
screening the ball or whatever it may be, he's got to take open shots, and he
will.  
He has worked hard with his footwork, being ready to do that, and the other
thing that I think where he's worked hard is trying to be more verbal.  
Really trying to understand not only what he has to do but what his teammates
have to do all the time.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Iowa State  74  
Baylor - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the champions of the Big 12 Conference, Iowa
State Head Coach Fred Hoiberg and student‑athletes Melvin Ejim, Georges Niang
and DeAndre Kane. Coach, congratulations on the victory.  
COACH HOIBERG: Just a gutty, gutty performance by our guys. After that start
wasn't looking real promising out there. Didn't score until the first media
timeout. I think started 0 for 13 and 1 for 17. And to find a way to shoot
50percent for the game, it was a testament to these guys and how we didn't
lose our composure.  
I thought we stayed in it with our defense, even though we weren't making
shots that never got out of hand. Baylor's been doing that for the last three
days, jumping out to big leads on teams just because that zone is tough to
crack.  
But once we got it in there and continued to try to get the ball in spots
where we could take advantage of it, we started making those shots, and it was
fun to see. And, again, great job by our guys playing very well and poised
down the stretch.  
  
Q. Melvin, can you just talk a little bit about what Coach was addressing
there, 0 for 13, starting from the floor but yet y'all just kept coming and
finally it started clicking there on the 3 to give you guys the lead?  
MELVIN EJIM: We started off the game, we were getting looks we wanted and we
just really weren't converting.  
Coach made sure to tell us just to calm down, that these were looks we were
going to get. Coming out of the half he just said keep your composure and keep
taking those shots and they're going to start to fall. And Naz started hitting
some, Dre hit some, Georges came in and knocked some down and we were starting
rolling. It was all about keeping our composure down the stretch. We knew that
we were going to make a run just like they made a run and it was just a matter
of time until shots started falling and we were going to jump out on them.  
  
Q. DeAndre, what were your emotions coming to Iowa State? Obviously it was a
new start. But could you possibly have dreamed it was going to end this way,
Newcomer of the Year, MVP of the tournament?  
DEANDRE KANE: Not what I expected, getting MVP and Newcomer of the Year. But
when Coach gave me a second chance, he brought me in, sat me down, and he
believed in me and these guys believed in me. I sent Georges a text message
and told him I just want to win. We bought into Coach's ‑‑ you know, what he
wanted to do all year. We played together. We trust one another. We fight with
each other. We're brothers. We love playing with each other. You see it on the
court, even though we get down. We've been getting down in leads like that all
year, but we trust one another, we keep fighting and we always find a way to
get it done.  
  
Q. Georges, could you talk a little bit about ‑‑ it seems like things turned
for y'all midway through the second half when they started giving you the ball
in the high post there and you were able to turn, face the basket and make
some decisions there. What in your mind was the difference in y'all's getting
through their zone?  
GEORGES NIANG: Realistically, I think it was getting in the middle, like you
said. But Naz Long really just opened it up. When they had to worry about
where he was at that opened up a lot of things in the middle for Melvin,
Dustin, for me to get even better looks and one‑on‑one chances with Austin.  
No, I give a lot of credit to Naz Long, him knocking down those shots were
huge for us. And Melvin hitting the two 3s off the design play was huge for
us. So I think hitting some outside shots was really the key to open up the
inside of the paint for us.  
  
Q. Georges and Melvin, other teams in this tournament didn't want to
challenge Austin in the middle. Looked like they fell back and you guys did
not. Was that something y'all talked about going into this game?  
GEORGES NIANG: Coach told us in the locker room, we're going to try to punch
them in the face first. We got off to a slow start, but I think we were
getting good looks, they just weren't falling in. He kept telling us in the
locker room keep going to at them, keep going at them. That's what we did and
they eventually cracked. They're a very talented team, though, so we're real
happy with this win.  
COACH HOIBERG: That was a figure of speech, by the way (laughter).  
MELVIN EJIM: We knew, even though they were long and athletic, if we could
battle them on the inside, we can get rebounds on them and we can attack them
if we went up strong and finished strong. And in the first half, we really
didn't do that well, but in the second half we made it a point to attack them
and we were able to get some easy buckets inside. And Georges was able to get
some nice steals down there and really convert. Dustin went in there, made a
couple of big plays. So we just, like you said, didn't try to shy away and
tried to attack them straight on.  
  
Q. I don't know if you all saw, but there were fans in the stands who had
Band ‑Aids on their head. Do you all want that to be a thing going forward?   
GEORGES NIANG: No, no. I shot 5 for 15. The Band‑Aid is obviously not good
luck (laughter).  
DEANDRE KANE: Whatever Georges say, so...  
MELVIN EJIM: Cool with me.  
  
Q. It may be safe to say that there were more people wearing cardinal and
gold here than when Hilton is full, how did that impact the game for you
guys?  
COACH HOIBERG: It had a tremendous impact on the game. It's so special to
share this moment with our fans and the State of Iowa. It's all about the
college sports. We don't have NFL. We don't have NBA. We don't have Major
League Baseball. There's such a passion for college athletics in our state and
especially for Iowa State.  
These fans have such a great following, with all of our sports. And just in
reading some messages last night, you just knew all the people that were going
to come down and see us compete for this championship.  
And it wasn't looking great, I've gotta be honest with you, early in that
game. But once we took that seal off the rim when Naz hit that 3, we slowly
chipped away, and our fans had so much to do with that.  
When you've got a fan base like that, it had to be at least 16,000 of the
18,000 cheering and pulling for you. That helps you, that helps you when
things aren't going well. And that was definitely a huge factor, I think, in
the game, was just the support that we had from our fans.  
  
Q. Fred, after the game you looked like you did a little bit of a lap there
pumping your fist, can you describe that experience a little bit and what was
going through your mind?  
COACH HOIBERG: The fist pump was such an emotional feeling for me, just‑‑ I
really thought about Coach Orr. I know he's been watching over us this year
and this one's for him. Just the fist pump was in honor of Coach.  
And also to thank the fans as well. Just wanted to get around and let them all
know how much we appreciated everything they brought to Kansas City. It truly
was Hilton South today. And just again a special moment, but also a very
emotional moment for me.  
  
Q. Heslip hit a 3 from the sideline there, put them up 2 and then Naz comes
down. Was that one of the deeper 3s he's made this year?  
COACH HOIBERG: Yeah, it's one of those Canada things, I think. Whatever you
can do, I can do better. It was obviously a very timely shot to hit that.  
I think in the game down there, Baylor, Heslip hit one similar and we came
down and missed one. Then they came down and Chery hit a couple of shots to
push it to seven. That was as big a shot as we had all game to put us back on
top and we didn't relinquish the lead the rest of the game.  
Just, again, guys sticking with it. To shoot almost 70percent against that
zone is huge for us. It's something we may see in the tournament. We played
three different styles against three great teams in this tournament. And that
will certainly help us moving forward.  
  
Q. This offense, when it's rolling, Fred, is it Georges up top creating and
then everything else just has to go from there when it's at its best?  
COACH HOIBERG: A lot of it is, yes. Georges and DeAndre are the two guys that
really facilitate our offense for us, and then other guys play off them so
well.  
And when we have proper spacing, we're able to take advantage of those guys,
because they force so much help. Melvin had some great drives to the basket
yesterday because his man had to sink in and help off Georges. Then Naz hit 3s
when those guys sink in and help. Both of those guys have great vision,
DeAndre and Georges, and they're both very unselfish. When you have two
playmakers, one your point guard and one really your 5 man, it makes it pretty
tough to prepare for.  
  
Q. The second half you guys were able to get some run ‑outs that weren't
there in the first half. Baylor didn't think it was because their energy level
dropped, did you see it the same way?  
COACH HOIBERG: I don't think it was either. We were just able to force a
couple of turnovers and it got us out going. Dustin had a Kevin Love‑type
outlet pass there to get DeAndre in stride on a basket. He also had an outlet
pass that he threw right to Chery. So it was just a couple of plays by our
guys to get out. We didn't want to play half court offense against that zone
all game.  
And by getting out and getting stops, more importantly getting rebounds, I
told them if we outrebounded them we would win. I'm glad that held true
because that's how important that stat is. We outrebounded the number one
offensive rebounding team in the nation by 10. I think that was the stat of
the game.  
  
Q. Most of the teams that start missing 15 of the first 16 are going to find
themselves in a pretty big hole. How big was it you guys were only down ‑‑ you
kept the distance pretty small there, right?  
COACH HOIBERG: It was huge. I can't stress it enough. I gotta quit saying
huge. Somebody said I say that too much. It was very important, I guess I'll
say. (Laughter).  
Our defense was really, really good tonight. I thought that second half
against Kansas we really defended them, and then that carried over today. They
shot ‑‑ really look at us, we shoot 32percent at halftime. We're lucky to
shoot that. But we held them to 34, and that's why we weren't in too big of a
hole.  
  
Q. What does this do for seeding tomorrow and then playing actual games into
next week?  
COACH HOIBERG: That's a great question, Travis. I can't begin to figure out
how they do all that with all the numbers and the strength of schedules, the
BPI, RPI, Kenpom. So many numbers out there. Who knows. I know we helped
ourselves obviously this week. And we'll see what happens. But wherever we go,
I know we'll be excited.  
We've got to‑‑ again, we'll enjoy it tonight, but we've got to get back to
work. We'll put this one behind us and hopefully give ourselves an opportunity
to have a nice run here in the upcoming weeks.  
  
Q. Speaking of the numbers, number one rated conference in a lot of
different ways. You guys win the tournament against many of those top teams.
It's not going to end up with the top seed in the tournament. Does it just
speak to the confusion maybe that some of those numbers lend themselves to?  
COACH HOIBERG: I don't even know what the hell you're talking about,
so...(laughter). So, again, there's so many different numbers, and you don't
know which one has the most merit or which one they put the most weight into.
But, again, you just gotta go out there and obviously try to win as many games
as possible and do it against the best quality teams.  
And to do‑‑ I think we were undefeated in neutral site games. We went into BYU
had a huge road win. And then you beat the Big Ten champs, nice win against
Iowa. Then have a great conference tournament against, I think, Kansas is
number one or two RPI team, and two other are very high quality opponents that
are I think top 30 in whatever RPI, I think. So it's good.  
It's something that we did to help ourselves moving forward, and hopefully we
can take advantage of that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Iowa State  74  
Baylor - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor Coach Scott Drew and student‑athletes
Kenny Chery and Brady Heslip. Coach?  
COACH DREW: I was really proud of our fight and our effort. I thought the
second half Iowa State, we didn't guard them as nearly as well we did the
first half. But let's credit them for‑‑ guarded or not, it's hard to shoot
70percent from 2, 100percent from 3, and 92 from the line. So they deserve the
win. Coach Hoiberg has done a great job. They've got a great team. And as I
told them before the game, hopefully I see them at the Final Four the next
time. So that's what we'll both work for.  
  
Q. How much did fatigue play a part in what happened in the last four or
five minutes out there?  
BRADY HESLIP: I don't really think it was fatigue. We're not going to make any
excuses. I mean, we fought hard to the end. But they made some really big
plays in the last three minutes and we weren't able to match them. But credit
to them. But we weren't tired. They just made some very tough plays and made
some tough shots.  
KENNY CHERY: Just like Brady said. We weren't fatigued. They just executed
what their coach told them. And credit them, they executed well and they
scored.  
  
Q. Brady, you mentioned the tough plays they made. You hit a 3 there almost
out of bounds and then Long comes down hits a 25 footer. Is that one of the
shots you were talking about, he was able to answer, you go up 2 and he gives
them a shot to go up 1?  
BRADY HESLIP: That was a big shot. We're scrambling around on defense, but
sometimes if guys are making shots from that far out it's pretty difficult to
guard. So that was a great shot.  
  
Q. Was the crowd any effect whatsoever? This was obviously a pro ‑Iowa State
crowd.   
KENNY CHERY: I feel like the crowd doesn't affect anything. Probably the
referees, but it doesn't affect what we did.  
COACH DREW: I didn't say that, by the way, he did.  
KENNY CHERY: It doesn't affect what we do as a basketball team. We stayed
together and we fought hard.  
  
Q. Brady, you guys as a team had four 3 ‑pointers in the early going
finished with eight overall. What did Iowa State do after that initial run
that helped them kind of contain you from the perimeter, so to speak?  
BRADY HESLIP: Well, I mean, we just‑‑ we have smart players. So we were just
reading what was there. And then after the first ten minutes at the first
half, we started trying to exploit them on the inside with our bigs because
they can make tough shots and they can make great passes because we know Iowa
State doubles the post. So, I mean, we were just mixing everything up to keep
them off balance. It wasn't that we just stopped shooting them.  
  
Q. How much do you think a game like tonight could possibly help you next
week once tournament play starts?  
KENNY CHERY: It's going to help us a lot. We're going to learn from it. We're
going to go back to what we've been doing, working hard, and moving forward.
Just thinking about the next one.  
  
Q. Brady, did you feel like it was defensive lapses in the second half or
was it more their execution?  
BRADY HESLIP: I think it was a little bit of both. From the last time we
played them on Senior Night until now, the players have been doing different
things. So we have to adjust how we guard them. So I think that just we didn't
get as long to prepare for them. And just credit them, they also made tough
shots. But we're doing our best.  
  
Q. Brady, you heard coach say at the beginning of the press conference he
hopes to see Iowa State at the Final Four. Do you think the team is hot? Do
you still think you can make a run, go deep into the NCAAs?  
BRADY HESLIP: Yeah, no question. That's our plan. That was the plan at the
beginning of the year and it doesn't change. We don't get to cut these nets
down, but we're going to cut some down in Dallas.  
  
Q. How would you both feel Baylor being labeled as one of the most dangerous
teams in the NCAA tournament?  
KENNY CHERY: It doesn't matter to us, we're just going to keep doing what
we've been doing, which is keep pushing, working hard, and we're not going to
let down. We've been through a lot this year, we lost five straight, we never
looked back to what happened. And look at the position we are in today. We get
to play in an NCAA tournament.  
BRADY HESLIP: I think we've been confident in ourselves all year. So we've had
ups and downs. We've been through it all. We've been through more than
probably any other team in our position has been and we wanted to win this
championship. But that's not going to affect how we approach the NCAA
tournament. We're still going to be the same team that we are.  
  
Q. We asked them already about the fatigue. You guys were trying to win four
games in four days, never been done in the Big 12 tournament. Did fatigue have
anything to do with that?  
COACH DREW: I think it was more what Iowa State did, they hit big shots, made
big plays down the stretch. I mean, if they don't hit those big shots, then
maybe it's a different story.  
So we definitely had enough energy to compete and win the game. Credit them
for winning it.  
  
Q. Kind of along those lines, that did not look like you all ran out of gas
in any way, shape or form. Do you feel good about that going forward? Is what
you all did accomplish here, it just comes down to just a couple of defensive
lapses as you go forward?  
COACH DREW: Yes, definitely feel good with how we're playing, how we're
competing with the team that we have, that we can compete with anybody.  
At the same time, sometimes you're more disappointed the closer you get to
winning the championship. But our goal all year long, the main goal is the
NCAA tournament. And we have that in front of us.  
So we don't have time to look back on this game at all and we need to focus,
get better, get ready for the NCAA tournament. But the worst thing we could do
is dwell on this game and let that affect us for the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. In the second half, Iowa State was able to get a couple of run ‑outs
where they weren't in the first half. If it wasn't fatigue, what broke down
there?  
COACH DREW: Well, it was turnovers. So we took some bad shots, because the
shot clock went down late. So credit them for good defense. We turned the ball
over. But I mean, Iowa State, one of the most dangerous teams in the country
in transition.  
And I mean you can't let Kane get out there and go, because when he does, he's
going to finish with 17, 7 and 7. Normally he finishes with more against us,
so I'm glad he only has one year in the league, by the way.  
  
Q. Is too much being asked of the starters right now? I know when Rico, Gary
and TP, their normal rotation comes in, I'm not sure how much you're expecting
them to really score, but is too much being asked of the starters right now?  
COACH DREW: No, I think our rotation's been good. I think our bench has given
us a good lift, good energy. Today we shortened it a little bit more just
because they had so many perimeter guys out there. But we feel good with them,
with our starters, with our bench. This is a good team. It's a fun team to be
around. That's why they've been able to stay together through adversity and
we're excited to find out where we're playing tomorrow.  
  
Q. You're all zone defense to start with really had them messed up. They
missed 15 of their first 16 shots, but you could only get out to a 10 ‑point
lead. How big was that to maybe get a bigger advantage early?  
COACH DREW: I thought we gave up some opportunities where we could have
extended the lead, got a bigger lead like against Oklahoma and Texas, we had
bigger leads. So when they made runs, we were still okay. And, unfortunately,
we didn't get a big enough lead with‑‑ with Iowa State, as quick as they
score, I mean, there is no safe lead. And that's why, again, the Big 12 is
such a great conference. You can be up 10 or down 10, it doesn't matter.
There's great players and they can score in great bunches.  
  
Q. Also, the fact a lot of people think the Iowa State can make a run in the
Final Four, the fact you played them down to the last three minutes, does that
enhance your guys' confidence and your confidence in your team's ability to
make a run?  
COACH DREW: I thought coming into this tournament, every year I've been here,
this is the most‑‑ I mean, you had in my mind more teams that could have won
this tournament than ever before. And I think you have more teams that can go
to the Final Four from the Big 12 than ever before.  
  
Q. I don't think we've seen Cory struggle in a game all year long like we
saw today. What did they do today defensively that limited him?  
COACH DREW: I thought their double team was effective. They did a good job
getting the ball out of his hands. And I know we had looks that we missed,
too. And just like at the beginning of the game, I think Iowa State missed
some pretty good looks.  
And that's what's tough about coaching, you might have good defense and a guy
hits a 25‑foot shot and you have a guy wide open and he misses it.  
So you want to be there and contest as much as you can. And I think with Cory,
they made a lot of the shots difficult and he never could get in a rhythm.
Then, when he did have a couple of good looks, they weren't falling.  
  
Q. After this kind of grind, and I know the tournament's coming up, but do
you try to give them a day or two off?  
COACH DREW: I need a day off (laughter). Definitely get some rest.  
  
Q. How do you do that in the next week?  
COACH DREW: Depends on what day we play, when we leave, but definitely they've
deserved a day off. And that's the only‑‑ the best thing about the Big 12
tournament, it prepares you for the NCAA tournament.  
And the only downside would be if you, like us, if you play an earlier game,
if we would play on Friday, we'd prefer that. If you want to get that done
with the Selection Committee, us and Iowa State.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Iowa State  94  
Kansas - 83

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by Iowa State, Coach Fred Hoiberg,
student‑athletes Melvin Ejim, Georges Niang and DeAndre Kane. Coach?  
COACH HOIBERG: Couldn't be more proud of these guys, how they came out of the
gate after a very tough physical game yesterday against Kansas State.
Everybody that stepped on the floor made a big contribution today.  
You look at these three guys, what they did, and you look at a guy like Daniel
Edozie who hasn't had a lot of minutes for us, came off the bench and was
huge. He was able to spell our guys. We had a couple of guys cramping up over
there on the side. But for those guys coming in there giving us those nice
spot minutes to give these guys some rest was very important, as important as
anything that happened today.  
Defensively, in the second half, we made adjustments. They were hurting us in
the paint with Perry in the first half. We tried to be there on the catch with
our double teams. We were much better in that area and our rotations were very
crisp and we were able to slow them down a little bit.  
I thought offensively we were really good all night with spacing, played a lot
of two‑man games and we were able to knock down shots. Just a great win for
our guys, really proud of them, big opportunity in front of us tomorrow.  
  
Q. Melvin and Georges, obviously all three of you up there played well. How
important is it for that to happen going forward and how much different is
this team when it gets the contributions from you three?  
GEORGES NIANG: I think we're very good going forward when all three of us make
great contributions. But I don't want to take anything away from our guys
coming off the bench, especially Daniel. He did a great job holding his own
down there, getting big rebounds and that big and‑1 was huge for us.  
We love competing for championships. Coach says take it one day at a time. The
Big 12 championship is in front of us and that's what we're looking forward
for.  
MELVIN EJIM: I think every day we play, we bring it. The chance of us three
playing well is increasing and when guys that come off the bench, like Dustin,
are playing well, Monte is playing, Daniel comes off and gives us some vital
minutes, it shows how versatile this team is, how many weapons we have and how
hard we're to beat when we're all clicking. We're doing a real good job and
we're really rolling right now, and I think that it's just going to continue
to go in that direction.  
  
Q. Georges, how is the face? Looked pretty bad going off the floor?  
GEORGES NIANG: Do I look better now? That was coach was telling me, I look a
little better now.  
  
Q. A little bit. Overall, in the first half, you guys gave up the 16 ‑0 run,
but you just didn't look rattled. How much of that was that a conversation
with you guys on the floor and how much of that is an extension of what Fred
teaches you all?  
GEORGES NIANG: Coach preaches how are you going to act when adversity hits
you? Are you going to give up? Are you going to point the finger? Are you
going to point the finger at yourself? How are you going to act? He asks us
that question all the time, and I feel like we came here for a reason. We
didn't want to go down with a fight, so we just kept fighting, clawing,
pulling, and we eventually got it on the two, even though I missed a bunny out
there to tie it.  
Then we went in and we felt like we had these guys in the second half. We came
out and made the first punch and from there it was clear skies.  
  
Q. Melvin and Georges, how different is KU without Embiid out there? It
seemed like you guys were really having your will right at the rim most of the
second half. How different are they when he's not playing?  
GEORGES NIANG: He's a very good shot blocker. He's a rim protector for them,
and it's unfortunate they didn't have him. But don't take anything away from
this Kansas team. They're extremely talented. They have a bunch of guys they
can go to. So it was a little bit easier getting to the rim, but they're still
a very talented team.  
MELVIN EJIM: I think their depth on the post, you know, they have three or
four guys they're rotating in and out. So they played extremely well today,
and I don't think you should take anything away from them and for us.  
  
Q. Georges and DeAndre, Bill Self had expected there to be basically a pro
‑KU crowd every time that they played in this building. Do you feel like what
Coach preached about how you're going to act helped you to stay composed
tonight? And did you feel like it was mostly a pro‑KU crowd out there?  
GEORGES NIANG: I think our fans travel really well. They're just as loud out
there, but Coach is always telling us you've just gotta play the next play. So
I think that's what we did when they hit us with that 16‑0 run. And we just,
like I said, kept fighting and clawing and battled our way back into the game.  
DEANDRE KANE: Same thing Georges said. Coach preached at the beginning of the
game that teams are going to go on runs and adversity is going to hit. How are
you going to respond? And you just gotta keep playing. You've got to play 40
minutes. Can't play 38‑, 36‑minute games. You gotta play 40 minutes, play it
all out. Their fans were pretty loud, but our fans were pretty loud, too. And
we just went out there and played hard.  
  
Q. DeAndre, how much different is the game for you in terms of pressure when
Melvin and Georges are contributing and other guys are hitting shots the way
they were tonight?  
DEANDRE KANE: It takes a lot of pressure off me, especially when we've got
Monte Morris in the game, he can handle the ball. And Georges brings up the
ball and so does Mel. It makes it easier for me. But this was the type of
offense we've got. We like the run and gun, we like to get up and down the
court. Anybody can bring it up.  
You see when Georges brings it up, he can run ice at the top of the key. But
it takes a lot of pressure off me knowing these guys can contribute, too, by
bringing the ball up.  
  
Q. Georges, KU got into foul trouble the first half. No matter who they
played against you, your game worked against anybody. What is it about your
game that just translates, doesn't matter who the defender is?  
GEORGES NIANG: I give all the credit to Coach Hoiberg. He puts me in great
situations to use my advantages, and that's my body and my moves. So he puts
me in great positions.  
And my teammates, they do a good job of spacing the floor and let me go to
work. And when we have a double team, they're wide open to knock down shots.
So credit goes to my team and Coach Hoiberg; they just do a great job of
putting me in good position.  
  
Q. Wonder if you could describe the meaning of getting to this title game by
way of going through Kansas and sort of the colorful time you've had with them
over the years.  
COACH HOIBERG: I mean, we've had some unbelievable matchups the past couple of
years, able to beat them a couple of years at our place. And the absolute two
hardest games I've ever had as far as losses go. McLemore banks in the 3. And
then losing the one at home, a tough call there at the end.  
Didn't play very well at home against them this year. Thought we played very
well at Kansas. They just were great. I don't think anybody would have beat
them that game with Embiid and what he was doing. And Perry Ellis had a great
game, and Naadir was a difference‑maker and Wiggins was awesome.  
It's a great team. It's a great win for us for the fact that it gives us
confidence that we can compete with anybody in the nation. It was good to
finally get one of these at the end after struggling to close out games
against Kansas here these past few years.  
Bill Self, I think, is as good as there is in this business. He does such an
unbelievable job. It ain't easy, regardless of the talent, to replace five
starters. What he's done with that team, to put them in contention for a 1
seed is a great credit to he and his staff.  
He's just done an amazing job, but for us to win this game, it's great for our
team, and even better for our fans that made this trip down here, doubled the
amount of tickets we had a year ago. So to win this one for them was very
important and a great feeling.  
  
Q. How difficult is it for you to execute offensively and defensively when
one of those guys or two of those guys are struggling?  
COACH HOIBERG: You know what, so much of it depends on the night, who we feel
we have a matchup that we can take advantage of.  
We miss a lot of easy ones in that first half. We were getting to the rim and
a lot of that has to do with Kansas. They've got great length in there. They
protect the rim as well as any team in the nation, their two‑point field goal
percentage. But we were getting there. In the second half, we started
finishing.  
Georges, we felt, was the guy that could go out and make plays for us. And he
did that. Had a few turnovers he'd probably like to have back, but he must
have scored six or seven straight possessions there to create some separation
for us.  
So, again, it just depends on the day. DeAndre made some really great plays
without getting to the rim and obviously shot the ball extremely well. And
Monte Morris, again second consecutive game where he made big plays down the
stretch for a freshman in his first conference tournament.  
  
Q. I know there's a lot of factors, but you guys shot 54percent tonight
after, I think, 39percent the first two games against them. How different is
the way that you attack and the way that you plan to attack them without
Embiid in there?  
COACH HOIBERG: Well, he's certainly a difference‑maker on that defensive end
at the rim. They're so good at trying to get in there and score at the basket.  
I think we only had 12 in the first half in the paint, 24‑12\. We close that
gap to 44‑38\. So we were able to probably attack a little bit more tonight
than we were the first two nights.  
Georges had a really tough shooting game, his first one. Made those shots in
the second one in Lawrence. And then again was unbelievable today. Those plays
he made, those aren't easy shots. He makes them look easy, but it's a credit
to Georges with what he's done with his footwork. He's in much better shape
this year, to be able to finish off that game for us was huge and he did a lot
of that yesterday as well against Kansas State.  
  
Q. When was the last time you had a T, because I don't think you haven't had
one this year?  
COACH HOIBERG: Kentucky, two years ago in the NCAA tournament. Those are the
only two I've had in my life, including as a player.  
  
Q. And what really makes you mad, because even the one tonight looked like
you got caught in a TV timeout?  
COACH HOIBERG: I wasn't going out on the floor to dispute the call. It was a
media timeout. And I went out there and I used a bad word. I'm not going to
sit here and pretend I didn't. And I put a little bit of that run that they
had on me, because I thought we got a little unnerved. We just got a little
bit rattled when I got that.  
I told them next time out, I apologized to them. Guys, everybody take a deep
breath. Let's get our composure back, and we did. We closed the half out very
well. What did they get up by, ten maybe. We were able to cut it by two, which
was manageable at the half.  
I thought our energy out of the gates in the second half was really good, able
to take a lead and never give it up.  
  
Q. What is it in the second half that you did so well to shut down Perry
Ellis after that explosive first half?  
COACH HOIBERG: That was the big thing that we talked about. We were probably a
little too complicated with a one‑day prep, with our schemes as far as when we
were going to double when we weren't. The second half we just decided to go
anytime he caught the ball. What was he? 9 for 10 in the first half, only got
up a couple shots in the second.  
We had it rolling. Shoot, he had 28 on us last year in this exact same game.
But we did much better job with our double teams in that second half, and
rotations were very good, closing out their shooters.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Perry Ellis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25064)

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Iowa State  94  
Kansas - 83

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Kansas, Coach Bill Self, student‑athletes Tarik
Black and Perry Ellis. Coach?  
COACH SELF: Well, obviously I thought Iowa State‑‑ I don't know if they
controlled the game from start to finish, but‑‑ because we had a pretty nice
run there midway through the first half. But they played very, very well. They
were terrific offensively. We never got in any rhythm defensively at all.  
And they were comfortable. And, of course, the first half their big three were
really, really good. In the second half they were all good. But obviously they
played through Georges there in the crunch part of the game, and he delivered
for them.  
So it was disappointing that we didn't play better on the defensive end, but
certainly they deserved to beat us and we deserved exactly what we got.  
  
Q. Perry, can you just talk about the second half, and the difficulty maybe
getting touches and getting shots off after a good first half. What did they
maybe do differently?  
PERRY ELLIS: I definitely could tell they clogged the lane a lot more off
their shooters. We definitely had to drive more. That was the key thing. They
really just clogged the lane a lot more.  
  
Q. Perry, do you feel like Iowa State played more aggressive defense this
time than the two times that you played them during the regular season?  
PERRY ELLIS: I'm not sure I would say that. I just felt like we were on our
heels defensively throughout the game. I felt in the first half we did a lot
better than the second half. We left too many straight line drives to the
basket, I felt, in the second half.  
  
Q. Perry, Iowa State thought their spacing was pretty good offensively. Did
what they did on the floor affect what you guys were trying to do? Did it
space you guys out, you felt?  
PERRY ELLIS: They definitely spaced the floor well, but I felt like it's on us
to have the energy and the mindset. And Coach always tells us to have the
pride to defend that.  
  
Q. Tarik, do you feel there's added pressure for you on the defensive end
because Joel is not playing?  
TARIK BLACK: He's a big piece of our program, so everybody on the team has to
make up for his absence. We have to rotate on defense as a team because we're
missing our shot blockers on the floor, on the ground defense has to be
better.  
And on the offensive end, we have to play with one another and the offense has
to move smoother without him on the floor. So the whole team takes up their
pressure.  
  
Q. You mentioned your defense rhythm, you could never get into it, was that
because they were doing a multitude of different things with the 3s and the
way they were passing the ball?  
COACH SELF: I don't think they did a multitude of different things. I think
whenever‑‑ I think they made seven of their first nine 3s, if I'm not
mistaken, and we're still ahead.  
So I felt like, good gosh, if we could just get them to miss, we could be in
decent shape. And we‑‑ although they didn't attack us the same way, we did a
better job defending the arc the second half. But what they did, they played
through their bigs and drove it.  
I think the question about spacing was a good one, because it's hard, when
you're guarding five guys that can all shoot 3s out there all the time for the
most part.  
And our ball screen defense was bad in large part because I think that we
didn't trust it enough to get back to shooters if we guard it the way we
wanted to. And I thought that we just were on our heels.  
When we got stops the second half, it almost felt like because they missed, it
wasn't because we did anything to make them miss.  
But I know there's a question earlier about offense. You score 83 points,
you're supposed to win. It wasn't anything offensively. It was all on the
other end.  
  
Q. You've talked most of the season about wanting, needing to get better
defensively. Them shooting 54percent and scoring 94 points, whatever, how much
of that is what you've been talking about all year and how much Embiid being
out?  
COACH SELF: I think a lot of it's that Iowa State was really good. I think
sometimes you start to think we could have been great defensively and they
could have shot 50percent or 47percent against us.  
And when you shoot 3s like they did early in the game, you know, a lot of
times that's not an awful play for most teams to make them do that. And, of
course, with them it is a bad play.  
But we played them up there in Ames the first time, they were 4‑26 from 3. And
I'm sure they made the same shots tonight they missed up there.  
Who knows if they'll shoot it again this well tomorrow, but tonight they were
terrific. But a lot of it is from a standpoint, Joel not being in there could
probably guard Niang better. He probably could. But I think it was more of a
collection of everybody rather than just one individual.  
  
Q. After such an intense game like this one and last night, is the NCAA
tournament almost going to seem like a breather?  
COACH SELF: Probably not. Probably not a breather. But I will say this: I
don't know how‑‑ I mean, I think I know our guys pretty well. I thought we
played tired. And the thing about it is when you have two teams that are
equally tired, the better offensive teams usually win. And that was the case
tonight.  
If you're really, really turned up and it takes energy and that kind of stuff,
you usually play at a higher level defensively. But a lot of times offensively
that energy doesn't do a lot for you to help you more because a lot of times
the game slows down for you where you're better offensively. So I think it
probably hurt us more from an energy standpoint defensively than probably what
it hurt them offensively. And their defense was good, but the thing about not
having Joel in the game, you don't have to guard the other big. So the other
big stayed in the lane and never left, and so it made it harder to maybe get
angles on the post.  
  
Q. Bill, you mentioned that offense wasn't the problem, it's the other end.
How concerned are you about this defense going into the NCAA tournament?  
COACH SELF: We're not going to play‑‑ I'm not going to say there's not other
teams in the country that aren't potentially as good as Iowa State
offensively. But we're not going to play a team, more than likely, in the
tournament that's better than Iowa State was tonight offensively. But sure I'm
concerned. I'm concerned about a lot of things. I don't know of any coach that
wouldn't be concerned about different things with their ball club. That's an
area that obviously we've been inconsistent because our defense last night was
exceptional.  
And tonight it wasn't as good, and the matchup was harder for us tonight. We
historically play better defense when you play against two bigs, and tonight
we played against zero. And that makes it hard for us to guard.  
  
Q. In terms of seeding coming up in the tournament, the way it works now
with the geographic location, would it be better to be the high 2 instead of
the last 1?  
COACH SELF: We're not going to be a 1. So I'm going to tell you, it's
definitely better since we're not going to be a 1. So we played a really good
schedule and that kind of stuff and who knows if we'll be a 2. I mean, who
knows how the other games will play out. And we're not going to be
disappointed with whatever happens.  
But certainly I don't know if there's any magical thing right now that we'll
definitely be this in this region or anything like that. Because right now I
really don't know. I think a lot depends on what happens in the other league
tournaments.  
  
Q. Because you mentioned that the team tends to match up better against
teams with two bigs, are there any other teams around the country with two
bigs that you feel like you could match up well if you draw them in the
tournament?  
COACH SELF: Well, there's been several teams in our league, so absolutely. But
I don't go around studying every team and this and that. There's not very many
teams in the country whose 5 man is taking 130 3s on the season, and there's
not very many teams in the country whose 4 man has taken 90 or 100 or whatever
it is. So that's the thing that‑‑ and Kane was unbelievable. He's taken 90 3s
on the season or whatever and he's 5 of 6 tonight.  
So they were a team that was red hot tonight. There's no question about that.
And they're capable of beating anybody in the country on a night in which they
play well. And they certainly played very, very well tonight, especially the
second half.  
  
Q. With Niang tonight, especially the second half when they were going
through him on the post, what is it about his game that no matter who you were
trying to stop or used to stop him, what is it about his game on the low block
that just makes him almost unguardable at times?  
COACH SELF: It's not him on the low block, it's him driving to the low block.
He scores the majority of his points by being crafty.  
He's not the quickest guy, but he's probably as hard to guard as anybody
because he can play at different speeds and he's shifty and he can get you
leaning one way and come back the other. He's very good at spinning, as you
guys know. So what I thought he did a great job of was to catch it beyond the
arc and put his head down and drive, and then however we guard him after that,
he countered it. He's really good. He's a fun player to watch play unless he's
kicking your butt like he did tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  86  
Texas - 69

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by the University of Texas, Coach Rick Barnes
and student‑athletes Jonathan Holmes and Isaiah Taylor.  
COACH BARNES: Disappointed that we go from playing one of our best defensive
games to tonight not doing. You've really got to give Baylor a lot of credit
in the fact that they executed offensively. And then on our offensive end, we
didn't really do the things we needed to do.  
But there were a lot of positive things I think that came out of the game
tonight going forward with a couple of guys. Really pleased with Kendal and
Martez and some other guys, Connor. Prince had some good things, too.  
But we've gotta get‑‑ we've got one more tournament. We've got to get to
playing the best we can play. And Baylor's doing that right now.  
I thought we were heading that way, but we didn't get it done today.  
  
Q. Jonathan, what did you feel like the difference was tonight? Was the
presence of Baylor's bigs just too much a factor for you all inside or what
was the difference?  
JONATHAN HOLMES: I think they had a really good game offensively and
defensively, but it's nothing that we haven't gone against every day in
practice, give them credit. We didn't execute on offense and we didn't keep
them off the boards on defense. So they were tougher than us tonight.  
  
Q. Isaiah, how difficult is it playing a Baylor team? You've beaten them
twice and they're playing their best basketball of the year right now?  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: We knew they came in hot. We just wanted to come in and compete
today, but unfortunately we didn't. We didn't do as much as we could. They
were hitting shots early, and we gave up a lot of offensive rebounds and
that's what really hurt us.  
  
Q. How much does this feel like it hurts your momentum going into the NCAA
next week?  
COACH BARNES: You know, what I just told those guys is that you got one more
time to feel this way. And the reason‑‑ and, again, I know they're
disappointed. But we didn't give ourselves a chance.  
You gotta give Baylor credit in the fact we knew they were going to get into
long possessions on offense. We knew they were going to pack it way back in.
But they've done it twice to us.  
We talked about our guards taking their shots. They didn't. Isaiah, you know,
they're going back up to 13feet, he's gotta shoot the ball. He doesn't give
those post guys a chance to do anything. He started out early, getting the
ball, doing what we need to do. And I think twice we fed the ball to Cam
inside. And then they obviously would get the ball. They were going to put us
in a long possession, and we just didn't play with the sense of urgency
defensively. But I don't know if ‑‑ again, that's a good question you asked
me. But I've been doing it so long, when you lose a game like this, the next
week guys get at it. Sometimes you finish thinking you're feeling pretty good
and it just doesn't work.  
But we need everybody‑‑ right now we need to be playing our best basketball. I
thought we were heading that way last night. We came out, and again I don't
have‑‑ again, you've gotta give Baylor all the credit. But early in the game,
even when they were scoring, those were the kind of shots we wanted them to
score with.  
But Brady hadn't hurt us in a long time. And just being late‑‑ and I think it
has a direct result because we were letting our offense dictate how we were
playing on the defensive end. I think it bothered‑‑ and I really believe that.
You can't let that happen.  
But with that said, there's some good things that we know coming out of here
that ‑‑ again, I was really proud of Kendal. And I was really proud of, again,
Martez. I thought Connor really did some good things and Prince. But we need
Cam and Jon and Isaiah and Javan Felix. Javan has got to shoot the ball.
That's what he's supposed to do for us. And he stood out front tonight and
held it. He's gotta shoot it. We've gotta be aggressive.  
And we just need everybody doing what they do well. And if we do that, I'm
telling you, we can beat anybody we play. But if we don't, it can be like
that.  
But, again, you've gotta give Baylor the credit. They executed, did what they
did. They're playing their best basketball, may be the hottest team in the
country. But we helped them along the way, too.  
  
Q. When you have won in March before, it's been with pretty good guard play.
How much more do you need from Isaiah and Javan and are they up to that in the
next week or so?  
COACH BARNES: They are up to it. Again, someone asked me about‑‑ and Jon
answered the question. They didn't do anything we haven't seen. We've seen‑‑
believe me, there was nothing‑‑ we had some shots around the rim that we
missed. We did that. But it goes back to defensively.  
I don't think ‑‑ I know we got three consecutive stops. And even with all
that, you think about it, we came out, we got it down and gave up two
offensive rebounds and it was actually Isaiah. That's why we took him out and
let him sit, because he didn't finish the play. After the game, I actually
said to him. I said I'm not sure I can say it anymore. We've gotta finish
possessions.  
I asked him what happened. And he actually said, you know, I let my offense,
what was going on on the offensive end dictate what was happening on the other
end. That's how fine a line it really is, that you've got to play through it.  
And that's what‑‑ and we've got to. But we need our guards to play. But,
again, Kendal‑‑ we've been talking the last week how we've been so impressed
with him, the ups and downs, but he's never not been ready, and tonight's
gotta be a big lift for him.  
So there were some good things. The guys that have played the minutes this
year are the ones that have to‑‑ we need everybody. That's the bottom line. We
need everybody to be at their best right now.  
  
Q. You're talking about Kendal and Martez. Would it be to the point this
late in the season that you might give them more minutes if Javan and Isaiah
aren't doing what you want?  
COACH BARNES: That's what I told the team. I told them, guys, what we do know
is that we don't have to count on just one guy. We don't need one guy to play
36, 38 minutes a game because we've had too many guys that have done some
things. But what would be nice if everybody could play, but we play with the
energy. Like I'm going to play two minutes as hard as I can, because we've got
guys that can come in. And you go back to the last time we played Baylor, we
had a big lead. And when we went to our bench, the bench didn't respond.
Tonight, the bench responded. The starters didn't respond the way they needed
to. And that's where we've got to‑‑ again, I don't think we need to go to any
game thinking somebody's gotta play 36 minutes.  
And so that's the one positive thing about it. I mean, there were some good
things, there really were, but you're always disappointed, especially when you
go from a great defensive effort to just being a shell of that team
defensively.  
But, again, Baylor had a lot to do with that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  86  
Texas - 69

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor, Coach Drew and three student‑athletes,
Brady Heslip, Isaiah Austin and Cory Jefferson. Coach?  
COACH DREW: Very proud of how the guys competed today. Playing three games in
three days isn't easy. And I thought they had tremendous intensity and did a
great job sticking to the game plan and really shared the ball, did a lot of
positive things.  
This is our third championship game in six years. We're hoping a third time is
the charm.  
  
Q. Cory and Brady, obviously you went through that really rough stretch and
you finished strong. What changed? What kind of happened that allowed you to
finish with the success you've had thus far?  
CORY JEFFERSON: Basically we just tightened up on our defense and working on
closing out the game. Most of the games we have lost, when we went through the
early part of the conference play, they were within like one to two
possessions.  
So we were there throughout the whole game for the most part, but we just
wasn't finishing out the game, and that's basically what we've been working
on.  
BRADY HESLIP: I feel our change is just everybody giving more effort on the
defensive end obviously to start. But when Kenny and I and Gary and the guards
who play the top set the tone with ball pressure and we're flying around
giving max effort then the bigs are going to give max effort. And Isaiah in
the middle has just been a anchor, just ridiculous, erasing every guard that
gets in there when we happen to let them drive. I think that has transferred
over to our offense. Just when we play better defense, we played better
offense.  
  
Q. Brady, it's very difficult to win four straight nights. You all looked
really fresh tonight. Did you all feel that way, and how do you feel you all
will be tomorrow?  
BRADY HESLIP: Felt fresh tonight, and I know we'll feel fresh tomorrow, too.  
  
Q. Cory, I know the big guys from Texas have given you some troubles earlier
in the season. What exactly changed tonight? Why were you so effective
compared to the first two games?  
CORY JEFFERSON: Texas has great bigs, and they're one of the top in the
country in blocking shots. Knowing that, we just know we've gotta attack their
shot blockers. Once you do that, it makes it harder for them to actually block
a shot.  
  
Q. Cory, how confident is this team right now with the success that you all
had in the last couple of weeks?  
CORY JEFFERSON: Very confident. We know that we're playing for a championship
game tomorrow. We're confident that we can win that. We're just going to go
out there play like we've been playing, play as a team, play Baylor
basketball.  
  
Q. Isaiah, looked like Texas was a little more willing to challenge you
inside than maybe last night. Can you just talk about all the blocked shots
you've been piling up?  
ISAIAH AUSTIN: Texas is an aggressive team. So I just wanted to be down there
and contest as many shots as I could. Our guards were playing tremendous
defense on their guards and Cory and Royce were crashing the wings. So it was
just an overall good defensive game for us.  
  
Q. Brady, obviously you had really two separate games against Iowa State in
terms of how you played. What was the key in the second game and what were
some of the things you had to clean up from the first matchup against Iowa
State?  
BRADY HESLIP: Like Cory said, the first time we played them, it was our first
conference game. We have a lot of new pieces this year, so them getting
acclimated to the Big 12 and us playing them on senior night, we played them
as a team. We found our identity and we knew what we're doing out there. We
know what our strengths and weaknesses are, so we just try to maximize our
strengths and I think that's the big difference.  
  
Q. Besides the on ‑court stuff, why do you think mentally you guys were able
to hold it together as well as you did going through that tough stretch and
not let the losses pile up?   
CORY JEFFERSON: We knew who we were, like you said, off the court. So we went
out to every game, even if it was the ones that we lost, but we went out in
every game knowing that we were going to win. We may have lost it, but we went
out to the next game knowing we were going to win that next one.  
We didn't let it deter us from what we knew we were supposed to do. We stayed
together as a team. We didn't put the blame on anybody when we went through
that tough streak and we stuck through it and fought through it and this is
where we've come.  
  
Q. Cory and Brady, both of you were here in 2012, when you reached the
championship and didn't win it. How much did this mean to both of you guys as
seniors?  
BRADY HESLIP: It would mean everything. I just want to win a championship with
these guys, with this team. The first time it was an amazing experience, but
now it's the second time, and we're not just here for the experience, we're
here to perform.  
So when tomorrow night comes, the only thing we're thinking about is winning.
It will mean a lot.  
CORY JEFFERSON: It's going to mean a lot to me, just playing for the
championship, we'll be the first team from Baylor to bring back the Big 12.  
  
Q. Coach, what changed from that moment where you guys had that really rough
stretch and obviously you finished really strong? What happened that really
fueled that?  
COACH DREW: Cory hit the nail on the head. The first thing is the guys never
pointed fingers, blamed each other or the coaches. We stayed united, stayed
together. We knew what we had to get better at.  
And then credit them each and every day coming, trying to win the day, get
better each and every day so we could be our best down the stretch.  
And we've had great leadership all year long, great chemistry, and as they
say, what doesn't break you makes you stronger, and I think that adversity has
helped bring us even closer together.  
  
Q. You guys made the four games in four days trip in 2009. Weren't
successful. What did you learn from that first swing through there that you
think may translate into maybe a better performance tomorrow night?  
COACH DREW: I think any time you get to a championship game or have an
experience, you can take some things away. And I think the big thing is
sometimes when you get to a championship game, you're more excited to be there
than really focused on winning it, very similar to our first NIT championship
compared to our second NIT championship game.  
So I'm hoping that it doesn't guarantee‑‑ more experience doesn't guarantee
you're going to win, but hopefully it adds a little hunger seeing the other
teams celebrate. And Big 12 does a great job with the festivities and it's not
fun being on the other end.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about when Isaiah is great on offense how that
changes you guys. But when Cory is doing his thing inside like we saw in the
first half and Brady is hitting the opportunity 3 ‑pointer, I think they
combined for 25 points in the first half. What kind of matchup problems does
that create?  
COACH DREW: Well, I think that's one of our strengths of our team is we have
great balance. We've had different people step up and make big plays during
this 10 and 1 run. And I think that's important. Because you're not going to
be hot every night and you gotta have someone else there to pick you up.  
At the end of the day, if you defend and rebound, it gives you a chance on
nights when not as many people are stepping up. And I found our bigs really
were a lot more effective this game than they had been our two previous games
and credit them on their hard work and development and getting better
throughout the year, because Cam and Holmes and Prince, I mean, kind of those
are very good defensive players. You're not going to find better defensive
players in college.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on Iowa State? You split with them in the regular season.
Can you talk a little bit about what you're expecting to see tomorrow?  
COACH DREW: Iowa State's a great team. And we just played them. And I know
they'll have some extra hunger because it's tough to beat a real good team
after you just played them. We played one of our better games of the year.  
And, again, they're a team that can win a national championship and I think
they're going to be real successful in the NCAA tournament.  
So you're playing for a Big 12 championship in the best conference in the
country. It's a great honor and privilege, and we're going to give it all
we've got and see how things turn out.  
  
Q. I know you have bigger things on your mind than records today. But you
become the all ‑time winner at Baylor against a team that you couldn't beat
for 13 games when you first got here. Does that cross your mind at all? Do you
ever think at all about how far you have come at Baylor?  
COACH DREW: I think the first and foremost thing is I've shared with the
players, the only way coaches get records is because you have great players
and they put the team first. And we've been very blessed to have outstanding
players. And the great thing is they're really good people, really good role
models, ambassadors.  
We love in the summertime when all the guys play pro ball come back. You love
during NBA weekend, All Star weekend when guys come back. I know they'll all
be watching tomorrow and cheering on the guys and you love being a part of
that family.  
  
Q. The zone's been pretty effective for you in this tournament. Tomorrow
playing Iowa State, they isolate guys and try to pull you out. How are you
going to try to balance that back and forth?  
COACH DREW: I think they're a team that's very hard to zone. And I know we got
our work cut out for us. If you want to ask me at 3:00a.m., I'll have a better
idea.  
  
Q. Baylor's never won a conference championship tournament dating back to
the SWC. What do you think that would mean to this program, this school?  
COACH DREW: I think women's basketball, football have had outstanding years.
And I know it just speaks volumes to the University's administration for me
and McCaw, the athletic director to President Starr, and all the regents. What
a great job they've done with the facilities and the university.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [Andrew Wiggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26681)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  77  
Oklahoma State - 70

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Kansas Coach Bill Self and the student‑athletes
are Wayne Selden, Jr. and Andrew Wiggins. Coach?  
COACH SELF: It was an unbelievable game. Two teams competing hard, and
certainly I think the first day of the most competitive league in America
hasn't disappointed so far.  
That took everything we had. We had to play out of foul trouble, and I think
it took everything Iowa State had to win earlier today. So you'll have two
tired teams that have to recover fast and get ready tomorrow.  
But these two guys, I thought Wayne was unbelievable in the first half and I
thought Wigs was just terrific play after play the entire game. So large
credit goes to these two why we won.  
  
Q. Andrew, how have you been able to block out all the buzz and the hype
that you had to deal with and still find a way to mature and grow the way you
have these last couple of months?  
ANDREW WIGGINS: Because I know that you never know too much, you know, I'm
always open to new things.  
Coach teaches me new things every day. Just preparation and practice. Always
play hard, run the floor, defend your man and he just made me a better player.  
  
Q. Andrew, did you talk to anybody about what March is like and Big 12
tournament and NCAA tournament and how much have you kind of been looking
forward to this month all season?  
ANDREW WIGGINS: I talked to my brother about it a lot. From his experience
last year, he just said you wouldn't believe how amazing it is if you are not
there to witness. So I just want to be able to feel that feeling with my team,
with my coach, and to give the fans a great year.  
  
Q. Andrew, talk to me about how you guys are adjusting without having Joel
on the team competing now?  
ANDREW WIGGINS: We have to play hard defensively, try to keep my man in front
of us, playing before we get the ball. Yep. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Wayne, can you talk about the possibilities, a tough game like this with
a lot of basketball coming up in a short time how much this can take out of
you and what you did to recover?  
WAYNE SELDEN, JR.: I'm just going to rest. We know we played hard today. We
know we've got to compete again tomorrow. This is what comes with it. This is
what we signed up for, we're going to get our rest and come back tomorrow
strong.  
  
Q. Andrew, can you talk about the shot you made to tie it there in the last
minute? You guys were down 2 and you needed a bucket. Talk about the sequence
and how that play developed?  
ANDREW WIGGINS: My shot was falling the whole game, and they cut out the
baseline, stepped back one of my main moves is what I like to do. It just fell
through.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about Naadir's foul shooting the last 30seconds, what
was kind of your reaction when the ball was in his hands and he had to go to
the line?  
WAYNE SELDEN, JR.: That's what a leader does. We knew he was going to knock
them down. We knew we wanted the ball in his hands when it's that time of the
game because we know he's going to come through for us. He's been here and he
wants to take those free throws.  
  
Q. So much has been made about not having your backstop back there, but how
good was your defense the first half and particularly in the overtime?  
COACH SELF: I thought our defense was good the first half. I thought it was
excellent, to be honest with you, but it was good when we played them in
Stillwater and good when we played them in Lawrence for a half. I think they
got like 26, 30 and whatever it was today, 23, on us. It was good. The problem
is we haven't defended them very well the second half all three games.  
They came out and obviously shot 52percent the second half. We didn't guard
them as well, but the law of averages should be prevail. When you have good
players, they're going to make shots and they've got four guys that can really
score the ball, and all terrific. And I thought they actually made some hard
shots. I thought they threw some hard shots.  
But considering we had to play small for a stretch and we hadn't practiced
that much, for a team that has a lot of big guys to have them, seem like, all
of them sitting over there next to me for a period of time, we kind of had to
make‑shift it a little bit. But I thought our defense was good. I thought our
defensive rebounding was excellent.  
  
Q. There's a lot of projections that Oklahoma State is going to be a nine
seed perhaps or possibly an eight seed, if they get in that slot, how angry do
you think a one seed would have to be to face that team that you just saw out
there?  
COACH SELF: I'll say who knows what they'll be, but I'll tell you this: I've
had teams in the past that was a three seed that was probably playing like a
six or seven seed, and I've had teams that was a seven seed playing like a two
or three seed.  
And I will tell you, Oklahoma State, whatever they're seeded, they're playing
a lot better than that. So if you're a one seed in their bracket and both
teams are fortunate to win, you're going to be playing a four seed in the
second round or five seed. They're good.  
And Marcus deserves a lot of credit and he gets a lot, but they've got four
guys that can flat out play, and that's not taking anything away from anybody
else.  
The problem that they have, from my vantage point, they're not quite as deep
as maybe some other teams. But if they can stay out of foul trouble, they can
play with anybody.  
  
Q. Obviously, Andrews had two of his best games of the year these last two
games, but what do you think the difference was in what the guys around him
did today versus the regular season finale against West Virginia?  
COACH SELF: We guarded better today. I don't know that our point production
was any better today because you've got two guys in double figures. I mean,
that's not going to cut it over time. But we did defend better.  
And we're not a great ball handling team as you guys witnessed and seen if
you've followed us all year long. We've got to make up for that rebounding the
ball and things like that. Certainly we stole some possessions that we gave
away through ball handling.  
But Perry's a good player. Perry can go get you 20 any night. He didn't do it
tonight, but we probably need Perry to become our third scorer without
question and really be a guy that other teams have to focus on rather than
just those two tonight.  
  
Q. Tarik was in foul trouble again, but still 12 rebounds out of him. How
important was he tonight in light of Joel obviously not being out there?  
COACH SELF: When you say Tarik was in foul trouble, he played 26 minutes. So
that's pretty good for him because usually it doesn't take that much time to
get in real foul trouble.  
So we needed him in there, and it certainly hurt when he and Perry both got
four. We played six or seven minutes when they made their comeback took the
lead when both those guys were on the bench. We definitely need them in there.
I thought he was very good defensively.  
  
Q. You had Wiggins on Brown a good part of the game, looked like he did a
fantastic job. Brown didn't get a lot of good looks. Could you talk about the
job he did on Markel?  
COACH SELF: Andrew is not one dimensional. He's our best defender. I thought
Markel still played well. He made a couple of really hard shots. That one 3 he
made to give them the lead was a joke how good that was. He did a good job on
them, and I also thought Wayne did a great job on Marcus.  
He's going to get in the paint. We fouled him too much the second half, but I
thought we did a really good job of playing the scouting report and not
stopping a good player but at least controlling him a little bit. Because, in
Stillwater, down the stretch, he went nuts on us and we were able to kind of‑‑
we didn't allow that to happen again in large part due to Wayne.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas  66  
West Virginia - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by West Virginia Coach Bob Huggins,
student‑athletes Terry Henderson and Brandon Watkins. Questions?  
  
Q. Brandon, there were times it looked like early in the first half y'all
were clear missing shots you don't normally miss. Was the feeling like what's
going on out here?  
BRANDON WATKINS: Kind of, sort of. I mean, we were really shooting it well
during practice. And I just thought that we would be able to hit shots during
the game. But I mean, every game you can't just expect to come out and make a
lot of shots. Sometimes you have down games and you have good games.  
  
Q. Terry, how effective did you think Texas' zone was or was it all your
missed shooting?  
TERRY HENDERSON: I mean, they're a long team. They've got a long back line in
the zone, and they deflected a lot of passes. We did a poor job of squaring up
and really looking at the floor before we threw the ball. I think we waited
too late to try and flash in the middle to get some easy shots or some easy
ball movement.  
And we played this zone before. We played against plenty of zones. So their
zone, we're used to playing against the 2‑3 zone. So I don't really think it
was supposed to bother us like that, but it did. And playing catchup the whole
game isn't going to help either.  
  
Q. Is this an even bigger bummer considering how well you played against
Kansas coming into this thing?  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, I certainly didn't see it coming. I thought we
practiced‑‑ we had three pretty enthusiastic days of practice.  
We just‑‑ when you're as reliant as we are on making jump shots and you don't
make jump shots, it becomes extremely difficult. We can't score close.  
They did a great job of collapsing on Juwan every time he went to the basket.
We had a hard time. We don't make shots when he drives and kicks it to people.
They're just going to sit in there, which is what they did.  
  
Q. As difficult as this is right now, do you still feel like you deserve to
be in the NCAAs?  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, we were sixth in the best league in the country. You
know, we struggled early and we lost some games early because we were so
young.  
And I think we've gotten better and better. I think, are we one of the, you
know, whatever, 60‑however‑the‑hell many there are now? I don't even know.
Yeah, I think we are. But I guess it's your body of work.  
It's kind of like they asked me the other day, you know, if Embiid didn't play
would that hurt Kansas? And I can remember when Kenyon broke his leg and the
head of the committee came out and said it's the total body of work, we don't
take any of that into consideration, whatever they did throughout the course
of the year. We were clearly the number one team in the country RPI, the
number one in the polls, number one in everything else.  
And we got the last 2 seed. So I've learned that you sit there on Sunday and
try and figure it out. How do I know what goes on?  
But are we? Sure we are, right now we are. I mean, take today aside, yeah, we
are. But I don't know. I don't know what everybody looks at and what's really
important.  
  
Q. It looked like Juwan was injured mid ‑stride on that layup attempt.
What's his diagnosis?  
COACH HUGGINS: I don't know. I don't know. He stepped on somebody's foot, I
guess. I don't know what it is.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Iowa State  91  
Kansas State - 85

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Kansas State head coach Bruce Weber and
student‑athletes Thomas Gipson and Shane Southwell. Coach?  
COACH WEBER: I guess an entertaining game. I'm not sure we guarded as well‑‑ I
know we didn't guard as well as we needed to. I asked the guys to just compete
and play.  
We've been on Shane to step up and be a player. I thought he was. A couple of
tough possessions down the stretch, and they made the plays and we didn't.  
And you know, shot 54percent, scored 85 points and you still can't win. Nigel
was good off the bench. I thought our whole bench did a nice job again, not
only Nigel, his career high, but Omari got in the first half, gave us a nice
spark. D.J.'s limping a little bit, but he gives us solid minutes. We needed
Marcus probably to stay out of foul trouble and it didn't happen. And they had
foul trouble on their own.  
You have to give them ‑‑ they're good. All three games are the same, came down
to the last couple of minutes, tie score. They made the plays and today they
stepped up and made some shots to give them a victory.  
  
Q. At the end of the game when Shane got that ball, headed a little out of
control there, what can a coachdo there? Theoretically, I guess you call a
time ‑out, but it was so quick what was the thought process there?  
COACH WEBER: Well, I think you ‑‑ he actually had Nigel wide open and that's
what I was seeing and hoping ‑‑ we had a couple of tough possessions down the
stretch. Wes went and tried to do something he shouldn't have. Shane actually
had a wild one that went in and then he had one in a half court possession
that wasn't very good. And we needed to be solid and take care of the
basketball.  
We were so good when we moved the ball and got passing and cutting, and one of
our better efforts for that. And you're sitting there watching and you're like
the first thing coming in my mind is call timeout, but he also has kind of a
little bit of a break and advantage, and just he had a great game, just didn't
make the right read down the stretch. But he gave us a lot of plays that
allowed us to be there at the end.  
  
Q. Shane, take me through what you saw on that last possession when it was a
two ‑point game and you lost the ball?  
SHANE SOUTHWELL: I believe Omari got the rebound and he outlet it to me. And I
had total tunnel vision. I'm thinking down 2, get to the basket, get a layup
or get fouled. I only saw Niang and a couple people trailing back for Iowa
State. In my mind I'm thinking get to the basket. He don't really want to
foul, he has four fouls.  
So then at the last minute, I heard Nigel yell my name, and then I looked and
tried to pass it to him when I brought it around and I lost the ball. But I
just had tunnel vision. So I had predetermined thoughts, so it wasn't going to
work out. If I would have just been a little bit more patient, it probably
would have worked out. Nigel would have had an open shot, and the way he was
going, I have a lot of confidence in him and I think he would have made that
shot.  
  
Q. Thomas, coach said if they won the battle on the boards, it would be
important for them. How tough was their rebounding today especially on the
offensive glass?  
THOMAS GIPSON: They're very good on the rebounds. I think the main thing when
we have rotations, when we have to do rotation help, Hogue and Ejim, they get
free lanes to the basket and easy put‑backs. So they pass it out to get wide
open 3s. But, I mean, they're good on the boards. We can't hold them on that.
We just had to be tougher.  
  
Q. Shane, how big was Nigel Johnson coming off the bench and giving you guys
a spark?  
SHANE SOUTHWELL: It was big. We pride ourselves on our bench play and next man
up. So he really played well. He's a really talented player. We just need some
glimpses of that every day or every game and even in practice.  
But like I said, he's a really talented player, and I'm really proud of him.
And we appreciate the performance he had today. But we just gotta go out there
and defend and get a couple more stops and we would have been even happier.  
  
Q. Do you feel this game got you going again a little bit because you did
play pretty well?  
SHANE SOUTHWELL: I really don't‑‑ I'm not really concerned with that. I'm
concerned with the loss and how we can, how I can play better or how we can
play better as a team. I always think of what I can do better. So I'm not
content or really worried about that.  
I made a couple of shots, but still it came from me defending and getting
those two rebounds early, which got me into a flow. So I really have to just
go out there, do the little things early. And my shots were falling, good
things were happening when you do the little things.  
  
Q. Shane and Thomas, how soon do you put this ballgame behind you before you
start thinking about where you might go? I mean, Selection Sunday is about 72
hours away, so you've got a lot of time. It might seem that way anyway.  
SHANE SOUTHWELL: You learn‑‑ we're going to watch film. We're going to learn
from the mistakes we had today. But we pretty much got to put it behind us and
learn from it and go out the next three days until Sunday, get some rest, but
also put up a lot of shots and stay together as a team and know that this
season is not over. We still have a lot of games left and we have a lot of
fight left and we've gotta go out there keep the mindset for the next couple
of days until we see where we're going, what type of seed we're at and who
we're playing.  
THOMAS GIPSON: He pretty much said it. I felt we put it behind us right away.
I feel like we'll be fine. It's just a tough loss. We can deal with it,
though. Shane pretty much said it all.  
  
Q. Your squad's known for being able to control the pace. Why didn't that
work today and how were you able to score 85 despite the pace?  
COACH WEBER: We were pretty efficient on offense and we scored 85 and 80
against them. We just didn't get enough stops. The big thing, the big stat is
their points in the paint. I think Fred deceives you and they made 8 for 18
from 3.  
But if you really study their stats, they haven't shot it that well over the
course of time. But they always get a lot of points in the paint and they also
get to the free‑throw line. And we just didn't defend like we needed to, and
they had us spread out and some of it they made some 3s. They got too many
easy layups.  
We finally took some charges in the second half to give us a chance, but they
‑‑ Niang and Ejim pretty much had their way. And Naz Long made the big 3 when
we had scored a bucket, and then we went and helped, they kicked it out, and
that was a big 3 for them. But the rebounding, points in the paint, we just
didn't do a good enough job.  
And on the other end, though, we scored and we were pretty, obviously pretty
efficient. You shoot 54percent, 47 from 3, and 73 from the line and don't win,
you know, it's pretty disappointing.  
  
Q. Bruce, if we can step back from today a little bit more of a big picture
question, what are the places that you've seen growth in your team, in your
program from the beginning of the season until now as you head into the
tournament?  
COACH WEBER: I think if you saw some of our early games, I'm not sure you
thought we could compete with anybody. And our guys came together. Our seniors
accepted their roles and instead of trying to be superstars, they've just been
very solid players and had real nice moments along the way, all of them.  
And then our freshmen just slowly but surely grew up. From the beginning to
get Gipson back and get him going, and the conference is tough, and it's not
very forgiving. And I hope it prepares us for the NCAA tournament. Obviously
it still comes down to matchups and playing good basketball down the stretch.  
But we've made a lot of progress. And we've had four freshmen play quite a few
minutes, and I don't know if anybody else in the league can say that. So you
feel good. I feel good about next week. I feel good about the future of the
program.  
  
Q. Getting into that, Bruce, how tough is it to go into the tournament on a
little bit of a slide in terms of losses here, but also coming off a pretty
well ‑played game today?  
COACH WEBER: I hope it's a motivator. And like I just told our coaches, we
just lost to one of the best offensive teams in the country, played them until
the end.  
We played a lot‑‑ people don't appreciate‑‑ I don't think nationwide people
appreciate how good our league is. And I thought it was a little
disrespectful, the polls. We just keep beating each other, and other teams.
You know, Iowa lost six out of seven and stayed in the polls. It didn't make a
lot of sense to me. But the only way you can back it up is go in the
tournament and do something. So I feel good about our group. I feel good about
the league. It was very competitive. And I hope this is a motivator, to lose
some games down the stretch, but also a motivator to know that we can play
with anybody in the country, because we've done it.  
  
Q. I apologize if you were asked that, I didn't catch the beginning, but how
important was it in the flow of the game, what Dustin Hogue did for them
because you had Niang in foul trouble, Kane in foul trouble, they were both on
the bench at the same time, which usually is not a good indicator for Iowa
State?  
COACH WEBER: He made three in the beginning, which you don't expect him to
probably make it. I'm not sure if it went under the rim and around. And then
he hit two really tough shots in the stretch run. And his rebounding is‑‑ he
averaged 12 rebounds against us the first two. He's great at that. Him and
Ejim have just pumped us on the boards. But he played a special game. Now we
probably‑‑ we match it somewhat with Nigel Johnson stepping up and playing
special for us.  
But they end up with five guys in double digits. We only end up with four. And
that's probably the difference in the game.  
  
Q. You referred a couple times to the quality of the league, but I'm just
wondering how this league prepared you, is going to prepare you for starting
next week. Seems like you're playing an NCAA tournament team two out of every
three games?  
COACH WEBER: Probably three out of four games, looks like, right? And then
somebody could be an NIT team. So even Texas Tech, if Tubby gets there a
little earlier and has a little better, a little more time with them, they
were as competitive as anybody down the stretch.  
So we've faced a lot of different styles. We've faced the size of Kansas and
Texas, the free‑wheeling offense of Oklahoma and Iowa State, and the toughness
of a Texas Tech, West Virginia. So we played a lot of different teams. We've
had a lot of close games. We've won some and we've lost some. And I hope that
our guys get their mindset right. And we know we played with the best in the
country, and we can go and beat anybody.  
But now we've gotta prove it. And I told them‑‑ my big theme this week was
compete today. And I told them before, you know, we'll still have one more
game, but after that you've got to compete today or there's no tomorrow. And I
hope they'll step it up and we'll have a good showing in the tournament and
our whole league does.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  77  
Oklahoma State - 70

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by the Cowboys of Oklahoma State, Coach Travis
Ford and student‑athletes Le'Bryan Nash and Marcus Smart. Coach?  
COACH FORD: We're really proud of our team's effort. I thought they played
hard, really did. We came out kind of in a little bit of mud, which I expected
a little bit after such a quick turnaround. I kept telling our guys in
timeout, "We'll get into it. We'll get into it." And we did.  
Give Kansas credit. They played really well. They made big shots down the
stretch. Wiggins made a big shot in the corner and he played a heck of a game.
They're just a really good basketball team.  
But our guys fought really hard, just didn't have enough left in the tank
there late. We fought a lot of adversity. Foul trouble, our 4s and 5s,
obviously we don't have a lot of depth there. We were trying to sub offense
and defense for a long period of time with LB and Murph was out. And we had
guys cramping a little bit.  
But, hey, no excuses, Kansas deserved it. They made big shots and big rebounds
against us. But our guys fought. I'm proud of them. I'm proud of them.  
Wish we could have rebounded the ball better at times, wasn't our best
shooting night. You look at the stat sheet and it's amazing, we kind of went
into overtime because we didn't shoot the ball very well.  
But these guys played with a lot of heart, they did. We got down, they fought
back, took a lead. But give Kansas credit, they made some big shots and got
some big rebounds.  
  
Q. Marcus, difficult defensive assignment tonight with Andrew Wiggins. Could
you describe how that was?  
MARCUS SMART: Andrew Wiggins, coming out there 41‑point game against West
Virginia, they played through him tonight and they made tough shots. He earned
a lot, he earned all his shots, and you give him credit. He made the baskets
when they counted and his teammates went to him. He was hot. He got the ball
in the right spot.  
  
Q. Le'Bryan Nash, looked like you had a nice offensive night and taking it
to them inside. Was a point with Embiid not in there?  
LE'BRYAN NASH: It is. Coach Ford just made an emphasis an Embiid is a great
shot blocker. When he went out, it's a good thing. You attack the rim. They
really didn't have no more shot blocks after that. So Coach Ford just made an
emphasis on attacking the rim and that's what I tried to do this game, and
then it worked out for me for a minute.  
  
Q. Marcus, a lot of people at Big 12 Media Day before the season asked you
about Andrew Wiggins and what you thought about him coming to the conference.
Now that the Big 12 season is wrapping up, assess his entire season and how he
affected this conference and where he stood in the conference and where he
stood against you, in particular?  
MARCUS SMART: Like I said before, you know, they said he was the best player.
He came out and, like I said to everybody, it wasn't a shot or anything. He
had to earn that. He came out as a freshman and took a slow bit to get used to
it. He got used to it and he's doing what he's supposed to be doing for his
team. He's leading his team. He led his team to a Big 12 championship and he
led his team against really good basketball with us today. And as a player,
you're supposed to be the best player on your team. That's what you're
supposed to do. So more luck to him going on with his future. And he did what
he was supposed to do tonight.  
  
Q. Marcus and Le'Bryan, if you could talk about the sequence in the second
half where Markel got a jumper, then Forte got a steal and a 3, and then
Marcus, you got a steal and bucket to pull within 1. How big was that and how
did that get your team going to finish out the game?  
MARCUS SMART: That was huge. Phil and Markel, they've been making plays like
that all season, especially late here in our season. They've been coming in
the clutch for us. And then I just tried to affect the game, and I came up
with a big steal to cut it to 1. But that's kind of what our team is. Defense.
We didn't have a great defensive night tonight nor offensive night. We took
Kansas to overtime. I'm proud of my team and Markel and Le'Bryan and everybody
else.  
  
Q. Marcus and Le'Bryan, can you talk about how tough it is to beat Kansas
here? I think they've won four of the five Big 12 tournaments played in this
building. How tough are they to beat here?  
LE'BRYAN NASH: They're extreme. Kansas City is probably like an hour away from
Lawrence or something, and it's just a home game for them. Their fans can get
into it. And it's Kansas and it's always tough to beat Kansas. They're a great
team and.  
You know, we had our chances. We couldn't convert them but I'm proud of my
team. We played hard and hopefully we can try and get one next year.  
MARCUS SMART: Definitely, like Le'Bryan said, I'm proud of these guys. It's
always hard to beat Kansas especially in this building. Like he said, they
have the fan base to back them up. So, you know, it's kind of hard. They have
that energy and momentum from their fans and it kind of takes the opposing
team out of it. But like I said, I'm proud of these guys. We fought to the
end. And unfortunately, some plays there we drew up didn't go right for us. We
didn't convert on them as a team. We let some slip, and Kansas capitalized on
the plays that they made.  
  
Q. Marcus, it was a rough shooting night for you. Was it something that
Kansas was doing defensively or were the shots just not falling tonight?  
MARCUS SMART: Actually, no, they were giving me open shots, but the shots just
weren't falling tonight. I was getting to the basket and that's kind of what
my coaching staff was trying to get me to do more, go to the basket. But I
took some good shots, took some bad shots. But the shots I took were good,
just weren't falling for me tonight. And as for everybody, Phil's one of our
best shooters and he missed a couple of shots that he usually makes. Markel
missed a lot of shots that he usually makes. And Le'Bryan around the rim, he
led the Big 12 in field goal shot percentage and he missed a lot of shots that
he normally makes. It's just a bad shooting night as a team, but that's
something we can fix.  
  
Q. Marcus, guys have been a little snakebit in close games, especially in
overtime this year. Going into the NCAA, how do you look at this team and how
important is it for you coming back to do something special for Oklahoma State
to kind of make a statement in the NCAA?  
MARCUS SMART: You know, it's nothing to keep our heads down. It's a great game
by two great teams. It's a learning point for us, you know. One of those
moments where we've got to close the game out and it helps going into the
tournament.  
Because nothing's going to be easy. Mostly all games come down to the wire and
it's who makes the more plays and less negative plays in the end. So this is a
learning process for us.  
  
Q. Travis, you had the timeout, 54seconds left and tie game. What did you
want to get out of that possession? Ended up with a Marcus jumper, but what
were you trying to get out of that possession?  
COACH FORD: We ran a play, we got about three options out of it. Phil Forte
coming off first, then a cross screen underneath the basket for Le'Bryan. We
actually got it around to Le'Bryan in the post. Phil wasn't open. We go to
Le'Bryan.  
Then after that, you've gotta go to your under 10 seconds offense, the same
one everybody else has. You kind of spread the court out and either get a
quick ball screen or you try to go one‑on‑one. But no different than their
last‑second shot in regulation. Neither team probably wanted the shots that
they got. Probably wasn't the best ones, so no different.  
But we ran a play that‑‑ because we had plenty of time, we ran a play with
about three or four different options on it. And they did a very‑‑ it was
their defense more than‑‑ it was very good defense on their part.  
  
Q. Don't know if you can go at this question maybe like you could after film
study, but what's it like being out there while you got a couple of future
lottery picks going at it going head to head like those guys were? It looked
fun to me. I don't know what it looked like to you.  
COACH FORD: I don't know if you call what we do‑‑ I mean, there was a lot of
great players out there. A lot of great players made some great plays.  
No question a lot of future NBA players out there. And they all competed. They
all competed at an extremely high level. I mean competed at a high level. I'm
not talking about made or missed shots; I'm talking about playing to win.  
And we did that. That's what I'm proud of our team. We played to win. We
played‑‑ coming out of the gates, I knew we'd be a little sluggish. Been in
this turnaround before and I kept telling my guys we're great. First time out,
we weren't playing well, but we were close. Kept getting close.  
We didn't play particularly well as far as Phil Forte and Markel Brown, Marcus
Smart, 14 for 42, but we competed. We competed, and that I'm proud of. I'm
proud of.  
  
Q. Not a typical 1 ‑8 matchup in the quarterfinals, was this the tight game
that you expected?  
COACH FORD: Yeah, we've played a lot of close games. I knew this would be
obviously difficult, quick turnaround and they've had a lot of success here
and they're a great basketball team.  
We knew it was going to take‑‑ it takes‑‑ you've got to play well in order to
beat Kansas, you've got to play well. And we competed well. We competed really
well. And again, Kansas made a lot of good shots, a lot of big shots. Wiggins
played really well. When they needed a shot, he really made some tough ones.
Marcus was right. He's gotten better and better and better as the year has
gone on. He's really, really good.  
I think all of our games have been pretty good this year. Played some good
games last year. But they're always good against Kansas. Kansas, you better
play well. You better play well.  
  
Q. How do you feel about how your team's playing right now going to the
NCAA's. Last night, you had some missed free throws. That's been kind of an
issue, but just overall how do you feel about your team?  
COACH FORD: I like how we're playing. I like how we're playing. I think
there's some things we can do to adjust to get better. I mean, there's some
things tonight we did to ourselves, to hurt ourselves at times. We need to
correct a few of those things. I thought we ran our offense tremendously
yesterday for 40 minutes. We gotta rebound the ball better, but I think we're
playing well. The last five or six games, two games we've lost, we lost in
overtime.  
And there's a lot of fight to us. Both games on the road, both games just like
road games. So I think we're playing pretty good basketball. There's some
things we need to do better, but you guys have seen us play. You probably can
answer it better. I think we're playing pretty good.  
  
Q. It looked like Kansas was playing really good defense?  
COACH FORD: They were.  
  
Q. But you went into overtime with three turnovers total. Can you talk about
the way you guys protected the ball and secured the ball and ran your
offense?  
COACH FORD: We came out, ran a play and scored. Phil Forte hit a 3. Kind of
went back to a play, looked for something else out of it.  
But two turnovers, one came ‑‑ Markel Brown was cramping the whole‑‑ the whole
overtime. And he drove and kind of stumbled, turned one over to LB, trying to
throw it in the post. LB slip and fell one time. You know, it happens. But
they did play good defense. But it was‑‑ you know, a few of our mistakes and
give them credit. They made some good shots. They rebounded the ball in
overtime and made tough shots. I think they scored one basket in overtime,
too. Or where is it? Eight were field goals. Free throws, they made eight free
throws in overtime.  
So I think both teams competed. We competed. They made a few more shots than
we did and defended at times, but we put ourselves in a good opportunity, we
just‑‑ you hit the nail on the head: We had a few costly turnovers you can't
have in overtime and you gotta rebound in overtime. But our guys gave it up.
They gave it up. We had some guys cramping and different things, but, hey, no
excuses. We really fought through to the very end and Kansas played well,
played really well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Iowa State  91  
Kansas State - 85

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa State, Coach Fred Hoiberg and
student‑athletes Melvin Ejim, Dustin Hogue and Georges Niang. Coach?  
COACH HOIBERG: Couldn't be more proud of these guys for how we handled some
pretty tough situations out there. Had a couple of guys, key guys, get in foul
trouble with four, with about eight or nine to go. And we decided to gamble,
put DeAndre back in there, felt we needed one of our playmakers in the game. I
thought he made some really good plays, helped keep us in it and put Georges
back in at the last media. Went in and made some great plays.  
Just talking about these three here, I thought Melvin, all night long, was
unbelievable. And in that basket he made driving to the basket to keep our
lead, I thought, was as big a basket as we had all game.  
Dustin Hogue, I thought, did everything today. He's always been a guy that's
done the dirty work for this team, all throughout the year. He doesn't get the
credit he deserves today, not only on the defensive end and rebounding, which
he always does, but made some huge plays for us on offense.  
So a big win. Had our backs against the wall on a couple of occasions, fought
through adversity and found a way to get a big win.  
  
Q. Dustin, can you talk about that? There was a three ‑ to four‑ to
five‑minute stretch when Georges had four fouls and DeAndre had four fouls.
They needed you offensively in the ways coach talked about. How do you
approach those minutes when those guys were on the bench?  
DUSTIN HOGUE: Normally in a game, we have to be playmakers, so I just played
my role most of the time, you know, trying to rebound and defend. But with a
couple of our key guys out, I decided to try to be more aggressive because we
didn't have the playmakers usually in the game and I started hitting some
shots.  
  
Q. It was mentioned on the K ‑State radio broadcast that when you two played
each other during the regular season, it had been tied late in the ballgame
both times and today you had the same thing. Why do you feel like these two
teams match up so well whenever they face each other?  
GEORGES NIANG: I think K‑State does a great job of pressuring and playing
defense, and whenever you play a team like that, it's hard to get going
against them. So credit to us when we were tied up. I felt like Coach put in
some plays that really helped us expose the way they pack in their defense. So
that helped us and led us to the win.  
DUSTIN HOGUE: I just think that we were just being aggressive. They're a
really good team. They go kind of small with their guards, their four‑man
stretch on the floor, so they kind of match us real well. I think in the long
run we just made key stops and we was able to hit shots down the stretch.  
MELVIN EJIM: Just to piggyback off what they said, they match up really well
with us. They play a smaller four and it's always up and down, high‑paced
game. I think that's the reason why it's always a close game to the end and it
comes down to who can make shots and stops. And they're a great team, played
defense really hard and matched up really well with us.  
  
Q. Georges, you said this was going to be a bar fight and it was probably
more beautiful basketball than that. What was it like out there just with the
intensity of every possession?  
GEORGES NIANG: It was real physical. I mean, every team is trying to outwill
their team to win. So people are playing extremely hard and at a high level.
Credit to them, they played extremely hard and they played extremely well. We
just executed better down the stretch and I just felt like that was key to the
game.  
  
Q. Fred, Monte, ten assists, one turnover with the DeAndre out for a good
stretch of the second half how important was he today?  
COACH HOIBERG: I thought he was great. He always does the right thing
defensively, got some key deflections. We were having trouble getting stops
unless we got a turnover and I thought he did a really good job of staying
tight with Spradling. It's not an easy matchup. He moves so much and Monte, I
thought, did a great job chasing him all over the floor. And ten assists and
one turnover, it's hard when you have an 8‑to‑1 assist‑to‑turnover ratio to
increase that in a game. But to go out there and do that as a freshman in his
first Big 12 tournament tells you all you need to know about that kid. He
loves the big stage. He won back to back state championships in Michigan. He
came out and played as poised a game as I think you can have as a freshman.  
  
Q. Fred, were you surprised how well K ‑State kept coming at you? Because it
seemed like the tempo was in your favor all night.   
COACH HOIBERG: We wanted to really get it going. They do such a good job
slowing you down, making you start your offense further out on the floor.  
If you would have told me they would score 85, I would have told you we're
going to have trouble winning a game because they're so good and sound
defensively. They really pack that thing in off the corners. But I thought our
guys made big plays.  
You look at what Georges did at the end, those last couple of minutes he was
in there, we gave the ball to him and he just went out there made unbelievable
basketball plays.  
I was a little worried when that one that Foster made stuck in the back of the
rim and went in. You almost think, well, maybe it's not our day to get this
one.  
But I give Bruce a lot of credit. That's an excellent basketball team. They've
got a lot of weapons out there, both inside and out. And I think they have a
chance to go on a nice run in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Melvin presented with the Big 12 Player of the Year trophy before the
game. He's had some 20 ‑10 games throughout the course of the regular season.
How well did he show today that he was deserving of that award?   
COACH HOIBERG: Melvin, to go out there, and he had five offensive rebounds in
the first half, did a good job I thought. He missed a couple of easy ones
there in the first. He could have had a 30‑point game, but then made those
really tough finishes around the basket, down the stretch. He hit some big
free throws for us and again really helped us do the job on the glass.  
We felt if we won the battle on the boards that we would have a very good
chance of winning this game. Melvin certainly helps us in that department. I
was a little worried about it, though. I was part of the Timberwolves and KG
got MVP, and it was our first game in the Western Conference semifinals
against Sacramento. And we went out there laid an egg because of the emotion.
I was a little concerned about that, tried to downplay it as much as I could
today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

### [Ryan Spangler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26691)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  78  
Oklahoma - 73

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Oklahoma Sooners Coach Lon Kruger and
student‑athletes Cameron Clark and Ryan Spangler. Coach?  
COACH KRUGER: I thought it was a ballgame in which Baylor from the start, I
thought, was more aggressive and dictated. I thought we were reacting most of
the first half, especially, they were quick on loose balls and they did a good
job. They did a really good job. I thought they played with more urgency and
determination from the start.  
I liked our guys' fight there late to get back into it, and a little bit of a
look at it. But still credit Baylor. I thought they deserved, did what they
needed to do to win a ballgame, and they deserved it more than we did.  
  
Q. Ryan, it seemed like Baylor's size and length bothered you guys more so
than in the first two times you played them, both offensively and defensively,
could you talk about what their size did tonight?  
RYAN SPANGLER: I think not even thinking about their size, I think they just
hit us first. The last two times we've played, we've hit them first, not let
them do that out of the start. But today they hit us first. They got on a
roll, and it was hard to stop.  
  
Q. It seemed like Austin really affected, I guess, your willingness to go to
the hole just for the whole team. Maybe he didn't have that effect in the
first two games, could you just talk about that?  
CAMERON CLARK: Well, his size, you know, he blocked a lot of shots. We could
have did a better job just being more aggressive. But credit Baylor, they came
out and popped us. We didn't do what we needed to do to get the win.  
RYAN SPANGLER: Yeah, he blocked a lot of shots in there. I think we need to
get‑‑ all week we worked on getting on two feet and pump faking, but I don't
think we did that today like we practiced. So I think the things that we
practiced, we need to bring to the game.  
  
Q. Ryan, you were on a pretty good roll coming into this event, and you're
going to be in the NCAA tournament. What does this do now? Does it humble you
a little bit, make you need to play harder defense? What's your mindset once
you hear your name called Sunday?  
RYAN SPANGLER: I think it just shows us, you know, how much better we need to
get by next week. There's a lot of things we need to work on. Defense is one
of them. We need to keep picking up our defense like we have the last five or
six games. But there's just little things we need to work on to become a
better team and come out firing.  
CAMERON CLARK: We just got too comfortable, I feel like. We've just gotta come
out more aggressive from the start. Playing like we've got something to lose.
I feel like we just didn't come out there ready to play. And we just gotta
learn from this and see where we place in the tournament Sunday.  
  
Q. Were you surprised? Because you told us yesterday they were pretty giddy,
pretty excited about the postseason. So did this effort surprise you or was it
like what Baylor did, like hitting first, like Ryan said?  
COACH KRUGER: I think Baylor affected the way we played, for sure. We had
three or four really good days of practice in preparation and guys were
anxious to play. I think Baylor, again, got into us early, especially on the
boards. They got quicker to loose balls, dictated with Austin's presence
inside. I think that had more of an effect on us than us not wanting to play.
I thought we entered the ballgame in the right frame of mind, but I thought
Baylor dictated.  
  
Q. You talked about how much you liked your team's fight. Was it just too
much of a deficit to come back from?  
COACH KRUGER: The second half, most teams are going to compete like crazy when
you dig yourselves a hole. Our guys did that. I thought they were more active
defensively the second half. I thought it got a little frantic there
defensively, didn't quite change gears. We went to the offensive end and
didn't shoot it as well as needed to, especially against their zone. So we'll
learn from this. No one likes ‑‑ no one likes the result. No one likes the way
we played, necessarily. Again, credit Baylor for that, but we have to learn
from it and play better next week.  
  
Q. We always talk about seeding for the NCAA tournament, where you're going
to be seeded, where you're going to be seeded. Is it more important who you'll
be matched up with more so than any particular number of seed?  
COACH KRUGER: In most years it probably is. You know, certain matchups might
be size or a pressing team or depending on what teams are comfortable with or
not comfortable with.  
The number in front of a name this year is probably maybe because of the great
balance and the depth of teams in the country, may not be quite as significant
as other years. But regardless, we've got to line up and win some battles and
play better than we did tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, the old adage it's tough to beat the same team three times in one
year. How much is that a true statement and how does that affect a team?  
COACH KRUGER: It's tough to beat good teams three times. Baylor's a good team.
They've won nine out of their last ten now, playing with confidence and
playing well, and I thought that showed tonight. They opened the ballgame with
that confidence that level of attitude about what they wanted to get
accomplished.  
And, again, I don't think necessarily beating a team three times, except when
it's a good team, it's really hard. And Baylor's a good team.  
  
Q. How does this affect pickup going into next week in terms of just
momentum, because you were playing so well and does this affect it at all? Is
this a different game?  
COACH KRUGER: It won't affect our momentum that we had. I think, if anything,
we should have more focus on how we have to play and what we have to do and
learn from this game. I thought this is a great opportunity to‑‑ again, I
don't like the result, but when you lose a ballgame you have to learn from it.
And we've got a lot ahead, and we've got a few days in preparation for
whatever comes next week.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously not the way you wanted to come out and play tonight, but
considering the fact you've got a few extra days off, how much of a benefit
can that be going into the NCAA tournament?  
COACH KRUGER: We'd rather be playing if we had the two choices, of course. But
we'll get back to Oklahoma City, Norman, tomorrow and probably shoot it a
little bit, work out on Saturday, and find out what's happening on Sunday,
then a couple days of practice next week.  
At this time of year, our guys understand what we need to do. And I think
tonight maybe reinforced that a little bit hopefully in a positive way.  
  
Q. Can you project how playing in this year's Big 12 might be able to
prepare you for the NCAA?  
COACH KRUGER: Well, arguably and certainly our thoughts is best conference in
the country, and every night you line up it's against a really good team. A
lot of different styles in the league, some smaller teams, some bigger teams.  
So really it has to prepare you well. The balance, the depth of really good
players in the league, it's tough every night. So we know when you go to NCAA
tournament play, you expect it to be tough but we've also been through that
grind and hopefully we've benefited from it.  
  
Q. Back to Baylor's size, it appeared tonight that size mattered as much for
Baylor on offense as defense. They've got a lot of easy shots, five dunks and
three uncontested layups, and most of that was their big guys getting easy
stuff. Can you talk about how hard it was to just keep them from easy shots?  
COACH KRUGER: They won the battles early. I thought they set the tone early.
They established post position. Our big guys, Ryan and Cam and D.J. and Tyler
did a good job of fighting size all year long.  
Today we didn't win that battle. Again, I thought their big guys early
established that they were going to catch where they wanted to and we doubled
a little bit in there early, but still they made plays at the rim that they
didn't do in the other two ball games.  
So, again, they're playing well. I think confidence might be a lot of that
right now, the fact that they're on a good roll and playing with a high level
of confidence, and they won those battles.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas  66  
West Virginia - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the Texas Longhorns and Coach Rick Barnes and
student‑athletes Javan Felix and Jonathan Holmes. Coach?  
COACH BARNES: First half I thought we were defensively really, really good, as
good as we've been in a while. And even offensively it gave us a chance to get
out and get in the open court.  
And these two guys certainly had a lot to do with that, but I really thought
that Demarcus Holland was terrific for us doing what we needed him to do and
even Kendal Yancy off the bench, but we got a really good effort from a lot of
different guy.  
  
Q. Could you talk about how the quick start really put them on their heels
and you all set the tone with the first 12 points?  
JAVAN FELIX: We've been‑‑ lately we've been coming out second‑guessing
ourselves and not being aggressive. We just wanted to get back to being
aggressive and attacking from the very beginning. And I think we did a good
job of that at the start of the game and kind of carried over throughout the
game.  
  
Q. Jonathan, for being a team that needed momentum the last few weeks, does
this help you get back to feeling how you were towards the beginning of the
year?  
JONATHAN HOLMES: I think we had some momentum coming into the weekend, looking
forward to all these games. I think it went like this and can definitely carry
over into some good momentum heading into tomorrow night and the rest of this
week, and the NCAA tournament next week.  
COACH BARNES: It's obvious I played John too many minutes this year. He gets a
lot more done in 18 minutes than he does in 28. (Laughter)  
  
Q. West Virginia's win over Kansas, did that really grab your guys'
attention, because you had done well against them this year?  
JAVAN FELIX: Our league is very competitive and anybody can beat anybody in
any given night. And it's something that surprises us, it's just something
that we knew they were capable of doing. We just didn't want to let it happen
to us tonight.  
  
Q. Jon, talk about Baylor. They had a very convincing win today over
Oklahoma. And just the matchup with Isaiah Austin inside?  
JONATHAN HOLMES: They're kind of like us. They have length. They have size.
They have depth. They play hard. It's going to be a tough game. We know what
we need to do. The game's probably going to be controlled. Whoever controls
the boards is probably going to have the upper hand. We have to get our rest
tonight and watch some film on them and get ready for them tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Jon, what exactly did you guys do to be successful against Baylor? You're
the only team to beat them during this run they've had. I think they've won
nine of their last ten, but what were you guys exactly successful in doing?  
JONATHAN HOLMES: I think we came out ready to play mentally. We executed. We
didn't play perfect, but we just found a way to get things done and so we're
going to have to do that tomorrow to be successful.  
  
Q. Were you a little surprised it was almost too easy?  
COACH BARNES: Oh, yeah. You go into a game expecting it to be a really close
game. You always do, even when you have a lead. You just know that your
opponent has a chance because of the 3‑point line, and then you're hoping your
guys don't get relaxed and help them by turning the ball over and getting
sloppy, which the guys at 10 didn't do a very good job. Again, defensively we
were good, transition defense was good. And I thought we did a pretty good job
for the most part, but you don't expect it to be easy. You never expect that.  
  
Q. Rick, how important was it being able to keep the minutes down? I know
Jonathan only played 18 minutes. Nobody was overly extended.  
COACH BARNES: It was important. And we've actually talked about it as a staff
a lot, because we gave our guys some time off. We knew they were a little
tired, obviously, after the regular season.  
But we wanted to get Isaiah's minutes cut back as much as anybody's, as well
as Jon's, and he kind of helped us by getting in foul trouble. But we're able
to do that because we've got some really good play from the bench and solid
things in terms of the execution that we were looking for.  
And, again, it goes back, I thought defensively we were really tuned in. But
Jon, I've said before, he needs‑‑ he's one of those guys that needs reps. But
tonight they only ended up with, what, 18 minutes? He probably would have
liked to play a little bit more, but this is the way it worked out and it was
good.  
  
Q. On the side there, you guys talking with Isaiah, looked like he just
needed to breathe and relax a little. Looked like Isaiah just needed to
relax?  
COACH BARNES: That's what I told him. When he went back in the game, he was
upset about his third foul, which was one of those bang, bang plays. And then
one of them was‑‑ he actually made a nice cut, but he really started
pressuring, putting pressure on himself, and I just ‑‑ before I left to come
down here, I told him, I said, when you have a lead like that, if you're as
smart as I think you are, you wouldn't go in there and try to throw up some
crazy shot and get hurt. You wouldn't do that. But I do think he's pressing.  
I mean, there's no doubt he needs to relax. But I think, too, I just told him
I think you've got to put a little more focus in it to get ready and know that
you've got to feel the game. You can't have a predetermined thought of how you
think it's going to be played all the time.  
But he definitely was‑‑ when it didn't go well for him early, he started
pressing. To me, again, I told him the thing you look at that tells you that
is just the fact that he had, what, five turnovers. He turned it over, I think
he had four at halftime.  
  
Q. You've been pretty adamant that the team hasn't lost any confidence over
the past month. Did the guys need to be reminded how good they were and that
they could beat a good team like this?  
COACH BARNES: Not really, I'm telling you. We just talk about execution and
that's what we haven't done at times when we've‑‑ I do think we got a little
lax. I don't think we lost confidence. But Javan said that‑‑ what did he say
about coming out? I don't know what his thought was. I mean, I can go back and
I showed him it's all about execution, spacing and doing the things that we
practiced.  
But, you know, I don't know. I think they've had a good‑‑ I've never worried
about their confidence. I can be honest with you, I never have. Maybe I'm not
in tune with them as I think I should be or whatever. But they've never made
me feel like they weren't confident. And I've never really had a problem with
that.  
My problem or my from a coaching standpoint, it's always about execution, the
details. That's what it's always been about. And tonight we were good with the
details tonight.  
  
Q. How big was the zone, keeping Harris and Staten out of the lane for your
overall success?  
COACH BARNES: Well, again, the key to Staten was the transition, getting back.
And we did ‑‑ again, our big guys did a good job doing that. That was
obviously has always been the point of emphasis, to try to get everybody back
and get our defense set. And we've done the best job we've done all year the
last two games getting our hands up in the zone. And by doing that we've
extended, too, based on the scouting report, who we needed to get out there.  
And a couple of nice plays, really when the ball went inside. We're not going
to keep teams from getting a shot every time. But we stretched it out and the
sides were good and getting their hands up. It's a big zone, especially when
we get Jon at the 3 and Martez up top. That's a pretty big zone.  
  
Q. Just about Baylor, anything you can point out specifically that worked
for you guys the first two matchups? And do you see any big changes in the way
they played over the last month?  
COACH BARNES: One, my memory's not that good about either one of the games,
other than I know the one at home, it was a one‑possession game and Kenny
Chery controlled the entire second half. The first half we were pretty good.
The second half they beat us. And, again, it was really a one‑possession game.
And my thought, the only thing I can remember ‑‑ because I can remember saying
to the guys throughout the game that he had totally controlled the game in the
second half.  
But you think about a team that's picked one of the top three teams in the
league, what, somebody just said they won nine out of ten and playing great
basketball at the right time.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  78  
Oklahoma - 73

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor, Coach Scott Drew, student‑athletes,
Kenny Chery, Cory Jefferson and Isaiah Austin. Coach?  
COACH DREW: A lot more happier coach today from the standpoint I thought our
guys really defended a lot better. First half was fun to watch. I thought we
really executed well.  
But it all starts taking care of the ball on the defensive end, and I think,
again, we shot 50percent for a reason, shared the ball, and got high
percentage shots. But really, really proud of how these guys competed today.  
  
Q. Isaiah, it seemed like every time they took the ball inside, they'd throw
it back out. I mean, was that kind of the hope that they'd shoot a lot of 3
‑pointers, that they wouldn't try to get much inside?  
ISAIAH AUSTIN: I think they changed their game plan a little bit from the
first half, because we were blocking shots and we were contesting a lot of
those shots and not giving them anything easy.  
So really, in the second half, they just wanted to drive and get me out there
so they could kick it for an easy 3.  
  
Q. Isaiah and Cory, looked like you guys did a better job when they doubled
finding an open man, did you change something from the last two times you
played or did you just execute better?  
ISAIAH AUSTIN: Our guards just got to their Xs, the spots they were supposed
to be in, so it was easy for us to pass it to them.  
CORY JEFFERSON: It's also something we worked on. We knew they would double
us, so we've been working on it throughout the season. A lot of teams have
doubled us throughout the conference play, so we just worked on it in practice
and got better with it. And it showed out there on the court.  
  
Q. Kenny, could you just talk about when Isaiah is both blocking shots
inside like he did the first half and also finishing inside like he was, how
that just changes things for you guys?  
KENNY CHERY: It changes the game a lot. Those guys are our key. We need them
every day. And without them, what else can we do? When we get breaked down, we
need them to block shots, we need them to contest shots or make shots harder,
and that's what they did.  
  
Q. Isaiah, I know the season you've had has been up and down a little bit
this year. Have you come into the postseason with a different mindset or frame
of mind after the struggles you had early on to put a good ending on this
season?  
ISAIAH AUSTIN: A little bit. My grandfather passed yesterday, I found out
yesterday, so I've just been trying to play for him, trying to play aggressive
for him. My teammates have been pushing me hard in practice and they've been
telling me they need more out of me. So I'm just trying to produce for them.  
  
Q. Kenny, can you talk about handling the press? You did turn it over a
couple times against it, but you guys were able to beat it for buckets. Did
you get a little nervous there at the end, I guess?  
KENNY CHERY: I didn't get nervous at all. I've got confidence in my teammates.
All we had to do was make adjustments, and that's exactly what we did when we
came out of timeout. And our guys handled the press really well because they
did not meet the ball pretty hard and Royce, Brady and Gary, Isaiah coming up,
Cory and everybody handled the press pretty well.  
  
Q. Kenny, can you just talk about the balance you had, scoring, seemed like
you all really did a good job of distributing the ball around?  
KENNY CHERY: That's where we're at our best, when we're sharing the ball, when
everybody gets touches and when everybody touches the ball, especially when
guys like Isaiah, Cory, Rico, TP, Royce, everybody on the team, you could get
passes from anybody.  
And we had a large amount of assists today which means‑‑ we had 16, 16 assists
today, and that's pretty good. And that's the type of team we are. That's
playing Baylor basketball.  
  
Q. For all of you guys, I know Oklahoma had your number for the first two
games, how much did it mean for you, do you think, by jumping on them like you
did to get some early confidence away? Was it 10 ‑0 or 12‑0 or something, but
going out jumping on them quick like that?  
CORY JEFFERSON: It meant a lot. Like you said, they beat us the first two
games, and Coach Drew always said it's hard to beat a team three times. I'm
sure they knew that. They were prepared. We made sure we were going to be
prepared. The main focus was just being ready, knowing our defensive, the
defensive end, that's really what got us going was our defense.  
KENNY CHERY: Like Cory said, they beat us the last two games. And like Coach
has been saying, we can't dwell on the past, we have to think about today. We
just thought about today. We didn't think about the last two games. We came
out hard, aggressive, had a different mindset and we just played our game.  
  
Q. You played so well for 25, 30 minutes, was it just a matter of you knew
they were going to make a run and you had to withstand it?  
COACH DREW: No question, Oklahoma's a great team. They score in bunches. They
turn you over with their pressure. So that's why it was important to have a
lead and have an opportunity to make a mistake or two and still be okay.  
  
Q. Kind of a similar question I asked Kenny about Isaiah, when he's playing
like that at both ends, seemed like he took Oklahoma's bigs out of the game
and then first seven points of the second half. When he's playing like that,
how much tougher does your team become?  
COACH DREW: No question defensively he's been in our 9 and 1, very good. But
offensively, when he goes 8 for 12 and 2 for 4 from 3, he's capable of that,
but when he does that, that adds a whole other dimension to our offense.  
  
Q. They got after you guys pretty good on the perimeter the first couple of
games. What did you do specifically to try and keep them from being as
effective as they were the first timeout?  
COACH DREW: I thought we adjusted defensively a couple of things. And at the
end of the day, too, I hate to say it but if you contest a shot and it's a
good shooter, there's a chance it's still going to go in.  
They missed some shots. They shot 35 3s. They could have made 18. They could
have made 10. Our job was just to make them as difficult as possible, try to
limit them to one and done and not give them easy ones.  
For the most part, we did a pretty good job of that. We had a couple of
situations, obviously. We left people more open than they needed to be. But at
the end of the day, Buddy Hield didn't have five 3s in the first five minutes
or seven minutes this time, so we made strides.  
  
Q. 38 minutes tonight for Kenny, were you planning on playing him that much
or was it just the bench didn't really give you much and you had to play him a
lot?  
COACH DREW: Well, I think probably the last ten minutes of the game, you could
see OU had done a pretty good job fatiguing us. And Kenny did a great job for
the amount of minutes that he played.  
But I thought that's where at the end of the game, our coaching staff's
always‑‑ when we're 2 and 8, we've always liked these guys. They have a great
chemistry. They're good kids. They've got big hearts and I think they showed
that down the stretch.  
  
Q. The balance you had tonight and then Royce getting his second straight
double ‑double, how big is that getting that kind of production?  
COACH DREW: That's that clean connection, Royce and Cory. I think both of them
made big plays and both of them really were focused and really been great
these last ten games.  
  
Q. You've now tied the career record at Baylor of 201 wins as a coach.
Considering where your program started, does that mean a lot to you?  
COACH DREW: I think it means that we've had a lot of good players and they've
all played for Baylor University and played well for the school and
represented it the right way.  
I think any coaching honor is a direct reflection of the players because none
of us coaches have made any buckets. So it's all the players' work.  
  
Q. At the risk of jinxing you, is this the best you guys ‑‑  
COACH DREW: Don't do that, Blair.  
  
Q. Is this the best you guys have played all year?  
COACH DREW: There's some stretches. We've played pretty well in the last ten
games, and early in the year there were some stretches we played real well. So
I know it's the best we played against Oklahoma, that's for sure.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on either Texas or West Virginia tomorrow; do you have a
preference or what are you expecting to see from them?  
COACH DREW: That's the great thing about the tournament this year: You knew
coming in that, to me, more wide open than it's ever been. And it doesn't
matter who you play, it's going to be a war. And I mean, that's what makes
this year's tournament so exciting, in my opinion.  
I mean, you've got a chance for 80percent of the league to be playing in the
NCAA tournament. I mean, that's phenomenal. So to answer your question, it
doesn't matter, because both of them are outstanding teams. We're just glad
we're playing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  76  
TCU - 68

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor University Head Coach Scott Drew and his
two student‑athletes Royce O'Neale and Cory Jefferson. Coach, your thoughts on
tonight's game.  
COACH DREW: Happy with the win. Disappointed with how we defended from the
last five minutes of the first half through the second half.  
We weren't nearly as good as we've been nor need to be. But at the end of the
day we got the win, which is important. Our offense, nine turnovers at half
was way too many, but four in the second half was much better.  
Rebounding‑wise, first two times played TCU, we did a great job limiting them
to second chance points. Tonight they had 18, which is way too many.  
So really credit to TCU. I thought they had a great game plan, played hard,
competed.  
I think our guys are happy with the win, but know that we have to play better
and look forward to having that opportunity tomorrow.  
  
Q. Scott, your thoughts on number 200, that's a nice round number for you?  
COACH DREW: Again, excited for the win, any win in the Big 12 is a great one.
As far as 200, it just says that I'm getting older.  
  
Q. They got to six or seven, I can't remember exactly which in the second
half, and then Prince went on that tear. I think he had eight straight points
on two 3 ‑point plays and another inside. Can you talk about the lift he gave
you guys?  
COACH DREW: I think TCU is scoring bunches and he's done that this year,
giving us spurts, and it was good to see him tonight do the same.  
  
Q. Did that give you guys a lift?  
COACH DREW: No question. It was‑‑ I don't know if that mic is working, so can
you hear me better now?  
CORY JEFFERSON: Definitely gave us a lift. He's always the player to come in
give us energy on the court, hustle player. And like you said, he scored in
spurts and that's what the team needs, and he brings that.  
  
Q. Royce, you guys came out with a lot of energy, got up 15 ‑3, did you feel
like there was a lapse after that, or was that more TCU?   
ROYCE O'NEALE: I think probably both ways. We kind of stopped getting
deflections on defense, but they also played hard because we knew they were
going to play hard from the beginning. So credit to TCU for staying in the
game.  
  
Q. Cory, Oklahoma is up next for you guys, you played them twice this year,
probably should have beat them in the first matchup at home. Can you talk a
little bit about them and what it's going to take to beat them tomorrow?  
CORY JEFFERSON: It's just going to be another Big 12 battle. Both teams are
going to be ready. Like you said, they've got us both times. It was a close
one at our house. So we're going to come out tomorrow, try to get a win.
They're going to be ready to play us. Obviously they don't want to lose. So
it's just going to be a good game.  
  
Q. Cory, early in the game you guys were kind of pounding it inside. Did
they do anything to take that away or did you feel like you went away from
that at all?  
CORY JEFFERSON: No. We just‑‑ once you go inside, it opens up the outside. And
we went inside the first half, and the outside opened up in the second half.  
  
Q. Scott, I was asking them about it, you guys came out with a lot of energy
right at the start. Did you feel like it kind of lapsed a little bit after
that?  
COACH DREW: And I thought I rotated a little bit more than I've been doing in
the last couple of games. And sometimes it's the worst thing, when you get out
to a lead, and we've played two games against TCU, done very well.  
And credit them. I thought they really made big shots, a lot of late shot
clock baskets. And then we had opportunities to get some rebounds that they
made great hustle plays and came up with them or we didn't secure them. We'll
have to watch film and see why we didn't get more of those rebounds that were
critical to extend the lead.  
  
Q. To have the advantage you did, rebounding and points in the paint, a
little bit disconcerting to still have the thin margin of victory when you see
some of those stats?  
COACH DREW: No, actually, we were ‑‑ the first two games we played them, we
were better in both of those areas. So that's what we do.  
The 13 turnovers, we've been better lately. Thirteen is more than we've had.
And nine in the first half, that hurt us because we shot 52percent. And when
you're getting offensive rebounds and shooting well, you gotta get shots up.
So that number hurt us.  
And then the other thing, I thought we didn't shoot the 3 as well as we've
been shooting it, 30percent. We had some looks that we've been making and we
didn't make.  
  
Q. Did you consciously extend your rotation tonight, knowing what you've got
during the rest of the tournament?  
COACH DREW: Well, I think wanting to keep guys fresh for today's game, and you
also do think big picture. But I thought in the first two games, when we had
gone to the bench, we had extended the lead. And I thought tonight it slowed
the momentum down.  
So, again, credit them for really playing well and us not defending as well,
getting stops, getting rebounds and doing what we did the first two times we
faced them. And I was saying that based on the last few games we played the
rotation, I hadn't subbed as much, as quick.  
  
Q. Are you going to have to shoot the 3 better to be able to move forward in
this tournament?  
COACH DREW: I think the first thing we've gotta do is defend a lot better. So
that's the easiest thing. We gave up 54percent in the second half. That gets
you sent home in a hurry. So that's the number one thing we have to do. And
then shooting, we can‑‑ you win games shooting 30percent from 3. You can't win
not defending.  
  
Q. As disappointed as you might act like you are now about the performance,
compare this to how you felt last year when you lost on that 3 ‑point, didn't
go down, and just how different a year makes?  
COACH DREW: I thought I was positive. I like your attitude. You can ask as
many questions as you want tonight.  
But definitely, you know what, any win in the Big 12, we understand what a
great league it is. To win and advance in the Big 12 tournament is something
that I know these players remember a lifetime. So most important part is to
survive and advance. We did that tonight. Thank you.  
  
Q. Despite kind of the second half sluggish performance, do you think maybe
it's kind of a good thing that the team had to play a game like this to kind
of maybe wake them up for the rest of the tournament?  
COACH DREW: I'll let you know after tomorrow.  
  
Q. I know it's just right after this one, but can you talk about the OU
matchup, you guys have faced them two times, playing them again for a third
time?  
COACH DREW: Well, the last time we faced them, they might have had 13 3s by
halftime. So we're going to have to do a much better job stopping their 3s.  
And after that, then making sure‑‑ offensively, we were pretty good in the
second game, but defensively in the two losses the first half we were great at
our place, the second half they got hot again from 3. So maybe we'll have to
play more man tomorrow. We'll figure that out tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma State  80  
Texas Tech - 62

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Texas Tech, Coach Tubby Smith and
student‑athletes Dejan Kravic and Jaye Crockett. Coach?  
COACH SMITH: Well, it's a rude awakening, first experience here at this Big 12
tournament. But we got off to a good start there, just really disappointed in
how we responded to the pressure.  
But a lot of credit goes out to Oklahoma State. They were ready. They really,
really became a lot more aggressive and took us out of our game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Jaye, there were a couple times out there you yourself looked really
frustrated. Just talk about kind of what Coach alluded to the last 12, 10
minutes of the first half and just kind of how the rest of the game went?  
JAYE CROCKETT: It's just so frustrating when you put so much into it, and then
we just got down and we just weren't following the rules that Coach wanted us
to stick to. He tells us to stick to the principles and do the fundamentals
every game.  
When you don't do that, and just make dumb mistakes, it gets really
frustrating.  
  
Q. Dejan, what was it about the full court pressure that threw you all for a
loop the first half?  
DEJAN KRAVIC: I think we were just rushing it too much. We didn't really meet
the passes. And like I said, we rushed it too much and we let it get in our
heads instead of just slowing it down.  
  
Q. Jaye, you went to the locker room with a knee injury. What was the
process like getting the diagnosis and whether you could come back?  
JAYE CROCKETT: The doctor wanted to make sure there wasn't anything torn in
there. Found out it was just kind of a bruised bone, but it's fine. The doctor
came and our trainer looked at it and they said it was fine, continue to play.  
  
Q. Dejan, you outrebound them 28 to 12 in the second half and also scored
more points in the paint then they did overall. How did you really take
advantage of the height advantage that you all had coming in?  
DEJAN KRAVIC: I mean, it was kind of the game plan. Our coach tells us to play
inside out. So our purpose was to just post up, post up real strong, look for
the ball outside, kick it out. If we don't, then go up aggressively.  
  
Q. Jaye, Marcus Smart, a lot of people talk about all the things that he
does on offense, but he looks like he's just a total ‑‑ wreaks havoc on
defense, got six steals tonight. What kind of an instigator is he on defense
in terms of disrupting your offense?  
JAYE CROCKETT: I think he's just really active. He continues to move, and he
has a big body. He's strong. He's kind of like a pest, like some small guys
that kind of get in there except he's big and he does it. He works hard during
the whole game, and he leads his team. He's out there talking the whole time.
He's really aggressive. That's what he does with his opponents. He's more
aggressive than them and works for them and gets them a lot of steals and
deflections on defense.  
  
Q. How different is that Oklahoma State team that you saw tonight than the
one you beat up in Lubbock about six weeks ago? What makes them different and
what kind of a challenge could they be if they get to the NCAA Tournament?  
JAYE CROCKETT: I wouldn't say they're too different. I think it was us. We
came in, we weren't as aggressive as they were. They were just making the
physical plays. And we made them when we were at home, we just didn't seem to
make them up here.  
You just lose at this level. When you're not the aggressive aggressor, then
you kind of slip up and the other team they can score off that. They get ‑‑
like I said, with Marcus Smart, he's aggressive on defense. He gets his team
steals and deflections and causes problems for our offense.  
  
Q. Jaye, what was the main difference between the play that started out 8
‑0, and then Oklahoma State pretty much took over the game with like a 23‑4
run?  
JAYE CROCKETT: We kept making unforced turnovers. We just kept giving them the
ball. That was something that we went over in our scouting report at Oklahoma
State. They had like 23 points off of turnovers and we knew that was something
we needed to stop with the turnovers and stop being so careless with the ball.
And we just went back to our old habits and it killed us in the end.  
  
Q. Oklahoma State didn't look like the same team that was in Lubbock. What
did you see as the biggest difference between how they were playing then and
how they're playing now?  
COACH SMITH: Well, I thought Jaye had a good point. It always takes two. And
we weren't‑‑ we were at home. We were playing better at the time. By that I
mean we were playing with a lot more confidence. We just haven't played with‑‑
today we're coming off‑‑ we were off seven out of our last eight games, so
we've been a little shaky for a while. Then we bounced back and had a good win
at home against Texas.  
But otherwise, we haven't been playing well. So you asked me that question,
and I just know that whatever issues Oklahoma State had, they corrected them.
And when you have a great player like Marcus Smart ‑‑ and Travis is a very
good coach, he understands what he has to do to get his team turned around,
and he did. He got them playing hard. They went to more trapping and pressing,
pressing and being more aggressive, and I think that was the key to their
turnaround.  
  
Q. You weren't really happy with your guys on ‑ball defense in the first
meeting in Stillwater. Did you see any improvement in that area in today's
game?  
COACH SMITH: Not really. Because we were so dysfunctional as far as executing,
and it's hard to‑‑ when you're always retreating because you turned the ball
over, your mindset is‑‑ you're making stupid plays offensively and just
reaching and fouling people on 3‑point shots. It negates any hustle, any
opportunities you might have.  
  
Q. The way the last month has gone, does that change how you feel about the
season overall and kind of the direction of things, where things are headed in
Lubbock?  
COACH SMITH: No, it doesn't change. We knew it was going to be a process. We
knew it was going to take time, but we expected to win more games, obviously,
and we had‑‑ we were giving ourselves a chance even in the tough losses
against Kansas, Kansas State at home, West Virginia, Iowa State. We were in a
lot of those games, but then the last‑‑ but we really never learned how to
execute in late game situations.  
And when that happened, we lost a lot of our confidence. And I think we've
been heading in the right direction. Obviously, the loss at Kansas and then
the loss here really didn't‑‑ I don't think it really is indicative of how
hard our kids have played and how they've overachieved in some ways.  
Having said that, I'm excited about the future and I think some of the
returning players are going to have to really step it up and improve in order
for us to be competitive in this league. With the new players we have coming
in, I think we're going to be okay.  
  
Q. You've had a chance to go through this league. You'll have seven or eight
teams going to the postseason. What exactly do you feel like you guys have got
to get better at heading forward?  
COACH SMITH: We've got to get better in a lot of areas. We certainly have to
get some outside shooting. We've really struggled shooting the ball from the
outside all year long, and we're trying to‑‑ and when you're not able to‑‑ we
try to throw it inside. We felt like our strength was our interior play, but
today and against good teams they find ways to double you and make other
people handle the ball and now you're not as good a passing team and they take
you out of your rhythm, out of your offense.  
So in order for us to compete in this league, we've gotta get better just
about in every position. I don't think that when I look‑‑ I thought today
Dejan really stepped up and played well. Jaye, he's a true Big 12 player, but
he's a fifth, fourth year guy. And Dejan, they're both mature and older guys,
but we need‑‑ like my staff are working hard to recruit good players that I
think can compete at this level. Not that the other guys can't, it's just it's
been a real challenging process to change and to change the culture and change
the attitude about what it takes to be a winning team.  
  
Q. What difference did Jaye Crockett make in the second half for your
team?  
COACH SMITH: Well, Jaye's our heart and soul. He plays with everything. He
gives it everything he has. He's a young man that will play at the next level.
Maybe not at the NBA, but he's certainly one of the most gifted players I've
had the good fortune to coach over the years, and he's got excellent
leadership skills, skilled offensively.  
He struggled with some tendonitis in his knees the last month, and even today
he had a little twist of his knee. And I'm glad to see he was okay and it
wasn't any real serious injury.  
So, no, it's been a good year for us, good to get here. I think we've got the
right people on track. I've lost my train of thought again. I'm sorry. But
it's been a great experience to be here. I know Big 12 does it the right way.
Very impressed with the hospitality and how this tournament is being run. So
thank you all for the hospitality.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma State  80  
Texas Tech - 62

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with Oklahoma State, Coach Travis Ford,
two student‑athletes Markel Brown and Marcus Smart. Coach, an opening comment
on tonight's victory.  
COACH FORD: Proud of the win, proud of the effort. Thought we got after it
defensively in the first half, after we got out to a slow start, obviously,
and a little bit mud. But I wasn't overly concerned about it.  
I thought we would get into the flow, but our defense really started causing
some turnovers. These guys were very, very active, very active defensively in
the first half, not quite as much the second half.  
And I thought we ran our offense for the first time pretty complete for 40
minutes. Pretty good for 40 minutes. We took good shots.  
We had good possessions, and we've got a lot of respect for Texas Tech. That's
a really good basketball team, a big physical team.  
So a good win for our team. Didn't rebound the ball very well in the second
half. But hopefully we saved a few.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes first.  
  
Q. Marcus, how important was Markel's leadership throughout the year with
all the different challenges that this program has had? And the second
question after that is for Markel. How much responsibility did you take upon
yourself to be a leader during those tough times?  
MARCUS SMART: You know, it was tremendous on his part, especially everything
that this team has been going through.  
You know, we needed that type of leadership, him being the senior captain on
this team. He stood up and took responsibility when we needed it. It not only
helped him but helped his team in a variety of ways. We're playing better
basketball and part of it is because of him.  
MARKEL BROWN: I think stepping up was crucial for me, because I've been in
those situations before with this ball club. I've been in some tough
situations, and I was able to fight out of it.  
So being there, to help them, cheer them on, to let them know that we can
fight another day was huge for me because the knowledge I have and these guys
have been on this team and they've been around us for a long time.  
Marcus, second year here. And he kind of knows the background of this team,
and he knows how to fight out of situations like that also.  
So I think we just came together as a team at the right time and now we're
moving a step forward.  
  
Q. Marcus, about tonight's game, you were down 8 ‑0\. What were your
thoughts then, and then you came, went on a big like 17‑1 run. Took over
defensively, a lot of and‑1s. Take us through the first half when you knocked
them out?  
MARCUS SMART: We've been playing very well on the defensive end lately. And we
looked at each other, and we looked over at the bench at Coach Ford. You could
see he was a little disgusted how we were playing defensively, which was
understood, because this team understands that we're a very well defensive
team, and we can turn people over. And we can press the pressure around
people.  
And we understood that Texas Tech was going to come out and give us a punch.
We had to sustain it. We were a little slow. We looked at Coach and we
decided, you know, huddled everybody up, me and Markel, and we told them it's
8‑0\. We already know what Texas Tech is coming to do. They threw a punch and
we have to throw one back and keep fighting, and that's what we did.  
  
Q. Markel, could you talk about that first half, because you guys were
struggling offensively. You hit a couple of 3s. Looked like you were trying to
make some things happen. You were kind of ‑‑ you were looking for your shot
more during that period.   
MARKEL BROWN: I was just playing with the flow. I seen that our offense wasn't
clicking in the first eight minutes. And I just wanted to go out there and
make a play for our team.  
And once I started making shots, that opened up things for other players, and
that's when our defense came along. Marcus ended up with six steals tonight,
which was huge, and we was able to pressure the ball and find the shots we
needed.  
  
Q. Marcus, Markel mentioned your steals. You got a bunch of picks in the
first half that led to run ‑outs and easy layups. Do you see those coming? Are
they stuff you see on film? Are they just the feel of the game? How are you
able to get so many steals?  
MARCUS SMART: You know, our coaching staff always talk to us about being at
the right place at the right time and, you know, extra efforts. And, you know,
it's kind of what it was tonight. I just kept giving it extra effort, helping
anybody that needed help and recovering back and just being in the right place
at the right time and being active.  
And I came up with six steals and, you know, they were some major steals at
crucial times, and it's not just me out there, though, you have Brian
Williams, Markel Brown, Phil Forte, those guys up front, they're out there
applying the pressure, allowing me to roam in the backfield and to come up
with those steals.  
  
Q. Both of you, in the first half, especially, looked like you guys were
comfortable. You were having some fun on the floor. With everything that's
been going on this year, is this the most comfortable you've been as a group
and therefore are you playing your best ball now?  
MARCUS SMART: Definitely. You know, we have had a lot of downfalls this year
in this season but, you know, everything happens for a reason. It was a big
learning point for this basketball team. It tested our character.  
And, you know, to see how we was going to respond, we came out and responded
in a way that we expected to respond, and we came out, we gelled together as a
team. That's all the coaching staff talked about, when your backs are up
against the wall, all you can do is lean on your teammates. And that's what we
did, and we started gelling at the right time.  
MARKEL BROWN: I honestly think that we're playing good right now, but our best
basketball is still to come.  
I feel like we still have little small mistakes that we can adjust, and that
will make us a better team, and I think our best basketball is still ahead of
us.  
  
Q. Did that feel like Oklahoma State basketball out there? Did it feel like
the guys were running up and down the floor and stealing the ball and having
fun, things like that? Did it feel good after some of the things you guys went
through this year?  
COACH FORD: I think we've been playing like that lately. How we played tonight
was the same way we played against them the second time around, which was six
games, five games ago. We did it against TCU a little bit. We've been very
aggressive the last five or six games.  
So that's why I really wasn't‑‑ I was upset how we got started, but I wasn't
overly concerned. I thought we would get into a flow.  
But, yeah, I agree that's when we're at our best, when we're out there being
aggressive and playing as a team. Our chemistry is good right now. When we
weren't playing well, the chemistry wasn't there and their chemistry is much
better right now.  
So I think even last game, I thought we played well. And so I was pleased with
how we played, especially how we started, came back, playing in the tournament
game. We got a lot of respect for Texas Tech.  
You look at the teams they've beaten and the games they've been in for us, I
was concerned about this game, especially because we beat them pretty good the
second time. It's tough. It's tough. And I was very happy with the way our
guys responded. Very pleased.  
  
Q. When you look back at this season, all the challenges you all have had,
where would this team be without Markel Brown?  
COACH FORD: That's a good question. I think Markel Brown is one of the premier
players in the country. What he does for our basketball team, we asked him to
play three different positions. He played point guard probably 15 minutes of
the game tonight. Obviously when Marcus was out, he played point guard for
every game for 40 some minutes every game, went overtime one game.  
And we asked him to score. We asked him to defend. We asked him to do a lot.
But he's one of the more versatile scorers in the country, scores in a variety
of ways. Best pullup game in America. Knocking down 3s. I was a little upset
with his free throws tonight, but we made them in the second half.  
But, no, Markel Brown is an extremely valuable piece‑‑ he's a senior, the only
senior on our basketball team. People forget that. He's our only senior. And
right now he's acting like a senior.  
He's what you would want. You look at his numbers every year, he's improving
every year, and I think he's got a great future at the next level as well.  
  
Q. Travis, the way you played defensive pressure out on the perimeter, a
team as undersized as you are, is that what you have to do to succeed at a big
time level, is pressure the ball the way you guys did?  
COACH FORD: It has a little bit to do with it. We still need to rebound the
ball better, period. The second half I wasn't very happy with the rebounding;
but, yeah, we need to get after it defensively.  
For the most part, we've had pretty good defensive numbers throughout the
year. We just need to add a little bit of rebounding to it. We're getting some
stops, but we're just not rewarding ourselves. We need to get after it
defensively, need to get after it.  
  
Q. The second half, that lead was hanging right around 15, 16 points. What's
the thought process? As the clock's winding down, you're thinking possibly
into the future you've got to win four in four days to win this tournament,
any of that start to go through your mind or where you start to pull guys
out?  
COACH FORD: I wasn't crazy how we played, but we kept it right there where we
needed to. We weren't rebounding the ball well. I wanted our guys to play out
of that.  
I wanted them to get on a run and feel good about themselves and bring them
out of the game. But we never really ‑‑ Phil Forte made some 3s to stretch it
back out.  
But to answer your question, yes and no. Yes, I understand we need to rest
them up, but no excuses. They're 18, 19. Whatever the next game is, there's no
excuses, we need to play. I'm not going to sit here tomorrow‑‑ you know, we
don't need to even think about that.  
Other than get our guys off their feet. But, hey, these guys should be excited
about being able to play in another game. So not overly concerned about it.
But you gotta pay attention to it.  
  
Q. You do have another game against Kansas without Joel Embiid. You took
care of them last time. Talk about that matchup tomorrow.  
COACH FORD: One of the great teams in the country, and they've proven it all
year long. Big 12 champs. And Embiid, I think, is one of the‑‑ I've said it
before, one of the more special players. I think in four or five years he
might be one of the best players in the world.  
But they have other options. They've got plenty of guys to turn to that have
stepped up. Black has played really well in the absence of Embiid. They've got
other guys, Traylor and Lucas, that can come in. Perry Ellis.  
You're always going to miss a player like Embiid. He's special. But they've
got guys they can turn to and that can pick it up for them.  
So we understand the challenge is going to be an incredible challenge. We have
a lot of respect for Kansas, and we understand how good they are.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  76  
TCU - 68

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by TCU Head Coach Trent Johnson and
student‑athletes Karviar Shepherd and Kyan Anderson. Coach, your thoughts on
tonight's game.  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, Baylor's a good basketball team. Obviously they caused a
lot of problems. They're real fast athleticism and their skill level. But for
the most part all year long I think everybody understands the situation we're
involved in, and for these guys, especially these two to my right, I think
they've done an exceptional job of staying the course, being coachable and
fighting through.  
I look out there and I got Thomas Montigel as a walk‑on at 6'2", about 200,
and he's doing the best job he can possibly do to keep Austin off the paint
and off the block. You know what, in athletics, one thing that is real easy to
do is quit when you're undermatched ‑‑ overmatched, excuse me, and you have a
lot of adversity during the course of a season. And I'm a firm believer that
adversity reveals your character as opposed to build it. And this is a group
that has a lot of character and for the most part they competed their tail
off.  
I wish we could have broke through, but it is what it is, and Kyan did an
unbelievable job keeping us in games all year long in league play versus great
players and great teams and well coached teams. And Karviar, for him to be in
a situation like he was all year long in league play, playing multiple minutes
and playing the post, speaks volumes to our future.  
And like I told them, we had two guys who gave us everything in Jarvis and
Thomas and very competitive, great leaders, great kids. And we will learn from
what happened this year and we will meet March17th individually and
collectively and move forward and get ready for next year.  
  
Q. Both of you could you talk about what it was like, you got things going
there in the second half and got interesting, what got the offense clicking
there down the stretch?  
KARVIAR SHEPHERD: We just played mostly through the coach, coaching staff, and
they draw up good plays in the timeouts and during halftime, and we just went
by what they wanted us to do and getting open spots and take good shots and
that's what we did.  
KYAN ANDERSON: I felt the second half we did a good job rebounding the ball on
the defensive end which led to more fastbreak opportunities for us as a team.
And we were able to knock down shots in the second half better than we did in
the first half. So got us going a little bit.  
  
Q. They've gotten after you pretty good the first two games inside and on
the boards. You did a lot better job today than in those two games. What
specifically do you feel like you were able to improve on to make it closer in
this game today?  
KARVIAR SHEPHERD: We just played harder this game. We knew that it was going
to be tough for us to come out and just not give it our all on our last game
or, you know, in this tournament. And we just came out and gave our all for
our two seniors. And it just fell out with a loss.  
But we're going to learn from this and, like we did from the two games, before
we're going to learn from this and come back next year and work out and do
what we gotta do to win games.  
KYAN ANDERSON: Like Karviar said, we just try hard in this game, put forth
more effort this game to rebound. We knew that they dominated the boards in
the first two games, so we made it important to try to get, made it important
this game to rebound. And we did a pretty good job.  
  
Q. Kyan, next season how much fun is going to be playing with a full deck
against the Big 12?  
KYAN ANDERSON: It should be a lot of fun. If we can stay healthy and
consistent with our weapons, it will be a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to
it. Like we've been saying, we're going to learn from this year. We don't want
to feel like this next year. So it's me, Coach and Karviar's job to get these
guys ready. We went through one round and seen how it is, now it's time to
focus up and try to get a run next year.  
  
Q. Karviar, looking ahead next year, how much you guys are looking forward
to that having more weapons at your disposal the next time around?  
KARVIAR SHEPHERD: Well, for the players that played, it gave us experience. So
we'll be able to come out and do what we gotta do to help the players that was
down and injured or didn't get cleared, help them out and play hard in
practice and do what we've gotta do to make everybody improve.  
  
Q. Like I asked the guys, how much fun is it going to be for you to have
more weapons next year at your disposal?  
COACH JOHNSON: Obviously, the more competition you have in practice and the
individual workouts, the better you're going to be. So when you talk about
fun, I mean, I'm not one that I'm going to sit up here and say just because
we've got talent coming in from a recruiting standpoint and we have talent
that's set out this year, this whole league is talented.  
And so everybody's going to be better. But for me personally, I agree with
what Kyan said. I'm looking forward to having a healthy group that you're
don't to have to worry about not being able to go full speed in practice and
those kind of things. It's going to be exciting, it's going to be interesting.  
One of the things that's always been interesting for me is sometimes you have
to hit rock bottom to really figure out what you need to do to get to the
elite level, and it's easy for me because I've been here, done that. But I
think these kids really now have got a great feel of how competitive, how good
this league is, number one.  
But number two, how hard they have to push each other and how hard they have
to compete, because usually when you have good kids, they're good to each
other in practice and they're too nice sometimes, but I think we're going to
have‑‑ moving forward, I think we're going to have a lot going on where guys
play with an edge. Chris Washburn plays with an edge. Amric Fields has been
hurt for a year and a half. I'm looking forward to him being healthy. Devonta
Abron, for him to sit out has been painful. And Trey Zeigler, he's a special
player. He's been around. He's been around. It's going to be fun. It's going
to be fun.  
  
Q. What's the process from here in putting the wraps on this season and the
way it turned out? How soon do you let this one go or what do you try to pull
from this one as you get ready to go next year?  
COACH JOHNSON: We will meet individually. I'll meet with them individually and
collectively on March17th, and then basically we need to get healthy. So we
will start spring workouts, individual workouts probably right after the Final
Four. But the main thing is the academics, getting completely healthy and
resting yourself mentally and physically.  
  
Q. How do you want this team to be remembered, I guess, because they've had
so much adversity and they never gave up?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, like who they are, I think you said it, a bunch of guys
that never stopped fighting, never stopped playing, never stopped trying to
get better and really supported each other. And that's a pretty good tribute.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2014

  

### [Avery Dingman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26752)

### [Greg McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15827)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Providence - 65  
Creighton - 58

  
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: First off, congratulations to Coach Cooley and his team
on the championship. Obviously, they've overcome a tremendous amount of
adversity this season, and to their credit, they continue to forge forward. So
although I hate to lose in a game like this, if I have to lose, losing to
someone like Ed Cooley is as good as it could possibly be.  
Having said that, obviously, we're disappointed with our play in the first
half. I didn't think our ball movement, our spacing against their zone wasn't
where it needed to be. I thought there was a little bit of a sense of panic at
times with a few of our turnovers and maybe a couple of rushed shots.  
I was very proud of the way our guys competed in the second half. I thought
Avery Dingman gave us a huge lift off the bench. Obviously, Doug was really
good the second half in trying to get us back into the game.  
But it turned out that the start of the game was too much to overcome with a
team that was controlling tempo. I think it was a 56‑possession game, which is
maybe the lowest possession game we've played all year. We anticipated that,
and if a team's going to play like that, it's important you play from in
front.  
When we had to play from behind all night, it really was to their advantage,
especially when you consider the number of free throws they shot compared to
us. It made it pretty difficult for us.  
  
Q. Doug, did they give you a lot of defensive looks that maybe even
overwhelmed or threw you guys off, or was it a situation where sometimes shots
simply don't fall? I know you guys tried to get Ethan going, and it wasn't
falling toward the end there. Could you explain what their defensive looks
were towards you throughout the game.  
DOUG McDERMOTT: They did a good job. That zone is tough. I don't think we were
really expecting zone. I thought we were kind of panicking almost to start the
game, and rushing stuff and not making the extra passes.  
Then in the second half, we really did a good job of getting our pace going
and transition, and that allowed us to get some open shots.  
Got to give them credit. That zone kind of threw us off to start the game. We
definitely started to get comfortable with it more in the second half.  
  
Q. If all three of you can chime in on this: As much as this hurts right
now, obviously, the season's not over. Talk about your goals that you still
have out there to go forward.  
DOUG McDERMOTT: As we talked in the locker room after the game, I think the
highlight of our season is yet to come. As much as it stings right now, the
best is yet to come for us.  
This is where we wanted to be, to be able to celebrate on Selection Sunday,
and we're in a position where we can do that now.  
So got to give credit to Providence. They deserved this, and they played
tough. We've just got to move on and focus on our next opponent.  
AVERY DINGMAN: Yeah, I think this one stung a little bit worse than the rest.
We obviously didn't win the regular season championship like we would have,
and we came up a little short tonight. But there are a lot of teams in the
country that would like to be in our position, so we can't really dwell on
this.  
We need to have a few good days of practice next week before we head to the
tournament. Like Doug said, our best is yet to come.  
  
Q. For Doug and Avery: You guys heard going into this conference and going
into this tournament that this style of play was going to be difficult for
you, the physicality of this league. Did that game feel different? Did the
physicality out there, did it feel like a different type of game than you guys
have played?  
DOUG McDERMOTT: A little bit, but we knew coming into the game Providence is
definitely one of the most physical teams in this league. Batts and Henton,
Desrosiers, they all come flying at you on the glass. We knew that coming in.
Just a couple of balls bounced and didn't go our way.  
Got to give them credit. They're physical. But I think we handled ourselves
pretty well all the way throughout league play on the physicality, and I think
that's really going to help us going into the tournament.  
  
Q. Greg, for a while, it looked like the Big East might get only two or
three teams. Now it looks like maybe 40% of the league, four teams will get
in. Can you say something about that, people sleeping on the strength of the
Big East a little.  
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: It would have been ridiculous if only a couple of teams
got in. Having played in the Valley that has a team that's going to be a
Number 1 seed and knowing‑‑ Wichita's had a great year. They've got a very
good team. But they're in a different league. It's different playing 18 games
against teams that we're playing against night in and night out.  
As I mentioned, we've played teams from other leagues in the nonconference
portion of our schedule that are being heavily considered for the tournament
that, in my opinion, aren't as good as some of the teams in our league that
aren't going to get into the tournament.  
So I think justice is served that we're going to get four teams in. It would
have been very disappointing had that not happened because this is a great
league with really, really good coaches and some great fan bases. I think
we'll represent ourselves well in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Doug, when you guys get that back down to two points, you were getting
stops on the defensive end. Are you thinking you've got the momentum that's
going to carry you over the top?  
DOUG McDERMOTT: I did. I really thought we were going to win that game. Things
just felt right up there. We were being real aggressive on the defensive end.  
Just got to give them credit. They kind of melted the clock. It was hard to
get more possessions there late in the game. I felt like we were going to win
it. But we had the best effort of the season down the final stretch, and
that's really good to see as a leader, just seeing everyone fight for each
other with so much on the line.  
  
Q. Coach and Doug: You guys used the word "panic" about the first half. Can
you elaborate at all about that kind of sense or what was going on.   
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: Well, we didn't‑‑ we missed some shots that maybe we
normally make, but I believe in the first 17 possessions we scored on four of
those possessions and had five turnovers. Now, we only had eight turnovers for
the game.  
So I just thought we were‑‑ because they were trying to slow us down when they
had the ball and make us defend for 30 seconds, we wanted to dictate the tempo
so much that we probably were in a little bit too much of a hurry. We wanted
to get it there quick, and our message in the locker room was we have to be
quick but not in a hurry. Once we get there, we have to make good decisions.  
I think the guys were trying to do a little too much. It's a big stage.
There's a lot on the line. I think part of that's human nature. But once we
settled in, I thought we were better.  
Again, the credit goes to Providence. Their plan was solid. We didn't hit
shots early, so they were able to stay with that defense.  
  
Q. Same question to you guys: How do you think you all handled this stage?
You've been very successful in tournaments in your years at Creighton, but how
do you all think you came out on this stage?  
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: I think it's pretty evident. I think there's a whole
city that didn't know much about Creighton that knows a lot about Creighton
now.  
  
Q. Coach, Bryce Cotton was pretty steady, not just tonight, but in all three
meetings you had with Providence this year. What makes him so effective
against you?  
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: He's got a great pace to his game. He's not the biggest
guy. I don't think he's the most athletic guard in the league, but number one,
he's a winner, and, number two, he just changes speeds, and he's got a knack
of making big shots.  
I was scared to death of the fact that he didn't shoot it good the first two
games because, in my mind, I'm saying, there's no way Bryce Cotton's having
three bad games shooting the basketball in a row, and that proved to be the
case.  
To play the minutes that he's played this season and have the responsibility
on his shoulders that he has, not only needing to score, but to also run the
team, it's a real credit to him. He's done a terrific job, and it's fitting
that he's going to end his career in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, earlier this week you said, after the win over DePaul, you said
the key is to push it. The key for you guys is that tempo, dictating it. What
do you think the biggest thing is looking forward? Coach or Doug, if you guys
want to answer this, what is the biggest thing rolling forward in the NCAA
Tournament to dictate that tempo?  
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: I think we've got to have a great week. We'll celebrate
tomorrow because you should celebrate on Selection Sunday when your name's
called because it's hard to do, and there's a lot of teams in the country that
aren't going to get the opportunity. So you have to celebrate.  
Once our name's called, it's time to get to work. We need to use maybe some of
the problems we had today as motivation to make sure we're a better team on
Thursday or Friday than we are today. I'm confident this group will do that.  
We need some rest first. We rode some guys pretty hard. We'll get some rest,
get healthy, and get back to work.  
  
Q. Do you care what you'll be tomorrow? You'd have been a 2 seed, if you'd
won this, but you may be a 3 or 4. Do you care?  
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: I joke with my boss, who's on the committee, that all I
want is a good seed against a bad team in warm weather (laughter). I didn't
think that's too much to ask.  
I think we've done enough. We have eight wins over the top 50 in the RPI,
which is fourth in the country. We've played a challenging nonconference
schedule; our schedule is top 20. So I think that deserves to be rewarded with
a high seed.  
NCAA Tournament is‑‑ the hard part is to get in. The second thing that you
hope for is that your matchups are favorable.  
We're going to celebrate tomorrow. We're going to have some fun with it, and
then we'll get back to work on Monday.  
Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2014

  

### [Ed Cooley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23287)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Providence  65  
Creighton - 58

  
COACH ED COOLEY: First, I want to say how proud I am to stand here as the head
basketball coach of Providence College. I also want to say how tough it was to
play an unbelievable team in Creighton and Coach McDermott's team. They
deserve a lot of applause and credit. Those kids are hard to play against.  
It took a brave effort from us to get over the hump. Very, very hard to coach
against because he has interchangeable pieces, and in my opinion, the best
player in college basketball. He is an amazing, amazing player.  
We were fortunate. It was brave of us as a staff to‑‑ everybody thought we
were crazy probably trying to play one of the best three‑point shooting teams
in the country zone, but because of Dougie, you always have to have a man and
a half around him, and you know, he almost pulled it off.  
It's a credit to our players. It's a credit to our seniors. Bryce struggled
the first couple of days here in the tournament as far as shooting, but I
thought he still controlled the tempo. Our game plan today was to make sure we
got to the foul line and got to the rim, and we wanted to play defense with
the ball. It's almost like a football team that runs the ball to make sure
that we dictated tempo. They had too many possessions in the game at
Creighton, and that was a buzz saw that we run into. So we had to come up with
a different strategic plan.  
I'm amazed sitting here. If somebody asks me about the bubble, I'm going to
yell at you (laughter). That bubble was popped probably a couple of games ago
because of the league that we play in. I said it from the beginning, this
conference will have four, five, or six teams in that‑‑ today showed that, the
strength of our league. You just never know from top to bottom. It is so, so
competitive night in and night out.  
I'm gassed. I feel blessed, blessed to represent Providence College.  
  
Q. Coach, how did you maintain that tempo, that even keel the whole game?  
COACH ED COOLEY: When you say "even keel"‑‑  
  
Q. The team, offensively.  
COACH ED COOLEY: When you say "even keel", I think of one guy because I've
been in this position before as an assistant, and that's Al Skinner. He talked
to me today. He told me, "Don't overcoach. Let your kids do it. Give them a
game plan, and I promise you, they'll follow it."  
So that was in my head as I was coaching today.  
  
Q. After McDermott gets going a little bit in the second half, what's going
through your mind down the stretch?  
COACH ED COOLEY: We were still in the lead. We were getting the possessions we
wanted. We didn't want to lose our composure. Today I thought our senior
leadership and our veterans stepped up. They really did.  
Bryce Cotton was Superman in the second half. LaDontae was the man again. We
had timely free throws. Being the best free‑throw shooting team in the country
came into play today, especially down the stretch. And I really thought we
showed a lot of poise.  
  
Q. Ed, if everyone thought you were crazy for playing zone against
Creighton, why did you decide to do it?  
COACH ED COOLEY: Because I'm crazy (laughter).  
  
Q. Is it something that you saw? Is it something that you ‑‑  
COACH ED COOLEY: It was a gut feel. I said, hey, let's get it. Again, it just
was a feel. It was a gut feel as a coach, and our players bought into it. I
think, if your players believe it, then you should execute it.  
As I said yesterday, sometimes you can overcoach.  
  
Q. Just to follow up, what was the reaction of the players, Ed, when you
brought that play up?  
COACH ED COOLEY: Their eyes told me everything I needed to know. When you as a
coach know your team and know your players, when I asked them, "Hey, you guys
want to go one right here?" They said, "No, Coach, we're good. We're good. We
know where they're at. We know our slides." That's when you've got to listen.
You've got to be more of a listener than a talker.  
  
Q. Ed, you haven't won this tournament since 1994. What does it mean to win
this tournament, especially with everything you guys have gone through this
year?  
COACH ED COOLEY: Wow, it means a lot. We have faced a lot of adversity this
year. It brings me back where I was‑‑ I remember where I was sitting. I
remember where I was standing. I remember being so excited for Providence
College.  
And I've got to pinch myself as I sit here right now because I can't believe,
this is the first time as a head coach I'm going to the NCAA Tournament as a
head coach. It is been eight long years to get to that blue carpet. And I feel
gratitude to the school that gave me the opportunity to come home and coach
their organization. I'm kind of speechless, but I'm very, very appreciative.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned limiting possessions for them, but offensively you
remained aggressive. How important was it posting up Wragge all the time,
using your advantage inside to control the game?  
COACH ED COOLEY: That was our game plan. Kadeem's a big boy down there. You
see his body? I want a body like his, right? You know, he can make free
throws, and we wanted to get him to the free‑throw line and be aggressive and
drive the ball to the basket.  
  
Q. Coach, after the game, while you were cutting down the nets, you had the
chance to take that last piece yourself. Instead, you handed the scissors over
to Bryce and said to him, "It's all you." I was wondering what was going
through your mind at that moment.   
COACH ED COOLEY: I'm always going to think of someone else before I think of
myself. It's not about me. It's always about you, the person.  
  
Q. Coach, I heard you say during your interview on the court that you had
told Bryce that you were going to fight him if he didn't keep shooting.  
COACH ED COOLEY: I tell him that every game.  
  
Q. What about Bryce made you confident he'd snap out of the little funk he'd
been in the last couple games?  
COACH ED COOLEY: You've got to know your players. You got to know what gets
them going. Sometimes you've got to get on them to piss them off. You've got
to get their energy going a certain way. There's select words we use that we
can't use in this room, and he gets it.  
Our urgency was at an all‑time high, our senior urgency. When you're playing
on this stage, ain't too many times you have a chance to win a championship.  
  
Q. Coach, how great was the support from people coming down from Providence,
giving you all that great added edge that you needed to get over the hump?  
COACH ED COOLEY: We're the biggest little state in the union, and it was more
juice behind the Friars today. Everybody was cheering for Providence College
because we're seen as an underdog. We may be small, but small is big in my
world because we're a family, we're a unity, and I felt all that love behind
us today.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about the fact that something that can carry
over into the NCAA Tournament is the fact that you had a different guy step up
in so many different situations, with Josh at the beginning of the week,
LaDontae had a big time performance against Seton Hall, and tonight a little
bit of everything. Could you comment on that.  
COACH ED COOLEY: I think it's a combination of that. First and foremost, our
player development. I think our assistant coaches do an unbelievable job in
our preparation. The players believe in what you're saying. And they got
better. They took advantage of opportunity.  
We said, if opportunity's knocking at the door, we don't want to ask who it
is. We don't want to say we'll be right there. We want to kick the door down
and own the other side of the door.  
  
Q. Ed, can you talk about the impact of this Big East Tournament
championship to your program, your university, the city, the state. Providence
College, as you know, was one of the founding members of this league.  
COACH ED COOLEY: Sure.  
  
Q. Dave Gavitt, the great head coach, was the guy that put this league
together. It's got to be pretty special for you as the head coach to bring
this program back after 20 years. Can you maybe put it into some kind of
context. Pretty unique. Pretty special.  
COACH ED COOLEY: Context, I hear "Coach Gavitt", and I say thank God for him.
Thank God for his vision. Thank God for what he's done for basketball in
general. And when you look at where we were and how far we've come, I think
administrations win championships, and we've got a lot of support behind us.  
So I appreciate Father Shanley and Bob Driscoll for supporting our dreams.
We've come a long way, but we've still got a long way to go. We're excited to
be in the NCAA Tournament. Now we've got to look at a different dream.  
  
Q. What did you think of LaDontae? He was tough inside at St. John's.
Obviously, yesterday he had a big scoring game. And tonight the biggest shot
of the tournament.  
COACH ED COOLEY: LaDontae is the first kid that we recruited when we came to
Providence College. What I've seen from him where he was‑‑ LaDontae was
overweight. LaDontae had these braids because he thought he was Carmelo
Anthony. He didn't cut his hair from‑‑ I think, for maybe eight to ten years,
and I said, "Is that how you really want to look and represent your family and
yourself moving forward?"  
And he said, "Coach, I can't cut my hair. I can't cut my hair." He cut his
hair. He said, "How do I look?" I said, "You look beautiful." And he went out
to have probably six straight double‑doubles. So it worked. He cut his hair,
and he got stronger. So I'm proud of LaDontae how much he's grown. How much
he's grown as a man, not as a player. He's grown as a man.  
I appreciate everybody today. I am so, so thrilled to be called a Big East
champion. Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2014

  

### [Kadeem Batts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26673)

### [Bryce Cotton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26726)

### [LaDontae Henton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26672)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
Providence - 65  
Creighton - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with Bryce Cotton, the Dave Gavitt Trophy winner.  
  
Q. Bryce, I saw you had a lot of confidence coming out early in the second
half. What inspired that early confidence?  
BRYCE COTTON: We got off to a good run in the first half. We had a great pep
talk going into the locker room. And we just told each other, we're 20 minutes
away from something we've dreamed up for a long time. That was enough
motivation to put a little pep in our step.  
  
Q. That shot with 45 seconds left. They cut it to two. Any hesitation or
were you pretty confident? You didn't have the best shooting night tonight.  
LaDONTAE HENTON: I mean, when you score the ball and your teammates believe in
you, and they put you in spots to score the ball, you just want to come
through for them. It was a tough night and a big game at Madison Square
Garden. I just wanted to make the shot.  
I practice that shot all the time. So it just comes from repetition.  
  
Q. Bryce, coming into the week, there was a question whether Providence
would make the Tournament. Now there's no question; you get the automatic bid.
Just talk about what it will be like going to sleep tonight and knowing that
and watching on Selection Sunday there's no doubt you'll be in.  
BRYCE COTTON: It feels great. Given everything what this team has gone
through, all the adversity, obstacles we faced, for us to reach this moment
now, we're just going to cherish this moment for the time being. We'll regroup
when it's time.  
  
Q. LaDontae, talk to us about the team defense against one of the most
explosive basketball teams in the country. You guys guarded them all night.
Just talk about the team and the individual defense.  
LaDONTAE HENTON: It comes from our coaching staff doing a great job of
scouting the personnel and what they do best. We wanted to slow the game down
on offense and make sure we played our pace, defense for us to play zone
against a good three‑point shooting team. It goes to show how our coaches
believe in us and how we can take the three away from a great shooting team.  
  
Q. You guys lost some of your key players early in the year. How were you
able to get to this point where you are right now?  
LaDONTAE HENTON: We just believe in each other. Can't nobody stop us but us.
That's the motto we came into the season believing. No matter how many guys we
had to play with, we was going to go out there with the toughest group of guys
and battle each night and battle in the Big East.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about what you did defensively in the first half on
Doug McDermott. Second off, safe to say that this is a group that was so
cohesive throughout the season. Can you just talk about the fact that you guys
have so much balance.  
BRYCE COTTON: Going off your first question with Doug, we knew that they're a
great transition team and one of the fastest teams in the country. We wanted
to make sure we did a good job controlling the tempo, not rushing our shots,
and our zone, making sure we're aware of where McDermott was and Rocky.  
We did a good job not having too many lapses, and that's what led to it being
effective tonight.  
  
Q. Bryce, you have the hoop around your neck, the net around your neck. What
does it mean to you and the team?  
BRYCE COTTON: It's just a vindicating feeling to know that the Providence
Friars are Big East champions. This is something our school and our city
hasn't seen in a long time. For us to finally bring that back home, it's top
of the list.  
  
Q. Bryce, after the first three seasons, you said yesterday that you knew
something was special during the summer when you guys were working out. Is
this what you envisioned? Do you see this happening?  
BRYCE COTTON: There it is. This is something we had in mind all along. We
wanted to get to the blue carpet finally. We definitely wanted to win the Big
East Championship as well.  
Like I said, we couldn't put it on our finger exactly what was special at the
beginning of the year, but here it is.  
  
Q. Bryce, on the court you were saying that this school has really been
through a lot to get here. What was sort of like the lowest valley? What were
the circumstances when the valley was lowest?  
BRYCE COTTON: I'm not sure I could pinpoint when it was lowest because when
you're going through things, you don't really want to sulk and dwell on that.
You want to continue to keep an optimistic point of view. That's what we did.  
So I can't pinpoint anything in particular, but we've been through a lot.  
  
Q. At any point, did you sort of feel like maybe your dream wouldn't
happen?  
BRYCE COTTON: Never, never. Our team is full of faith, faith in God and faith
in each other. God definitely came through for us, and we knew at the end of
the day we were going to leave it all out on the floor, every single night.
This is what it's like. It's definitely been a blessing.  
  
Q. LaDontae, just the toughness that you guys played with. There was a play
with you and McDermott where he went down. Was there a focus to play with that
extra chip?  
LaDONTAE HENTON: These are my brothers. I'm going to war with them every
night. We want to be the toughest team on the court every night we play.
Tonight Coach made sure we came in with a tough mindset. And with the game on,
that's what we did.  
  
Q. Bryce, each game in this tournament, you worked hard to outwork all your
opponents. Was that the key to the championship, just never getting
outworked?  
BRYCE COTTON: Yeah, I think coming into any game, you want to outwork who
you're playing against, get all the 50‑50 loose balls because that creates
energy for the team and that induces momentum.  
Yeah, that's the game plan for every team we face.  
  
Q. Bryce, last night Doug McDermott said you might be one of the most
underrated players in the country. Do you think now you've kind of shed the
underrated title with this?  
BRYCE COTTON: That's not something I really focus on. I'm out there to play my
game and play with the guys I love and win basketball games. If people notice
me, that's fine. If they don't, that's not my problem either. I just want to
win.  
  
Q. Kadeem, after what happened only one week ago in Omaha, how surprised
were you last night when they said you would play zone?  
KADEEM BATTS: Our coaches do a great job of game planning and strategizing.
That was their game plan. It worked to a tee. They struggled in it. McDermott
got his shots off, but we ended up stopping everybody through the zone and
they struggled a little bit. So it was good.  
  
Q. Bryce, after you struggled shooting the ball a little bit earlier in the
tournament and even a little bit last night, how were you able to put that
behind you tonight and play more efficient on the offensive end?  
BRYCE COTTON: In basketball you're going to have high points and games where
you go through slumps. At the end of the day, you've got to have a short
memory. You've got to be sure of yourself and remember what you've done all
year. My teammates did a good job of continuing to encourage me, and just know
I'm due for a great game.  
Give credit to them. They played great the whole tournament. Kadeem, LaDontae,
Josh Fortune. They made incredible plays each and every game down the stretch.
They deserve just as much credit.  
  
Q. Bryce, you started out that conference late and you had a tough start on
the conference schedule earlier this season. Coach Cooley, one of the
emotional stories of the regular season. He had a house fire, and some woes
you had early on. Can you just talk about how you guys embody what your coach
does.  
BRYCE COTTON: I mean, as a team, we have a bunch of individuals who are
naturally tough on their own, and it just so happens that our coach has the
same mindset. So whenever the players and coaches are on the same page, that's
definitely big time for any program because that's just tremendous chemistry
and a great bond.  
  
Q. Kadeem, it's kind of fun to watch seniors, you and Bryce and even the
guys that don't play much ‑‑ Ted Bancroft, Lee Goldsbrough. It was obviously
the seniors drove this train. Could you talk about the leadership and the
cohesiveness that you seniors brought to the table. We don't see a lot of
teams with a lot of seniors in college basketball anymore.   
KADEEM BATTS: Well, along with the seniors, we have great other leaders, like
LaDontae Henton. He's the man out there. He grabs every rebound. He showed
that this tournament.  
As a team, and like you said, the seniors, we just come together, and we have
a very mature group. That's why we were able to persevere through a lot of
things. Through injuries and adversity, we came together as a family and
really fought.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2014

  

### [Greg McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15827)

### [Ethan Wragge](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24907)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Creighton - 86  
Xavier - 78

  
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: We're thrilled. In less than 24 hours, we're playing for
a Big East championship. When Ethan and Doug made the decision to come to
Creighton, when I made the decision to come to Creighton, for that matter,
none of us ever dreamed that would be a possibility.  
So to be on the stage we're going to be on tomorrow night is a fitting way for
an incredible senior class to end their regular season careers to play for a
Big East title. So they played in two championship games in the Missouri
Valley Conference and won them both, and then they come back this year and get
back to the championship game in a league as good as the Big East is really a
credit to their career, to their perseverance, to their toughness, and to
their willingness to play unselfish basketball.  
I thought that was the key tonight. Doug obviously scored some points. I
thought he set some great screens to get Ethan loose on a couple of occasions.
Ethan's battling some injuries, and he just keeps fighting.  
But really proud of my basketball team because Xavier obviously, it goes
without saying, they're a very good team. We've had two very competitive games
with them leading up to this one, and tonight was no different.  
So we're thrilled to win and excited to have an opportunity to play for a
championship against a very good Providence team tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, after losing to Xavier just four or five games ago, what do you
think was the biggest difference in the rematch that helped you win?  
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: We were 10‑of‑34 from the three‑point line that night,
and if I'm not mistaken, I think Doug took 12 threes and was 5‑for‑12, and I
think Ethan was 3‑for‑9\. So two of our best shooters had some decent looks at
the basket and didn't make them.  
Xavier really made us pay on the other end of the floor. We didn't have an
answer for Justin Martin. I think we did a better job on him tonight. And we
made the decision tonight just not to go after the post as much as we've done
the first two games and really allow them maybe to get some tough twos, but to
try to take away their rhythm three‑point shots as a result of our post
doubles we used the first two games.  
I thought our guys without any prep time really executed that well.  
  
Q. Doug, you came to the Garden about six weeks ago and didn't play your
best game. Did that trip help you, you think, this weekend?  
DOUG McDERMOTT: Yeah, I think it did. I think it helped all of us. We were
kind of in shock mode when we got here the first time because we all just
dreamed of playing here. So now to be here, we were a little more comfortable
these last two games because we already saw the atmosphere, what it's like
shooting here, and what the crowd's like.  
So I think that helped. And having 3,000 or 4,000 fans here is helping us,
too.  
  
Q. Coach, you said you guys had eased off the post. How much of that had to
do with Stainbrook being limited?  
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: We were going to do that if he was playing as well. We
just felt we gave him too many three‑point shots the first two games, and
probably increased their shooting percentage because of how open they were on
the back side of those double teams.  
We did it to try to protect Ethan because we're asking him‑‑ he's giving up
four inches, five inches, and 40, 50, 60 pounds, whatever it is. So we've got
to give him a little help. Obviously, he had some foul trouble tonight because
we left him on an island, but we thought it gave us the best chance to win.  
  
Q. Playing in the Garden for your first time with a home ‑court advantage
being heavily in you guys' favor, did it help you guys' energy?  
ETHAN WRAGGE: Yeah, like Doug said, there was 3,000 or 4,000 people there
tonight and just the sendoff we had and the whole vibe of the game, it doesn't
feel like we're 500 miles away from home or however far we are.  
  
Q. More than that.  
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: How's your geography? (Laughter).  
ETHAN WRAGGE: Whatever. It was just impressive. We're the road team traveling
the furthest and we can bring the most fans.  
  
Q. For Doug and Ethan: Talk about just the opportunity to play for a
championship in the Big East tomorrow.  
DOUG McDERMOTT: It's what we all dream for. It's pretty crazy that we're
already here and we're playing a good Providence team. It's going to be a
special feeling when we walk out there tomorrow. I know our fans will be there
with us again.  
We're really excited. We've got to get some rest tonight and be ready to go
tomorrow.  
ETHAN WRAGGE: It's just an unreal feeling. Five years ago, I was playing just
in the Missouri Valley, and now today‑‑ or tomorrow at least, we'll be playing
for one of the most historic college tournaments of all time. It's just an
unbelievable feeling, unbelievable ride, and we're excited for it.  
  
Q. Doug, you moved up on the charts all ‑time scoring. Is that something
that you kind of keep track of or somebody's keeping track of those numbers
for you?   
DOUG McDERMOTT: Someone's definitely keeping track of them for me. I don't
think about that too much. That's Rob Anderson's gig, our SID.  
It's been really cool, though, just seeing that happen. But it's all credit to
our coaches and my teammates.  
  
Q. Coach, your opponent tomorrow, Providence, has basically gone the whole
year with six guys. To hear what they've been able to do, is that impressive
to you to see that they've been able to get this far with that little?  
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: I think Ed Cooley has done as good a job of coaching
this team as anybody in the country. Given some of the injuries they had early
and then the defections, a lot of teams pack it in. To his credit, his team
has really willed their way, in my opinion, into an NCAA Tournament, because
we've played teams from the Big Ten and the Pac‑12 that are on the bubble, and
the team we're playing tomorrow night is much better, in my opinion.  
He's done a fantastic job, but Doug played 39 minutes tonight, Austin played
33, Jahenns played 36. We're going to have some sea legs tomorrow night, too.
But I think, when you get on that stage, the adrenaline takes over.  
We played them a week ago tomorrow at our place in the regular season final.
So we're both familiar with each other. It's going to be two good teams
playing basketball and having the time of their life. Really looking forward
to it.  
  
Q. Doug, can you speak a little bit to what it's like to play on the stage
of Madison Square Garden in this kind of tournament.  
DOUG McDERMOTT: It's unbelievable. It's a feeling you can't really describe.
The fans are so close. All the focus is on the court. It's so bright. Dark
backdrop. It's just a dream come true. It's an unbelievable atmosphere, and we
couldn't ask for a better way. We're glad we could play our third game here
tomorrow.  
  
Q. To both you guys: You're undefeated wearing gray uniforms. Safe to say
you'll be wearing the gray again tomorrow?  
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: Shhh.  
DOUG McDERMOTT: Knock on wood. There we go. We're good.  
Yeah, they're working for us, so we're going to keep wearing them.  
  
Q. Greg, you guys joined this league, and even though you had as much
success as you had before coming here to coach, did you sort of envision
yourself as being potentially the conference champion in your debut season?  
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: I think in the back of our minds we felt like we could
compete in this league, simply because, besides Doug being a fourth‑year
player, Jahenns being a fourth‑year player, Ethan's a fifth‑year player,
Grant's a sixth‑year player, Will Artino's a fourth‑year player. Austin
Chatman is a two‑year starter. We just have so much experience and guys that
know how to play basketball.  
I think that trumps size and athletic ability to a certain extent and allows
us to compete. But there were a lot of questions as well. When we made the
decision to go with the small lineup, how are we going to be able to compete
defensively? How do we compete on the boards? What do we have to do
offensively to make sure the tradeoff is worth it?  
If we're going to give up something down there, we have to make sure we take
advantage of something on the offensive end of the floor. To these guys'
credit, we just kept tweaking the offense and finding different ways to get
our shooters loose. They're smart enough that they can continue to take all
that in and execute it. So I don't know that we're surprised. We're honored,
but these guys have‑‑ these guys have averaged 26, 27 wins a game over the
last four years, and I think there's something to knowing how to win and
understanding how to win.  
And then they play for each other, and I think any time the coach is blessed
enough to have a group like that, your chances are pretty good because these
guys, they don't care who gets the credit.  
Obviously, Doug takes a lot of shots. He's a focal point of our offense. Those
guys in the locker room are his biggest fans and are really happy for him when
things go well, and Doug's really happy for Ethan right now because Ethan had
a heck of a game. That's what being on a team is all about.  
  
Q. Greg, talk about Austin's play in the tournament so far, especially that
rebounding race down with the free throw? That was the best part.  
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: He's been outstanding. He was really good last week at
home against Providence as well.  
He's probably the one guy on our team‑‑ and I think Ethan and Doug would
agree‑‑ that probably doesn't get the credit he deserves. We ask him to do a
lot for us. He's the quarterback of our transition game, getting it there
quickly and making the right decision. Oftentimes, he's guarding one of their
best players on the defensive end of the floor, and constantly sticking his
nose in there.  
His development over the course of the last three years is right up there with
anybody in our program. So he understands how to play the game. He's learned
to really manage a basketball team.  
There might be better point guards in the country statistically. I'm not sure
there's a better point guard in the country for this team than Austin Chatman.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2014

  

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

### [Isaiah Philmore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26739)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Creighton - 86  
Xavier - 78

  
COACH CHRIS MACK: First off, unbelievable atmosphere, environment. What a
great tournament. Wish we would be a part of it tomorrow night, but Creighton
was obviously much better. Hats off to them. They've got a terrific team.  
I said it before. I'll say it again: They're extremely difficult to guard. I
thought our guys gave great effort. We never quit. We get down 19 points with
eight minutes left, cut it to 5. Our kids had the heart of a lion, but we just
didn't have enough in the tank to be able to close the gap all the way.  
We started off offensively really sluggish. That hurt us. And, again, Doug
McDermott is the best player in the country. And when Wragge shoots the ball
like he does from three at the five position, they're one of a kind. They're
very, very difficult. Our hats are off to them. They're going to be a tough
out not only tomorrow but the rest of the way.  
  
Q. Chris, Justin and Jalen seemed to give you good energy, good defense at
the beginning of the game. When they got in foul trouble, how difficult was
that?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: It hurt because those guys are playing really well. Justin
had a great Big East Tournament. He's played really well for us all year. He
really relishes the challenge of trying to guard Doug McDermott.  
You know, when those guys went out, it wasn't like it was a one‑point game.
They inflicted some damage early on. We just felt like we were playing from
behind virtually the entire game. It's a tough team to catch up on because the
more you want to get into their ball handlers and pressure them, the more the
floor gets spaced.  
Again, the shooting ability on the floor is like none I've ever seen before at
the college level.  
  
Q. Coach McDermott said they really came into this game wanting to focus on
the perimeter and not as much the post with you guys. How much do you think
that changed the complexion of the game, from your perspective?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: Well, I thought in the second half, we ended up getting 42
points in paint, and probably a large majority of those from the second half.
We should have done a better job of asserting ourselves in the low post in the
first half, and then maybe it would have been a different game.  
You know, we've played through Matt all year. Matt goes with a sprained or
strained MCL back‑to‑back nights; not the easiest thing in the world. But he's
a guy that we play through, and we weren't able to do that maybe as much.  
I think Jalen's come a long way, but Jalen's not Matt yet. We learned that
in the second half and still punched it in, both to Isaiah and Jalen and a
little bit to Matt, but probably should have done that a little bit better
than we did in the first half, and it would have been a different game.  
Q. Did Matt hurt himself again tonight or just lingering ‑‑  
COACH CHRIS MACK: No, but it's not like you can snap your fingers, and he's
going to be 100 percent. There weren't too many kids in the country to play on
what he played on last night, and to turn it around and play 21 hours later‑‑
he tried to gut it out. You could tell his gait was different. He was moving a
little bit gingerly.  
We've got more postseason to play, and I want to make sure we can do the best
for Matt here over the next four or five days, so he can be even more
effective than he was in the Big East Tournament.  
  
Q. Isaiah, when you guys got down 19 with eight minutes left, was there
anything you or the other seniors said in the huddle to get you going and cut
it back to 5?  
ISAIAH PHILMORE: To be honest, we were talking about how we need to stick
together. We've been sticking together all year. And we were saying, even
though we're playing in Madison Square Garden, it can't have us in oohs and
aahs. We've got to stick together and try to fight back. You can't come back
with a home run. You've got to come back and get defensive stops and then turn
it into offense.  
  
Q. Chris, you've played Creighton now three times. Is there a way to defend
them, you think, or just hope that they miss shots?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: Yeah, I think there is a way. I think you have to be, very
honestly, probably a little more athletic than we are at the five position.
It's a little bit tough for us.  
When we start to get into ball screen situations, switching them is probably
the easiest solution because you don't have to get as spread out. Then you're
asking five men to be able to contain guards, and you're asking your points
and your twos to be able to play a guy like McDermott in the post. We were
very successful with doing that at Xavier.  
On a zero‑day turnaround, these guys got to bed at 2:00 in the morning after
the game last night. You can't really rep a whole lot of stuff you want to do.
They sort of had to do that off muscle memory, and a very toxic team to do
that against.  
  
Q. As you head home and await Selection Sunday, what are your thoughts on
the team and your confidence with what they've done so far for their
profile?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: I told these guys in the locker room, I couldn't be a
prouder coach. My high school coach used to always say, "Hey, no matter the
result, the sun's going to shine tomorrow." And it's going to shine tomorrow,
and we're going to live to fight another day.  
I'm proud of our guys. Not this past time we were in New York City, but the
time before, I was with Isaiah, and I was with Semaj, and we walked around
wherever they held media day, and on every posterboard, it said "Xavier
seventh". We finished third in the Big East our first year in a very, very
tough league. We're going to be in the NCAA Tournament, and nobody outside our
locker room walls felt that way when the season started.  
So I'm very proud of our team. Just disappointed tonight that we couldn't be
playing tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, just curious to get your thoughts overall after your first year in
the league and especially going forward, with the recruiting class that you
have coming in and some of the other schools in the league have top 20
classes? Where do you see the league a couple years from now?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: I think it's only going to grow stronger. You know, you've
got teams that are learning about one another. You have rivalries that are
going to build and form, and that happens when teams get to play each other
twice. I mean, you go to the conference tournament, everybody's playing
everybody for the third time. There's no, oh well, they get to play Providence
at their place. It's an equal schedule, which is awesome. We're one of the few
conferences in the country that have that.  
So, again, it's going to be an amazing ride for the ten schools that are in
it. Again, more on this year, I'm really proud of our seniors. I'm proud of
Isaiah. Just everything that went into this season, and we still have some
more basketball to play.  
Q. Isaiah, you talked about the guys trying to stick together to come back,
but you personally had a great second half, scored 17 of your points. Talk
about, from your perspective, what you were trying to do there and how
important it was for you to do well in the second half?  
ISAIAH PHILMORE: Well, like Coach said, Matt's out, so somebody has to come
and step in, and that's basically what I tried to do in the second half.
Probably should have tried that a little bit more in the first, and we might
have different results.  
You know, you can't ask Jalen to do everything. He's going out there. He's
playing his butt off, and he's just a freshman. So I just stepped in and did
what I had to do. My teammates fed me the ball at the right time. Just wish we
had a different result at the end.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2014

  

### [Fuquan Edwin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24932)

### [Eugene Teague](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24933)

### [Kevin Willard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21832)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Providence - 80  
Seton Hall - 74

  
Q. Kevin, what was your plan on that last possession there where you called
time ‑out and you shuffled the personnel in, did you want a two at that point
or a three?   
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: No, we were trying to get a three. That was the tough
thing about that lineup was‑‑ that's why we got Eugene back in there, was you
had three guys‑‑ you had four guards and Patrik. We didn't have anything to
run. We tried to get Eugene in there and slip Ryan out to the corner and hit
them for a three.  
At that time, I didn't think we could foul and go back down. We still got a
good look. We got a good layup and just missed it.  
  
Q. Kevin, what can you say about what the program accomplished the last few
days here?  
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: I told the seniors that. I told the team that. These
guys, unfortunately, their win‑loss record hasn't been phenomenal, but over
the last two years, they've provided a solid foundation for us to build on the
future. It's hard‑‑ young guys don't‑‑ can't see what they've helped build,
but these guys have really, through their hard work, grades, everything,
helping recruiting. These guys have been instrumental in helping us go from a
very unstable situation to a pretty stable situation.  
  
Q. Fu, you made a lot of big shots down the stretch. Talk about what was
going through your mind in the final minutes of the game and what you're
thinking about now?  
FUQUAN EDWIN: I just wanted to stay in attack mode. I knew we wasn't too far
away. Just going down the stretch, it was tough on me. So I just wanted to
stay positive and stay in attack mode.  
  
Q. What are your emotions right now?  
FUQUAN EDWIN: I'm very sad. I wish we could have pulled through with the win.
It would have been good playing in the championship game. I just want to give
credit to our effort. I think we battled hard.  
  
Q. Kevin, you've had difficult locker room things to deal with at the end of
the season, but was this tougher because of what you guys were able to do the
last two days?  
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: No. I think every time you're done playing, you always
have seniors whose careers are over. No, actually, this was kind of maybe a
different feeling. When you take over a program, you always have‑‑ I got close
to Herbie because of what happened to Herb, and I got close to Jordan, but all
the other seniors come and go when you first take over a program. So you don't
have such a connection with the guys that first came in.  
These guys, Eugene and Brian, have been here for three years. Fuquan's been
here for four. Aaron's been here for four. So it's a little different feeling
for me because I have a little different connection with these guys. Not that
I don't have a good connection with the other guys.  
But when you spend time and you see these guys grow, not only as players but
as men, it's a little different feeling. I can't explain the feeling. I don't
know if it's a proud feeling, a sad feeling. It's just a much different
feeling than when you take over a program.  
  
Q. For the players, I guess it felt like you guys were within an arm's
length the whole game, like four then eight then nine then six. Was it a level
of frustration that caused not being able to get over the hump? And did it
have anything to do with playing three games in three days? Were you guys just
out of gas at the end?  
FUQUAN EDWIN: No. We just got to give credit when credit is due. Providence
played a great game; had a good game. They hit some tough shots. You know
Cotton, he led his team. He handled the pressure we was throwing at him. Just
tough when we couldn't get over the hump and make some tough shots. But games
go like that sometimes.  
  
Q. Eugene, those two fouls you got in the first half, did that sort of
change the way you played the rest of the game?  
EUGENE TEAGUE: Yeah, it definitely changed the game. When you get two fouls
quick, it's hard as a player to play your game because you're just worried
about getting the next one. But getting those two fouls like that in the
beginning is tough. It was frustrating.  
  
Q. Fu, I know you're not the kind of guy that makes excuses. Your shooting
hasn't been as good as it's usually been lately. Has the thumb been giving you
any problems lately?  
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: Yeah, it has. I'll answer that for him. It has. He's
battling through it. It's supposed to be taped up. He doesn't have the tape on
it because of the feel of the ball. So he's battled over the last four days,
four games with a very sore thumb.  
I asked him to take the tape off, not for the shooting, but he was having
trouble catching it with the tape on. He did what he had to do for the program
and for the team.  
  
Q. Coach, their zone looked really active and in sync tonight. You guys got
some good looks in the post, but did them coming off the three ‑point line,
was that the difference in the game for you?   
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: We haven't seen zone‑‑ I was trying to think of the last
time we saw zone. That's where this league has changed so much. You used to
see zone every other game. I don't think we've seen zone since Georgetown, and
they played only two or three possessions.  
I knew that he does that to give Cotton some much needed rest, but we just
hadn't gone against it. We went over some stuff this morning, but it's
probably not enough to really attack it effectively. It was active. They did a
good job in it.  
  
Q. I know this is probably not your first thought right now, but what are
you thinking about as far as the postseason tournament? Would you like to play
in something? Are you hoping to get an NIT bid? Would you consider the other
tournaments?  
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: No, we won't consider the other tournaments. He's got to
heal up. Eugene, again, needs rest. Patrik has to get shut down.  
The only older guy that's probably not battling anything is Brian right now.
Brandon, he‑‑ I'm not going to risk something, one of these guys for one of
those.  
They're good tournaments. They're well run, but right now with my seniors
where they are, getting him healthy is my most‑‑ my number one, and getting
Eugene kind of ready for his next stage is probably most important.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2014

  

### [Ed Cooley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23287)

### [Bryce Cotton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26726)

### [Tyler Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26725)

### [LaDontae Henton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26672)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Providence  80  
Seton Hall - 74

  
COACH ED COOLEY: Just a great opportunity for our team. I thought we came in.
I thought our kids were prepared. Today we played with a purpose. We had
played Seton Hall twice this year, but we never played them at full strength.  
The first time we played them, Teague had a concussion. Second time we played
them, Fuquan had a hand injury. We felt we got their best shot today. I was
proud of our guys. We responded in some foul situations; a lot of fouls both
ways. But we were able to withstand some foul trouble.  
I thought we got good energy off the bench, by Brice Kofane especially. I
thought Tyler got us going, and LaDontae was a man child today, an absolute
man child today. He's had back‑to‑back games, and I always think he's one of
the more underappreciated guys on our team. He's just been a rock. He was the
first kid that we recruited to Providence college when we came, and I couldn't
be more proud.  
Bryce was Bryce. They went on a little run. We called a time‑out to settle our
guys down, and we almost found a way to make it a little more interesting.  
But we were able to advance and move on. The national tournament is all about
is advancing. I'm just really proud of this group because I remember being in
the same building some three short years ago, and that same organization beat
us by 31 points when we first came here. So when you reflect and see how far
you've come in a short period of time, it's all about these players and the
effort and the time and commitment that they just put into not just the
basketball organization, but the culture of building Providence College. So
I'm really, really proud of this group.  
  
Q. Coach, this team has had some bumps throughout the season as well. You
had a tough start to the conference schedule. Can you just talk about looking
back at the beginning and just describe how far you've come and how important
it has been for the experience of this group.  
COACH ED COOLEY: Sure. We're led by our seniors. We're led by our seniors and
our upper class, starting with Bryce, Kadeem, LaDontae. They've been through a
lot of Big East wars, and they've been through a lot of games. They've logged
a lot of minutes.  
What I'm more proud of them is how they've handled themselves as men and how
much they've grown. We all want to win basketball games, but at the end of the
day, I'm a basketball coach that believes in developing a person as a whole,
not just as a basketball player, and that's what these young men have done.  
  
Q. Ed, can you just talk about, you only play a rotation of six guys. You've
obviously lost some guys the past couple years.  
COACH ED COOLEY: You only need five.  
  
Q. Talk about what it says about your team you're able to get to a Big East
final.  
COACH ED COOLEY: It's a credit to our weight training and our conditioning
staff that our players are able to withstand this. Especially this guy right
here (pointing to Bryce Cotton). He plays every minute that God created this
year. God bless him. He's done a great job.  
Again, it's a credit to the strength and conditioning staff and to them
believing in the way we want to play.  
  
Q. Ed, just talk about both of the last two games, just holding off teams'
charges.  
COACH ED COOLEY: If you look at our games, we're not the prettiest group. At
the end of the day, we just want to win. We make it interesting, but we've
been able to prevail. I hope it's ugly, and we prevail tomorrow, too. If it
plays out the same way, we'll have the same conversation.  
  
Q. Coach, you had Batts and Desrosiers in foul trouble. Can you talk about
the play of Kofane today.  
COACH ED COOLEY: Yeah, he had a couple of extra possessions. He had a couple
of big time blocks. Another senior who's been through a lot. He hasn't played
much for us but he's playing at the right time. I'm really appreciative, and I
know these guys are as well.  
  
Q. Coach, it's been 20 years since Providence made it to the final at the
tournament. Anything, comment, any reflection about that?  
COACH ED COOLEY: Sure, I remember. I remember when Providence College played
in that game. I think I was just graduating from school, and I was really
happy for our city and for our state.  
But that was then. This a new era. This is a new Big East. And we're really
fortunate to be here because there's a lot of teams that would love to be
sitting in this game tomorrow, and we're one of the last ones standing.  
  
Q. Just for all the players: Thoughts on winning these two games and
following up on what Coach Cooley talked about, playing in the championship
game of the Big East Conference Tournament tomorrow night, big television
audience, big crowd, for the first time in 20 years. I'd like all the players
to give me your thoughts on what a great accomplishment this is.  
LaDONTAE HENTON: This was one of our goals coming into the season. Madison
Square Garden, it's a big place to play at, a great place to play at, and we
just wanted to come in here, and we know we can compete with all the teams in
here. So we wanted to do that. Coach just made a point of emphasis of playing
real hard, coming out with effort, and that's what we tried to do the first
two games.  
BRYCE COTTON: Following off of what LaDontae said, going into this summer, we
built such a great chemistry, and we have such a tight bond, and we knew there
was something special about this team. We couldn't quite figure out what it
was that was special.  
As the season continues on for us, I think we're starting to see it.  
TYLER HARRIS: I just feel like it's a blessing to be here and play at The
Garden and make it to the championship game. It was great, especially with
this team, of how close we've become and just with the program and how we can
make an impact on this program. I just feel like it's a great opportunity.  
  
Q. You talk about every time they seemed to get close, whether it was
LaDontae or Tyler, came up with big shots. You guys tonight showed you're not
going to completely let them catch you.  
COACH ED COOLEY: Showed our poise. These kids have played a lot of games.
They've played a lot of minutes. So I thought our experience really showed
down the stretch. I don't think we got rattled. I think they cut it to four or
five a couple of times, maybe closer than that.  
I just didn't think we got rattled. We've been there before. The guys were
great in the huddles when I call the time‑out. They run the time‑out.
Sometimes I just listen. Sometimes the coaches want to dictate rather than
listen to your players. When you listen to your players, they're going to tell
you a great story. When the players talk, sometimes the coaches need to shut
the hell up.  
  
Q. Coach, certainly, there's no lack of motivation for winning a Big East
Tournament title. How much do you anticipate it playing into your team's focus
going into tomorrow? You're an old guard Big East team, and this will be a new
Big East team coming in. Kind of standing up for the old guard, do you think
that will provide any extra motivation for your team tomorrow?  
COACH ED COOLEY: Man, I'm not thinking about that, baby. I'm not thinking
about that. I'm just thinking about how we can beat whoever wins. We've played
them. We played Creighton. We played Xavier. We split with them both.  
I'm thinking about the moment. I'm in the moment right now, not the what ifs.
You know what I mean? I hope I answered your question. I don't think of that.
I think of Providence College every day.  
  
Q. It wasn't a very good question.  
COACH ED COOLEY: That's all right. I love you, though.  
  
Q. Ed, was there any concern going into this game against a Seton Hall team
that's kind of just playing with house money, really has nothing to lose?  
COACH ED COOLEY: Providence College was here with a purpose. Again, you have
to worry about your opponent, but you have to worry about yourself and what
you know. We had a goal and a mission. Our mission was to try to get to the
NCAA Tournament. Our goal was it could change throughout the year. We started
0‑2\. We had a devastating, devastating loss, and Kris Dunn, we had a couple
of suspensions. We were sick. We had a lot of guys sick this year. I was sick.  
So it really is. It's an accomplishment because our mission is close to being
achieved.  
  
Q. LaDontae, fourth straight game playing 40 or more minutes. Does fatigue
ever get to you? Do you anticipate there maybe being a problem tomorrow
night?  
COACH ED COOLEY: No, not at all. No. We've been playing this way the whole
year. I'm sorry, but I'll answer that question. These kids have played like
this since they came to Providence. He's averaged 37 minutes a game. He's
averaged 120 minutes a game (laughter). And this man, he's averaged about 30.  
You can't be tired when you're playing for a championship. You can be tired at
the end of the season when you're on vacation.  
Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Xavier  68  
Marquette - 65

  
Q. Buzz, Deonte had reached 23 points with seven minutes left, and he
disappeared for a while. Was that defense?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: Yes.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the way you guys scrapped through this? I mean,
obviously, you're not happy with the result, but there was a stick
‑to‑itiveness that made this go right down to the wire.   
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: Thank you. It mirrors our last two games in many regards,
other than we didn't play ten extra minutes. I do think our guys have resolve
and resilience.  
I thought, whenever that last media time‑out was‑‑ that's what I was trying to
look up. I think it was 3:32. The next 11 points they scored were from the
free‑throw line. Obviously, I under the last two or three possessions we were
trying to foul. But we couldn't ever get a clean stop. Fouled late in the shot
clock, gave them points. I think they went 9 of 11 their first‑‑ they didn't
miss until right there at the very end.  
I think it was 58‑61 when Derrick fell on his hip, Jamil missed those two free
throws. They had scored seven or eight from the free‑throw line and then
finished scoring from the free‑throw line. We just couldn't ever get a clean
stop.  
And I thought that, obviously, we need to shoot more free throws in order to
have a chance to win, and we need to make a higher percentage, but we turned
the ball over too many times in a lower‑than‑normal‑possession game. We had
five turnovers when we played them last time. They had 19. Tonight we had 15,
they had 10. It's a possession game, and you need a shot every possession.  
  
Q. Buzz, did you get the look you wanted out of that last possession?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: Out of the time‑out?  
  
Q. Yeah, out of the time ‑out.   
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: I wanted it to be a little cleaner. We were trying to get
Jamil open to run one of our side‑out plays that have a few different options.
We didn't necessarily have to have a three there. Some of what we were doing
in that play allows a potential three.  
But he didn't get open, and Todd was about to fall inbounds. We would have
wanted to get a cleaner look.  
  
Q. This is a new experience for you now, going to the NIT.  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: I hope.  
  
Q. Yeah, you hope.  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: That's the thing that‑‑ obviously, I see it from a
different lens, like you said. Part of it is I think I'm getting old, but part
of it is I do look at it from a different perspective. We've never been to New
York and not been an NCAA Tournament team in the last three years.  
So when I turn on the TV or look at some of the social media stuff, it's like,
oh, they're in, they're in, they're in, they're in. And then no, it's a
bubble, it's a bubble, it's a bubble. And then it's like, yeah, they're going
to the NIT. And then I'm like, well, how many teams are in the NIT? You know
what I mean? How many bubble teams are there? How many 1 seeds are there? How
many 2 seeds are there?  
I hope we go to the NIT, and I mean that sincerely. I would like us to keep
playing, but as I just told our guys, in my career as a head coach, I haven't
been to the NIT. So does anybody know how that works? Sincerely.  
So after Selection Sunday?  
  
Q. Yeah, just whoever's leftover?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: They just call you and say, "You want to play? Hi, I'm
Michael Hunt. You want to play in the NIT?"  
  
Q. Conference champions are automatic qualifiers (AQ).  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: So there's only 23 teams that are not AQs that are going
to the NIT?  
  
Q. There still may be AQs playing tomorrow.  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: That's what's so strange to me. I'm not sure the people
that say you're NIT bound understand there's eight AQs and more.  
  
Q. Deonte look like he took it to a different level.  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: I thought we got him some good looks. I thought our
interior guys, particularly Deonte and Davante, I thought they played really
well in the channel. But I think Xavier, their perimeter guys got to the
channel too often.  
Thanks.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Oliver Purnell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15064)

### [Brandon Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21821)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Creighton  84  
DePaul - 62

  
COACH OLIVER PURNELL: Just a couple thoughts on the game, and I'll open it up
for questions.  
I didn't think our energy level was as high as it was when we started the game
yesterday. I guess that's understandable playing a late game last night. But
if Creighton hadn't been so good and shooting the ball so well‑‑ obviously,
McDermott was facilitating everything, and then Manigat hits a couple of
shots. Maybe we get a chance to get our legs under us because we finally got
our legs under us in the second half, got our energy level up, and got to
going.  
Obviously, we dug ourselves a hole‑‑ or Creighton had dug a hole for us at
that point. So I thought it was a combination that we weren't quite as
energized and ready as we were yesterday, and a combination of Creighton and
McDermott were really good.  
They've got a really, really good team. I think they've got a chance to
obviously do well in this tournament and really represent our league well in
the NCAA Tournament. I think McDermott, once again, proves that, in my
opinion, he's the best player in the country.  
  
Q. Is it just like picking your poison with McDermott? He can score from the
perimeter or the inside.  
COACH OLIVER PURNELL: Yeah, and we had Brandon on him one time. Brandon did a
decent job. But if he continues to post, then we come over and double on him,
and he picks a guy out on the other side. He's a really good passer. Then we
put a big on him, and he goes out and shoots threes. So he makes it hard. And
he gets a few stick‑backs to boot.  
So he's a good player, and you do have to pick your poison. Some nights,
Georgetown a week or two ago, he goes 9‑for‑22, and that's what you want.
That's a good night. You want him to be inefficient, shot a low percentage,
and you've got a chance to get him then. When you're shooting it really,
really well from the outside, you're not going to miss many layups, not going
to miss many free throws.  
  
Q. This question is for both of you: What difficulties did you encounter in
defending McDermott? Oliver, you just alluded to it.  
COACH OLIVER PURNELL: I'll just leave it to Brandon.  
BRANDON YOUNG: We're just trying to throw different type of people at him. We
know he's a great player. You know, like Coach said, I was sticking him at one
point, Charles, Jamee. We're just trying to throw different pieces at him and
trying to make it tough on him. Like Coach said, he's a great player. Great
players do great things.  
  
Q. Coach, is there something that, after getting that win last night, that
you taught your team that maybe you look forward to in the off ‑season and
headed into next year? Just your main takeaway from this week.   
COACH OLIVER PURNELL: You know, I told the guys that they came up here and
battled and played some really good basketball. Second half tonight,
obviously. Last night was one of, if not our best, game of the year. And they
just kind of hung in there.  
I told the seniors, if they hang in there and spend the amount of time and the
amount of work they have this year and the amount of stick‑to‑itiveness, then
they're going to be successful in whatever they do beyond basketball.  
And I told some of the other guys that we've gotta learn from this year and
some of the things that maybe we did to ourselves or other things that happen
to you, you just have to hang in there, and you have a chance to be
successful. I think we have the opportunity to do that with the guys we have
coming back and the few guys we have coming in, and we can do really well this
year.  
  
Q. I see Jamee Crockett had a really good game tonight. Was that important
for him?  
COACH OLIVER PURNELL: I think that helps him from a confidence standpoint.
Jamie was out for a long time with a suspension, and then he got mono. So it
was a while for him coming back and getting his legs under him. He's not in
great shape, but today was probably the longest stretch he's gone in a while,
and he played pretty effectively.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about what Brandon's meant to the program, especially
this year since February, when you've asked him to do a lot?  
COACH OLIVER PURNELL: I think Brandon exemplifies what our program is all
about, this year in particular, but over the last three or four years.  
He just hung in there. He hung in there, and he fought through, and he battled
to the point where he's playing his best basketball. He wouldn't say this, but
I think he's playing his best basketball by far coming down the stretch when
we needed him the most. Sometimes it wasn't enough for us to get over the hump
with everything he had going, but he came back the next day, and he came back
the next day, and he came back the next day.  
Again, I'll say to him now what he said to he and the seniors in the locker
room. If he battles like this in anything he does, basketball‑‑ he's going to
play some basketball, but anything he does beyond basketball and sticks to it,
the amount of time, the work ethic, the approach, he's going to be successful.  
  
Q. I guess it's a follow ‑up question to Brandon himself: How was passing
George Mikan on the scoring list and winning the first Big East Conference
game last night?   
BRANDON YOUNG: It was a great feeling to be recognized with those great group
of guys. But our first Big East win meant a lot to us. Coach told me that I
did a pretty decent job yesterday, but I told him I played horrible.  
You know, we just was competing yesterday. We fought, and we just played
together. Like Coach said, we didn't come out with the energy that we came out
with yesterday until we looked at the scoreboard and we were down by 20. So
that was a habit of ours just looking up and seeing that we're down and trying
to fight back into it.  
But you know overall, I had a great four years here. I want to thank Coach
Purnell, and everybody that's with DePaul Athletics and just giving me the
opportunity to play basketball here and maturing as an individual.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Jahenns Manigat](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23271)

### [Doug McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21790)

### [Greg McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15827)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Creighton - 84  
DePaul - 62

  
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: As I told the team in the locker room, I was extremely
pleased with our defensive effort, attention to detail the first half. I
thought we flew around pretty well and made DePaul's looks difficult, had them
shoot the shots we wanted them to take rather than the shots they wanted to
take.  
Because our defense was good and our rebounding was good, we were able to
establish a transition game. Jahenns really got us off to a good start. Doug's
performance in the first half was one of the better ones I've seen. I've seen
some good ones out of him, but that was about as good as it gets.  
Second half, I thought we were a little tentative. I thought we played a
little more not to lose than playing to win. I would have liked to have seen
us throw that knockout punch the first five minutes of the half. But to
DePaul's credit, they didn't allow us to do that.  
  
Q. What was it that gets the feeling go in your first Big East Tournament
after winning the Mountain Valley last season?  
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: Missouri Valley.  
  
Q. I'm sorry. Missouri valley. Was there any type of pregame jitters going
into this tournament?  
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: I don't think so. I think the guys were anxious.
Fortunately, we had an opportunity to come in and play St. John's here. And
even though we lost the game, I think that awe factor of coming into this
building the first time, that was taken care of. We had a shootaround, they
took pictures, we did all that stuff.  
This was more about the game and concentrating and getting down to business.
Obviously, we have a heck of a following, as you all heard tonight, and that
adds more fuel to our fire as well. If that many people are going to make the
trip halfway across the country to come and support us, we owe them a good
effort.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about that was one of the better first halves you've
seen. What do you see when he's playing like that in the first half?  
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: I see the guy that wants the ball when he's in the zone.
His teammates have done an incredible job of recognizing over the years when
Doug is one of those zones. They're making the extra pass, and our screening
activity for him was good.  
Our team is about playing together and being unselfish, and Doug passed up a
couple that he probably could have shot the first half to make an extra pass
to Jahenns because he knew he had it going.  
That's why we've been successful the last three or four years is that we play
unselfish basketball, and certainly Doug's included in that even for a guy
that shoots a lot of shots.  
  
Q. This question's for Doug: The Garden has an opportunity to have a
platform to raise the stakes, energy, electricity. We have had great
individual performances in Big East Tournament history. Was that your feel
coming into this game? Because it looked like you wanted that moment the first
half.  
DOUG McDERMOTT: Absolutely. As a kid, you dream of playing in venues like
this. The Garden is about as good as it gets. I watched the tournament growing
up a lot. You remember the Kemba moment, so many great games.  
So just to be a part of it definitely was in the back of my mind. And in
warmups, it felt surreal out there.  
  
Q. Doug, when you were here last, although you won the game, they kind of
held you down the stretch, like you went seven minutes without a point. Was
that on your mind coming in, back here?  
DOUG McDERMOTT: Not really. St. John's did a great job there in the second
half, but a lot of it was my fault. I kind of quit moving with the ball a
little. I got to do that for us to be successful. I wanted to come in with a
mindset today just to continue to keep moving, just be aggressive. It's not
only going to give me shots, but it's going to get shots for my teammates.  
  
Q. Doug, what did you see in DePaul's defense in the first half that allowed
you to be so successful? In the second half, where you were in the lead and
you tapered off with your scoring a little bit.  
DOUG McDERMOTT: Really wasn't much what DePaul was doing. I was just feeling
in the rhythm, in the zone, and I felt like I could make it out there. They
were doing a good job. I just happened to get going, and my teammates
recognized that I had the hot hand. The second half, I wasn't quite as
aggressive. I took a couple bad ones, and you've just got to not get
complacent at halftime.  
  
Q. I mean, this is bigger than the Missouri Valley Conference Tournament; a
lot more media is in here. Can you guys compare what it's been like so far,
just the first couple moments, from last year to this.  
JAHENNS MANIGAT: It's a little different obviously. But we're just all focused
about basketball. It's a different venue, obviously, from the Valley. You're
not going to Carbondale, but you're going to Cincinnati. It's just different
all around.  
But like I said, we're just focused on basketball, focused on who the next
opponent is, and what we can do offensively and defensively to play our "A"
game. With that in mind, I think we've had a pretty successful inaugural
season in the Big East.  
  
Q. Jahenns, talk about hitting some shots tonight.  
JAHENNS MANIGAT: It felt great. I think it's about time. I wasn't shooting the
ball too well down the stretch there of the season. My coaching staff kind of
kept telling me, you know, "If you're open, if you're comfortable, let it
fly." I came in with that kind of mindset today. I didn't want to let the past
poor games be a distraction or discourage me from shooting good shots for our
team, and they went in tonight.  
  
Q. Doug, when you were talking about being in the zone and feeling it
tonight, can you describe sort of what that's like for you when you're out
there and you get the ball in your hands. Do you just feel like you could sort
of hit anything at that point?  
DOUG McDERMOTT: Yeah, it feels like that hoop is huge. It just feels like
everything's going to go in. You just kind of‑‑ that energy carries over to
the defensive end of the floor. I know he won't admit it, but it's one of
those feelings where you just feel like you have all the energy and confidence
in the world. It's a feeling that is the best.  
  
Q. Two ‑part question: First of all, do you believe in the Sports
Illustrated jinx? Secondly, do you try to channel Larry Bird in any way?   
DOUG McDERMOTT: No, I do not believe in it, but, of course, everyone‑‑ I think
a lot of guys look up to Larry Bird. He's one of the best players to ever
play. With that being said, there's only going to be one Larry Bird. It's a
guy I like to watch. He's a crazy competitor. He makes all the right plays. So
I try and watch a lot of film on him.  
  
Q. Jahenns, can you talk a little bit about what you see in Doug when he's
in that rhythm. Is there a look in his eye when he has it going?  
JAHENNS MANIGAT: He looks a little bit different. He's moving a lot more, I
can tell you that much. As a teammate, you're just trying to add a screen for
him or get the ball in the right spots. I think our guys‑‑ in the locker room,
we have a bunch of unselfish guys, and I think Austin did a great job of
finding him in the first half. And myself and Grant did a great job of
screening for him.  
So once he gets going, that's certainly the number one option we're looking
for.  
Doug is a great player. He's super unselfish as well. If he doesn't have it,
he doesn't force it. I know he thinks some of the shots he took in the second
half were forced, but I feel it was part of our offense. He's an easy guy to
play with. He puts up big numbers, and when he's that aggressive, it opens up
the floor and opens shots for everybody else.  
  
Q. The team looked very comfortable against the press tonight. Is that a
point of emphasis heading into the tournament?  
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: We just wanted to attack it. We had shooters on the back
of that. Some teams at press, they put a shot blocker back there, and they can
take the chance to press because they can protect the rim. We're probably not
attacking the rim. We're probably attacking the press to shoot a three. That
maybe changes the mindset of the press a little on that back end.  
So that was really our message to the guys. Let's bust it. Let's throw it
ahead. Let's make an extra pass, and let's shoot an open three. We spend a lot
of time on our offense trying to create the three‑point shot. We're very
comfortable taking it after the one pass.  
  
Q. Doug, when you consider that 15 conference wins is the most that any
school's ever had in the first season in this conference, when you have a
chance to look back and think, wow, we're in the semifinals of the Big East
our first season, how exciting is that?  
DOUG McDERMOTT: It's really exciting. It still doesn't all feel real. This
season just flew by. It's just great for our university. I wanted to come back
to school to set the tone here for our moving to the Big East.  
I feel like we've definitely proved that as a senior class, and we're really
excited going forward.  
  
Q. For Greg: Rebounding has been a concern for you guys over the last few
games. I know you mentioned it. How encouraged were you by tonight?  
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: I was very encouraged. I think we led the Big East in
defensive rebounding percentage. When we get off the bus, you probably
wouldn't guess that that would be the case. So our guys have to be
fundamentally very sound from a rebounding standpoint.  
For the most part, we've done that this season. It's so important to us
because that's where our transition starts is with a stop and a defensive
rebound. So I thought our guys really fought. I thought Ethan Wragge was
outstanding, battling down there. He knocked down a couple big shots. I know
that's what he's known for. I thought his defense and his rebounding was
really good as well.  
  
Q. Greg, every time you guys got the ball after a defensive rebound or after
they scored, you and your staff were screaming "Run! Run! Run!" How much of
that was part of the game plan tonight, trying to maybe get DePaul sped up?   
COACH GREG McDERMOTT: They played a game yesterday, last night. So, obviously,
their legs maybe were a little tired, and we were fresh. So we wanted to set
the tone with our tempo. But that's our plan going into every game. We want to
push it against everybody. That's who we are. That's how we've built this
program. We're pushing it to do different things than some other teams, but
we're pushing it just the same.  
As Jahenns alluded to, Austin is kind of the quarterback of all that. Tonight
I thought he was really good. He made good decisions. He had a couple
cross‑court passes early, but after that he cleaned it up, and I think he had
almost double figures assists.  
That's the way we play. We're constantly hammering that message to our guys.  
Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2014

  

### [D'Angelo Harrison](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26674)

### [Steve Lavin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21860)

### [JaKarr Sampson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24961)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Providence - 79  
St. Johns - 74

  
COACH STEVE LAVIN: This was clearly a game of runs. We were playing well, had
a seven‑point lead. Providence went on a big run to build, I think, a 17‑point
cushion, and then we went on a run just inside of six minutes, if I'm not
mistaken, and had the ball down one. We didn't convert, and Providence pulled
away.  
So a game of runs. I thought we played well in stretches, but then we had
periods where we didn't play with the necessary aggressiveness.  
You look at the stats, they're equal across the board, other not that the
free‑throw game. I think they were plus nine from the foul line. But in every
other area, at the end of it‑‑ rebound, I think we were minus 3. You look at
assists. You look at turnovers, points in the paint‑‑ pretty much every
statistic is balanced except for the free‑throw line. Providence did an
effective job of getting to the charity stripe and converting, and then we
shot 50 percent from the foul line, which is going to make it tough because it
gives you very little margin for error, in other area if you're going to hope
to be successful at this stage of the season against a quality team like
Providence.  
I was proud of our team's collective effort against Cotton to hold him to, I
think, one point in the first half or zero points, whatever it was. That was
testimony to our kids' grit.  
And really proud of the way our team fought back, dramatic comeback and had a
chance to take the lead in the waning seconds. Says a lot about their
resiliency and fight‑back, and we've seen that all year, but it was on display
once again this afternoon.  
But disappointed with the loss.  
  
Q. D'Angelo, there's a lot of plays in games, but the one where it looked
like you might have the turnover on Cotton and you got called for the foul.
How did you see that play?  
D'ANGELO HARRISON: I just thought I got a clean strip, but our job is to play
and then go away. So credit Cotton or credit Providence for building that
lead. If we wouldn't have gotten down so much, it would have been a different
kind of ballgame, the rally we had at the end.  
  
Q. Steve, Ed just sat in that chair and said he would be shocked if you
don't make it to the NCAA Tournament on Sunday. How do you feel right now?  
COACH STEVE LAVIN: Well, what I shared with the team is clearly at this stage
of the season, it's in the Selection Committee's hands. I think, if you look
at our body of work and a number of the criteria that they consider, we
clearly have some pluses. But losing the first round of your conference
tournament is not a good thing when you're trying to play in the postseason.  
But winning 11 of our last 14 games before today was a plus, and when you
consider the three losses during that 14‑game stretch, one was at Creighton on
a McDermott shot from long range at the buzzer. One was against Villanova,
where we lost by three without the services of Orlando Sanchez. As you can
see, he's pretty central to everything we do. And Chris Obekpa had his ankle
injury.  
And then the Xavier game was an unusual week a couple days after Villanova,
where our team lost five loved ones. It definitely affected our game there.  
I thought we found ourselves last week in the win over DePaul, then an
impressive win in double overtime and Marquette. Then today was a great Big
East battle, punch, counterpunch, two teams that wanted to advance in this
tournament and came right down to the wire. I know the Committee will look at
all those factors.  
I don't think it's an automatic that we're not in. I know people have been
saying that, but I thinkwe didn't help our cause any by losing today, but I
haven't bought that this was a play‑in game for either team.  
But clearly as the coach at this stage of the year, the kids know, we talked
about, you want to win and advance through your tournament, continue to play
on this final weekend because eyeballs are on teams that continue to work
their way through the postseason tournaments, the postseason conference
tournament.  
So you'd prefer to take it out of the Selection Committee's hands by winning
today, winning tomorrow, and winning on Saturday. But now that we weren't able
to do that, we have to hope that they look at the body of work of a young team
that's getting better, a freshman point guard that improves with each practice
and game, challenging ourselves against the Wisconsins and Syracuses, and the
11 of 14 down the stretch.  
I think we didn't hurt ourselves in terms of the way we played today. We just
hurt ourselves because we didn't win the game, and that part is disappointing.  
We're either going to be in the NCAA or the NIT, and either way, we have to
get ready because we want to win games and advance as far as we can to finish
the season on the best possible note. Whether that's the NCAA or the NIT,
we'll have to wait.  
  
Q. Steve, Chris only played two minutes today. I know he had foul trouble.  
COACH STEVE LAVIN: 99 percent of it was foul trouble, and that team at the end
was a great hurry‑up offense. As we can see, it was pretty dramatic. As
impressive a comeback as any team I've coached in my career.  
Can't say enough about that effort, to be in position to have the ball at
point‑blank range and a chance to win it. A lot of contact, but that's Big
East basketball. I just talked to JaKarr about it. He felt he could have
converted. I thought it would be an and‑one if he did, but we came away with
neither.  
That's the way the cookie crumbles. It's a competitive situation. We came up
short. So we tip our hat to Providence, and we'll see where things finish out.  
But, yeah, Chris just‑‑ you know, two fouls puts him on the bench to start.
Third foul to start the second half, puts him on the bench. Then we're down
17, and now we're in a position where against a zone offense, we're trying to
put combinations out there that will help us to both make shots and then also
we were in a scramble, trapping mode. So we went small to come back in this
game.  
  
Q. Speaking of Chris, losing him to foul trouble was obviously huge, as you
guys certainly struggled down low for most of the game then. Do you feel like
that right there kind of put St. John's behind the eight ball?  
COACH STEVE LAVIN: Not Chris, but the team?  
  
Q. Yeah, losing Chris put you behind the eight ball.  
COACH STEVE LAVIN: Yeah, he's the leading shot‑blocker in the country, and
that foul trouble naturally put us at a disadvantage because we prefer to have
him at the rim, like a soccer or hockey goalie, and it gives our players up
top the confidence to be aggressive with ball pressure. If you get beat,
you've got Obekpa back there to either block shots or alter shots. That fuels
our offensive attack.  
So in spite of that, I thought there was a stretch where, whether Chris was in
there or not, Providence was a little more aggressive at attacking the rim.
And then we reclaimed momentum, and we took it to them, and as a result, got
high‑percentage shots and ended up scoring more points in the paint than they
did.  
So it really was an interesting game of runs. We got out early, playing well,
thought we had good control of the game. They made a run to go up 17. We made
a final run to close it to within a point. But we didn't get it done, and
Providence moves on.  
  
Q. Steve, you're now 1 ‑4 in this tournament. I know every team is
different.   
COACH STEVE LAVIN: Sure.  
  
Q. Has there been, as you look back over the past three years, has there
been a sense of urgency that maybe your team hasn't had? Has it seemed like
the competition has genuinely jumped?  
COACH STEVE LAVIN: I'll take you right through it. Coaches know basketball in
their career pretty well.  
First year, we beat Rutgers but lost to Syracuse. D.J. Kennedy was hurt in the
early minutes of the game. He's one of our best players. I think that was a
Sweet 16 or Elite Eight team, if he doesn't get hurt. We blew out Duke, blew
out UConn, beat Pittsburgh in The Garden. We won at Cincinnati, Marquette, and
Villanova that year before D.J. got hurt.  
Second year, I had cancer. I'll take the blame for that.  
The third year, we didn't have D'Angelo because some coach thought it would be
smart to suspend him. But I'm glad we have him back.  
And then this year we just battled our fannies off. We fought our fannies off
today, and we lost. So that's the four. I'll leave you to evaluate it as the
pundit.  
  
Q. JaKarr, last minute of the game, it's a run ‑out, and it's you and Jordan
passing the ball back and forth to each other maybe a couple of times each,
and you get the layup but you don't make it. What happened on that shot? Were
you too far under?   
JaKARR SAMPSON: I mean, I feel like I just missed a shot, you know. I feel
like normally I would make it, and I'm disappointed in myself. I just feel
like I missed a shot. Foul or no foul, I missed a shot. I felt I should have
made it.  
  
Q. D'Angelo, you guys seemed pretty loose and confident a couple of days
ago. Do you think that in the time in between that you guys got tight? I mean,
you sort of sounded like you guys had your best game coming. Where do you
think it went?  
D'ANGELO HARRISON: Just a combination of a few things: We missed free throws.
We missed a couple of shots in that first half. We weren't playing St. John's
basketball that we usually play. But you saw that, I think, the last six,
seven minutes. If we did that the whole game, it would have been a different
kind of ballgame. We just waited too late. We were just flat until the end.  
  
Q. Coach, I just want to know what do you think is the biggest argument for
the Big East Conference the way it is now this year to have maybe about five
bids going into the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH STEVE LAVIN: I think‑‑ no disrespect to any other conference, but people
are talking about six in the Atlantic 10 or seven in the Pac‑10\. Take a look
at what Georgetown, who didn't finish.500 in our league and got beat in the
first round by DePaul, one of the last place teams in our league‑‑ oh, yeah,
what was it?  
JaKARR SAMPSON: Seton Hall.  
COACH STEVE LAVIN: What about it?  
JaKARR SAMPSON: Beat Villanova.  
COACH STEVE LAVIN: Yeah, exactly. The idea, I think that speaks to the depth
in our league. Georgetown, I'm not wrong, they beat VCU and Kansas and
Michigan State, teams out of other strong conference that are getting
consideration with five, six, seven teams. Look at what Villanova did at the
top of our league all year long, beating the likes of Kansas and other quality
programs. And yet the middle and the bottom of our league can beat those top
teams. Or even a team like Georgetown that couldn't finish.500 and couldn't
win in the conference tournament the first round, yet they were thumping teams
in other conferences.  
We played Syracuse to the wire and Wisconsin to the wire. We challenged
ourselves all season long. I know the Committee looks at those factors. The
eye test. Are you a team that's getting better? A young team with upside? In
our case, not only with Rysheed Jordan, but some of the underclassmen, it's
clear we're getting better.  
We didn't help ourselves by losing in the first round today, but I think when
you look at this league, it's clear how competitive it is from top to bottom,
and the quality of basketball, if you have basketball people that know the
game, and you watch the quality of play in this league, it's pretty special.  
  
Q. D'Angelo, just describe your emotions. It seemed like you were pretty
upset after a comeback like that, just falling short. Knowing you guys
probably didn't put yourself in good position.  
D'ANGELO HARRISON: Disappointed. We've got to put away this game. We have
basketball in front of us, tomorrow or the next day, just figure out where
we're going to be and work hard again so we can get this next one.  
  
Q. Steve, I know you're still optimistic you'll make the Tournament. If you
don't, will you consider this year a disappointment or a failure?  
COACH STEVE LAVIN: No. This group is‑‑ they've taken us for a ride that I'll
never forget. To have a team that started the league 0‑5\. One time we were
9‑8 overall and 0‑5, and now we're up here finishing the league 10‑8 in a
three‑way tie for third. Independent seedings and the Alan Greenspan minutia
for how you separate the three teams that are tied. At the end of it, we
finished third for the second time in four years. To finish third in the Big
East is no easy task, or tied for third.  
But to win 11 of our last 14, to finish 10‑8, to have 20 wins after being 9‑8
at one point, and to go through a couple weeks ago five loved ones that were
lost, the injury to Obekpa, Sanchez's newborn child‑‑ it's been a unique
couple weeks but memorable, and we still have basketball ahead of us, and a
20‑win season in this day and age is no easy task.  
This group, if anyone, the beat writers that are around them on a regular
basis, they've made fans of a lot of people. They're just a first‑class group,
and they represent our school in a first‑class manner. I couldn't be prouder
of probably any group I coached in my career. Never had a group dig themselves
out of a hole 0‑5 in New York City under the bright lights, and to finish
10‑8, and to be playing the quality of basketball that we are at this stage of
the year. Considering where we were earlier, just says a lot about their
character, testimony to the fact they were raised the right way. We're
fortunate to coach them.  
  
Q. JaKarr, one of the big reasons for the early deficit was the glass; just
a lot of offensive rebounds. Did you feel they were overpowering, they were
outhustling? Was it an energy thing? What did you think was going on there?  
JaKARR SAMPSON: They have more energy than us. Outhustling us and everything.
Just more energy.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Xavier  68  
Marquette - 65

  
COACH CHRIS MACK: Obviously, tournament play, you can't celebrate a win too
long because we'll be right back here in 21 hours, but I'm tremendously proud
not only of these three guys here but the rest of those kids in the locker
room.  
We battled. We played one of the most physical teams in our conference. They
were senior laden. I have a lot of respect for how hard they play and how hard
they compete. But I just thought our guys played tough throughout.  
We got knocked on our heel to start the game, but we responded. To have Dee
out there limping around, you know Isaiah's limping around, Matt Stainbrook
pulling a Willis Reed, I honestly didn't think he was going to play four hours
ago.  
Again, just a great team effort. We move on to play a really good team in
Creighton tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Chris, can you talk about Matt? What changed your mind and allowed him to
come into the game tonight?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: I just had it in my mind that he wasn't playing for the last
ten days. I'm not trying to pull the wool over anybody's eyes. These guys will
tell you Matt hasn't practiced. He's never been around. He's in the training
room. We knew he's working hard. He's very diligent in his approach.  
As the week sort of wore in, David Fluker said, Matt wants to warm up on the
day of the game shootaround. I said okay. When we shot this morning, he looked
pretty good. Again, we're going half speed for the most part in shootaround.
But then as we're going back to the hotel, Fluke said, he wants to play. I
said, "Well, I want him to play too," but it's not my call. The doctor said he
was cleared, and so we were going to use him as much as we could without
overusing him. He did a great job.  
  
Q. Chris, again, this is a team that certainly has been, I guess, kind of
like a Jekyll and Hyde type. Tonight you certainly put on the gas against a
tough team like Marquette. These three gentlemen to the right, how big were
their roles? It seems like these guys had different types of roles but very
key roles.  
COACH CHRIS MACK: We really tried to spread Marquette apart. They're so big.
Otule and Gardner are two of the biggest post players we play all year. At
times they're on the floor together. We tried to spread the floor out as much
as we could. Semaj and Dee did a great job on ball screen situations. And you
have Justin out there, who can really attack a close‑out and space the floor
out with his shooting ability, not to mention down the stretch each of these
guys hitting free throws. It's a big night.  
But I would challenge you on the Jekyll and Hyde. We play in a really, really
tough conference. We won 20 games. We lost 9 of them without Matt. Matt goes
down at Seton Hall and we are down 18‑16\. We play in a very tough conference.
Our kids are resilient. They're not perfect, but we're good.  
  
Q. There are those that believe this win is going to push you into the NCAA
Tournament.  
COACH CHRIS MACK: I like those people.  
  
Q. Do you come into a tournament like this and have any idea about, hey, we
should try to do this, we want to do this to improve the resume? Or is it one
game at a time and see where the chips fall?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: Probably everything you talked about. These guys are smart
kids. You know, what am I going to tell them, don't worry about it? It has
nothing to do with NCAA. They have Twitter. They have Instagram. They know
what's at stake.  
But I'd also tell you that every time we play a game from day one, from game
one up until tonight, we always wrote the four letters in the top right of the
white board that said "NCAA" because deep down that's been a goal of these
guys. We weren't there a year ago. Justin and Dee got to experience it as
freshmen. Semaj has yet to be in one, and that's a goal we had all year long.
They knew what was at stake, and I'm glad we battled for it.  
  
Q. Jake Thomas was a thorn in your side the first two games, 11 three
‑pointers, but tonight only had one. What were you guys able to do to
neutralize him tonight?   
COACH CHRIS MACK: We mixed up our defense between zone and man. Tonight we
probably did the best job playing zone than we did all year. Early on, it
probably scared our guys a little bit because we were getting so many high
post catches, and Burton was diving to the rim. But we never gave up both. We
never gave up Burton diving to the rim and high post plays and circle‑up
threes by Jake Thomas.  
I think it surprised their big guys because they were more on an island than
they've ever been in zone. Then man‑to‑man, Dee will tell you some of the
shots that Jake Thomas hit in game one and game two, you can't do anything
about that. He made a lot of those all year. He's coming off, staggers on one
foot. Sometimes you've got to tip your cap, but I felt tonight we were just as
locked in as we've been.  
  
Q. Chris, you guys have Creighton tomorrow night. How do you go about
defending a player of Doug McDermott's caliber?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: We just shut him down (laughter). We don't let him catch the
ball or shoot a three.  
I mean, you know, you just try your best, play as hard as you can. You try to
deny his catches. You try to load to the ball. You try to contest his shots.
And when you swallow a couple threes, you can't think it's the end of the
world.  
He scored 3,000 points for a reason, but we beat him one time, we lost to him
one time. In both games he had 20‑plus points. We've just got to play their
five, not their one, and do as good of a job on the defensive end as we can.  
  
Q. Semaj, I watched you, of course, play since you were at Brewster Academy.
You were one of the best high school players in the country. You come to a
school with a great tradition in basketball. What has been the transition of
coming from the Atlantic 10 to a great conference like the Big East?  
SEMAJ CHRISTON: I just think the league is more physical, bigger and stronger.
Other than that, every night you're going to have a tough game, home or away.  
  
Q. Do you feel this is a good example of what this conference is about
against a tough team like Marquette?  
SEMAJ CHRISTON: Every night is going to be a big game. You've got to be ready.  
  
Q. Dee, three assists, no turnovers. A huge part of the game was turnovers
coming into it, knowing you had 19 against Marquette last time. Will you talk
about that aspect of the game and how important it was to take care of the
ball tonight.  
DEE DAVIS: That's what we practiced over for the last three days is making
sure we were strong with the ball. Really personally, I felt like we tried to
carry it over. But as a team, I felt like we did that as well.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
Providence - 79  
St. Johns - 74  
  
COACH ED COOLEY: I thought we controlled the whole second half. We got up
pretty big. It's the first time all year we've played without Bryce Cotton for
a period of time. So I'm proud of the development of the group. We came
together and had a hard‑fought win. I thought we played a great team.  
That was a tournament game. I think St. John's is clearly an NCAA team. When
you look at the depth of our league, what's happened in this tournament
clearly shows how strong our league is from top to bottom.  
I think we were very fortunate to win today. I thought we got lucky at the
right time, but I'm really proud of our kids' effort. From what my President
told me, we haven't won down here often. So for us to get off the snide, it's
a great accomplishment for our program.  
I'm excited to advance because that's what tournament play is all about.
There's a lot of game balls to go around, and I couldn't be more proud of the
group. We're excited to play Seton Hall tomorrow. We played them late in the
season, so we got a good feel for them. They're playing very well the last two
games. So get some rest, throw the ball up tomorrow, and play again.  
  
Q. Is it weird sitting up there without Bryce?  
COACH ED COOLEY: If you've had told me Bryce would be 1‑for‑10 and 0‑for‑4
from the three‑point line and we'd be sitting here, I'd be lying to you. He's
been as consistent a player as I coached for a full season. It's about the
guys that are up here, not the ones that are not.  
  
Q. Coach, this win's got to mean a whole lot to the program with Providence
taking down a good team like St. John's. What's going to be the focus going
into the game tomorrow against Seton Hall? They've basically surprised, I
think, everybody in all of college basketball with this win over Villanova.  
COACH ED COOLEY: Winning in tournaments to me don't surprise. You're going to
see more upsets across the country. Again, I talked about the depth of our
league and the quality of our league.  
You know, in tournament play it's a one‑and‑done situation, and you hope to
advance. Again, I'm going to come back to talking about the style of play.
It's about matchups. And sometimes when you don't come out of the gate ready
to go, you get caught.  
  
Q. Ed, can you just talk about getting past Bryce's struggles. You talked to
him at the half. Obviously, he seemed a little bit tight.  
COACH ED COOLEY: No. I talked to him, "stay aggressive" because he definitely
came out aggressive today. That's the first time in his career, since I've
coached him, he's been in foul trouble. He may lead the country in least
amount of fouls committed. He's not a foul giver, I guess. Is that even a
word? A fouler. A fouless, I don't know. I'm not the brightest guy in the
room, but I know he don't foul often. How about that?  
  
Q. I hate to take the focus away from your win, but you sounded pretty
adamant when you said St. John's is a tournament team. Come Sunday, how
surprised would you be if they're not in the field?  
COACH ED COOLEY: I'd be shocked. I would be. I'm not in that room and
selecting anything, but I've played them now three times. They have matchup
problems all over the place. They have length. They have star power.  
They're a tournament team, deservedly so, because they come out of the Big
East and this conference is a monster.  
  
Q. Josh, can you just talk about that stretch in the second half where the
lead went from three to ‑‑ I think you had two threes. Could you sense the
zone where they shifted in the zone for that stretch?   
JOSH FORTUNE: I think they shifted in the zone for that stretch because we did
a good job on offense finding open spots and making shots. I think they
switched to man because we made shots when they were in the zone. We just made
shots.  
  
Q. Carson, just talk about matching up with them physically inside.  
CARSON DESROSIERS: Who?  
  
Q. Just in general, matching up with them.  
CARSON DESROSIERS: They're a physical team. They've got a lot of size, a lot
of athleticism. I think we did a pretty good job on the boards today. I think
that's one of the reasons we won the game.  
  
Q. I have a question for Josh: 24 points today. That's a high. Seemed like a
little bit of a struggle the first half. What did Coach say to you at the
beginning of the second?  
JOSH FORTUNE: He told me to be aggressive and keep shooting. I saw a few
layups go in, and I just felt like I could make every shot. Coach told me to
keep shooting and stay aggressive, and my teammates found me.  
  
Q. You think that was working for you?  
JOSH FORTUNE: Yeah, definitely.  
COACH ED COOLEY: I think Josh is a big reason why we've grown the last five or
six games. He doesn't shoot the ball enough for me. When you look at the
success we've had the last couple of week, he's a big reason for it because
everybody can't have attention on the other guys, especially Kadeem and
LaDontae. And then Bryce draws all the attention.  
But if you leave him open, I think it's going in every time he shoots it. So
he'll be shooting again tomorrow. If not, we're going to have a fight.  
  
Q. Coach, were you surprised Obekpa only had two minutes today?  
COACH ED COOLEY: I don't pay attention to that. I'm trying to coach my own
guys as best I can.  
  
Q. Did that change your game plan a bit?  
COACH ED COOLEY: Not even a little.  
  
Q. Did you see the final seconds of the Seton Hall game?  
LaDONTAE HENTON: We were just focusing on us. We heard about the game, but we
just know we had to get it done, our game in front of us. We know we had a
tough matchup with St. John's, so we know we had to get that done first.  
  
Q. What did you tell the team when St. John's pulled close and they had time
‑outs and they were putting heavy pressure on you? What did you tell your
players in the moment?   
COACH ED COOLEY: Stay in the moment. St. John's was going to have runs, but we
wanted to make sure we had the last run. I continue to tell the team we're the
best free‑throw shooting team in the country, and our best free‑throw shooters
missed‑‑ Cotton, Harris, LaDontae, and our free‑throw shooter who doesn't
often get to the free‑throw line ends up being the hero of the game, going
4‑for‑4, and that's Carson.  
So keep in the moment. Make sure you don't lose your composure. All we had to
do was win by one. That's what I was concerned about.  
  
Q. Josh, can you talk about the game tomorrow, the excitement of going to
the semifinals and also going up against Seton Hall. You split with them
during the season.  
JOSH FORTUNE: We played them twice during the season. We know how they play
and what they want to do or don't want to do. We have to go in there focused
with the game plan and execute offense and defense.  
  
Q. Kadeem, can you just talk about matching their size and intensity and
their defense. They pretty much played zone the entire game.  
KADEEM BATTS: St. John's? We had a good game plan going into it. We wanted to
attack them. We knew they would play zone. Once we had a couple of zone
busters, they had to get out of it and match up man‑to‑man. I felt we did a
good job attacking their defense.  
  
Q. How about your zone defense?  
KADEEM BATTS: Our zone was very good. We matched up well. We communicated. I
felt like that gave them a lot of trouble.  
  
Q. Ed, you think St. John's is in. Do you think you're all set for the NCAA
Tournament?  
COACH ED COOLEY: The Big East should have five, six teams in this tournament
every single year. Hopefully, you know, but right now I'm not concerned about
that. I'm concerned about Seton Hall and how we're going to guard their
interior, how we're going to guard their quickness, how we're going to guard
their three‑point shooting. I'm worried about Seton Hall. Everything else will
take care of itself.  
But I do know one thing: When you play in this league and play on this stage,
we're the best teams in the country when it comes to playing competitively
night in and night out, and that's why we're in the situation we're in.  
Thank you.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Seton Hall  64  
Villanova - 63

  
Q. Sterling, what was the plan there? Was it kind of a scramble thing, or
was that the plan to take it?  
STERLING GIBBS: It ended up being a little bit of a scramble. The plan kind of
got switched up a little bit because of something someone‑‑  
EUGENE TEAGUE: A little bit?  
STERLING GIBBS: Yeah, a lot of bit. In the end, it was supposed to get in my
hands, and I was supposed to create a shot for my teammates or create a shot
for myself, and I just stepped back and hit the jumper.  
  
Q. Sterling, can you describe what it's like to win this game on this
stage.  
STERLING GIBBS: It was big time. You beat the No.3 team in the country, it's
always a good feeling. You go into the game with the big game plan. You come
into the tournament knowing that you have to win four games in four days. So
to just get one step closer to that is definitely a great feeling.  
  
Q. You certainly know a whole lot about Big East basketball. Your brother,
of course, played here four years as a member of the Pitt Panthers. What does
it mean to you to play in the Big East, and better yet, be the hero in a big
tournament like this, knocking out a tough team like Villanova?  
STERLING GIBBS: It's a good feeling. I think you should give Patrik and Eugene
a lot more credit than me. I just hit one shot, and they hit a whole lot more
shots than I did. They kept us in the game.  
  
Q. Coach, what does it say about your team as they fall behind after having
a big lead, and then coming back and win the game down the stretch.  
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: We never really got rattled. We got rattled a little bit
when they jumped on us. When it was 47‑44, we talked about getting back and
getting stops. We got two big stops in a row, and then Fuquan hit a big three,
and Sterling's pass to Jaren for the three was big.  
These guys have showed great character all year. They've battled through a lot
of injuries. They battled through tough losses. I think that's our ninth
one‑point game this year. These guys have a lot of heart. They have a lot of
character, and they deserve to win.  
  
Q. Coach, you got the shirt that the guys always wear, "The Pirate Way". Can
you just talk a little bit about‑‑ is there something about‑‑  
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: No, it's Adidas (laughter).  
  
Q. You got a little plug for them.  
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: The last thing I know about "The Pirate Way" is probably
being on a ship and burying buried treasure. It's nice they sent us new shirts
for the tournament.  
  
Q. Then let me just ask, all these one ‑point games, is there something
about this team down the stretch?   
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: I mean, I'll be honest with you. I think we've had six
one‑point losses, it takes a lot out of you. And one of the referees told me
the other night, he said, he's never seen a team go through what we've gone
through and still come back and play hard every night.  
I just think it's the character of these guys. They showed up every night.
They showed up for the most part every practice. And they've played extremely
hard.  
So for these guys to get some success for all the effort and hard work they
put in, as a coach, that's what you're most happy about.  
  
Q. Patrik, you were pretty dominant in the first half tonight. What was the
importance of fouling out last night and coming back strong tonight?  
PATRIK AUDA: I think we're all really excited about the win yesterday, and
they just kind of got us going. So I was really excited to play today again,
especially yesterday I was in a little bit of foul trouble and didn't play
that many minutes. So I was just ready to go right from the beginning.  
  
Q. Coach, for so many years, this year to last year, your two big guys were
out part of the time. How important was it for today's game to get that kind
of lift from the team?  
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: It's nice. Everybody always says to me, "Patrik's really
going." This is what Patrik was like last year before he broke his foot. This
is what Patrik was like the first five games before he re‑injured his foot.  
And Eugene, I thought was becoming the most dominant center in the league,
right behind Devante. And I think I said he's finally back from his
concussion. It was one of the worst falls a college player could have. It's
just taken time.  
I think he has confidence in his foot. He has a big screw in his foot, and it
takes a little time to know what feels right, what doesn't feel right. And
same thing with Eugene, every time he gets a headache, is it a concussion
symptom? Is it this? We've had to treat both of them with kid gloves, but
they've both brought it.  
  
Q. Eugene, Sterling, you've guys said you were good enough when you're all
healthy and all together and all on the floor to do things like tonight. Did
you ever think that there was a point where either you were going to do it or
you weren't going to do it?  
EUGENE TEAGUE: I definitely thought we were going to do it. Sterling made a
great shot, but I thought we could definitely beat Villanova tonight. I wasn't
doubting us.  
  
Q. Coach, what made you decide to call a time ‑out there on that last
transition play?   
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: Fuquan had the ball. If Sterling or Jaren had it, I
probably would have let them go, but Fuquan at the top of the key against
their defense, that's not‑‑ on a rip‑through move or a catch‑and‑rip, that's
his specialty. But off the dribble, I wanted the ball in either Sterling's
hands or even Patrik. That's why I gave it to Patrik when we turned it over.
He had Ochefu beat. I think Arch made a nice steal.  
We usually don't like to call time‑outs. We usually like just to go. But I
wanted the ball, at that time, in Sterling's hands.  
  
Q. Sterling, you mentioned four games in four days. You've won two. How
confident are you guys going to be going forward into tomorrow's game with
this?  
STERLING GIBBS: We're really confident, honestly, especially after you beat
the No.3 team in the country. They're the best team in the Big East, and by
the same time, we know, if we can beat them, we can beat anyone. So we're just
up for the challenge.  
  
Q. For Eugene: Given what you've been through this week being sick and
everything, how did you feel coming into the game physically?  
EUGENE TEAGUE: I felt good, you know. I'm not really thinking about being
sick. I'm just out there trying to make opportunities to give us a chance to
win. I felt good.  
  
Q. Coach, in the conference season, Pirates were the eighth seed, and you
really turned it around in the conference tournament. What have you done
differently so far?  
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: Again, I hate using excuses, but we didn't have our
starting center for the first six games. We lost Fuquan for the first really
four and a half, I'd say five until he was back.  
Actually, even though we didn't win that many games, I thought we were playing
pretty good basketball towards the end of the season. I thought the only bad
game we played was Butler. We played Creighton tough and lost by one. DePaul
played really well. They're a great basketball team. We beat somebody else.  
I really thought if we could get past Butler, we could beat anybody. I didn't
think we could get‑‑ but I was really scared about getting past Butler. It's a
tough matchup for us. They defend really well on us, and I thought, if we
could get past them, we could get some momentum and just keep going.  
Thanks, guys.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Ryan Arcidiacono](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24960)

### [Josh Hart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26656)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
Seton Hall - 64  
Villanova - 63  
  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: That was a great college basketball game, great to be a part
of it, great atmosphere. The Garden was rocking. We had a lot of fun.  
Seton Hall, they just played great. It was a great college basketball game.
They played better. They made the plays at the end. We made a play. They made
a play a couple times.  
I just thought they played extremely well. We started off the game not
shooting the ball well. We had good shots; didn't make them, battled back.
That's what tournament time is all about. They made a great play; give them
credit.  
I think that game was about Seton Hall really executing and really playing
well. I don't think it was about us playing poorly.  
  
Q. Jay, you guys, as you said, missed a lot of shots in the first half, but
you kept getting to the line and pounding it in there and getting free throws
and chances. Did that make you think at halftime you still had a pretty good
shot to come back and take the game?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: We have a good team. I know they're not going to quit. We
were getting shots we wanted. We were getting to the foul line. We missed free
throws. We missed shots we normally make.  
But good teams find a way to win anyway. We've had other games like that this
year where we didn't make free throws, didn't make shots, and we found a way
to win.  
I thought we came back, Darrun hitting that shot gave us a chance. They came
up with a better play. I think it's one of those games we've just got to give
them credit.  
  
Q. Coach, how concerned would you be, this is the third time playing this
team? Does that get in your head?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Probably in the back of my head, yeah, you think about all
those things. Once the game starts, you've got to concentrate on this game.  
We had a tough game with them at their place. They're a very, very good
offensive team. I thought they played smart defense tonight, gave some of our
guys shots that they wanted to give shots to, and we let those guys take them.
We just didn't make them.  
I thought they were a very smart defensively tonight. And it paid off for
them.  
  
Q. What does this mean for your NCAA Tournament? Probably won't be a 1 seed,
but might be a 2 now. Going into the Tournament, how will you guys feel?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: You've all heard me say this before: This was not about 1
seeds, 2 seeds. This was about we wanted to come to Madison Square Garden and
win the Big East Tournament. Winning the Big East Tournament would mean much
more to us than a 1 seed.  
This is a great tournament. We want to be here until Saturday. I think we're
most disappointed about that. The NCAA Tournament seedings, my belief is 1, 2,
3, it doesn't matter that much. You're going to play great teams.  
  
Q. For Ryan: You and Bell and Hilliard obviously struggled to shoot in the
first half in particular. Was it anything they did, or did you just feel like
you weren't on your game today?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: No, we just took open shots. We just weren't making them. I
know Darrun and Josh had a couple of them. I made my first one and then got a
couple of other elbow jumpers and an open three. It just didn't fall for us.  
The second half we find of picked up our defense, and that's where we got some
easy layups, easy buckets, and we started making it in the second half. We got
the shots we wanted to. They just weren't falling for us.  
  
Q. Coach, about a month ago, in an interview, you were talking about the
teams in the Big East, and you actually had mentioned that Seton Hall, if all
their players could play, could beat the best teams in the country. And this
kind of proves your point, right?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Yeah, I didn't really want to do that today (laughter). I'd
rather have been wrong, but I do believe that. I really do.  
I also said DePaul. You saw that last night. I know how good these teams are.
I think my quote was, "Nobody would want to play these guys on these teams in
a one‑and‑done game."  
I just know the quality of coaching in this league. I know the quality of
play. I think some of the teams that finished in the bottom of the league
early in the season had injury problems, had suspensions. Just early in the
season in nonconference play, they weren't at full strength. So it didn't make
any noise nationally. But then once we all started playing games and they got
to full strength, they were really good teams.  
  
Q. When you played Seton Hall last month at your place, you guys really
torched them inside in the paint. What was the difference in their defense
tonight?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: I thought Teague was really good defensively tonight. We had
trouble scoring on him. For some reason, he was not as effective defensively
the last time we played them. He did a really good job.  
We got the ball into JayVaughn a number of times, and I thought he had some
good looks, and he contested them. JayVaughn got to the foul line ten times,
so this time he didn't make free throws.  
The difference between winning and losing is so close. We missed ten free
throws. We're a pretty good free‑throw shooting team. If we made free throws,
we might be sitting here talking about a different outcome. That's the game.  
As I said, I think they played smart. There were times‑‑ they got real
physical with JayVaughn in there, rather than worrying about Teague getting in
foul trouble. He finished with four. There was a play there at the end he
might have had his fifth, but they called it on somebody else. It was just
smart on their part on how Teague played.  
  
Q. For Josh and Arch, you guys went on a 16 ‑0 run, took the lead 47‑44 on
Hilliard's three. Did you both kind of feel like the momentum has swung, we
kind of flipped it, and we're finally where we want to be? Did you kind of
sense that?   
JOSH HART: Yeah, definitely a little bit. We picked up our defense in the
second half. So that really gave us a chance to be in the ballgame. So when we
go on a big run like that, it always gives us momentum.  
  
Q. Arch, is a loss like this pretty dramatic? You guys had that big
pushback, as we said, and a lot of teams would probably have wilted in that
situation, but they punched back. But getting a loss in this kind of
environment, a few days removed from Selection Sunday as you prepare for the
tournament, can it serve as something positive, just as a painful gash or a
reminder? "The tournament is next week; we can't afford to have any
performances like this going forward."   
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I guess you could say that, but for us, we want to win when
we're, like, during games when we're not shooting the ball as well. We didn't
play as well defensively as we could have in the first half. In the second
half we picked it up.  
But like you said, in the NCAA Tournament, it's one and done. We have to bring
it right from start. We can't have Coach call a quick time‑out. We have to
bring it. It comes from practice every day and just going at each other.  
  
Q. How important is it for you to come back here in the East region, if you
can make it to the Sweet 16? Would you like to come back?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: You know, honestly, any of that stuff in the NCAA
Tournament, I really don't care about. There's so many variables in the NCAA
Tournament. We played a first‑round game twice in the Wells Fargo Center, and
we're down in the second half. I thought it was tough playing at home. I
thought there was pressure on us.  
And then we had other times in the second‑round game at the Wells Fargo Center
against Arizona in '06, we never would have won that game if we didn't have
the crowd behind us.  
There's so many variables, we don't worry about any of that. We're happy to be
in there. We'll play anybody anywhere, and we don't talk about that stuff.  
  
Q. You alluded to the free throws a couple of minutes ago. You guys have
been struggling from the line recently. How much of that is a concern for you
right now?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: We work on it every day. We've always been a good free‑throw
shooting team. I don't think there's anything more you can do about it. I
think it's who we are. We've got to play that way.  
When certain guys aren't making free throws‑‑ like JayVaughn's been like 78
percent from the foul line. So he just had a bad day. It's just who we are.
Like I don't make it a concern, like, oh, that's going to be our Achilles
heel. We'll just play that way, knowing that sometimes some of our guys don't
make free throws.  
Thank you, guys.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2014

  

### [D'Vauntes Smith-
Rivera](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24979)

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

### [Jabril Trawick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26645)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

DePaul - 60  
Georgetown - 56

  
Q. What did you tell your team in the locker room? And thoughts going
forward and what do you have in mind for the postseason?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: I just told them when we're leaving in the morning.
Postseason, the tournament, we'll see. Our body of work, you've seen and heard
what we're doing. It's kind of hard to sit and talk about that following this
loss. This is hard to not think about this loss.  
We'll see. We'll see. I don't know how things look after today. Our strength
of schedule is ninth in the country. We went through a very rough stretch. We
had a starter out when Jabril was out. From the time he got hurt until the
time he came back, we were 1‑5 during that stretch.  
They say they'd take injuries into consideration. Tonight's loss is
disappointing.  
Next question.  
  
Q. John, was the energy there that you wanted tonight, that you wanted to
see your team in a game, I guess, you felt you had to win to get to
Saturday?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: I didn't think it was lack of energy. I thought our
guys played hard.  
  
Q. Do you think you guys got caught looking ahead to tomorrow night's
matchup and looked past today?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: I don't.  
  
Q. John, last time against DePaul, you were able to get to the line 41
times, tonight only 16. Anything change in your mind? Also the turnovers last
time. You had 7 against them last time; tonight you had 11.  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: No. I'll just say maybe they didn't foul as much this
game as they did in Chicago.  
  
Q. Coach, was there more of an emphasis put on attacking the basket coming
out in the second half there? You hit a lot of jump shots in the first half.
You seemed to get more in the paint to start off the second.  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: Yes and no. This is disappointing to us, but you've
got to give a whole heck of a lot of credit to Oliver and his team and his
staff. They played a very good game, a very, very good game. They were poised
when they had to be poised, and they made the plays when they had to make the
plays.  
Sometimes it's hard not to think about us, but they did a terrific job
tonight.  
Back to your question, yeah, we did want to. Even though in the first half we
were getting open shots, they just weren't going in. We were getting exactly
what we wanted, I felt. But we did make‑‑ okay, they're not going in, so now
let's get it into the paint. We tried to get a few post‑ups early from Jabril
for Nate. We wanted our guys to attack, and it didn't work.  
  
Q. Did you feel at all the team was tight at any point during the game?  
D'VAUNTES SMITH‑RIVERA: There was a few minor errors defensively. They had a
few offensive rebounds consecutive, and it hurt us down the stretch. You could
see those baskets at the end were what separated us for a while.  
So I think it was mainly just the rebounds, and transition defense also
affected us.  
  
Q. Jabril, just your thoughts on what your body of work and if it's worthy
of the NCAA Tournament, even after this loss?  
JABRIL TRAWICK: I mean, I hope so. I think that we beat a lot of good teams
this year. I mean, we played a lot of good teams this year. I mean, we've been
through a lot with the program this year. I think, like Coach said, it's hard
to look at it tonight.  
I think it's disappointing we didn't come out with the win, but at the end of
the day, I think that we're a tournament team. I mean, we'll see.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2014

  

### [Khyle Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24417)

### [Brandon Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26622)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Seton Hall - 51  
Butler - 50

  
COACH BRANDON MILLER: I love the resiliency in our guys. I love the toughness
in our guys in order to come back in that game.  
I thought there were multiple times when we could have easily given up, lay
down; we didn't. We fought.  
Like I told our guys, there's some nights that just aren't your night. We
struggled to shoot the ball in the basket. We struggled to connect on passes
late game. We struggled to make the plays that we needed to make in order to
win a game like that.  
But I give a lot of credit to Seton Hall, the way they played. Coached well,
played well, and they got us tonight.  
  
Q. Brandon, how difficult was it offensively when you couldn't get Kellen or
Alex to get anything to fall?  
COACH BRANDON MILLER: They struggled. And, again, Seton Hall did a good job of
staying on Kellen. They knew where he was at all times during the zone. K.D.
did a pretty good job of moving without the ball, at the same time, they had
an awareness of where he was.  
A couple times late in the game, when he did get good looks, he hadn't gotten
a look like that in a while; threw him out of his rhythm.  
And then Alex has played as well as he has in his entire career over the last
two games. Just didn't make a shot. He had some looks. Looks didn't go in
tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about that final play (no microphone).  
COACH BRANDON MILLER: They put a guy on the ball, and then they allowed the
ball to be entered, as long as it was in the backcourt, and then they wanted
to keep the ball in front of them and make us shoot over the top.  
Didn't know whether they were going to pressure and make it hard for us to
inbound the ball, but they allowed us to inbound the ball. We got a half‑court
shot, and it didn't go in.  
  
Q. Khyle, a senior never enters his last game thinking "This could be my
last game," but when the final shot didn't go in, what went through your mind?
  
KHYLE MARSHALL: I can't believe it's over. It hit me pretty hard, knowing that
this could possibly be my last game in a Butler uniform, but I got to give
credit to our guys. They fought the whole game, all 40 minutes, even when we
were down, down double digits late in the second half. They continued to
fight, and they continued to fight. I couldn't have been more proud of my guys
tonight.  
But once the ball didn't go in, I was just in disbelief.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you think Seton Hall did differently tonight in comparison
to the last game of the season on Saturday?  
COACH BRANDON MILLER: The number one thing is they didn't lose Kellen Dunham
on defense, especially early in the game. They had a much better awareness of
where he was. They extended their zone out further than probably what they
normally extend. That would be the biggest difference.  
  
Q. Coach, at the end of your first year as the head of the program, how do
you see it going forward?  
KHYLE MARSHALL: To look back on this year, I love the fact that we played our
best basketball towards the end of the season. I thought we really‑‑ I thought
we improved.  
We have a lot of good pieces in our program right now. We have good pieces
coming in. I love the strides that we made. Obviously, I like the improvement,
but I understand that we're not where we need to be right now. We need to
continue to get better.  
But I do think we're heading in the right direction and going the right way.  
  
Q. Coach, now that you've been through the full season in the Big East, what
are your thoughts?  
COACH BRANDON MILLER: It's a very strong league. I don't know how many leagues
can say that their 7 seed in the tournament has the wins that our 7 seed in
our tournament has. When you think of Georgetown and who they played and who
they've beaten, you could‑‑ I don't know how many teams will ultimately get in
the NCAA Tournament, but you could argue that seven of the teams, depending on
how they play, might possibly could get in.  
Obviously, we're not going to get all seven because all seven can't win, but
all seven are right there and talked about to be one of those teams. So that's
70 percent of your league playing at that type of a level.  
There's not a day where you have a guaranteed win, no matter who you play. You
go into venues that are hard to play and get road wins, but from top to
bottom, obviously, it's a very competitive league.  
  
Q. Khyle, did you ever let yourself think a couple free throws here, a
couple close games there ‑‑ you guys had a couple of close overtime games
early on‑‑ this could have been entirely different?   
KHYLE MARSHALL: No. We can't look at one specific thing that got us behind at
all. There's multiple plays where we could have did something here, something
there, but you can't really put it on one particular play where something
happened.  
Throughout the game, no one ever plays a perfect game. So you can't really
blame it on particularly one thing. All I know is our guys fought for 40
minutes, and we had a chance to win.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2014

  

### [Billy Garrett, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26644)

### [Oliver Purnell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15064)

### [Brandon Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21821)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

DePaul - 60  
Georgetown - 56

  
COACH OLIVER PURNELL: Obviously, that was a heck of a win for our ball club,
but I think our guys earned it every step of the way but their approach. The
last several days in practice, after the Butler game where we probably played
as bad as we could, these guys came in with a proper attitude and really
worked at it.  
We've been talking about March and what opportunities lie in March for a
couple weeks now, and I think our guys internalized that. But certainly that
could have gotten washed away when we didn't play so well in our last game.  
But I think that speaks to the character of this group. We talked about pride
in our team, pride in ourselves, but pride in our school. We talked about "We
Are DePaul", and we want to prove that we're better than that, we want to
prove that we can play. We want to prove that we can win.  
So we had that opportunity, and certainly the guys took advantage of it
tonight by just being mentally into the game the entire game, up, down,
whatever, they stayed with it. I'm proud of them, but we want to stay longer.
We want to stay longer.  
  
Q. Oliver, obviously, the last game against Butler was a tale of two games
pretty much. How did you get your team up for this game?  
COACH OLIVER PURNELL: Again, they just listened. We talked about gaining
perspective. It is now March, the most important time of the year, the most
important game. Every year, every March there are a few teams that make some
noise. We have an opportunity to do that by being consistent in some of the
ways that we play this year.  
So we just kind of brought out old film, and we played well particularly well
against Georgetown, saying we've got to do it for 40 minutes. We've got to be
all in. We've got absolutely nothing to lose. They embraced that approach and
attitude.  
And, again, playing for pride, pride for our school and ourself and our team.  
  
Q. Oliver, with everything that's happened with Cleveland (Melvin) leaving,
how gratifying is this win tonight and the way you guys ended the season on
such a down note with all the losses?  
COACH OLIVER PURNELL: Well, it would be gratifying either way. This is that
time of year where you're trying to win the championship. So to get a
first‑round win, particularly, it's an upset. That's going to be gratifying
either way. I can't quantify it in terms of that because this is what you play
for this time of year, and you want to be playing your best.  
Obviously, this was one of, if not our best game of the year.  
  
Q. Brandon, you finally got here to return. What does it mean for you? And
how hard was it watching it from the bench?  
BRANDON YOUNG: It means a lot to me. Watching it from the bench, it was tough,
but you know, I knew it was guys out there who was capable of getting the job
done, like Billy.  
Forrest stepped up big for us today. Like I said, Billy had a great game
today. I played horrible, but that's why I got teammates. They were picking me
up and being positive, and we came out with the win.  
  
Q. Oliver, you guys have Creighton tomorrow night. How do you guys go about
defending a player of Doug McDermott's caliber?  
COACH OLIVER PURNELL: That's difficult. We played them tough the last time we
played them out at Creighton. In fact, I think it was a one‑point game with
six to play. McDermott kind of went to work and kind of took over there.  
So I don't think we're going to reveal exactly the way we're going to play
them, but play them a little bit differently coming down the stretch. We'd
love to be in that same spot tomorrow night and see if we can do some things
to slow him down. It is very difficult to stop him. I got tremendous respect
for his ability.  
He's got some pretty good teammates, but you got to kind of pick your poison.
Do you let him beat you, or do you force one of his teammates or a couple of
his teammates to beat you?  
  
Q. Billy, can you talk about the way you closed the game out, you guys,
especially on the free ‑throw line?   
BILLY GARRETT, JR.: Yeah, in shootaround and practice, the coach preached free
throws. He said every one counts, and it's going to come down to free throws,
and it did.  
So we listened to that, and we paid attention to it in practice, and we worked
on it. When it came down the stretch, it really did come to free throws, and
we were able to knock them down.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2014

  

### [Fuquan Edwin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24932)

### [Eugene Teague](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24933)

### [Kevin Willard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21832)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Seton Hall 51  
Butler 50

  
Q. Coach, it seems like the game plan was to take Kellen Dunham out of the
picture considering what happened a few days ago. Is that accurate?  
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: Yeah, we were going to give up jumpers to Marshall, maybe
jumpers to Barlow, which we did. But he just killed us. You let him get going,
and you're going to be in for a long night.  
We lost him a couple times, but for the most part, I thought we did a really
good job on him.  
  
Q. How do you turn around lose by 17 and then turn around and win four days
later?  
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: We watched the film and saw what we did wrong. These guys
always bounce back pretty good. We looked back and saw our mistakes and said,
look, if we correct these, we'll have a pretty good chance.  
We played them at home. We played them somewhat decently. We missed pretty big
opportunities.  
This is the Big East Tournament. If you can't get ready for the Big East
Tournament, there's something wrong with you.  
  
Q. Was there a bigger emphasis to go down low than Saturday? Seemed like you
were a little more reluctant on the three ball.  
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: We put four new plays in in two days to try to get the
ball to Eugene. They do a very‑‑ they are as good a defensive team as you'll
see when they're playing the way we're playing right there.  
We put four new plays in. That's pretty much what we ran. Just trying to get
him the basketball. They do a good job of doing it. But I thought our guys
really focused in, and we put four new plays in in two days. Sometimes it's a
little tough, and they did a good job.  
  
Q. Does it feel good to finally get one of these one ‑point games?   
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: I've played in the Big East Tournament. I've now been
here forever, coached it an assistant. It's awesome. It really is.  
Just playing the Big East Tournament, just getting a "W" in the Big East
Tournament, it's a great feeling.  
  
Q. I just wanted to ask you what it felt to know they're going to play at
least one more game, these guys to your right.  
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: They can answer that.  
EUGENE TEAGUE: It feels great, you know.  
FUQUAN EDWIN: Yeah, it's a good feeling, just knowing that we're able to
advance and continue to play for Seton Hall. We're trying to take it all the
way, and we believe in ourselves. So we're going to work for it.  
  
Q. Can you just describe the steal at the very end, what was going on, what
you saw?  
FUQUAN EDWIN: I seen him driving towards the baseline. I tried to read him,
and I knew he was running into trouble on two of my guys, was right there
stepping up on him. And I just anticipated the pass, and I came up with it.  
  
Q. Coach, this is probably the shortest turnaround to playing another team.
When do you start preparing for the next game?  
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: I think we had a short turnaround last year, didn't we?
We played South Florida at 11:00 at night and played Syracuse at 2:00.  
The great thing about this league‑‑ and this league is phenomenal‑‑ is the
fact that now that we're out of the true round robin, everybody knows
everybody. So for us to go back and watch film tonight, it's not like you have
to learn personnel. We know James Bell, we know Arch, we know Pinkston.  
So it's not like it's going to be a whole new refresher, and I think that's
one of the reasons why the games all year long have been tremendous is the
fact that‑‑ FOX has done a tremendous job of putting every game on TV. So we
all see it, and everybody knows everybody. I think it's made the league
tremendous.  
  
Q. Kevin, I'm just wondering that last play, what did you expect Butler to
run? And sort of what were your thoughts as that ball's in the air?  
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: You know, really, I was actually expecting them to try to
curl Barlow and then screen in for Dunham. And then we saw Dunham take it out.
Brandon did a good job of not letting him get it back.  
When the shot goes up like that, I think I've seen enough six overtime game
against‑‑ back in the day. There's been enough shots made in this tournament,
you just sit here and say, hopefully, this isn't one of those things that goes
on, another 30 For 30 in 30 years.  
I'm proud of my guys. I think Fuquan and Eugene, the seniors, really did a
good job of refocusing this group after the loss. They came out with great
intensity. We didn't play great offensively, but you've got to give them a lot
of credit for that.  
  
Q. Can you just discuss the way Eugene played. He scored all your points in
the last nine minutes.  
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: Eugene played terrific. No one really knew this. He's
been battling the flu since Saturday. I wasn't even sure he was going to be
able to play as bad as he looked yesterday.  
The big fella has been key for us all year. That was a huge blow when we lost
him with a concussion. He's played great basketball the last five games. To be
honest with you, he's probably finally getting over the concussion, and more
importantly, the Krispy Kreme doughnuts he was eating while he was out with a
concussion.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you see out of Patrik today? What did they do to him to
take him out of the game?  
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: Patrik got foul trouble. It was tough to get in the flow.
He only played 17 minutes, and he really didn't play the second half. That
hurt us, not having Patrik. In the second half of games, we run a lot of
things through him, and not having him out there, we kind of stalled a little
bit offensively because he made a nice high‑low pass to Eugene. He's able to
handle the basketball in certain situations.  
They did a good job on Patrik. They made a nice adjustment. They dug much
earlier on him, but he didn't get a whole lot of opportunities because of foul
trouble.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask about, obviously, the end of the game with the steal, but
the start of the game, you seemed to ‑‑ I don't know, you were bouncing out of
your shoes almost. Were you just so jazzed at the beginning? I mean, describe
just a little bit when the game started, what you were feeling like.   
FUQUAN EDWIN: No, that's me every game. That's my role on this team. Coach
calls it the "fool effect". I just try to bring my energy so my guys could
feed off of it. If I could have everyone playing like that, having hands
active.  
Coach preaches on deflections, and it just leads up to easy points.  
  
Q. Was it any different tonight, just knowing, obviously, any loss could be
your last one?  
FUQUAN EDWIN: It was no different. I didn't play like that in my mindset. I
just wanted to play hard and give them my all and leave it on the court. I
think we all did that.  
  
Q. Eugene, just following up on what Kevin said, how are you able to cope
with, obviously, not feeling well?  
EUGENE TEAGUE: This was my last go‑round. I wasn't going to sit it out. I was
going to battle through it.  
  
Q. What will the schedule be like? How much of a walk ‑through can you do?
How much of a practice can you do?   
COACH KEVIN WILLARD: We'll get back to the hotel. We'll let these guys shower
up and change. We'll come down. We'll eat. We'll watch our‑‑ we really
probably won't watch personnel. We'll watch our defense against them, our
offense against them. We'll make any adjustments that we want to.  
We'll do everything defensively tonight, and tomorrow morning we'll have an
8:00 walk‑through in the ballroom, have breakfast, and come back here.  
There's really not much else you can do.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
MARK TURGEON: Happy to be here. Obviously with a season you're always excited,
but when you're joining a new league, it even makes it a little bit more
exciting. I guess it's the unknown, not sure what you're getting into. I've
followed a lot of these coaches for a long time, followed the program, so I
know they're all excellent coaches, great programs, and, arguably, it's been
the best league in the country the last four or five years. So with that said,
there's a lot of anticipation going into it, and we're looking forward to it.  
It's a great league, and we're excited about being in the Big Ten.  
  
Q. What do you see in the contrast? Is there a contrast in styles?
Obviously, you haven't played in the Big Ten yet, but any film review or
anything revealed that this might be a different style of play for you and
your program?  
MARK TURGEON: No, I don't think so. We're going to play a little bit
differently this year ourselves, but when you get into leagues like this now,
you have 14 teams, ACC had a lot of teams. I think we had 15 last year. You're
going to have all kinds of styles. Instead of playing Virginia, you might be
playing Wisconsin, instead of playing Clemson, you might be playing Purdue,
and I can go on and on. There's teams we played in last year's league that
play the same way as teams in the Big Ten. There's going to be finesse teams,
there's going to be real physical teams, there's going to be fast teams,
there's going to be slow teams, you've just got to figure out who they are and
adjust and play against those teams.  
  
Q. In contrasting styles, but also you have so much institutional memory of
the ACC, how difficult is that to try to replicate that to go into a new
league where you're playing 13 teams, maybe only one you played in the
previous year?  
MARK TURGEON: Oh, you know, it is what it is. Fortunately for me or
unfortunately for me, I've moved around. I've been in quite a few leagues now.
I didn't anticipate this one, but here we are, so I'm used to it.  
We put a lot of film study in here in the fall to the teams. My assistant
coaches, film guy will do a lot of that work, putting things together for me
to study.  
It is what it is. You know, obviously right now we probably don't have a
rival, but five years from now we might not be their first rival, but we'll
have a rival in this league, and there will be big games for us in this league
and ones that our fans get excited about. The Big Ten did a great job for us
giving us a great home schedule this year. We have a lot of big names,
powerful programs coming into Maryland this year that will have our fans
pretty excited.  
  
Q. I wondered in the leagues that you've coached in what your experience has
been with the different scheduling formats for conference play, and I guess
there's eight one ‑plays in the Big Ten this year. I'm wondering if the
regular season is becoming devalued because of the loss of the round‑robin
schedule.   
MARK TURGEON: I don't know if it's being devalued because there's still 18
games and 18 tough ones. Obviously everybody plays a different schedule. It's
almost impossible with so many teams to put the schedule together. I think the
Big Ten did a nice job with the three‑year cycle that they're going to have.
It is what it is. You look at your 18 games, you do the best you can, and some
year you might get lucky and have a little bit easier schedule, and some years
you might have a tougher schedule. But you won't know until you play the game.
Sometimes it looks on paper like it's going to be tough, and it might not be,
and sometimes on paper what looks like it's not going to be tough, it's
tougher than you think.  
It is what it is. It's college basketball today. I think every league can
almost say that. It's not a natural round‑robin type thing, but it's the
nature of our sport today.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Bo Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17045)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
BO RYAN: On behalf of the players, the run these guys made, I was happy to be
a part of that. I couldn't have been around a better group of young men. I
thought they handled everything real well, very proud of them. Now, we've got
some work to do.  
  
Q. Over the last few seasons, you guys have kind of flown under the radar.
Now this year you guys have been picked as the top dog in the conference. How
do you guys handle that as the season begins?  
BO RYAN: Well, it really doesn't affect when we're doing our transition
defensive drills, I don't think my guys are thinking about that. Our guys live
in the moment, or at least we're trying to‑‑ it appears that way. They're
trying to get better. They know there's weaknesses to shore up, and we're
trying to accentuate our strengths. Basketball is a game of momentum, a game
of streaks, which we saw last year with our season. But I think what our guys
have done is just, we lost a very important part to graduation in Ben Brust,
but he stretched the defenses. He was a great rebounder for his size. Nobody
for his size rebounded the way he did. He gave us some dimensions that might
be a little difficult to replace, but we've got some guys that are trying to
do that right now.  
But as far as the expectations and everything else, most of the players that
are playing in the Big Ten played in high schools where their teams were
targeted, where their teams were marked. So I think they're kind of used to
that kind of attention to where it doesn't affect how hard they know they need
to work. What I've seen so far in practice is they're practicing the same way
they have those couple years you mentioned under the radar, so to speak.
They're practicing every bit as hard as that, if not more.  
  
Q. You talked about the loss of Ben Brust to graduation. How much confidence
do you have in underclassmen like Bronson Koenig and Nigel Hayes to pick up
that production?  
BO RYAN: Well, we're hoping for some surprises. Not a lot of questions last
year were asked about Nigel Hayes or Bronson Koenig last year. The fact that
you're mentioning their names now, they've had some experience, they've been
in the mix, they've been under fire, so hopefully that translates into a more
mature, physically and mentally, approach when they get on the court. We're
going to need that.  
  
Q. You guys are often known as kind of being the sum is more than the parts
team. Is there something to getting that kind of Big Ten national recognition
kind of honors?  
BO RYAN: Well, having been around a little bit, how soon do we forget the
Sports Illustrated cover of Orlando Tucker and Brian Butch. Devin Harris
played in our program, Jordan Taylor. We've had First‑Team All‑Big‑Ten guys. I
think what you're referring to, though, is that collectively for a couple
players, or even more so, sixth man of the year last year in a Nigel Hayes.
When you say sum of the parts, there are good players throughout the league on
every team, and it's how that mixture plays off of one another that usually
makes the difference in how your season comes out. Last year I thought our
guys played off of each other, as well as anybody in the country, and
therefore I thought that was the reason for the run that we made at the end.
But we've had parts before that got some attention.  
  
Q. Back in the day when there were 11 teams in this conference, you were the
one guy that said, let's play 20 games during the regular season and make it
even. Now that there's 14 teams in the conference, does the eight one ‑plays
that you're going to have going forward, does it bother you? What's your
opinion on it?  
BO RYAN: Let's play 26. Ernie Banks said let's play two, didn't he? No, 20
would be great. Scheduling is so hard nowadays. I've said this before, so I'm
not going to beat a drum here about scheduling, but to play the RPI teams and
to play where their RPIs will be at the time, to play 20 games in our league,
I think it would be great for the league if we could squeeze it in, if we
could do it. There's a lot of other factors. It's not like Mark Rudner sits up
and night thinking, oh, good, let's see if we can't get 20 or 22 league games
scheduled in here. I don't think he's looking at that. I think there's been
some test runs at looking at things.  
I would not be opposed to playing 20 at all.  
  
Q. After making the Final Four last year for the first time since 2000, what
types of challenges are ahead of you in trying to return to that big stage?  
BO RYAN: Well, I think challenges for coaches and coaches staffs are the same
whether you finished bottom half of your league, if you finished .500. Still,
for the next season, what you're looking to do is try to see if you can
continue to develop your players. That's our job. We're mentors. We're trying
to get them better, not just as individuals but as teammates. I've always
approached every season the same way, this being my 43rd in this profession.
You can't possibly think that I woke up this fall thinking, oh, wow, I'm going
to do something different this year. We're not. The coaching staff isn't. The
players are the ones that put a lot of time in in the off season. The
returning players, they're hoping that pays off, and that's all you can do.
You can prepare, you train, you take care of business in the classroom, you
put yourself in a position to be successful, and then let's play. The
conversation is great and that's what everybody in this room is involved with,
conversation about our teams, and it's great because the sport couldn't be any
more popular than it is right now. Our league couldn't be any better. I mean,
with the size and the areas that we're going now, all the people that are
going to see us, we'll lead the country again in attendance.  
For us, we know that every night we play in the Big Ten, for example, there's
going to be a great crowd. It's going to be a great venue, the best
competition. So for us, we're going to do what we do, and the players are
going to be finding out more about themselves as we go along, once we start
playing non‑conference and preparing for the Big Ten.  
  
Q. What sort of impact along those lines do you see the expansion having on
the league and on your program from a competitive standpoint and a recruiting
standpoint?  
BO RYAN: Well, it can only help. I started as an assistant in the '70s. We
were able to get some players from the East, Wes Matthews from Bridgeport. The
Gregory brothers from Coolidge High in D.C., Larry Petty from Memorial, Danny
Hastings out of Philly. Well, then the '80s came, and the Big East came in,
and the players from the East were not traveling to the Midwest anywhere near
in the numbers they were before. So when you ask a person like myself that saw
that happen, now you're opening up the East more to the Midwest, and you're
also opening up the Midwest for people who maybe want to go to the shore in
the off season. If we lose some recruits because they want to go to the Jersey
Shore, that's going to hurt. I go to the Jersey Shore every summer. But it's
opened up more recruiting areas for the teams that have been added and for the
teams that have already been in existence in the Big Ten. We've expanded our
horizons, and I think it's great.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Morning, everybody. Certainly feels better being in year two
sitting here than year one, just talking about it, just knowing who we have,
what we've got coming in as well as what we had last year, so certainly very
excited about it. Excited to get rolling.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the newcomers and how they're doing in preseason
practices this year?  
RICHARD PITINO: Yeah, really good. I think the difference between this year
and last year is our newcomers fit the way that we want to play a lot more so
than maybe last year, and I think that will help with our defense. It'll help
with our press, all those little things that we're trying to do when building
kind of the brand that we want to play. Those guys fit that. All of them do.
And they're all guys that if we make a defensive mistake or somebody is in
foul trouble, I'm confident, defensively, that they can really pick up the
slack there. Certainly, they'll go through their lumps like all freshmen do
and all newcomers do, but all of them are different, but I think they'll all
contribute.  
  
Q. Do you feel like with those newcomers coming in being able to play a
little bit faster that you're going to run on teams a little bit more than you
did last season?  
RICHARD PITINO: I thought we ran last year. Obviously, you did not. But yeah,
I think the difference will be the defense more so than the offense. You know,
my first year at FIU we were top ten in the country in steals. We certainly
were not that last year. I think that number will go up, and hopefully we can
create more offense from our defense.  
So yeah, I think we're moving in that direction, definitely.  
  
Q. What can you share from the game plan for the season opener November 14th
in Puerto Rico?  
RICHARD PITINO: Shocking that you'd ask that. You know, it's interesting
because me and my dad talk every day about our teams: How's practice going,
this and that, and neither one of us have kind of, like, backed off the intel,
but I see it coming soon. We start giving so much information, and we flip
that switch a little bit. So that part is definitely different.  
It's hard because I haven't started scouting them. I watch every game.
Normally I go back and see the games they lost, but I don't want to watch them
lose games, so I've got to kind of figure out how we're going to approach that
game. And, certainly, in about a week or two, we'll start doing that, but it's
going to be a fun experience for our guys for sure.  
  
Q. You get (inaudible) and Mo back. How much will that affect how much you
play out of the post this year?  
RICHARD PITINO: You know, you look at Mo as he was getting going towards the
end of the year was really scoring at a very good rate in the low post. We've
got to establish that. We probably got a little bit three‑point happy. I think
we made the most threes in school history. We also took the most threes in
school history, and that's not always a good thing. I think everybody wants to
establish that inside‑out attack, and we've got to do that. We've got two
veteran bigs with Mo and Elliott, whoever starts, I don't know, but we need to
go inside of them early because they're very capable.  
  
Q. Dre Hollings has gutted through an ankle injury the last couple of months
of the year, but he's been a prolific scorer his whole career. What do you
expect from him and how do you think he'll play off Mathieu now that they've
got two years together?  
RICHARD PITINO: Yeah, I think he looks really healthy. Last year he got hurt
in the Wisconsin game, hurt his ankle, and he rushed back. I think he missed
three or four games, I'm not sure of the exact number, and he rushed back
versus Purdue, and we were only going to play him a little bit, and then we go
into triple overtime. His ankle really was hurting, and he showed a lot of
guts to fight through that because he wanted it so bad. Well, now he's
healthy. His ankle feels good. His hip feels good. He looks really good. He's
had a great, great preseason, and I expect him to have a very good year.  
  
Q. How much do you think the NIT title and coming off a game like that can
springboard the team this year, and is that something you feel like guys
talked about in the off season, that they can achieve something special?  
RICHARD PITINO: The NIT, winning the NIT, it's just a weird‑‑ nobody knows how
to handle it. Do you brag about it? Do you talk about it? You know, he didn't
even put it in the notes, the Big Ten guy. I noticed that. That's okay,
though. But, certainly, your goal is to get into the NCAA Tournament every
year. We know that. But when you get in the NIT, it's really difficult, and
you're playing some really good teams with great competition. So our guys are
very proud, especially of those last two games. You play Florida State. Again,
it was a very good team. You beat a very good SMU team. They were certainly
very proud of it. But that's not the goal to be in the NIT, and I think
everybody in the locker room knows that. And it's good in the sense of we know
what kept us out of the NCAA Tournament, and we know what won us the NIT. So
that carryover, I hope is there, because I know those guys are pretty focused
to get in the NCAA Tournament.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
MATT PAINTER: Obviously we're excited about this year. We've had some
struggles the last couple years, and it hasn't been for a lack of talent. We
really had a great situation with guys playing together, having chemistry, and
we haven't had that the last couple years. There's some additions and some
subtractions, I think we have that figure out. Our issue also has been we've
been young and we've stayed young, and most people who do that are going to
have some struggles, so I think it's really important for us to be able to get
old here in time and get some consistency.  
But I really like our team. I like our guys. We have good size in A.J. Hammons
and Isaac Haas. And we were able to add a kid just recently, Jon Octeus that I
think will give us some versatility and some defense, a guy that can play the
point, also play off the basketball, to go along with the guys that we already
have. We have a couple guys that can really shoot the basketball.  
So we have a nice mix of guys. Now we have to get a higher level of
experience, of playing together. I think people always talk about experience
or inexperience, but the ability to have guys stick together and play together
and grow from that is really beneficial in high major college basketball.  
  
Q. Matt, did you feel like you needed to restore the culture that you once
had at Purdue? You talked about having a lot of talent, but it didn't manifest
itself on the court.  
MATT PAINTER: Yeah, no question, and that's nobody's fault except mine. I said
it last year, and I got interviewed late in the season about, you know, it's
not a school district; that's on me. We just have to get more of a Purdue guy.
We feel like we have done that.  
But also I thought last year, especially in conference play, in the last month
and a half of the season, we weren't getting beat by other teams in the Big
Ten, we were beating ourselves. When you go three years ago, you're the No.1
ranked in the country in fewest turnovers and then you're the second worst
team in your league in that area and then you don't make your free throws, you
just keep putting yourself in position to win and then beating yourself. I
think it's going to be important for us to do some of those constants of being
a good half court defensive team, taking care of the basketball. We've made
some strides in rebounding the basketball, and I think if we do those things,
we'll be fine.  
  
Q. You were in this league when you played every other team twice. This year
you're going to play eight teams once. Do you like that? What kind of an
effect do you think it has on the regular season and on the regular season
champion, whether it devalues that accomplishment at all?  
MATT PAINTER: Yeah, I don't think it devalues it, it's just different.
Obviously, it's not consistent, nor is it ever going to be again, because
we're not going to jump up and say we're going to play 26 league games. That's
not going to happen. You're just not going to have your true champ. It doesn't
mean they're not a champion. There's always been‑‑ even before, of when you've
played people also was really important. You can't dictate that through the
schedule. So that is still a variable that's very important because you play
the two best teams and you play them at home versus being on the road, that's
going to help you. But you also play those two teams and you're healthy and
they're not, that's going to help you, also. So there's some other variables
that are going to be consistent that were with the Big Ten when you just had
actual ten teams and you played everybody twice.  
But I don't think it devalues it, but someone is going to have an advantage
and someone is going to have a disadvantage, and there's going to be some
schools that are kind of in the middle of the fray. You just don't know who
those are going to be. You can take some shots at them, but for the people who
are actually making the schedule, they can't control that part of it. But it
isn't your dad's Big Ten anymore. It's different. It doesn't mean it's wrong.  
  
Q. Where are you at in decisionmaking in terms of the team, and then
obviously that ties into the point guard. Where do you see that as of right
now?  
MATT PAINTER: Well, I think we have options, and, obviously, the addition of
Jon Octeus will help with that. He has practiced with us for one day. I've
seen all of his stuff on synergy, and it's a little bit different, but it's
also refreshing because he was a guy that was just kind of out there and
thought he was going to go to a school and didn't get admitted, and now he has
another opportunity, and he's really excited about that.  
But our decisionmaking in terms of who we play, lies in their effort and their
production in practice. We're not going to play guys that are going to turn it
over. Now we have enough guys to where we can‑‑ whether that's Bryson Scott,
PJ Thompson, Jon Octeus at that spot, or a combination of those guys, we have
some other guys with Rapheal Davis and Kendall Stephens and Dakota Mathias
that can play that 2‑3‑2\. So it's very important that we get a good mix,
definitely four of that six, maybe five out of that six‑‑ I think it's tough
to play six people in three spots‑‑ of people that will take care of the
basketball and give us a chance. For us, the ball needs to go inside, and I
think in this league if you can play inside‑out and you can make good
decisions and you have someone that can score on the blocks, it really gives
you an advantage.  
  
Q. Have you changed your recruiting philosophy at all heading into this year
as opposed to the last couple of years? Have you felt it necessary?  
MATT PAINTER: Yeah, it was necessary, and we had obviously‑‑ I wouldn't say
your philosophy, I would just‑‑ even though it pushes towards that a little
bit, of just trying to get a guy that fits at Purdue and fits with me better.
We had a lot of success. Obviously they were talented guys, but that mix of
guys, sure, you would like to have an E'Twaun Moore, JaJuan Johnson, or Robbie
Hummel, but Louis Jackson and Ryan Smith, guys like that, Chris Kramer, Keaton
Grant, those are really good players for us, and those are the guys that you
have to have. You have to have those company guys, and we feel in this
recruiting class that we've brought in, we have more of those guys that I
mentioned to help that. This isn't something where we waited until the end of
last year to where we realized we had an issue. It's something we realized, we
worked on, and obviously made some adjustments.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Tim Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18102)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
TIM MILES: First of all, I want to just start with a little bit of I want to
coach you guys up a little bit. Today is not media day, it's the nightmare for
sports information directors. And second of all, when a coach walks into a
room, we're used to the school song or a standing ovation, and we get none of
that from you, and I want to know when that's going to stop. When are we going
to get it right here? Because we walk in and you guys are just like punching
your keys, drinking your coffee, grumpy that it's morning. Are we going to do
a happy hour deal? Is that what you want? Are you that difficult to deal with?  
I mean, coaches are ready, and we all know that most people are going to ask
us questions about their own teams, so you can put, well, Miles said this
about Indiana. I would just like to field questions about Nebraska.  
  
Q. Following your orders, Tim, you were picked last the first two years in
this league. This year you're picked fourth. Do you have any reaction to
that?  
TIM MILES: Well, yeah. You guys haven't got it right yet. You know, an old
coaching friend told me one time, never trust the media unless it helps you
with recruiting, so I kind of stick by that.  
  
Q. How old a coach was that?  
TIM MILES: Well, that was Jim Molinari, my assistant. He told me yesterday.
(Laughter).  
  
Q. You guys have had a lot of success, especially last year. How do you
continue to move in the right direction as this season approaches?  
TIM MILES: Well, probably just throw the ball to Petteway and Shields and
stand there and say nothing. I mean, we weren't any good until we defended.
Once we started playing very solid defense and became a good defensive
rebounding team, we became a good team but not until. We were still pretty off
on offense and as practice has progressed, I think we've continued that
direction. If you want to come Lincoln and see missed shots and stuff like
that, we're right there, baby. You can go over to gate 25 afterwards and get
something to eat.  
But it's just one of those things that‑‑ defense has got to be our calling
card.  
  
Q. I'm sure you've been asked this in a lot of different ways, but do you
approach the season any differently with your players when maybe there is a
level of expectation from last year that now you're going to try and replicate
or pass? Do you talk to them any differently about this season?  
TIM MILES: Well, am I meaner to them you mean? I think it's important that the
guys understand that your college experience only happens once. Take every
day, live in every moment, embrace it, and try and get better every day.
That's kind of how we try and stay in the moment all the time. Expectations
are what they are, but nobody should have higher expectations for us than
ourselves. The one thing I'll tell you about this group is I think they
remember blowing an 18 point lead to Ohio State in the Big Ten Tournament.
They lost their mojo, did not practice the next week going into the NCAA
Tournament, did not play well against Baylor, at least for the portion that I
was there, and then‑‑ don't ask me about that. I'll get fined.  
Where was I?  
But I think they remember the way the season ended rather than that big run
that put them in a very good position. Because, honestly, we were 11 out of 13
or something like that, and that's a championship‑style run, which is pretty
cool. But that's not what we remember, and that's not what they remember. They
put in the work like they're still picked dead last.  
  
Q. Looking back at last season, the success you had at home, is there any
one thing you can attribute that to?  
TIM MILES: Well, our venue is unbelievable. It's a state‑of‑the‑art place. It
carries noise really well. It's not built for hockey, it's built for
basketball, so you don't have the slow grade going out and then your level 200
and 300 people 50 yards back. Everybody is right on it. It's really like an
old‑time coliseum that way, and our fans bought in. They believed in‑‑ first
of all, they wanted to see the new building, and we sold it out. I bought
3,000 tickets, as you well know. We made sure that we had a fan base that was
strong. Nebraska fans are so supportive that they made it a difficult place to
play.  
We practiced there for the first time the other day, and we shot the ball
better than we'd shot all year. I think the guys truly believe it's just
somewhere special to play.  
  
Q. Last year's schedule was a little odd for a relative newcomer in Nebraska
where you only played Iowa and Minnesota once. Going forward, you're going to
have eight single plays and five double plays. Do you feel like Nebraska has
the opportunity to develop rivalries or are they going to have to be instead
of border, they're going to be organic?  
TIM MILES: If I say enough dumb stuff, we'll have rivalries, so I think it
really depends on that. I wish we'd play our border schools more. Last year we
played Iowa the first game of the year, and then I honestly don't know that I
watched them again. And if I recall right, I think they were on the other side
of the bracket in the Big Ten Tournament, so I don't even think I watched much
there, either. I didn't even see Franny's team play very much after they beat
us.  
We don't like that, but I believe that that's not going to change. I believe
that the way the ACC and the Big Ten are doing it is probably going to stay
that way. I don't believe you'll see us like in football playing east and west
or northwest and southeast or whatever the heck. That's just the way it is.
Hopefully, as often as possible we get those border schools, but as far as
rivalries, yeah, because we're a newcomer it's hard to say who our rival is.
And I'm new to the league, too, but, certainly, when you look at recruiting
and you look at where you go, where you get your kids from, you want to be
able to play those people as often and possible and beat them.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I think what you just said kind of summarizes our outlook.
Seven upperclassmen, all of whom got major minutes last year, ten returning
lettermen. I feel really good about the options that we have. I thought one of
the strengths of our team last year was our depth. I feel the same about this
year's team. That's why I think right now we're optimistic.  
  
Q. How is your son doing?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Thank you. He's doing very well. It's obviously been an
interesting journey, difficult at times. The outpouring of support has been
absolutely phenomenal. I would say getting closer to being back to as normal
as he can possibly be in light of what he went through. But I think in
situations like this, we were very fortunate when we found it. I think that's
the critical thing no matter what age you are. So we feel blessed. His
treatment is going well, and we're looking forward. Thank you.  
  
Q. What are your expectations out of Woodbury this season?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Well, I think with Adam, he's in I would say the best shape of
his life physically, and I think that's really going to help him. He's strong
but lean and fit. His intensity level in practice has been incredibly
impressive in terms of competing on every possession, and I think that's one
of his great qualities. He's been one of the best low post defenders in our
league, and he's been an excellent rebounder, outlet passer. We've utilized
him on offense as a passer. He's been tremendous.  
I think you're going to see him score the ball a little bit more. He's much
more comfortable. He's worked on a variety of things, whether it be post moves
or face‑up jump shots. I think you're going to see him be more aggressive in
that area. We're going to go to him a little bit more.  
But I think when you see a guy go from his sophomore to junior year, I think
we all expect him to take another step, and I think he expects it from
himself.  
  
Q. During your career, I wonder if you have had teams that have had a lot of
seniors and a lot of freshmen and not a lot in between. What are the dynamics
of getting a roster such as that to blend and mold and have success?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Well, I think the first key is if you have seniors, how are
they mentoring those freshmen? If you have freshmen, what are their
expectations of themselves? Are they trying to fit in? Are they fully
expecting to compete for minutes and sort of have that expectation for
themselves?  
What you want to see is a healthy competition. The young guys going after the
old guys, the old guys respecting that and helping, ultimately, the team
become the best it can possibly be, so that at some point during the season,
you don't have inexperience. You have kind of one team that plays the right
way.  
  
Q. You had Gabe Olaseni play a little bit at the 4 or 1 and 2. How is his
development coming along at that position in practice, and do you expect him
to continue to play that as you get into the season?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: You know, I think he's going to have to. When you look at who
we have, obviously you've got Adam Woodbury, Jarrod Uthoff, Aaron White, Gabe
Olaseni. That's your four top post players, but then also Jarrod and Aaron
will play the 3, as well. So Aaron White is going to play a lot. Gabe Olaseni
is going to play a lot, but will they play together a lot? We'll see.  
He's really good running the 5 man, but his jump shot has improved I think to
the point where if you play him facing the basket on the baseline at the
free‑throw line and you throw him the ball and you don't respect him, he can
make that shot. He's a much better passer than he was saying when he was a
freshman, so you have Woodbury and Olaseni in there together, they're both
capable passers, willing passers, and they can both run.  
I think a lot of times when you have a running team, you're hesitant to go
with the twin towers because they slow you down. I don't think by playing
those two guys together we'll be slowed down. You know, don't be surprised if
you see that, and I think another factor will be how does Dominic Uhl develop
and figure into that mix. So the quicker he becomes accustomed to what we're
doing and the more he plays, maybe the less opportunity that they would play
together, and if not, then they would play more.  
  
Q. Last season Devyn Marble shot 191 more times than his next closest
teammate. How are you going to replace his leadership and talent but also the
sheer volume of shots that he took?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Well, the leadership and talent, obviously it shifts to Aaron
White. It's Aaron White's team. But again, he's got two other seniors and four
juniors all of whom played a lot, and they're all good people and they're all
good players.  
The other part of it I think is harder to replace because we relied on him so
much, not only in terms of those shots you talked about but also as a point
guard at times, we posted him up, we used him in a lot of ways. Somebody else
is going to have to step up and score those points and take those shots. We
have a number of candidates, Josh Oglesby and Peter Jok in particular at that
position, but I think you'll see a different Mike Gesell and I think you're
going to see a completely different Jarrod Uthoff in particular. All of those
guys are gifted offensive players, and I think that's where it'll come from.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THAD MATTA: I'm a little bit upset that we only get eight minutes for this.
They cut it back this year so I'll try to talk quick.  
I think from the standpoint of a lot of questions about our basketball team,
from the standpoint of losing three starters, I've told people we're going to
be a different team. We'll play a little bit different, but I've been very
pleased with one week down now in the season with the direction we're heading.  
  
Q. Obviously, the Big Ten has been a strong league for a number of years but
hasn't wan a national championship since 2000. How do you think that has
affected perceptions of the conference?  
THAD MATTA: Well, I haven't really thought about that. I think from the
standpoint of ‑‑ you look at the teams that have won national championships, I
think from the year 2000, we've had‑‑ the Big Ten has had some great, great
basketball teams. I've always said this, kind of how my luck goes. I get a
great team in '07 and we're playing a team that brought everybody back that
had won it the year before, which doesn't happen anymore.  
I don't think that you can judge the conference per se by that we haven't won.
I think you look at the overall success that we've had just in the time that
I've been in here, since '04 or '05, whatever it is, I'm very pleased with
where Big Ten basketball is, and yeah, I'd love to see one of us win one,
that's for sure.  
  
Q. What are real expectations in your mind for D'Angelo this year? I know
there might be a lot of expectations for how he can help carry your offense?  
THAD MATTA: Yeah, I think with D'Angelo, all I can say right now is I'm very
pleased with how he's playing in practice, the strides he's making. He's doing
a great job of kind of taking the court over every time he steps on the court.
How does that factor into once we start playing games, the lights are on? He's
played in some huge basketball games throughout his high school career, AAU
career. And he's come up ‑‑ two high school national championships with
Montverde is impressive. He's going to have some ups and downs, but I like his
demeanor. I like the things that he can do on the court, and we've got to keep
coaching him and keep him as healthy as we can.  
  
Q. With the addition of Anthony Lee, in addition to Amir and Trey McDonald,
what's that dynamic been like? Are you going more two bigs on the floor?  
THAD MATTA: Yeah, we're still playing with that. I think that's one way we can
go. We can go with some skilled 4s. I've got four or five guys that can play
that position, which is what I like about this team. I think with the addition
of Anthony and David Bell and even Trevor Thompson, who ‑‑ Trevor can't play
this year‑‑ the competitive nature in practice has been probably something we
haven't had in a while, and Anthony definitely factors into that in terms of
what he's bringing to the table. Those guys now know if they don't come to
play, they'll get embarrassed in practice.

### [Eddie Jordan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16808)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
EDDIE JORDAN: First of all, we're honored to be invited into the conference.
We know where we are as far as the 14‑team league, and again, it's going to be
a great challenge for us, and we just hope that we can be competitive and
represent our school, our University, and our community in a respectful way.  
  
Q. You've coached some teams in the NBA that have had high expectations, and
now coaching a college basketball team that's had some struggles recently, can
you talk about the differences and similarities of coaching teams that are at
opposite ends of the spectrum?  
EDDIE JORDAN: First of all, it's running the entire program. There's a lot
more responsibility on the head coach, and we all know, and yet at the same
time you are teaching fundamentals on every level, and for us, it's a process
for us. We know where we're coming from. We thought even last year, we thought
the process was successful, the first stage of it. We were picked last for our
conference. We were seventh. People thought we would win eight or nine games.
We won 12.  
So we felt our kids competed with first‑class, and that was the first part of
the process, and that was successful. Doesn't matter what the record said at
that point. We understand we're going to a tougher league, and the second part
of the process is to get better players, which we think we did, to be
competitive, and to meet the opponent eye to eye and to play with harmony and
effort.  
That's the second part of the process, and we think we're doing okay with that
part.  
  
Q. Do you feel like most of your fans and just people in New Jersey in
general realize that you've moved leagues?  
EDDIE JORDAN: You know, all summer it's been talked about, been read about,
and just like our football program, I don't think it resonates until we
actually see Rutgers against Michigan, against Penn State, against Indiana. I
think that's when it really resonates. But again, our football team has done a
great job. The Penn State‑Rutgers game had a great viewership, and the energy
and the anticipation is there on our campus and our community, but for the
larger community, recruiting base, I don't think it will resonate until we
actually get on the floor and see the opponent eye to eye and people can see
that.  
  
Q. Being in your third conference in three seasons, has it been a challenge
to study opponents or developing an identity as a program?  
EDDIE JORDAN: Well, after 20‑some‑odd years in the NBA and coming to Rutgers
last spring, two springs ago, I saw our kids in the spring workouts, I saw our
kids in the summer workouts, I saw our kids in the preseason practices, and I
kept saying, I just need to see the opponent, and I need to see what we're
going against. I'm used to NBA teams, and you're right, I understood what the
league and the culture was about. Coming into our non‑conference schedule, I
said, we need to get better. We need to get better shooters, even
non‑conference teams had their system down and had been running their system
for years, and we were new. We were under a new system, under a new coach, and
same this year. I've seen our kids, we have a new group of players, we're
young, and I'm anxious to see‑‑ obviously we have a non‑conference schedule in
front of us, but I'm anxious to see our Big Ten opponents eye to eye, and I
know it's going to be a great challenge, but that's why you're in this
business.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
TOM IZZO: Yeah, those nine lettermen unfortunately a couple of them weren't on
scholarship. I kind of like this team. I think it's a team with the same kind
of passion we had last year, the same kind of camaraderie, but a little better
leadership. Last year just wasn't‑‑ it wasn't a strength of our team. It
wasn't necessarily a weakness, but we had‑‑ we didn't have quite the
leadership that I think we have with Travis Trice and Denzel Valentine. So
with Trice and Valentine, there's no question, thee big losses were Appling,
Harrison and Adrian Payne, but in Appling's case he had a tough second half of
the year and Trice was playing pretty well so he got a lot of experience. And
because Payne went down for eight or nine games, Costello got some experience,
but our big three will be those three with Dawson being a big key this year.
Does he take another step up, does he average the 15, 16 points, eight, nine
rebounds that he did the last six, seven games of the season once he got back?
If he does that, I think this team could progress greatly here in the months
to come.  
  
Q. Tom, you've been to Final Fours consecutive years multiple times. I'm
just curious when you try to go back that second time in a row, what are the
positives you can use in your favor, and what are the obstacles and challenges
you might face to keep kids on track to get back there?  
TOM IZZO: Well, you know, the positives are you have something to point to.
They know how much fun it was. It's an experience of a lifetime. It's hard to
explain to anybody what it's like to win that Elite 8 game and know you're
going‑‑ like for us, going to Detroit or something, and then to be able to
come back the next year as we did when we went to Indy that next year, it was
a goal because it was a realistic goal.  
I think the negatives are, that was right about the pre‑Twitter era, and I
think it's harder now because so many people are telling them how good they
are. But I think Bo can handle that. He's been there, done that. He's done it
at different levels. I think he's got some grounded kids, and I think that's a
big key, too.  
Back when we went to three of them in a row in 2000, we just had driven guys
that had nothing but winning championships on their mind. I'm not sure anybody
has that anymore, just a little more difficult in this more "me world" than
"we world," but I think that'll be his biggest challenge. Can his kids handle
the things that will be said about them around them.  
  
Q. Media poll, all the preseason magazines, everybody is picking Wisconsin.
Do you see them clearly separate from the rest of the league, and after that
it seems to be a real muddle for the next eight to ten teams. Is that also how
you see it?  
TOM IZZO: Well, first of all, I saw us picked anywhere from second to eighth
or ninth, and our fans kind of rumbled about that. I told them, God, that's
probably where I would have picked us. I think that's where I'd pick a lot of
teams. There's no question that Wisconsin is the class, but Wisconsin gets
picked second or third when he's got nobody back, so I think that tells you a
lot about Bo and what he's done. But he does have a very, very good team and a
lot of guys back and stability, and he's got guards and he's got bigs, so he's
got a little bit of everything. He's got a great wing, a great point guard and
a great center. And when you have that, a lot of good things can happen as did
for us last year.  
But as far as the rest of the league, I think what you're starting to see
again is, yeah, we all lost some pretty talented guys or a lot of us did, but
all of a sudden Minnesota wins the NIT, you look at the job Northwestern, that
he's done there. You've got some perennials that have been down last year,
like Indiana and Purdue, and both those guys are great coaches and I think
they're going to have much better teams.  
So it's the bottom‑‑ Nebraska, they've come out of nowhere, and Tim has done
such a good job there, and now they're going to be contenders. So I think the
bottom again has moved up. The top other than Wisconsin has maybe moved back a
little bit, but I think there's an eight, nine, ten‑team race, and with who
you play once and where you play them, muddled up is a good word. I've got a
couple other words that mean the same thing. Not as many letters, but I think
you spoke well about what you're saying.  
  
Q. Obviously, this has been a strong league for a number of years, but your
program is the last Big Ten team to win a national championship. How do you
think that drought has affected perceptions of the league overall?  
TOM IZZO: Well, you know, I do think it affects it somewhat. It's not kind of
like what's happened in football with the SEC. It's not to that extent. But I
just know that to win one you've got to be so good and so lucky, both, and
what I've enjoyed about our league is we've sent a lot of people to that Final
Four, and we've been in the mix. When you're in the mix, sometimes it's a
call, sometimes it's an injury, sometimes another team just plays better that
day.  
But I think I'm proud of the fact that even though we haven't won another one,
we have had a lot of teams either in that Final Four or those Elite 8 games,
and that really speaks a lot about the quality of your conference and the
number of teams we're getting in. The team that doesn't quite get in that
maybe should have last year, goes and wins the NIT. That talks about the
strength of your conference. Does it hurt it? I don't know if anybody looks at
winning national championships that hurt it as much as who's going to the NBA.  
  
Q. You've been in the league since there were, I think, 10 teams and you
played each other twice every year, and now with eight one ‑plays this year,
you mentioned a lot depends on who you play once, who you play twice. In your
mind has it devalued the regular season?   
TOM IZZO: I don't know if devalued is the correct word. It's complicated. It's
confused it a little bit. You know, I still think the value of who we're
playing and where we're playing‑‑ unlike the ACC and the Big East for so many
years, our fans aren't used to the conference tournaments maybe becoming
bigger just because‑‑ even it's happened in football now, when you don't play
everybody‑‑ I mean, one or two games on who you play or don't play can make a
two or three‑game difference in the standings. I don't think we want to
educate our fans on that. We still want to try to win championships, but
that's what's a little harder for the coaches, I think, is the concept that
there's a reality to it that if you don't play everybody and you get one of
those breaks with the top four teams you play once and the bottom four teams
you play twice, there's going to be a big difference in your win‑loss record
probably, especially in basketball where home and away seems to have such an
impact. I mean, football it does, but basketball it's off the charts.  
  
Q. With the conference growing and with the level of play just getting
better across the board, how does that change the way you approach
recruiting?  
TOM IZZO: Well, you know, recruiting, we're all trying to get better players,
and you know, when you have the national impact that now we are beginning to
have, I think in our meetings last night, you find out what kind of TV numbers
there were just in football out east, and it's going to bring us more
nationwide. But at the same time, recruiting has always been important, it
always will be important. I think what's harder now is to figure out what is a
five‑star, four‑star, three‑star. If I'm not mistaken, there's a football team
from Mississippi that everybody claims is filled with two and three‑star
recruits.  
It's about getting the right players and the right chemistry and putting them
together that I think is the most important thing, and yet we have a bigger
base now to recruit out of because we're going to be more well known in the
East Coast and throughout the Midwest, ,and with Nebraska pushing down a
little bit there into the south Midwest, I think.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [John Groce](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20727)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
JOHN GROCE: Thanks for having us. Obviously we're very excited about our team,
especially the way we finished at the end of the year. You mentioned that we
have four starters returning. We had two transfers sitting out that have made
a real difference on our team. It's very noticeable in practice. Both guys
give us some more offensive fire power and punch and scoring. I love our
experience with 11 out of 15 players having been in our program for at least a
year, so we've got some continuity there and some maturity. We're much further
along at this point and this juncture than we would normally be because of
that experience.  
Right now, our focus is just on continuing to get better, and I think we've
done that so far. We started on October 3rd until now, so we're anxious to get
back together again tomorrow and practice again. We've not had a bad practice.
I think that speaks volumes of our leadership. Egwu as our captain at this
point has been tremendous, and we're going to rely a lot on his leadership, as
well as his productivity at both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. You just mentioned Egwu. What are your expectations for him to take the
next step this year?  
JOHN GROCE: Well, I think the first thing is I think he understands‑‑ and
obviously we'll have our vote for captains to see if anyone joins him here as
we head into year three‑‑ but he understands that he's got a great
responsibility. To whom much is given, much is expected, and I'm not talking
about necessarily from a production standpoint, I'm talking about from a
leadership standpoint, and he has been tremendous in that regard, teaching
Leron Black and Michael Finke and helping the transfers that are playing now
get acclimated. I really think he wants to give it everything he has. He's one
of those kids that only knows one way. His motor runs all day, and he's a real
pleasure to coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the point guard situation? What are the
plans for the season?  
JOHN GROCE: Well, obviously we don't want to lose Tracy. For us we're going to
be fine. We've got Ahmad Starks who's been terrific on the offensive end. He
packs a big‑time punch. Yesterday we scrimmaged and he probably had his best
practice of his career at Illinois. We've got some fire power there. Tate has
really improved. Tate has some innate leadership qualities and brings some
vocal leadership to our team that I like.  
My concern is more with Trace. I love Trace, and he's such a competitor.
Obviously, he prepared to do this really, really well, made a lot of
sacrifices, and I thought had really grown and matured a great deal, and so
here you are as a senior ready to tackle that with his partner in crime, so to
speak, Egwu, and now that opportunity gets taken away from him. But I think he
understands things happen for a reason, and his attitude has been tremendous
and his rehab work. Surgery will be this coming week, and we're looking
forward to getting back an even better version of Tracy Abrams.  
  
Q. Can you just speak to Wayne McClain? I know he was an assistant under
you, but what you've known about him in this program?  
JOHN GROCE: Well, unfortunately I didn't get a chance to know him real well,
but the one thing I do know is I know a lot of the players, coaches, and a lot
of people that have been impacted by him. I think last night when I sent the
tweet out, I meant every word of it, from the standpoint of obviously he's had
legendary coaching success, state championships, assistant coach on a team
that went to the national championship game. But to me I think the response of
Nnanna and Tracy who have played for him showed me a lot as well as people in
our office and people in the community there on campus and how they felt about
him. You could tell he impacted a great number of people, and I think
obviously that will be as much or more of his legacy than all the wins that he
had as a basketball coach.  
  
Q. I just wanted to get your opinion on the new schedule format for the
conference season, five double plays, eight single plays.  
JOHN GROCE: Well, I think the scheduling component, obviously, our Big Ten
office works very hard, very diligently to put that all together and put
together something that makes sense. I think with where we are right now and
adding obviously Rutgers and Maryland as members 13 and 14, yeah, I think it
makes sense how they did it. Obviously in a perfect world, I think everyone
would love a round‑robin where you play everybody home and away, but at this
juncture, I think it's wise. I've got no problem with the schedule and the way
that it's done in the climate of college basketball right now for us to play
18 games. Most of them are wars, night in and night out, and the way that they
put it together makes total sense to me.  
  
Q. Is the NCAA Tournament a part of what you're discussing with your players
at this stage?  
JOHN GROCE: It always is. You know, we're at Illinois. People ask me that
often. For us we don't shy away certainly from that expectation. At the same
time we control the process. At the end of the day, the outcomes are‑‑
sometimes you can't control all those, but we can control our attitude. We can
control our effort. We can control our actions to be great teammates every
day. We can control executing details, being more disciplined, all the things
that make up a good basketball team.  
That's what we're trying to control right now. But we don't shy away from
that. Of course, if you asked all of our players right now, they would love
the opportunity to be in the NCAA Tournament. I think they understand that
being in that tournament is a privilege. It's not an easy thing to do, but
they love challenges. We love challenges, and we attack those things
fearlessly, and I'm sure that this team will do the same.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
TOM CREAN: First of all, the State of Illinois and the history of the Big Ten
lost a really, really good one yesterday with Wayne McClain's passing. I
didn't know Wayne as well as most, but had great respect for what he did as a
coach certainly in high school and then what he brought to the Illini and the
Illini Nation and was a big part of the history of this state in many ways.
Indiana basketball sends condolences to his family and friends and anybody
that worked or played for him.  
As far as us, we're trying to get ourselves to a point right now where we can
look at every day and know that we are tenacious, that we are on the attack,
and that we are fundamentally driven, and that's the goal. It's been the goal
since the season ended when we started spring workouts the week after our
season, and it has been the goal with every new player that's come in. We're
at 60 percent of a new team right now, but getting the team to understand
every day the compete level that they have to have, the togetherness that they
have to have, the ability to move the ball, to move their bodies, to
understand the value of defense. If you're going to be any good in this
league, you have to defend and rebound. Last year we ended up being sixth in
the country in rebound margin, and we lost a pretty good rebounder in Noah
Vonleh, so that's one of the things we have to get established that we can
rebound the ball, and if you're going to be good in this league you've got to
be able to get back in defense and stop the transition because there's so many
great fast break teams in this league. You've got to be able to control the
dribble, and because of the passing in this league, you've got to be able to
control the dribbler without a lot of help because this league will pick you
apart when you're over help over rotation system. You've got defending the
three, and you've got to be able to rebound. So those are big, big aspects for
us moving forward.  
Love our attitude. The Montreal trip for us this summer where we got the ten
extra days of practice and a chance to go over there any play five games which
were all extremely competitive was very, very good for us and helped our team
in many ways. I love the way that they're working. I love their energy. And
this year right now we're much more focused on our fundamentals and the
details of the game and the spacing rather than trying to get guys to
understand how hard they have to go, how competitive they have to be. So
that's a sign of maturity right there for our team.  
Individually, I won't take all the time up here to talk about those guys. Like
I said, we're excited about the new guys and the fact that Yogi Ferrell is
back with us for his third year and has had the success that he has had in
this league. On being the point guard on a team that was number one in the
country for 10 or 11 weeks as a freshman to the things that we had to have him
do last year. We probably had to have him do more last year than what would
have been in a perfect world, but he was capable. And now I think we've put
more people around that will get the floor spaced, will be able to allow him
to play more to the style that he is so good at being able to play, which is
not only to score the ball but to move the ball, and along with that, we're
excited.  
I'll just mention two other older guys. We're excited about the addition of
Nick Zeisloft who's from the city of Chicago but from Illinois State
University. He brings a wealth of experience to us, but he brings a tremendous
competitiveness and that tenaciousness that we talk about and the energy that
we need, not to mention a high skill level, especially shooting the ball. And
we're hoping for the emergence of Hanner Perea. People ask what's different
with him when they see us back home, and his body continues to change. He
continues to get bigger and stronger, but he's playing with a poise, and he's
playing with a consistency.  
Now, it's early. It's two weeks in, but that's a start. With that, we're
excited about the direction of the team and the way that they're working.  
  
Q. Getting back to Hanner, what have you seen from him so far and what are
your expectations for him this year?  
TOM CREAN: Well, consistency, that's the word. Consistent in everything,
consistent off the court, consistent on, consistent with his effort and energy
level. Because if there's one thing that's held him back in the past, it's not
being able to play long stretches consistently, and certainly Noah Vonleh took
a lot of minutes last year and rightfully so because of the production that he
had. But we need Hanner to be a real disrupter and force defensively with the
ability not only to block shots but to cover ground. Our goal is to get him to
a place where he can guard everybody on the court, not only on the post,
whether it's a switch‑out, whether it's if he gets isolated, being able to use
his length, his quickness, his athleticism to use that, and he's got to be
able to score for us in transition, score on offensive rebounds, but also be
able to score in the post.  
And we're going to have to find a lot of different ways to score in the paint.
I think we scored 25 percent of our points in the paint last year, and we
don't want to give that up because that's where so many of your free throws
come, and he's got to be able to get fouled for us.  
But he just really needs to continue to build on the consistency that he has
and the poise that he's playing with because he's really slowed himself down
in the post. In the past he's struggled playing in any type of traffic, and I
think because of the spacing we're going to hopefully be able to have this
year that's going to help him with that, but at the same time he just doesn't
need to get ahead of himself and be in a rush when he gets the ball and
continue to play on that poise level.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on James Blackmon, what you're seeing from him early and
what you need to get from him?  
TOM CREAN: Well, he's come in with a beyond serious work ethic. Robert
Johnson, Jr., and James Blackmon, for as highly ranked and they were and
certainly being from Indiana and being a McDonald's All‑American, sometimes
those can go another way. And the fortunate thing we've had is we've never had
a McDonald's All‑American before we got to Indiana, but they have the same
basic thread that other greats we've coached and other greats we've heard
about have when it comes to the work ethic.  
He's a never‑day‑off guy, he is constantly working on his game. He's very,
very easy to coach because he knows he needs to get better. He knows he's
good, but he knows he needs to get better, and he takes it. He's extremely
humble in the sense of where he needs to improve. What I love about him is he
knows he needs every aspect of it. A year ago this time, he might have been
able to do 185 pounds back home maybe once, maybe, when he got to Indiana in
early June he did it seven times. Two and a half weeks ago, he did it 13
times. So that's a guy that's serious not only about the basketball part of
it, he's serious that everything he's going to need to be really successful at
this for a long time. He's been a tremendous student early on in the summer
and is really learning the leadership that he's capable of and the best
leadership he can bring right now is just that consistent level of toughness
and determination in practice and competing when he gets a little winded, and
I think he's going to be really, really fun to coach. He certainly has been to
this point.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Chris Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26016)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
CHRIS COLLINS: I didn't realize I was following Coach Miles, so I won't even
try to be funny. The comedian of the conference. Obviously, it's exciting to
be back here. It's that time of year again. We're excited to get going with
our season. For us it's almost like a whole new team. Of the 12 guys we have
on our team, six of them are newcomers, so it's literally a fresh start.  
That being said, I've been really pleased with the development and leadership
of our returning guys, and although a lot has been talked about our incoming
freshmen class, I think still, when you play in a conference such as the Big
Ten, the most important guys are those guys that have been through it and have
played and can show the way for young players.  
I've been really pleased with what the returning guys have done in the summer
and fall that we've had. There's a good vibe. The guys have good chemistry,
which any time you have that many new players as a coach, you always worry
about how the pieces are going to fit together. The guys are coming together,
their practices have been spirited, and I think with anything, we're just
excited to kind of get out there and get going. It's going to be important for
us to get off to a good start to the season.  
I've talked about it a lot in the off season. For us we didn't play as well
last year in November and December, and we didn't kind of figure out who we
had and what we were until the conference started, and then I felt we became a
pretty good team. We played very hard. We were a great defensive team, and I
thought we were very competitive night in and night out in our league.  
It's going to be important for us to get off to a good start and hopefully see
for our young guys‑‑ get some wins early, so when you get into the conference
you can come in with some confidence.  
  
Q. You talked about the makeup of your roster. Ohio State is in a similar
situation this year with a lot of seniors and a lot of freshmen. I don't know
if you went through this at Duke at all, but is it a different dynamic to
coaching a team like that and trying to get it to blend?  
CHRIS COLLINS: Well, I think it is. I think, first of all, for me it was
important because I'm going into my second year, and now these were ‑‑ all the
guys who were in the program were guys that were in the program before I got
there. And now we're bringing in a big group of guys that were part of our
first recruiting class. I think it was important for me when those guys got on
campus, I wanted our older guys to really show the way and be at the forefront
of showing these young guys the way we do things. I think that was important
for them to spend time, not only in the workouts and on the floor, but to
spend time off the court because no matter what, if you want to become a good
team, there has to be that chemistry. There has to be that camaraderie.  
I think we have a good mix, though. I think the leadership of our team,
especially the two guys, Tre Demps, JerShon Cobb, two guys that have been good
players, had really good years for us last year, they've really stepped up. We
lost a lot with Drew Crawford. Drew was kind of our Mr.Everything, not only
what he brought on the floor, but his leadership and what he did off the
floor.  
The veterans, I've challenged them to kind of take control of the team in the
off season and set the environment and show these young guys what it takes to
play at this level. That's what I was proud of is ‑‑ kind of that's what last
year was about for us was creating that culture, creating that environment of
the way our program was going to be and how we dealt with things on a
day‑to‑day basis, and our veterans have done a great job with the young guys
and helping to bring them along.  
  
Q. You mentioned Crawford. He was obviously such an important piece of this
program, having led the conference in minutes last year. From an Xs and Os
standpoint, how do you begin to try and replace his production, namely his
ability to get into the paint?  
CHRIS COLLINS: Yeah, I don't think any one guy can do that. I don't want to
put that on any one player. I think as a whole, I think we have more fire
power offensively, not just with some of the young guys we brought in, but
also the development in some of our returning guys. I felt last year we were
pretty predictable in terms of what we were going to play through Drew, and we
had Demps and Cobb, and those were kind of the three guys. And if teams were
able to take one or two of those guys out, we would really have a hard time
scoring.  
I'm looking forward to seeing how our offense can evolve. That was certainly
our struggle last year. We were a really good defensive team, we played hard,
we battled, we gave ourselves a chance to win, but when we ran into problems,
it was when we had long droughts where we couldn't score. Certainly you take
Drew's production out of there, we need some guys to step up, and I think it's
going to have to be a collective effort. But what I've seen so far is we have
some more players and more depth and more athletes that can make some plays
and hopefully help in that regard.  
  
Q. What are your expectations for Vic Law here in his first year?  
CHRIS COLLINS: Well, Vic is going to have a big role on our team. We're going
to expect him to play a lot early and to be a big part. Although I don't want
him to feel the weight of the world on his shoulders that he has to be a
savior because that's not the case. He's a tremendous player. He's very
athletic. He can make a lot of plays, and he's long and is good on both ends.
What I want for him is to go into it and not feel pressure, but he's going to
be in a position right away to go out there and play but also learn. There's
not a freshman in a America that doesn't have a transition from high school to
college, and I think it's going to be important for us that he adjusts to the
college game and learns how he can be successful. And then, hopefully, as the
year goes on, he can be more and more productive because certainly we need him
to be an impact guy for us from day one.  
  
Q. Have you specifically addressed the pressure this group of freshmen may
feel, the expectation?  
CHRIS COLLINS: Yeah, I don't want them‑‑ obviously, it's a talented group.
There's been a lot talked about them coming in, and I'm excited about the
freshman group. I think they're all going to be really good players for us in
their careers. But I think a lot, and not just us, but I think we're kind of
in a day and age right now where there's too much too soon on a lot of these
freshmen. For me, I really want to rely‑‑ I've got four starters coming back
that have played a lot, that did a lot of good things last year, and I want
those guys to kind of be at the forefront where we can bring these young guys
along and not have them feel that they have to be the ones to, like I said, be
a savior or take our program right away to new heights.  
I want them to be part of the equation. They're all good guys. They all want
to win. They all want to be a part of the group, and they've done a really
good job adjusting so far in the early season.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: Well, it is good to be here and get the season going again.
We've been practicing for a little bit, but October 15th, yesterday, was the
first day we really opened up camp and said we're in it now. This is the time
of the year to get the media and all our obligations out of the way so we can
really concentrate over these next four weeks to get ready for our first game.  
  
Q. Caris LaVert named first ‑team, how do you think he'll handle the
spotlight this season?  
JOHN BEILEIN: Well, you never know. He was in it a bit last year. I mean,
there were several games where we just went to him because people were doing
things with Nick or with Glenn, Jordan Morgan, Mitch, so we just went with
him. He's sort of used to it. I love his personality because he doesn't let
things bother him very much, so I don't think he gets too excited or he gets
too worried about either situation.  
  
Q. John, what are some of the challenges a coach faces trying to get back to
the Final Four a second consecutive year? You know what that was like last
year, obstacles, expectations?  
JOHN BEILEIN: Well, yeah, it is. It's obviously difficult to get there. At the
same time, once you've been there one time, and I assume you're talking about
Wisconsin, I'm as hungry or probably hungrier than ever to get back there. So
I think it's great motivation for everybody because they've experienced that
run. It's maybe not getting there, it's the way you get there and how you get
there and those moments in between, the journey. It makes it so valuable.  
So yes, it's hard. You'd like to stay injury‑free, and you also have to‑‑
you're going to have‑‑ I don't care who you are, it's very normal to have
times during that year where you're not going to play well. You won't look
like a Final Four team, and that's exactly what you may need in February or
late January or even in March.  
  
Q. I wondered during your career if you've had teams where you've had a lot
of seniors and a lot of freshmen and not a lot in between, and how do you
coach ‑‑ what are the dynamics of that kind of team and how do you try to
coach it?   
JOHN BEILEIN: Just a few times. Unfortunately, the seniors‑‑ we haven't had
many seniors. We've had one or two each year. But I do remember one year we
had a team with five seniors on it that had a great year with young players,
but they were tremendous leaders, and they wanted to‑‑ they just wanted to
win. They'd given up a lot of personal goals to just win. That was a lot of
fun to coach them. It was at Richmond, my first year at Richmond, and I
believe the same thing in my fourth year at West Virginia, we had five seniors
then, as well, and they had experienced a little success and they wanted more
of it. They had a tremendous year. But I think, once again, going back to the
last question, they'd been part of a journey there, and they really wanted to
finish it the best they could.  
  
Q. You have a lot of freshmen on this roster. With the Italy trip in the
preseason, how much did that help kind of get this group together heading into
‑‑ you said yesterday really getting started with camp?  
JOHN BEILEIN: To have these foreign trips is such a great experience for these
young men, not just basketball‑wise, but the things that they can learn
unrelated to basketball are incredible. So I think we grew as a team just with
this, a whole new sense of appreciation of the world, and the different
cultures that are out there that we don't even think about. So as a result,
that was really valuable. That's a great time that our team bonded, but it
also gives a little snapshot of who could do what in short prep. Going into
it, you've got to be careful not to hurry ourselves because we had that
experience, but at the same time we can move a little faster than we have in
the past.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could talk about Spike and how you've seen him
develop since he got on campus, particularly from last season to this
season?  
JOHN BEILEIN: It's amazing the confidence he has shown since the day he walked
in the door. I mean, even when he came for his visit where he was what some
people thought was an unlikely recruit, he was laughing about how unlikely
people thought this was. And then every time he walks on the floor, he just‑‑
he's got incredible confidence that "I can play at this level," and he's shown
that so well. He's a pleasure to coach. He's become a really excellent team
leader right now. I'm really leaning on him to be the pulse of the team.  
  
Q. With these foreign trips, how do you handle those, and also when you
start to get your team ready for the season, how much does the fact that they
had that experience, they put some games into their legs in August or whenever
they made the trip, how does that factor into the way you approach your
preseason?  
JOHN BEILEIN: Well, the ten days of practice are great for just working at the
fundamentals, but you can't put in the type of work that you do in a normal
year. You give them more concepts rather than‑‑ you talk about the
fundamentals. You wouldn't be able to train it as well because you don't know
what you're going to see, and now you come out of that and you can really sort
of look at the big picture. You have a better evaluation of your team, and now
your preseason practices should be more on point than they normally would be
because we have information that we would have no idea or wouldn't have known
until two or three weeks into the season.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 16, 2014

  

### [Branden Dawson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25081)

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Adreian Payne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25068)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  69  
Michigan ‑ 55

  
COACH IZZO: I'm really proud of three sets of people: These players have done
an unbelievable job fighting through the things, adversity, and things they
had to do. My assistant coaches, they had to do the same thing because it was
a tough year on all of us. And the preparation they did in the last couple
nights, the assistant coaches and the scout team guys, I think these guys
would agree were unbelievable. And this year I have to give a lot of credit to
our trainer, Q, and our team doctors and acupuncturists, and everyone else
that took care of these guys because it's been that kind of year.  
We beat two really good teams. I think Michigan and Wisconsin have proved
throughout the year that they deserved to be in consideration for a 1 seed,
and I think they were. And they fell a little bit, but they're two very, very
good teams. But I think we proved that when we get everything back, we're a
very, very good team, too, and one that can play. Unlike some of the teams
I've had, they can play on the offensive end, they can play on the defensive
end, and I thought these two guys did a lot of both today.  
  
Q. Adrian, what was it like celebrating that with Lacy up on the podium,
having her and holding the trophy and holding her there?  
ADREIAN PAYNE: Her and her family drove down, and just to have them supporting
me like that, it was great.  
  
Q. Branden, yesterday you spoke with eagerness about getting your shot at
Michigan. There was a stretch in the second half where, I think, you got two
offensive boards, you got a defensive board, you got a lay ‑up, you got a
dunk, you fed Payne on a dunk:   
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yeah, it all starts with my teammates and Coach Izzo. I was
ready to play against those guys, and being a guy from Indiana, coming in my
first year I wasn't familiar with the whole Michigan and Michigan State
rivalry. But once it grew on me, then I started to come in, and my teammates
pushed me. I just felt good out there, and we played great.  
  
Q. How tough was it to get through not being what you guys thought you could
be? By that, I mean your buddy there, Payne, he missed seven, eight games;
whatever you missed, nine. I mean, that wears on the mind. How tough was that
getting through that?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: It was definitely tough, and the main thing with us and with
our great coach, we just never gave up as a team. We just kept fighting, we
just kept pushing each other as a team.  
I prayed on it every night. When I was out those nine games, I prayed every
night. It feels great to have our rhythm and our chemistry back and just to
see us playing good as a team.  
  
Q. Branden, what's it say about yourself to miss the games that you did and
then come back and get most outstanding player?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Well, like I said, it all started with my teammates. My
coaches have worked, the conditioning coach, and when the team was practicing,
I was down on the other end doing drills on the floor, defensive drills, I was
running on the treadmill and doing those little things. Coach said if you want
to come back, you have to keep working hard, and I was on the bike when the
team was practicing. It feels great being out here with my teammates and
winning a Big Ten championship being that I missed it with the ACL injury.  
  
Q. How tough was it, Coach? Were you pulling your hair out or wondering if
this team would be deprived of being able to show its potential?  
COACH IZZO: That's a very good choice of words. You don't get many teams that
are talented, have inside‑outside, have some toughness, are together, have
great chemistry. I said three times in my career I thought we were good enough
to get to a Final Four: In 2000, when we went to one in '99, 2001 still might
have been a better team, when we went back to the Final Four. And a couple of
the other ones, I thought you had a chance, but I thought this team was the
next in line to have a legitimate chance because there's so many things that
you have to do to get there.  
It was the most difficult year of my whole career here just because you fight
making excuses, you fight the realization, you fight players being down about
it. There was a lot more talking, you know. I've got a minor in psychology, a
major in medicine, and a two‑year degree in basketball coaching this year, so
it was a little reversed than other years.  
  
Q. Tom, is there kind of a common thread to all of the Michigan State teams
that have made deep runs into the tournament?  
COACH IZZO: You know, I think there is, and I think that was the hardest thing
as I was talking to the guys today before the game. Steve and Greg from CBS,
the one thing that I said, we kind of didn't have an identity this year. We've
always had an identity of our toughness, of our defense, of our rebounding. We
were third in the league in rebounding, which for us is probably the worst
we've been in a lot of years. And we really weren't as good defensively down
the stretch. Our running game wasn't as good because we didn't rebound as good
to get the running game going.  
I think the problem we had is we had no real identity. Who was our go to guy?
Was it Appling? Was it Harris? Was it Payne? Every time we found one,
something went wrong with him. That's what made it difficult.  
But I think the blueprint that we talked about when we got them all back two
weeks ago is: We've got to shore up our defense, we've got to get our running
game going, and we've got to be a little tougher. So we did practice hard. We
did go two a day some. A little odd, I had my equipment man, who's a marathon
runner, chewing me out for it. But I thought I had to do what I had to do to
bring back an identity.  
I think you saw some of that identity today and the common bond between this
team and most others, we're pretty good defensively, we're a pretty good
rebounding team. It's hard to believe ‑‑ it would be a hell of a trivia
question ‑‑ I think we shot more threes and almost the same percentage as
Michigan for the year, and their identity is they're a very good three‑point
shooting team.  
So I think we've been able to do it inside, we've been able to do it outside.
We've run the ball. And I think we were able to play teams that want to go up
and down, and we've been able to play teams that want to play smash mouth.  
You have a Wisconsin team one day, a Michigan team the next. That proves my
point.  
  
Q. After the Northwestern blowout, I asked you if you thought that ‑‑ since
you got everybody healthy, if you had seen a positive, consistent progression,
or was it like the stock market, up and down. Now after these next two wins,
now can we say the stock market is up?   
COACH IZZO: The market is up, yeah. The market is up. That's what every coach
works for is consistency. I'm not sure I'd call three games consistency, but
we played pretty well against Iowa. We played decent against Ohio State. If
you look at the last five out of six, I think we've made some serious strides,
even though sometimes it showed, sometimes it didn't.  
You know, players need to feel good, coaches need to feel good. There's no
better way to feel good than to play against the best and compete.  
Don't kid yourself; Wisconsin and Michigan are two great teams. I thought both
of them were worthy of being a No.1 seed. Sometimes you've got to win at the
end, and that changes, at least like it did for us a couple years ago. We were
probably a 2 seed and we won it and became a 1. I think if Michigan would have
won they would have been a 1 seed, deservedly so. I think if Wisconsin would
have won, they would have been a 1 seed, and deservedly so. Michigan State
won, and we probably got what we deserved, even though we didn't play with our
full deck. We lost some games, that's the way it is.  
But who cares now? It's a whole new ballgame.  
  
Q. With the adversity your team faced this season, did you ever have any
doubts about them overcoming it? How did you convince them to stay the
course?  
COACH IZZO: That's a good word, a good phrase, stay the course. We used that.
My football coach Mark Dantonio used that with me a lot. Convinced them that‑‑
some days I was convincing myself to stay the course. Yeah, I was worried
about running out of time if you want the truth. I didn't know how long it
would take, if it was real.  
The fans, you put the jerseys back on and you're 100 percent. We're still not
where we need to be if we're going to make a deep run. We still have moments
where we're fouling too much or we're doing this or that. But, today, we shot
uncharacteristically poor from the three, so we've got some work to do the
next couple days.  
But I think my staff did a good job convincing me when I was down, and I guess
I did a good job of convincing them, and then we had some selling to do to our
players. You know, it's disappointing when you have a goal of winning the Big
Ten championship and you don't get it done. So their daubers were down, and we
picked it up the best we could.  
  
Q. You've talked about how Indianapolis has been good to you and to Michigan
State. Do you kind of wish that you were in the Midwest so that you could come
back to Indianapolis, and what is it about Indianapolis that you guys just
play so well?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I don't know. Maybe it's Gary Harris. Indiana has been good
to me in recruiting.  
I think the biggest thing is it's a basketball state. It's a basketball city.
The way these arenas are set up in the downtown area, Final Fours, I mean,
it's‑‑ they should be in the rotation on a quite‑frequent basis.  
But this year was special. How many times does a football and basketball team
both win their conference championship to start with, and then to do it in the
same city? And I got to enjoy his, he got to enjoy mine. Give Mark Hollis
credit, too, my AD. He didn't get to be here with me to celebrate it because
he's on that selection committee, but he did a heck of a job. And so I think
Indy has been very good.  
I enjoyed my time here when we played here in Regionals and Final Fours. I
enjoyed the Big Ten tournaments. I really enjoyed our football championship
game here. My whole team did. And I do need to give thanks to Mark Dantonio
because he's been a big help as I went through the year.  
He'd stop by, I'd get a text, I'd get a call, even though he was out
recruiting. Because sometimes coaches understand what coaches go through when
other people don't. It's been great.  
  
Q. All your Final Four teams that you've coached, have you seen any sort of
correlation between what those teams did in the conference tournament, and is
there a common thread or is there usually no correlation between how you do in
the conference tournament versus how you do in the big dance?  
COACH IZZO: Yeah, the Spartans have been a little bit strange in that area.
We've lost the first game and gotten to a Final Four. We've won the
championship and gotten to a Final Four. We're diversified, we can do it a lot
of different ways.  
But I don't think that's been a common thread. It's what that team needs at
that time. I said here, the biggest thing we needed was to play three games.
We needed more and more games together. We just‑‑ I mean, Appling getting some
lobs today, we just couldn't do that in practice. We're starting to feel the
rhythm again together, and so the more games you play, the better it is.  
Other years‑‑ I've never wanted to lose right away, but a few teams worn out
or something‑‑ and it's not going to change your seeding much. You look at it
differently. This year it was very important that we moved on, and what does
that mean, I don't know. I don't worry about what the Big Ten Tournament does.
I look at the season, our non‑conference schedule. Our conference schedule, I
thought, was brutal like everybody else's in this league.  
We will be very well prepared for the NCAA Tournament. Whether that gets us to
where I want to go, I don't know, but I can't think of a conference that could
prepare you more than this one has done. The Big Ten is‑‑ we didn't get a 1
seed, and I'm sure people will wonder about that. We had two teams that
deserved it, and so did the teams that got it. I'm not politicking here; it's
over. And I'm not upset about it. They could have won their way in. We did
that once. We lost our way in once.  
But with a bunch of 2 and 3 and 4, and what did we get, 6 teams in, happy for
Nebraska. Did Minnesota get in? Sad for Minnesota, but I mean, the league just
beat the daylights out of each other, and now with new coaches we've got
different styles. Some press, some play zone, some this, some that. I think
that prepares you for the NCAA Tournament as much as anything we could do.  
Appreciate it, thanks a lot.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 16, 2014

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Jordan Morgan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26711)

### [Glenn Robinson, III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25143)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  69  
Michigan ‑ 55

  
COACH BEILEIN: We got beat today by a really good team. They were exceptional
in everything, in everything that they did. Their defense was really good,
their steals in the first half, and their offensive rebounding, just took
possessions from us. All that being said, a couple breaks go our way, we would
have liked it to be three or four at half. Unfortunately it wasn't.  
And the second half ‑‑ the key part of the game, I think, was the second half.
We came out, I thought we had a couple really good looks, and then we‑‑ and
didn't convert, and they did. And all of a sudden it's 15, and now you're
fighting back the whole way.  
Huge congratulations to Michigan State. They deserve it. They were better than
us today, and we move forward and look forward to the NCAAs.  
  
Q. Jordan, the early foul trouble, how frustrating was that and how do you
think that affected the rest of the game?  
JORDAN MORGAN: I mean, it's tough. It seemed like all our big guys were kind
of in foul trouble. And they definitely exposed that, not necessarily just
imposed on us but kind of on the glass, and kind of a certain physicality down
there. So that was tough for us to kind of work through and try to stay in the
game through that.  
  
Q. Glenn, the match ‑up with Brandon Dawson, getting him back on the floor,
what was that like being able to battle with him?   
GLENN ROBINSON, III: I mean, I've played against Branden many times. He's a
great player, especially for them to have him back, he did a lot for their
team. We knew his big thing was offensive rebounding, and we had to keep him
off the glass. We needed to do a better job at that. But he really gave them a
spark on offense and defense, I thought. He played well, and as far as
attacking him, I just tried to get downhill a couple times. I didn't finish a
lot, but I just did what I could.  
  
Q. I was just wondering, in general, how much better is this Michigan State
team than the one you saw during the regular season?  
COACH BEILEIN: Two things are happening: Number one, they're getting healthy,
right, and number two, you get those guys back and they're healthy, that
doesn't mean you're immediately better the next day. That means it takes time
to get timing down, to get guys ready. There's a lot of work that goes into
this thing.  
So those things, I think, have been happening over the last two or three weeks
where they've had ups and downs as they got healthy. But their timing in this
tournament, you can see by the gravity of their wins. Wisconsin is a pretty
good team, and they did the same thing to Wisconsin they did to us.  
  
Q. Max was forced to give you a lot of minutes tonight. You actually put him
in over Horford in that first half. What did you get out of him today?  
COACH BEILEIN: Well, Horford was in foul trouble, and we thought we could just
hang in there a little bit and keep it under double digits at halftime, which
we were on the verge of doing. And Max is really good in practice every day.
We can't stop his three‑point shooting. In practice, he's done some really
good things. So I thought he carried himself really well.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the struggle to get inside the three ‑point line,
the three‑point arch, to get some inside shooting the first half?  
COACH BEILEIN: Well, first of all, they're a very long team. They're very
experienced. It takes‑‑ when we have breakdowns, it's usually youth breakdowns
defensively. You didn't see many freshmen out there today, and really just a
couple sophomores. They really do a great job of protecting the paint. You're
not getting in there. And if you get in there, you've got to finish through
physical contact, and they were better than us today.  
But their defense is as good as anybody in the country. We just played three
teams, back to back to back, that are really good defensive teams. We had to
make tough shots really and come out the second half ‑‑ like I say, we had
really good looks. Caris LeVert had a couple threes he's been making every day
didn't go in.  
  
Q. In an hour or so, people will know where they're going for the
tournament. I want to ask you whether you care about seeding, but how helpful
is it that you've got a game Thursday or Friday and you can turn your channels
toward that?  
COACH BEILEIN: Yeah, I've never seen so much wasted energy on who is seeded
where. I mean, it is incredible. If you asked 99 percent of the‑‑ maybe I'm
just stupid, but tell me the difference between a 14, 15, 16 seed or a 1, 2
and 3. We're talking about the 12 teams, the last 12 in and the first 12 in,
playing them anywhere it doesn't make a difference.  
I don't care where we're seeded. I don't care where we play. I'm just really
happy to be in the NCAA Tournament, and I trust those guys over in that hotel
room with anything. They work at this thing, and I trust them with anything.  
When Michigan's number comes up, we're happy if they're sending us anywhere
and what we're seeded.  
  
Q. You alluded to facing such great defenses this weekend. Can you talk
about how that prepares you for next week and going forward?  
COACH BEILEIN: Hopefully, we don't see too many people like we did. But we
just saw three of the best, really. Illinois was‑‑ their synergy tells us
their ball screen defense is the best in the Big Ten, and we were able to
score enough points.  
Ohio State, all year long, they were in the 38th, 39th percentile as far as
defensive field goal percentage. And the only thing that was holding Michigan
State back was having another upper classman out there, either a senior or
junior. Like Jordan Morgan for us, that's a huge thing to have guys that not
only know their position, they know how to get other people in their position,
and Payne and Dawson and Appling, they do that so well, and Harris is a great,
great defender. It's just getting them all together because we can usually
pick on one guy. There's nobody to pick on on that team.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2014

  

### [Josh Gasser](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22131)

### [Frank Kaminsky](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26750)

### [Bo Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17045)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  83  
Wisconsin ‑ 75

  
Q. For both guys, what made it so difficult to get over the hump there in
the second half?  
FRANK KAMINSKY: You know, we dug ourselves a hole in the first half, and we
were trying to climb out of that hole the whole second half. And we just
didn't have enough left in the tank at the end to get over that.  
JOSH GASSER: Yeah, I mean, when you're down 17 at half against a really good
team, it's tough to get out of. They outplayed us that first half. We fought,
we scrapped to try to get ourselves back, and just couldn't quite get out of
it.  
  
Q. Frank, can you guys take enough positive from the way you played in the
second half to carry over into next week?  
FRANK KAMINSKY: I think there's things we can take away from the game. We know
we can't come out like we did and have a bunch of turnovers in the first half.
That led to a bunch of fast break points for them. They really got into a
rhythm, and we dug ourselves a hole and we couldn't get out of it in the
second half. We played much better, and that's how we have to play going
forward.  
  
Q. Just for both, how important was it for you guys going forward to keep
fighting and to at least bring it close at the end?  
JOSH GASSER: I mean, in a one‑and‑done format, that's what you've got to do.
You've got to fight till the end. It's NCAA Tournament time, so it's
one‑and‑done from here on out. So if we don't fight and scrap from here on
out, bad things will happen. We'd like to come out on top, obviously, but it
didn't happen.  
FRANK KAMINSKY: We've just got to take it 40 minutes at a time going forward.
Like Josh said, it's one‑and‑done time. And we know that everything we've
worked for this year is on the line now, and we've got to go out there and
just listen to the scouting reports and do everything the right way.  
  
Q. Same question from your perspective on what was so tough about getting
over that hump there in the second half.  
COACH RYAN: Which hump are you referring to? That's what I didn't quite
understand, like why we didn't get ahead?  
  
Q. Correct.  
COACH RYAN: Because we didn't make enough baskets, and we didn't stop them
enough times. We shot it better. We held them to a lower shooting percentage.
We did a better job in the paint. We scored more in the paint. We did a better
job on‑‑ in a lot of areas. But when you say get over the hump, the hump was
20‑something at one time. Got over that one.  
But hump, it's either you get ahead or you're behind. We didn't get ahead.  
  
Q. What changed in the second half or what did you guys do coming out of the
locker room to try and get back into it?  
COACH RYAN: Just reiterated what we tried to get across before the game. They
hit some shots. They made some jumpers. Payne starts out with a tough three.
You've got to give them credit for the way they shot the ball.  
But we didn't make some‑‑ we didn't make the decisions we needed to make in
order to get our defensive players in the half court position. So once you're
playing from behind, the number of possessions change. We got behind, and we
just had to keep trying to get more than they did on the next‑‑ whether you
get 40 possessions a half, 35, 30, it's usually somewhere between 30 and 40.
We did not do a very good job on our possessions. And they shot it real well
to get a lot on theirs.  
Second half, hung in there tough. What's that mean? Of course they're going to
play tough; what do you think? Athletes are going to go out there and not
scrap and not‑‑ we created some doubt for them shooting‑wise. We weren't
creating doubt early.  
I mean, you guys in a driveway, off your garage, you start hitting some shots,
and the neighborhood kids are like, Man, that guy is good. Well, the
neighborhood kids got to take you out of your comfort spot. Gotta do
something.  
  
Q. You talked about your offensive decisionmaking. Were you referring to
shot selection or something else?  
COACH RYAN: Yeah, ball movement, body movement, shot selection. It's never
just one thing, it's a combination of things. And we weren't very fluid, but
we found that fluidity and did a much better job on our points per possession.
We got to the foul line, did the things we were hoping to do more of in the
first half.  
  
Q. With all the fouls and stoppages in the first half, what impact do you
think that had on your ability to come back?  
COACH RYAN: Well, in order to make a comeback, if you can score with the clock
stopped, that's a pretty good thing, and we've been able to do that over the
years. Well, try to do it again.  
But just a free throw here, tough jumper by them there. We got them to miss
some free throws. One of them hit so hard, our guys couldn't get their hands
up in time. That's why I try to tell our guys to have their hands up at the
free‑throw line.  
You've got to grab those, and if we come down and score on that one, there's
still time. There's a lot of things you can go through, but in order for it to
happen, it has to be ‑‑ you've got to score with the clock stopped a lot. And
you've got to get them to either turn it over or take bad shots and not give
them second ones.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2014

  

### [Branden Dawson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25081)

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Adreian Payne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25068)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  83  
Wisconsin  75

  
COACH IZZO: Well, first of all, the team we beat is a hell of a team. We got
off to such a good start. We made shots, they didn't make shots. I thought we
played some of our best basketball of the year in that first five minutes, and
we built a pretty good lead.  
You know, we played Kentucky, we played some of the Carolinas, and Wisconsin
is very good. Kaminsky has gotten so much better, and I thought we played
awfully well. I didn't think we had quite the energy level the second half,
but some of that was because of foul trouble, and especially with Adrian, he
played 27 minutes, got 18 points.  
And the other fact that I'm really proud of is this guy next to me, Brandon,
14 points, he's hitting jump shots, seven, eight rebounds, he's really been a
difference‑maker on the defensive end, too. These two guys are worthy of being
up here, and yet Wisconsin is a good team, and I thought we had to hang on for
our life.  
  
Q. Either of you, tell me a little bit about the progress Denzel Valentine
has made this season.  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Well, Denzel has been coming in and working since the day we
lost to Duke. And after that loss Denzel looked in the mirror and said, Hey,
if I want to get better and be a better player, it's going to start with me
being in the gym.  
You know, he made sacrifices like Coach asked. He's been in the gym since
after that loss, summer, in between classes. He's the one that gets us going
with his energy, with his music in the pregame. Denzel, he deserves
everything, but he's just a great player. He's improved a lot.  
  
Q. Both of you guys, statement game today, statement game tomorrow?  
ADREIAN PAYNE: For sure. It was definitely‑‑ you know, it's Michigan, and
we're just excited to be able to play them again. They're a great team.  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Well, like Adrian said, tonight against Wisconsin, they're a
great team. They fought hard. They're a tough team, and they never gave up.
Like Adreian Payne said, against Michigan, we just can't come out and just get
selfish. We just have to play solid as a team and just come out and play
together, like Coach said, just listening to his game plan.  
  
Q. Branden, you haven't had, kind of, full strength to play Michigan this
year. How excited are you to be a part of this rivalry again and to have a
shot at them again tomorrow?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Well, I'm very excited to be given a chance just to play
against these guys. Just sitting out watching those two games, I felt like I
could have helped out a lot. Michigan is a great team, and they deserve all
the accolades they have been going through. I'm definitely excited, just to be
out here playing with my teammates again, and we're looking forward to it.  
  
Q. For either of you or both, Coach has talked about that it'll take some
time for you guys to kind of get back into a groove of things. But the way you
guys played yesterday and the way you guys played today, do you feel like
you're at a pretty good level to be able to do some good things some
tournament time?  
ADREIAN PAYNE: I think we're just scratching the surface because we didn't
play at a high level before. We just haven't had time for everybody to play
together a long period of time so we can get our chemistry together. This
tournament has been great because we've been able to play with each other
more, and we're starting to look better. We're just trying to get better each
day, and by us having a game every day, we're getting a chance to play with
each other and get better.  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Well, I would say it all started from the Illinois game at
home. We lost, and Coach talked about coming out with a sense of urgency,
coming out with energy, and I think Illinois just wanted it more than us. I
think, in practice, Coach talks about our defense. We have to get better
defensively and communicate, and I think that's important for us. We've been
playing great, our chemistry has gotten a lot better, Keith is playing with a
lot of confidence, and him and Travis are pushing the ball more, and our
chemistry is looking great.  
  
Q. Tom, you were concerned about whether you had enough time to find it.
With what you've seen the last two nights, are those concerns eased a little
bit for this team?  
COACH IZZO: Well, they're eased a little bit, but as I told them, we honestly
do have a long way to go. I thought we caught Wisconsin, we just started out
so good, and they got down. But just the type of team‑‑ it's kind of funny
because Bo and I have gone at it now, and I think there's an incredible
respect. I told my players, there's no way they're not coming back.  
I didn't like the fact that the second half, we didn't seem to have the same
energy level. Now, some fouls kind of dampened some of that, I think, but
that's still something that this team has to realize. When you're playing in
these kind of tournaments one‑and‑done, now, next week, whenever, you don't
get to have bad halves. Now, we didn't have a whole bad half, but we had some
bad times, and that's what we talked about in the locker room.  
I'm seeing some confidence in Keith. B.J. has got a lot more confidence. He's
bringing some things. We're getting a little smoother how we cover things. Not
great; I was a little disappointed in my backup guys tonight as far as my‑‑
Trav was great, but my centers struggled. I think you've got to give Kaminsky
credit. This is not your typical Wisconsin team. They run, they can score.
They've got times when they've got five shooters on the floor. It is a hard
team to defend. I told them after, let's get to a Final Four because they're
good enough. I really mean that.  
  
Q. As a Michigan native have and a veteran of so many Michigan ‑Michigan
State games, put into perspective what the game means to the state of
Michigan, especially given the results thus far this year.   
COACH IZZO: Well, we've gone through a lot of things over my 20, 25 years, I
think, of being an assistant and then a head coach. I think when Judd was
here, it ended up pretty even, wins and losses. Then we went through the Fab
Five era and then I took over and got my tail kicked for quite a while. And
then we did some kicking.  
And I think to have a rivalry‑‑ and when you think of Duke‑North Carolina or
Auburn‑Alabama or whatever rivalry you choose‑‑ a rivalry isn't a rivalry
unless both teams are competitive. I think a rivalry is a better rivalry when
they're in the same state. You can have some good rivalries that aren't, but
when they're in the same state, they are.  
And I think both coaches have respect for one another. I'm not going to get
into whether we like them or they like us or whatever because I always get
asked that. But there's a respectful rivalry now because both teams are good
and both teams are playing for a lot. I think they should be playing for a 1
seed. I thought Wisconsin, if they won it, would get one. I still think
they're a very, very high seed. We got an opportunity to play them. I told my
players, we've got to play three games here. I thought that was important that
we get games under our belt, and we play three days, and shazam, we get to
play our rival. You know, so it's Fourth of July and Christmas. You get both.  
  
Q. Do you think today may have been the closest you came to playing a full
40 minutes?  
COACH IZZO: Honestly, no. The second half I did not think‑‑ I think I know
some of the reasons, but I did not think we played as well, but I think
Wisconsin played better, too. I'm just going to take my ball and go home and
be happy to be honest with you.  
I thought it was‑‑ we're getting closer to playing the way I'd like to see us
play. We ran, we defended pretty well early. Probably the only negative that I
see right now on this team is the fouling situation. We're making some foolish
fouls, A.P. is reaching and Gary Harris, and we can't make those kind of
fouls. As a coaching staff, I told D.J. we've got to do a better job. Probably
with two and a half minutes left to go in the half, should take A.P. out. It's
sad you got to think that way, but I think you do.  
We played well, played well against Northwestern. This was a big win because I
think we beat a team that's‑‑ as I said, I think we're playing for a 1 seed,
and I don't think conference tournaments should hurt that. But we'll see how
we do tomorrow. It's important to us right now to keep getting better, then we
get another three, four days of practice, and then the big dance starts.  
  
Q. How difficult has it been for you to keep your patience and your wits
about you through all of this?  
COACH IZZO: I mean, honestly, it's been the most difficult year of my career
just because I love this team. I've said it from the beginning, I said it in
the middle, I said it at the end; it is one of the best teams I've had here. I
haven't been able to enjoy them enough. Good guys, fun to be around, good
players, got a lot of good chemistry as far as getting along together. Now
we've got to get that playing rhythm back.  
But, yeah, it's been difficult. Everybody says, Well, you don't look as happy.
Why would you look happy with six guys out? There's nothing to be happy about,
it's just‑‑ it was hard. It was hard on them.  
But, you know, I said, adversity usually makes you stronger in some way,
shape, or form. At least if I ever go through this again, I'll know how to
handle it a little better. But there were some trying times, but I had to keep
reminding myself, just think of them. They're out there, the pistons aren't
all moving at the same time. And so I still give them a lot of credit. We did
a lot of good things considering.  
  
Q. The last time you were down here you brought the team down to watch the
fast break team win the Big Ten championship. Is there any carryover from that
and will there be tomorrow?  
COACH IZZO: I like being in championship environments, I really do. I went to
the Super Bowl just to see what it's like. When it's closer to home, like our
football team and the great job Mark Dan Antonio did‑‑ when I suggested it to
the players two weeks before, and then we go get beat by North Carolina which
kind of dampened it. But it really didn't dampen it because the mission was to
learn how to win a championship. I thought the most significant part of the
night was when I said, Let's get out of here, it's midnight, we'll get home at
4:00 in the morning, 5:00 in the morning, and we left at about 7:00 in the
morning. I said, Let's get out and go, and they all said, Coach, we've got to
stay for the ceremony, man.  
It was so much fun to watch quiet guys that I've got, because some are, waving
flags and high fiving their comrades out there, and just the excitement they
had to see them win. Mark D'Antonio has often talked that I've kind of showed
him the way, early, how to win championships, and this year he showed me the
way. So is there any significance? I think you can borrow me that line backer
to jump over the pile. I don't know if there's any significance in the game,
but I see the significance that was the way we started the season out,
learning how to win a championship from our football buddies. And now we get a
chance to win our own in the Big Ten, and I think that's an awesome‑‑ that's a
good year. That's a good set of events.  
  
Q. Aside from, obviously, getting a positive result tomorrow, what do you
need to see improved to feel good about next week?  
COACH IZZO: Foul trouble would be one. I think we've got to defend without
fouling a little better. We cut our turnovers down; that was good. And see if
we can stay consistent, 40 minutes of consistency, and I think our situation
would help that.  
So those are the couple of things that I want to see: Unselfish play. We had
15 assists and 29, but early in the game, we had 9 of our first 13 were from
assists. That's critical. The lack of turnovers, getting eight for the game
against, I think, a good defensive team is critical.  
You know, it's interesting because you get in this league as long as I've
been, I hope four of us get to a Final Four, and that's what I told Bo. I hope
everybody plays well. I'm big for the conference. I just want to play a little
better than somebody else one more time in the league.

Q. Aaron, first of all, just what happened on that last shot where the ball
‑‑ it appeared to slip out of your hands.   
AARON CRAFT: It slipped out of my hands.  
  
Q. Aaron, you were out for an extended period and came in, you had to go
almost straight to the foul line there. Did you feel like you weren't back in
the flow of the game at that point?  
AARON CRAFT: It's not about sitting out or anything. You've got to step up for
your team in that moment, and I didn't. We knew that was going to come back
and haunt us sometime. The two games we've had, we haven't shot the ball well
from the free‑throw line, and it cost us today.  
  
Q. Shannon, what did you guys start doing better offensively to rally from
double ‑digit deficit the second straight day?  
SHANNON SCOTT: Just staying aggressive really. Kind of dug ourselves into a
hole again. I feel like as a team when our head's underwater, we start
fighting more, and we started doing that again today.  
  
Q. Shannon, the game you had on offense today, did it stem from your
defense? It seemed when you went in the game early you were very disruptive to
what they were doing at their end on offense, and I wondered if that got you
going?  
SHANNON SCOTT: It always helps, but I've just got to learn to stay aggressive
on offense at all times.  
  
Q. Aaron, they're shooting threes at a pretty crazy clip early on, and it's
coming from guys all over the floor. Seemed like you used the defense still to
kind of regain your poise and get back in the game. How did you do that?  
AARON CRAFT: Just kept trying to tell ourselves they couldn't keep shooting
the way they were. They started off five‑for‑five or something like that. Some
of them were open and some of them were contested. We wanted to limit the open
ones, and if they make a contested one, he made one off the backboard, what
can you do? Like Shannon said, we just wanted to stay aggressive, and we did a
great job fighting back by halftime.  
  
Q. Aaron, I know you're going to want to go back in the game, but the way
the guys were playing, the flow they were in, were you going to be okay just
sort of being cheerleader or did you want to go back in?  
AARON CRAFT: I trusted in what they were doing. It was amazing to just watch
on the sideline. They were doing a phenomenal job. They finally got us a lead,
we got over that hump, and just down the stretch I was hoping I could come in
and make a difference.  
  
Q. Can you walk us through the thought process of how you were going to
manage Aaron, given the team had rallied to take a lead without him?  
COACH MATTA: Well, we wanted to give him a break in the first half. There's
nobody in the country that plays harder than he does, and we knew he was a
little bit tired. And we had that long segment‑‑ I think the media time‑out
was at 4:14 in the first half ‑‑ and we knew another one was coming, so we
didn't give him a break there.  
I was okay, especially the way the guys were playing, giving him as much
rest‑‑ we knew it was going to kind of come down to the end, and keeping him
over there was‑‑ I was fine with it. Like I said, those guys had a pretty good
flow to what they were doing out there, and he's not going to miss a beat when
he comes back in the game.  
  
Q. LeVert said, when he was in here, that his job normally is to get back on
defense and not offensive rebound, and that you guys weren't really paying too
much attention to him on the boards all day. Is that what your plan was, he
really wasn't a priority in your rebounding scout, and is that why he got open
for that offensive rebound?  
COACH MATTA: No, to be honest with you the way they got us on the boards in
Game 1, rebounding was a big key. Now, they didn't send guys the way they did
really until about that play was when he went. It was a heck of a play on his
part, and we just‑‑ we missed him.  
  
Q. I don't mean to belabor this, but do you think about maybe not putting
Aaron back in the way things were going, or is he a guy you have to have out
there at the end?  
COACH MATTA: Oh, absolutely, yeah. You have to have him out there, no question
about that. The way Shannon was playing, there was just possessions where you
knew it was going to come down to the defensive end of it, and you want him in
the game when the game is on the line defensively.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2014

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Caris LeVert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26743)

### [Nik Stauskas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24438)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan  72  
Ohio State ‑ 69

  
COACH BEILEIN: I feel so fortunate right now. You look at so many of our games
down the stretch here, they've ended just like this and the ball keeps
bouncing our way. You only can have that type of luck if you have guys like
these guys sitting next to me. They make enough smart plays to keep you in the
game, and some games the ball will just bounce your way.  
Really proud of how these two guys and everybody else had big roles in this
wins, and now we move forward and try to win it all tomorrow.  
  
Q. Nick, talk about the last basket you made, kind of the acrobatic scoop.
Were you looking toward the corner or were you thinking shoot all the way on
that one?  
NICK STAUSKAS: I was thinking shoot the whole time, because I kind of knew
Shannon Scott wasn't going to take a charge. He was going to try to jump, and
that's a shot I work on all the time, just a little reverse lay‑up with some
spin on it. I was pretty confident going into that one.  
  
Q. Caris, you've talked a lot about your recruitment and whatnot. This kind
of big stage with all the eyes of the entire conference watching, how much
does it help you to play with that chip on your shoulder?  
CARIS LEVERT: It's a dream come true for me getting to play against Ohio State
in a big stage like this in a Big Ten Tournament. This was one of goals coming
in is to win the championship, so it feels great.  
  
Q. Caris, can you talk us through the last play after you missed the free
throw getting back and the defense on craft's shot?  
CARIS LEVERT: Well, I think he just lost the ball actually. I don't think I
got a hand on it, he just lost the ball, and the time ran out.  
  
Q. Against the tougher teams in the Big Ten you guys have done well. To get
a win over Ohio State that you hadn't beaten, I know you don't pay as much
attention, but guys, in what could be a rivalry game still, talk about the
ability to do that.  
NICK STAUSKAS: Yeah, well, coming into this game, for us we weren't thinking
about winning the Big Ten conference championship, the tournament. We were
thinking about just beating Ohio State. This is a rivalry game, and we were
just excited to be out here and have this opportunity today. And I think we
did a great job of sticking together as a team even when they made their runs.
I just think we did a good job today.  
  
Q. Caris, on the rebound that you got off Nick's missed three there that led
to the free throw, was there something that you were reading based on the way
that play was set up? It looked like you were cutting in there like almost ‑‑
not designed necessarily, but‑‑  
CARIS LEVERT: I'm actually not supposed to offensive rebound at all. I'm
supposed to just get back on the play. Coach Beilein just told me about that.
But I noticed the whole game they weren't really boxing me out because I'm
supposed to be going back, so I noticed when he shot it, it came off a little
short, so I knew I could go get the rebound.  
  
Q. Coach, Lenzelle for Ohio State, 11.4 points per game, and he finished
with only three. What was the key to keeping him from producing especially
down the stretch?  
COACH BEILEIN: You know, we studied their stats for the last five games, and
some of it worked out pretty well, that he hadn't been shooting the ball
really well, so we really tried to contain him his set of ‑‑ getting out too
much on him. We also tried to just stay in a containing with Shannon Scott,
and that really hurt us because he shot the ball like he's probably never shot
it in his career here. So that's good for Ohio State next year because he's
good, but thank God he didn't beat us today. But there was no special plan,
just try to contain him, make to take tough twos.  
  
Q. In the first half and in the second half, you had a big lead and then
they made big runs to cut into it.  
COACH BEILEIN: I think the big changes were the points off turnovers. As you
know, any time Aaron is out there or any of your other players, they had seven
steals in the first half and we had seven turnovers. Steals are usually
run‑outs. They're not a time that you walk and you take the ball back. You
take the ball out of bounds and all of a sudden you set your defense.  
The seven steals probably led to‑‑ I think they had 22 points or something at
halftime off‑‑ no, 13 points in turnovers. And in the second half they got
three or four more. We did have some shots that didn't drop, but I was happy
with our defense. We played exceptionally well in those first‑‑ the start of
the game. That couldn't last.  
  
Q. You had, I think, end of the first half a pretty significant scoring lull
and again in the second half, almost ten minutes. Was there anything about
their defense in those particular periods that bothered your offense?  
COACH BEILEIN: Well, number one, it probably is what I just spoke to. They
probably took the ball from us and created turnovers. So you don't get a shot
if you turn it over, so that's going to lend to that.  
You watch them and you've got two teams playing right now, Michigan State and
Wisconsin. Those are the three best defensive teams in our league. They're
just really difficult to score points on, and that's why‑‑ we had 70 points on
them, so there's going to be those lulls. But when you get it going, if you
can keep it going to, get to seven points against Ohio State, that doesn't
happen very often.  
  
Q. Ohio State was the best team in the conference as far as three ‑point
defense, and you guys came out and shot the lights out. Was there something
you guys were doing especially well as far as spacing or was it just a day
where shots went in?  
COACH BEILEIN: We're fortunate because we have ‑‑ when you add Zak Irvin to
it, we have really four or five guys, Spike is six, that can come off the
bench and make threes. So we've got six of our eight that play can make
threes. And, as a result, when you have that many guys‑‑ and pretty much they
have different green lights, but they have green lights. So when they're
shooting it well, we can spread people out.  
  
Q. I just wanted to ask, obviously you'd rather have him on the floor, but
how has it been having Mitch on the bench? Does he ever slip into an assistant
coach type role?  
COACH BEILEIN: Actually, yesterday, he huddled me up with one of the players
explaining to the player that he had to talk more in our switching, that he
had noticed he wasn't talking loud enough. I don't know why I had to be in
that conversation, but he wanted me in that conversation, as well.  
My concern with Mitch is he is going too hard in helping our team with his
enthusiasm, that we don't want that back to get hurt any more. We want him to
be completely healthy, but he can't stop himself.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2014

  

### [Tim Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18102)

### [Terran Petteway](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26714)

### [Shavon Shields](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25003)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  71  
Nebraska  67

  
COACH MILES: Well, unfortunately, I thought that we beat ourselves. I know you
have to credit Ohio State with their pressure late. The last 13 minutes they
really did an excellent job of getting us rattled. Their physical defense out
front I thought really got to us, too. But really at the end of the day, when
you have a lead like that, you should be able to hold it and keep it and find
a way to win, but unfortunately we weren't able to.  
Credit them, but at the end of the day, I'm going to put this one on us and me
and not finding a better way to attack their pressure.  
I thought we had practiced it relatively well during the week, had plenty of
reps, but it's hard to simulate, and you never know how physical the game
gets. Craft and Scott were so physical the last six minutes of the game that
it just gets you out of your rhythm. There's no doubt about that.  
  
Q. Shavon, you guys were up 18 in the second half with ten minutes left.
What changed from that point to the rest of the game?  
SHAVON SHIELDS: Just they were turning us over, speeding us up, getting us out
of operating areas. And we weren't executing on offense, weren't making plays
on defense, giving up offensive boards, and we just kind of fell apart. It was
just really embarrassing on our part and unacceptable, and that's really what
happened the last couple minutes of the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about their physicality on defense? Seemed like there was a
lot of contact every time you got in the lane. How much did that play into
that second ‑half rally there?   
TERRAN PETTEWAY: There really was no excuse. They play physical, we know that
about Ohio State. That's their identity: Play physical and hard. We just had
to take care of the ball, and we didn't. I mean, that cost us the game.  
  
Q. When Tom Izzo was building Michigan State, he said the hardest part was
when he got a team, that they learned how to win. Is that the next step in
rebuilding Nebraska for you?  
COACH MILES: I think our inexperience in being in a game of that magnitude,
that high caliber, where you've got to just fight it out definitely hurt us.
Hopefully, it's something we don't re‑create. Hopefully, it's not a symptom of
something that's a larger problem, that it was just one of those experiences
that we weren't quite ready for. It's hard to replicate in practice. But Coach
Izzo is right. He usually is.  
It's just such a disappointing day for us.  
  
Q. Do you think the kids went in thinking, Okay, we need to win this to lock
up an NCAA Tournament berth? Do you think there's any pressure like that?  
COACH MILES: No, I just think we wanted to win the tournament. We wanted to
win the Big Ten Tournament. We wanted to do in three days what Michigan State
took two and a half months to do. The tournament is going to be what it's
going to be. It's out of your control. I don't think they felt any pressure.
They didn't play like they did until Ohio State pressured us.  
  
Q. How big have the transfers been for you this season? Has that been the
biggest difference?  
COACH MILES: Definitely. Those are guys who are our best athletes and I think
they have a really good skill level, too. And Walter did a really nice job, I
thought. He started out in frustration a little bit, but ended the game really
well. And then Terran, I thought, just got frustrated and ended up taking
himself out of the game mentally. We just can't have that. He's too good and
too valuable to let that happen. I didn't do a good job putting them in great
situations either. We just have to go back and look at this and keep trying to
get better for wherever we play next week.  
  
Q. Kind of building on that, how much of a learning process has it been this
season just to come as far as you have, as quickly as you have, and did you
see anything in the body language of your guys at the end of the game where
you thought maybe they don't believe that they can get this?  
COACH MILES: Well, I think when we threw the lob and the kid tried to reverse
it and missed it‑‑ we set two records: One in the first half and one in the
second half for worst shot ever. That's usually not a record you want to set
in the Big Ten Tournament.  
It seemed like that really bothered us, and we got guys in foul trouble: Benny
and Shavon got in foul trouble, and we had other guys that came in that
honestly looked scared. They were like, Oh, boy, this is a big moment, and
they really made their run. And then we just couldn't get them‑‑ they scored,
what, 10 of their last 11 possessions probably, I think it was, and we just
couldn't get anything going.  
And you have to credit their defense and then look at when we quit scoring.
When this team scores, they really defend. But, then, when we quit scoring
sometimes we worry about that. And I think that's a mark of immaturity, not in
a bad way, but just understanding how you win. Can you win shooting 36 percent
against a team like Ohio State when there's a lot at stake? Tonight we
couldn't, and it's unfortunate because it was right there until the last
minute.  
  
Q. You got down eight in the first five minutes or so and then kept clawing
your way back. Any reason for that slow start? Was it just ‑‑  
COACH MILES: I think that when you sit there for a week, whatever you try and
do in practice, you kind of lose that competitive spirit. Same thing here. And
we play‑‑ what day is it, Friday? Was it Friday? So we play today, and then
maybe we don't play again for another week. Maybe we play Tuesday, who knows.
But just sitting here for a week and all you do is practice and talk about the
potential game, you're used to playing every three days. And with the Big Ten
schedule, sometimes you might play five in eight days. So you're used to a
regular diet of games, and I just think it took a little bit of time.  
Last year we hopped on them pretty good when we had beat Purdue and then saw
them in the quarter. And we were right there late in the first half, and we
were the aggressor and, finally, they got their act together and run us out of
the gym. But I think not playing that first day, sometimes it takes a little
bit to get yourself going.  
  
Q. I know it's not up to you, but are you guys an NCAA Tournament team? And
how quickly can you put this loss behind you and start shifting towards the
next tournament?  
COACH MILES: I'm a Catholic, we're not putting it behind us. We're going to
live in it for a while.  
I think we're a tournament team. I think we're a team good enough to win in
the tournament. I mean, you just look at our body of work‑‑ and even, we lost
to Illinois who was playing lights‑out and just lost to a great Michigan team.
And other than that, we haven't lost many games recently in the past two
months.  
I know that early we weren't the team we are now, but I know they have to
consider your full body of work.  
  
Q. As you said earlier, it's out of your control now, but what are the next
two days going to be like for you knowing what that would mean if your name
does get called?  
COACH MILES: I'm trying to debate my options, and none of them are good or
healthy. One thing I think we'll do is get the team together tomorrow just so
they're not sitting around all day. So we'll do something tomorrow with them,
whether that be shoot or whatever, and just‑‑ that's always a healing process.
The child psychologist takes the kid in the sandbox, gets the Tonka trucks
out, and we get them in the gym and give them a ball and that sort of thing.  
We need a little salve on these wounds, so we'll probably kill a day doing
that, like shoot for 11 hours. I don't know, is that against the rules? We're
on spring break, aren't we? We're going to be. We'll break the rules. I'm
kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2014

  

### [Joey King](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24795)

### [DeAndre Mathieu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26127)

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Wisconsin  83  
Minnesota ‑ 57

  
COACH PITINO: Well, obviously, offensively we didn't have it tonight, and
you've got to give them credit. They made us pay. They're a very good
offensive team.  
You know, disappointed with the effort tonight‑‑ just not so much effort, but
I just think that we let our offense frustrate us and dictate our defense. But
you've got to give them credit. They're a very, very good team.  
  
Q. For either of the players or both of the players, how frustrating is it,
I guess, when your offense does get off to a slow start like that and you see
Wisconsin go on the run they did and then just knowing how tough it's going to
be to come back from that?  
DEANDRE MATHIEU: It's really frustrating because they're a really good
offensive team, and they really just controlled the pace of the game. And once
they got a big lead, we knew we had to get stops, but we just couldn't get
stops today.  
JOEY KING: I'll just reiterate that it was definitely frustrating. Those runs
are just things that we have to put a stop to through our defense, and our
offense definitely transitioned over into our defense struggling today.  
  
Q. How physical did you think it was in the first half, and some of the
calls that you maybe didn't get, how frustrating was that offensively to
overcome?  
JOEY KING: Whether it's a foul or not, those are things that, in the Big Ten,
you just have to play through. It's a really competitive game, and those are
definitely things that we just have to fight through and not think about.  
DEANDRE MATHIEU: Like Joey said, in the Big Ten all the games are physical.
They've been like that all year, so I mean, whether it was a foul or not, that
was the referee's decision. We just had to play through it, and we made a lot
of mistakes that went beyond the fouls, and we didn't defend today.  
  
Q. Joey, after they went on the initial run and then you guys came back with
three three ‑pointers in a row‑‑ I don't remember how many points you came
within‑‑ but was there a point soon after that that you felt like maybe it
started to actually get away from you for good?   
JOEY KING: We always want to come in and fight, and whether or not people
think we can win, we always think we have a chance. Towards the end, it got
away from us and we ended up losing the game by double digits, over 20, so
that was really disappointing. But for most of the game, we always thought we
had a chance to make a run and get back in the game.  
  
Q. You guys have a couple more days until Selection Sunday. What's that
going to be like, just waiting? You're kind of in that tenuous spot; are you
in, are you not? What do you anticipate that being like?  
DEANDRE MATHIEU: We just hope we can get a chance to get in the tournament,
and we're going to work hard. Regardless of whether we're playing in the NIT
next week or the NCAA Tournament, we're going to work hard and try to make a
run regardless.  
JOEY KING: Yeah, depending on whatever tournament we get in, we're just going
to go home, continue to get better, and just look to make a run in whichever
tournament that we play in.  
  
Q. Coach, just going into the game, can you talk about just your team's
mindset? Did you feel like ‑‑ I know in the past you kind of noticed that
maybe they were pressing a little bit, the pressure got to them a little bit?
  
COACH PITINO: No, I thought we were getting good looks, especially early. I
thought we were getting really good looks. Things just weren't rolling our way
at the beginning, and then it just kind of snowballed a little bit.  
But I thought we were getting good looks, it's just they weren't going our way
at the beginning.  
  
Q. Coach, basketball has been such a part of your life, and you've seen a
lot of different experiences on a Selection Sunday. For the next 48 hours,
kind of give us a sense of what your mindset is going to be and what's going
to be going through your mind.  
COACH PITINO: Well, I think the first thing that I'm going to want to do is,
I'm going to want to watch this game and kind of clean up some of the mistakes
that we made. Because we're always trying to get better, more than anything,
offensively, defensively. So we'll correct all those mistakes, give them a
little time off, and then regroup.  
Listen, I hope we get into the NCAA Tournament. I feel that we played one of
the best schedules in the country, and that's normally what they want you to
do. But with that being said, whatever tournament we are in, I'm proud of
the‑‑ we're disappointed tonight, but I'm proud of how hard these guys have
played this whole year.  
  
Q. When Andre and Austin are struggling offensively like they did tonight,
does the team feel that? Do you think that the team ‑‑  
COACH PITINO: How could they not? It's difficult. Those are our two or three
main guys, and Austin has been really scoring the ball at a high level. I
thought Andre was getting good looks, just wasn't falling his way.  
You've got to give them credit; they certainly are a very, very good team. But
certainly it's always tough when those guys don't make shots, when they go 3
for 20.  
  
Q. Obviously, all Wisconsin starters can score, but how much harder is it
when they have guys coming off the bench having production like they did
tonight?  
COACH PITINO: They're a really good team, really good team top to bottom. They
don't beat themselves. They're really talented. They have a couple guys on the
roster who are potential NBA players. They've got good young talent. They make
you pay when you make a mistake, so they've got an opportunity if they win
this thing to potentially be a 1 seed. They knew they were a very good team,
and we had a lot of respect for them.  
  
Q. When Austin Hollins was going through his struggles and overcame that,
have you noticed anything with Andre the past couple games that caused him to
have a tournament like this?  
COACH PITINO: Tonight was different, I think, than the last game. He just
wasn't making shots today. I'm going to have to go back and look and see if
they were good shots or bad shots. But 2 for 14 is extremely, extremely rare
for Andre Hollins.  
  
Q. You've talked already about thinking how the team has overachieved
already, just based on where they finished in the Big Ten and their record,
but is it disappointing because you have shown sparks this season to finish
this way?  
COACH PITINO: Yeah, I mean, when you lose, you're always disappointed. But
we've got great respect for Wisconsin. They're a very good team.  
So I think we've all got to clear our heads a little bit, take a step back,
certainly focus on the mistakes that we made because we are playing next week.
Hopefully, it's in the NCAA, who knows? But we are going to play next week.
And wherever we play and whatever tournament we play in and whoever we play,
we're going to hope to win because we're fortunate to be able to play this
game. We're lucky, and our guys enjoy it, they love it. I enjoy coaching it,
so I'm not going to take that for granted.  
  
Q. It looked like you and Coach Ryan had some words in the post ‑game
handshake. I might already know the answer to that, but can you shed any light
on that?   
COACH PITINO: No.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2014

  

### [Amedeo Della Valle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26713)

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

### [Shannon Scott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25236)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  71  
Nebraska  67

  
COACH MATTA: I told our guys at halftime, I said, Look, with the nine
turnovers we had, why don't we just go out and give them the ball nine times
and let them try to score. And they took me literally, so we were down 18
points.  
But I'll tell you what, I'm very proud of these guys and the effort that they
put forth. They were thinking the game at a level down the stretch that we
needed to be thinking the game all the way through. Proud of these two guys
here. Shannon's first half was not good, challenged him at halftime. He did a
great job. Amedeo plays with no ego. He just plays with a love for the game,
and just did a tremendous job for us, and his defensive presence was as good‑‑
it was the difference in the game, to be honest with you.  
Like I said, we fought, we clawed, and found a way to win the basketball game.  
  
Q. When you're down 18 in the second half, what are you thinking? How are
you going to get back in it?  
SHANNON SCOTT: We know there's no 20‑point baskets, so we've got to take every
possession one at a time. We've got to get a stop. And once we started doing
that, we really got pride in our offense, and that really got us going.  
AMEDEO DELLA VALLE: Yeah, I think we played with more energy when we saw that
we were actually down 18, and we started picking up full court. They turned
the ball over a couple times, and with that we got our confidence back, and we
kept going.  
  
Q. Amedeo, was this your best moment in a Buckeye uniform?  
AMEDEO DELLA VALLE: Probably, yeah. I think the best moment was when I decided
to come here, when I committed here. But, definitely, one of the toughest
games for me, but I'm glad we came out with the win.  
  
Q. Amedeo, you missed those two free throws with, whatever, 5:40 or
something to go. And then you come down the stretch and they fouled you and
you made four. Can you just ‑‑ was there any thought to the missed free
throws, and did you just put that behind you, or what happened?   
AMEDEO DELLA VALLE: Yeah, I think I didn't release the ball well at all on my
first two free throws. And to be honest, I don't really like the ball. I hate
the ball.  
After I missed those two, a little pressure went off, so I was ready to knock
the other two free throws down and then the last two.  
  
Q. (No microphone)  
AMEDEO DELLA VALLE: Yeah, I got my misses off, my misses out of my body, and I
was able to make some.  
  
Q. Thoughts on Michigan as a basketball team?  
SHANNON SCOTT: We know they're a tough team. Back at our place, we had them
down early in the game, and they were more physical than us, had more
toughness than us, and they came out with a win. With that in the back of our
head, we know we've got to have our A game to win the game.  
  
Q. Thad, with the trouble you were having with their zone for a long time,
was that the reason you decided to go with Amedeo, thinking he could make
shots, or did you just put him in out of routine and see if he had anything to
give you?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, at that point we were looking for anything we could find,
just in terms of finishing and‑‑ we opened up the second half and we had three
fouls in two minutes and TEN seconds, and we missed four straight free throws.
You know, just‑‑ Aaron missed a lay‑up, Trey missed an attempt to dunk, and it
was like, my gosh. They were down there making the plays, and yeah, so when we
inserted Amedeo, it was just like, Hey, I told him, just give us something out
there. The biggest thing, like I say, I know he had 12 points, but his defense
was incredible: Three blocked shots, two steals. Wow, was he good.  
  
Q. You're 20 ‑5 in Big Ten tournaments since you've been at Ohio State. Do
you prepare the team different when you come into March? Is there anything
different you do compared to the regular season?   
COACH MATTA: Yeah, we do a lot of things‑‑ no, we stay the same course. I
think in this tournament, as you saw, players make plays. Even for Nebraska,
some of the plays those guys made were, wow.  
But I think that you hope, at this point of the season, all the work you've
done dating back to this year, September 28th, it can come into fruition. You
see it across the country. There's been a lot of ups and downs in these
tournaments. But in terms of different meetings or different film sessions or
different pregame talks, it's basically the same.  
  
Q. Thad, Amedeo had a pretty good game against Nebraska the first time he
played. Is that just a coincidence?  
COACH MATTA: You know, as I went back last night and watched the game, I was
saying to myself, Hey, if we can get Amedeo going, and even out there he had a
decent game. He had some great looks that didn't go down for him.  
Yeah, I don't know, but the timing was perfect today, that's for sure.  
  
Q. I would say most coaches would have probably sat LaQuinton for a little
bit after he got his T. Did you put him back out there because he might be the
only guy that could make some shots for you?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, I'll be honest, I didn't see. I got blocked on what
happened. He said he got hit in the face on the drive. We're working with him
on that.  
But yeah, he definitely played at a high level today.  
  
Q. Amedeo, at one point, smacked the ball out of the hand of an inbounder. I
don't know what your reaction was to that, but is that kind of thing
acceptable because of his fire, or does that say anything about him? What was
going on there?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, what I saw‑‑ I literally started laughing when I saw it
because that was his Euro style there. I think he thought they were going to
quick inbounds and he just knocked it out of the guy's hands. It was just a
warning, and we told our guys not to do it again. He said, Yeah, I did it. Not
a big deal.  
  
Q. 47 fouls in the game; tough to get into a flow with that many fouls?  
COACH MATTA: Yes, but fortunately for us, like I said, the way we started the
second half was just‑‑ that's not a‑‑ we don't foul a lot. I think we're
pretty high up in the country in not fouling. I took the time‑out when Shannon
got the hand check out there with 3:03 to go or whatever saying, Hey, we don't
want to commit those. Aaron had a couple down the stretch that we‑‑ those are
the ones we don't want to pick up if at all possible.  
  
Q. You've had a few rallies at Ohio State since you've been here. I mean,
Xavier in the NCAA Tournament comes to mind. Is there anything that rivals
this one in your mind that you can think of at the moment?  
COACH MATTA: You know, obviously, the Notre Dame game this year was down eight
with a minute to go. What were we, down 18 with 10 to go today? This one was
probably‑‑ the stakes were high on this one. Now, you're going to make me
think all the way‑‑ but no, this one is definitely up there, no question about
it.  
Like I say, because I think we were playing a great basketball team and a team
that, gosh, I hope we don't see them in the NCAA Tournament; that's for sure.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  67  
Northwestern  51

  
COACH IZZO: Well, I'm just proud of the way we played defensively. I thought
Gary, Zel, and Brandon kind of led the charge. So did Keith Appling. It was
nice to see him back kind of like the way he was. And I thought B.J. had some
tip‑ins and some loose balls and we got some things because of his activeness.
I'd say this is the best he's played in a long, long time. If you looked at
what we had him doing defensively, we had him switching, we had him working on
Crawford, who I just love the guy. He's a good player.  
I just thought our overall defense until the last seven minutes was
exceptional. We got some breaks, got it out, and considering we did all that
without Adreian. They did a good job on him, but he was in so much foul
trouble. So happy, but it's only one win.  
  
Q. What's the importance of having a feel good game as you guys try to get
this stretch going in the postseason?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: It's definitely important for us just to get this win, this
key win tonight. Just to see us happy again as a team and just playing good as
a team. And like Coach said, we've got Keith coming back and different guys
rotating in, so this win was definitely needed for tonight.  
GARY HARRIS: It was just good to be out there having fun. We placed some
emphasis on it in practice this week, to improve our defense and our
communication, and I feel like we placed a lot of energy on defense and that
carried over to the offensive end. We were just playing how we played earlier
in the season, which was good for us.  
  
Q. Brandon, you talked about Keith. There's been mention of Keith being
back, but tonight did you have a different feeling? I think you've been pretty
active since you've been back. Did it feel different at the start?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yeah, I definitely felt different out there, and like Coach
said, when you work on things, you just see results. I felt good out there,
and my teammates have been telling me in practice we need more out of you. We
just need you running, bringing energy, and just crashing the boards, and
that's what I did tonight. I stayed solid and didn't rush anything, and it
turned out good.  
  
Q. Gary, talk about coming back to Indianapolis and playing basketball. Any
thoughts about going out there in familiar surroundings?  
GARY HARRIS: It's fun. Last time I played in this arena, it was for the
Indiana All‑Stars when we beat Kentucky. You know, I've had good memories in
this gym, and it's always good when you can come home. I love coming home.  
  
Q. You guys obviously had a clear depth advantage. Was it just a huge
initiative to push the ball up the floor and tire them out?  
COACH IZZO: Well, it was a huge initiative at the beginning of the week. And
in all honesty, conventional wisdom would think you're probably going to play
Iowa, so it really doesn't matter who we played, we wanted to do that. And
then last night when things changed, we thought that was one of the advantages
for us is ‑‑ when you play a game, there's an advantage for that team the next
game because you shot on the floor. We never did that, all those things.
There's an advantage to us, especially when your team doesn't have as much
depth.  
Chris did a heck of a job with that team. When they lost Cobb, he's a great
player and it made it harder for Crawford to do everything himself. We thought
pushing the ball and crashing the boards were two things that we needed to do.
We did a decent job until the last five, six minutes, we kind of gave up some
shots. But other than that, I thought we played pretty well, and we pushed it
pretty well.  
  
Q. Tom, how happy were you to see Branden start to take that mid ‑range shot
that's always seemed to be open for him the last two or three years?   
COACH IZZO: You know, it's kind of strange, I told him God might have taken
his hand away, but he gave him a jump shot. He's actually been shooting the
ball so much better since he's come back, it kind of reminds me of my golf
game. When you come back and you're just concentrating, you do it real well
early. And I think he's concentrating harder on the form of his shot because
everything is not perfect, and it's helped him.  
Don't kid yourself; the difference in Branden was his energy and his defense.
And then he made things happen on the break, and he did hit a couple nice
shots. But I think he felt better about himself because he did other things
better. He was a big key. I mean, he was switching, talking, he was covering
up for people. I think that was one of the best games Branden has played here.  
  
Q. Hope you have another golf analogy for Drew Crawford. You've been full of
praise over the years. What did you see from him in the second half?  
COACH IZZO: He's one of those kids in the league that it's a joy to go against
him because you know he's bringing it every night. And I think when he lost
his running mate, it made it a little harder. If you talk to the kid at all,
he could have jumped ship last year. A lot of people would have tried to pick
him up, and he didn't. It was good for Chris and it was good for the
Northwestern program. It was good for the Big Ten to have him back, and it
kind of shows you what a quality kid he is.  
I don't know how a guy could be that good of a kid when his dad is an
official. I don't know how that's possible, but he is (laughter).  
  
Q. You talked about, before the game, kind of getting this team regenerated
again and getting it focused. How do you think they did that tonight?  
COACH IZZO: Well, guys, I mean, let's not kid ourselves; we are going to be a
work in progress with every game we play. I mean, we still have our moments,
and I thought we had a couple of crazy turnovers. I thought‑‑ we're doing a
little better job of playing the kind of defense we want because we're back
switching some things and doing some things, but it's one game. We played a
couple good games now, one average game, and one poor game in the four that
we've had everybody back. So, are we making progress? Yeah, we are. But
tomorrow will be a good test to see where we are.  
  
Q. Going back to talking about Crawford, you guys embraced for a while at
the end of the game there. What did you tell him?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I just said, Hey, you've had a hell of a career, and I'm
really proud of you. I'm glad you stayed. I told him that. I think that kid
could play some basketball beyond college, I really do. Wherever it is, I
said, if I can ever be of any help, call me.  
  
Q. We saw two suffocating defenses in the quarterfinals tonight. Tomorrow is
it roll the sleeves up and get bloody?  
COACH IZZO: Yeah, yeah, it's an old‑fashioned fist fight. That's what
Wisconsin‑Michigan State have been like. It's kind of strange, though, because
we've almost led the league in three‑point shooting, and they were so good
early, and then they fell off. Now Brust is hitting threes. They've got more
guys hitting threes again.  
So it's kind of a strange‑‑ when you look back at this incredible match‑up
that it's been for ten years, really, we've won our share, and then they sure
did win their share. It's kind of become where we're both still pretty good
defensively, but we both are relying on the three‑point shot a little bit
more. I don't see that happening tomorrow, although I think it's going to be
old‑fashioned game, and it should be fun.  
  
Q. In the four games you've had everyone back healthy, have you seen kind of
a steady progress, or has it been kind of like a stock market, kin of an up
‑and‑down chart kind of thing?  
COACH IZZO: Yeah, we've been more of a stock market up‑and‑down to be honest
with you. I think the biggest key tonight was Keith. Your quarterback has got
to play well, and I thought he pushed it better. You could still see, though,
where he comes in and used to make those moves and just go around a guy and
get it up, and he just is‑‑ just hasn't done it in so long that he's not as
comfortable. But he did push it. We begged him to push it all the time. He did
guard very well. That's the old Keith.  
So I think that is the biggest key. Branden, yes. A.P., we really didn't get
much out of A.P., but he'll be there tomorrow. I'm not worried about A.P.  
I think if I had to look at it over the four games, where have I seen a little
bit more improvement? The Iowa game, it was Keith that went down a little bit
and made some turnovers and that in the Ohio State game, and tonight again he
did some good things. We're making some progress.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  67  
Northwestern ‑ 51

  
COACH COLLINS: Well, congratulations to Michigan State. I thought they played
very well, especially in the first half. I thought their speed and their
intensity, them knowing that we played such a hard‑fought game last night, I
thought they did exactly what they needed to do by coming out with amazing
energy and defensive intensity, and it got us on our heels a little bit early.
I thought they played well.  
Certainly, the two facets that they really hurt us with were the points off
our turnovers and then their second‑chance points, which is what they do
really well. They do that to a lot of teams.  
I'm really proud of my team. We emptied the tank last night in our game
against Iowa, got a big‑time win for us. It was a huge win for our program.
Had to come back and play, arguably, the best program in this conference. It's
been for a long, long time, incredibly well‑coached, great talent. We fought
till the end. We got down, and I think these guys showed who they were even
until the end. We got down 20‑plus points, and with a minute and change to go,
it was a 13‑point game and we had the ball. Where a lot of teams ‑‑ when
you're real tired like that, a lot of teams, you can just mail it in the last
eight minutes or the last ten minutes and have had enough.  
We've never been that way all year long, and this is a‑‑ Drew obviously being
here, I think tonight he became the second all‑time leading scorer in our
program's history and will no doubt go down as one of the all‑time greats in
our program. I'm just sad I only had a chance to coach him for one year. He's
a special guy.  
As we move forward, we're going to constantly talk about what he brought every
day as we continue to get better, and as we continue to build our program.
He's laid an amazing foundation for the future of this program.  
  
Q. Drew, those moments when Coach took you out for the final time, and you
were hugging some of your teammates and walking off the floor. What was the
emotion like, in general?  
DREW CRAWFORD: Yeah, it's a tough feeling, you know, just because all the love
there is in this program. I care about Coach Collins so much, every single one
of my teammates, the entire coaching staff, down to the athletic trainers, our
sports performance coaches, our managers. Everybody just has showed me love
since I've been here, and it's been a fight, and we've done it together.  
You know, it's a tough feeling walking off, but I can say that I walked off
happy, feeling like I gave my all to this program. There's nowhere I'd rather
be for my last year, and looking back, I don't regret that decision at all,
and I love being a part of this team this year.  
  
Q. Drew, Izzo talked a little bit about the embrace and what you guys talked
about after the game. How much did that mean to you, and what exactly was
said?  
DREW CRAWFORD: You know, I just told him it's been an honor playing against
his teams for five years. Michigan State is an unbelievable program, and it's
always been fun playing against such great teams. So you know, it means a lot
that he's always kind of respected me as a player, so it was nice to send it
off that way.  
  
Q. Alex, if you wouldn't mind looking ahead to the future, what do you guys
need as a program to continue to rise in the Big Ten?  
ALEX OLAH: We just have to, I guess, look back at this year and see how hard
we worked to get where we are right now and take this team and take the
leadership from Drew and the seniors. But, yeah, just see how hard we worked
and work even harder and get even better and create a great program here at
Northwestern.  
  
Q. How much, in general, do you think fatigue was a factor tonight,
especially because you guys aren't the deepest of teams and having played a
tough game yesterday?  
DREW CRAWFORD: Yeah, it's tough, just because we had a late game last night,
and we played heavy minutes. But you know, we were prepared, and we were ready
to go for this game. We just tried to give all we had, continue to fight down
to the last minute. You get a little tired, but that's something that you have
to push through because you have to lean on your teammates, and they're going
to get you through that.  
ALEX OLAH: Yeah, obviously, it was really tough for us, like Drew said. We
just played late last night. But we did everything we could to rest up and get
treatment and everything to be ready for this game. Even though we were really
tired, our legs were real tired, we tried to give it all on the floor and
tried to leave the floor‑‑ whatever the result was, leave the floor with our
head up.  
  
Q. What have you learned from this year that you can take into next
season?  
COACH COLLINS: Big Ten is a good league. I've learned a lot. I mean, for me,
you can feel ready for something, you can know you're prepared for something,
but there's a lot of things you can only learn by going through them and going
through your own experiences. I'm really proud of the year we had. It was a
fun group of guys. I thought we maximized who we were. I was really down when
we lost JerShon Cobb because I thought we were really starting to get on the
verge of getting to know the team we had, and guys were playing well, the
confidence was there. And then when he went down, it was a big hit.  
Then we rallied at the end. We kept rallying, which it showed a lot about the
spirit we had and the group of guys. At the end, you always know you've got a
good group when the year is over and in the locker room everybody is
emotional. Because you're either emotional because you've won and you're at
the top of what you've worked for, or you're emotional because it's over and
you wanted to keep going on. And everybody in our locker room was emotional
because they love playing together. They love Drew and what he brought.  
You know, I'm not the most patient guy. I came into this year trying to win
every game and preparing our guys and trying to use our personnel the best we
could to put ourselves in a position to win. Sure, there's a lot of mistakes I
made; nobody is perfect, just like no player can play a perfect game. There's
a lot I can improve upon as a coach, and you can only do that through
experience.  
I thought my staff did a great job this year, and I really can look‑‑ we can
look at ourselves and say that we got the most out of our team. And I think,
as a coach, that's what you have to ask yourself at the end of the year. And
if you can say, yes, then you should be proud of that. Did I want to win more
games? Absolutely. But for us to win six games in the regular season, to win
one game here in the postseason‑‑ when I believe we weren't favored in any
game we played in the Big Ten‑‑ so that means we were predicted to lose every
game. So for us to win six in the regular season and one win in the postseason
and be playing tonight, I think it shows a lot about the guys we have in our
locker room and what we accomplished and how we maximized our personnel.  
I'm really proud of that, and we've got to keep moving forward. Every program
in this league is trying to build for something special. That's why the Big
Ten is the best league. There's not a bad program in our league, and everybody
aspires to be at the top. We aspire to be there, too. I feel the foundation
that was laid this year with our program, how hard we play, how we compete, I
think we earned a lot of people's respect with our effort, with our level of
play, and with the way our guys played this year.  
I'm very proud of that. We still have a long way to go. Our returning guys,
it's going to be a big summer for us to get stronger, to get more athletic, to
get more durable. Obviously, we'll be bringing in a lot of young players, and
our returning guys are going to have to take over the leadership mantle that
Drew was leaving, and it's a big void. He was an outstanding leader, and Drew
and I, our arms were locked all year long. And when a best player and a coach
get a relationship like that, it forms a really strong unit. And that's what
we had, and that's why we played so hard this year.  
  
Q. Along the lines of the future, if you wouldn't mind just talking a little
bit about, you've got five guys coming in at least; what are they going to
add, and offensively will they be able to add much? Are you looking at Vick as
a defensive presence?  
COACH COLLINS: I don't want to get too much into every guy right now. I think
you guys saw just from a sheer numbers standpoint, we need more players, and
I'm not talking about talented. We need more numbers. For us, we only dressed
eight scholarship guys tonight. When you're in the Big Ten, you have a game‑‑
we only played six last night and for the most part of tonight. You can't win
big. You need more numbers. We have to develop from within, and our young
guys‑‑ the thing that I feel good about is all the young guys coming into the
program, they're coming into a good culture.  
But I feel like we're adding guys that, not only are they talented players,
but they fit into what we're trying to build. They want to be in the gym. They
play with a chip on their shoulder. They want to be good, and they're winners.
I think they can all add to what we've already started this year. We're going
to have a core back‑‑ JerShon Cobb, obviously, he'll be back healthy, Alex
Olah, Tre Demps‑‑ those three guys being a main core with other veterans
coming back, Sobolewski, Taphorn, Lumpkin who played a lot. Those guys will
all be back.  
We've got a lot of guys who have got experience, and you've got to keep adding
and continue to get better, and that's what we plan to do.  
  
Q. You've obviously talked extensively about that bus ride home from that
first Iowa game and how you've changed the way you've played, and for lack of
a better word, kind of engrained this relentlessness into the program. Is that
kind of a blessing for the future because of guys who are going to be here
like Tre and Alex which in turn engrain that in the guys who are coming in?  
COACH COLLINS: I think it's a big thing. I think in order to get anywhere,
you've got to go through tough times, man. You've got to‑‑ nothing ever comes
easy. You've got to go through struggle, and you've got to find out what's
inside you. I think for each of those guys, when we went through our
struggles, when we lost games and people counted us out, we lost seven
straight when JerShon went down.  
We scored 32 points at home against Penn State, and people just left us for
dead. We go up to Purdue, win. We come here, everything I heard was it was a
total mismatch, and why would we even show up to play the game. We lost to
Iowa by 30 points.  
Our guys refused to hear that because we've gone through times like that
before during the year. We kept fighting, we kept playing, we kept preparing.
And I agree with what you're saying. You find out more about yourself when you
have to go through tough times, as a player, as a coach. You find out what
you've got inside you, man. Do you want to keep fighting? Do you want to dig
out or do you want to step aside?  
I think we've found some fighters, and that's what I like. Even to the final
buzzer tonight, we were down 20‑something points, it could have been so easy‑‑
our guys were dead during the huddles. It was hard for me to talk to them they
were gasping for air so much. What we talked about that last eight minutes is,
Look, no matter how tired we are, no matter what the score is, we're going to
finish this year the way we've played all year. We're going to finish this
year by fighting, and that's not going to change.  
As we add more players and as we continue to move forward and, hopefully, get
better as a program and better as a team, that quality will not change. We
will be a team that is a group of fighters. I feel strongly that we've earned
a lot of people's respect for that, and we need to carry that on going
forward.  
  
Q. When you first saw these guys practice at the beginning of the season,
offensively and defensively, what were you expecting to see and how did it end
up relative to that?  
COACH COLLINS: Well, probably from a numbers perspective, I was hoping we
would shoot a little better. It was a difficult transition because for them,
everything was different, and I give them a lot of credit. And it wasn't bad,
the way they did things wasn't bad. And it was very good. There was a lot of
wins, and they were very well coached, and they won, and they were successful
the way they played. But a transition was made, and we decided to go in a new
direction.  
The thing that I was happy about, you know, I came into the year, I felt good
that we were going to have a veteran perimeter, guys that had played a lot of
minutes, even though Cobb was out the whole year and Crawford was out the
whole year, they had experience. Dave was coming back as a two‑year starter.
Tre had had a lot of experience.  
Alex was a big unknown. I knew he was a big guy. Initially, I saw a lot of
promise in him, but I saw a kid that was not very confident in himself when I
first got here. But I saw a lot of ability, I saw size, I saw touch, I saw a
look in his eye that he really wanted to be a good player. I mean, where Alex
Olah is right now to where he was, there's no more improved player in our
conference, and he's just a sophomore.  
I think Tre Demps is a much improved player. I think JerShon got a lot better
as the year went on. I thought we improved in a lot of ways, and I thought our
guys kind of adjusted, and I adjusted to them. Some of the things we adapted
maybe were a little bit more comfortable to the way they did things in the
past, so that everything wasn't just such a stark change and a stark
difference. There had to be some give and take.  
I had to understand them, they had to understand me, and we kind of found a
happy medium. And we figured out and we had a great stretch of games and we
won. And then JerShon got hurt, and we had to kind of reinvent ourselves
again, and we finished strong.  
There's a lot to build on. We've improved in a lot of ways. We still have a
long ways to go. I know that. But I also am not going to lose sight‑‑ I'm not
going to lose sight of a lot of the good that came out of this year and a lot
of the progress that was made. Sometimes you might look at a record and it
says 14‑19\. I'm looking at all the small wins we got along the way, the
practice habits we gained, the way we approached our preparation, the
leadership that was built, the improvement that was made in the players, the
culture that was built.  
In order to do something really special, you've got to lay that foundation,
and it might not manifest itself right away into 20 wins, 25 wins, but we
still won. We still won, and we still did a lot of good things with this
group, and for that I'm really proud.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit more about the way you've seen Tre Demps
improve throughout the season?  
COACH COLLINS: Well, I think Tre went from a guy‑‑ we created a great role for
him, being that sixth man. I think Tre is a scorer, and sometimes he might get
a bad rap for the fact that he looks for his‑‑ I like the fact that he's
aggressive and he's hungry. It all comes from a good place.  
Tre is probably the guy in our program who's in the gym the most. He's in
there at night. He comes in before class, after class. He wants to get better.
He's hungry to improve. I thought he got a lot better with his decision
making. He became a better rebounder. He got seven rebounds tonight. I think
he had six last night, five assists. He got better with the ball, making plays
for other guys.  
And Tre won us a lot of games, guys. Tre was our closer this year. We got down
to the end of games, he won the Illinois game for us at home, he won the game
at Indiana, he hit the big shot at Minnesota. You go down the line, and our
big wins, at the end of games, that kid has got guts. I love the fact he's on
our team. I think he's going to have two really good years. JerShon going down
kind of affected him because it put the ball in his hands a little bit more as
a point guard, and that's not really what he is. He's a combo guard who can
score and attack, and he was at his best kind of in that role we had him in.
But he finished the year strong doing a little bit different things, and I
think having to be a point guard for us at the end will really help him for
his development for next year as he continues to build.  
A lot of good things. I'm sad that the season is over. I wanted to keep
playing. Our guys wanted to keep playing. It just wasn't in it for us tonight.
Michigan State is really good, and as you guys know, our gas tank was on E,
and we tried to do what we could, it just wasn't there.  
I appreciate you guys. I know we're done. Appreciate you guys covering us this
year, and look forward to a really bright future for our program. Thank you.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Wisconsin  83  
Minnesota ‑ 57

  
COACH RYAN: Well, I'm just proud of our guys to have handled a couple runs
that Minnesota made. We know they can score points in a hurry. It's not like
we relaxed. But I give our guys a lot of credit for toughening up and getting
the help from the bench. And they played off of each other pretty well, and we
played it all the way through.  
The guys that came in at the end that very rarely get any time, they made hard
cuts, they played the game and respected the game, and I thought we did that
for 40 minutes. I thought we did a pretty good job of going to our strengths.  
  
Q. What does it mean to you to put together that kind of performance and put
your team through this tournament?  
BEN BRUST: As long as we get the win, that's all that matters now in March.
Just came out and some things started falling and then just tried to play with
energy throughout the whole game and come up with a couple loose balls. Didn't
get one of them that I can remember, but just tried to play with energy all
the time, get my guys going. And I think Nigel did a great job coming off the
bench, so did Bronson in the first half. He hit some timely threes there to
get our lead back and then we kind of just weathered the storm from all their
runs and went from there.  
  
Q. Nigel, you and Bronson have been put in some situations where you've been
able to play a lot as freshmen this year. Why do you think the two of you have
been so successful, and at this point do you feel like you're even a first
year player anymore?  
NIGEL HAYES: That's all credit to Coach Ryan and the coaching staff. They do a
great job of preparing us for this as well as upperclassmen, such as Ben Brust
right here next to me. They do a great job of talking to us and explaining to
us how situations would be for when we get out there and see that situation,
we're already prepared to handle it. I think we just‑‑ with the preparation
we've been given, I feel like we go out there and execute and do pretty well.  
  
Q. Nigel, it looked like they guarded you with three guys, first Walker,
then Eliason, and then King at one time. Did you recognize that you had some
quickness advantage, especially over the first two guys, that you could take
advantage of?  
NIGEL HAYES: I did. That's why‑‑ well, really I was just trying to get the
ball to Ben. Ben was shooting the ball pretty well, so if I did have the
opportunity to take my own shot, I was trying to make sure that I made it
because Ben makes his. He's looking at the sheet. Josh always makes his shot.
Bronson was five for five, so I was just trying to be like those three, and I
feel like I did pretty well. Not as good as them, but I have work to do, and
I'll try and do better next game.  
  
Q. Ben, what does that warm ‑up shirt mean to you?   
BEN BRUST: Just going out there, playing hard and trying to do things to help
make the team successful. We got a bunch of guys who try and do that, and it
was a good win today. But we know that we've got to get rest now and get ready
for the next opponent, whoever that is.  
NIGEL HAYES: If I could elaborate on that, in all seriousness right now, the
epitome of the Badger would be Ben and Josh. You know, they always hustling.
They never take plays off. As Coach Ryan says, they put their face on the ball
110 percent, grinding it out, no easy possessions for the other team. I feel
like when all of us, we put games together like that, like we did today, we
were almost there, we get the results that we got today.  
  
Q. Ben, did the guards think that if you got the ball to Nigel he had some
mismatches to take advantage of?  
BEN BRUST: That's the great part about Nigel. He's got quick enough feet to
get by guys and he can step out when guys are playing back on him, so he's the
ultimate mismatch. Great footwork, great decision‑making, and starting to
knock it down at the line which makes him a dual threat at all times. It's
always good to touch the post when you've got guys doing good things with it.  
NIGEL HAYES: Ben makes my job easier. When you're surrounded by shooters such
as Ben, Josh, Sam, Frank, Bronson, Trae, you know, it makes the inside job a
little easier. Guys can't double. So I give credit to this superb shooter
right here. He's well on his way to breaking records and everything, and I
just want my children to be like him.  
  
Q. Ben, Bronson and Sam talked about, during the week, being more
aggressive, and it looked like Sam tried to set that tone early, and then
Bronson attacked, as well. Did you guys notice that when they were in the
game?  
BEN BRUST: I think they did a lot of the same things that they've been doing,
but they did a good job of being aggressive and being smart with what they
were doing. They made smart plays when they were in there, and Sam finished
well and Bronson created some good shots for himself and knocked them down. It
kind of just spreads through all of us. That's the good thing about the group
of guys that I'm with. You never know who's going to step up next, and that
helps.  
  
Q. We talked about Nigel and Bronson a lot this year with good reason, but
how satisfying is it for you as a coach to have two freshmen you know you can
rely on in big games like today?  
COACH RYAN: Well, this is one example. This is one game, so I won't get
carried away. I mean, they've learned things through trial and error. They
happened to fall into place today with the shots going down, but, more
importantly, on the defensive end I thought the two of them did a really good
job of some things that they're still working on and learning because of the
lack of possessions. Some of our guys have been through a lot more possessions
than others.  
So they're improving, and that's what we like to see. I don't know how often
you can have two freshmen have that kind of night shooting‑wise, but I'm
impressed with what they were doing defensively.  
  
Q. You guys usually have a very well balanced scoring sheet, but tonight Ben
with 29 points. What do you think about his performance overall?  
COACH RYAN: You know, he didn't force anything, so sometimes you can look at a
stat sheet and say, well, a guy took a lot of shots or whatever, and the seven
that he missed, he missed six threes, how many of them were forced? I didn't
see any forced. I thought he did a good job.  
Plus he draws attention when he cuts. That one rim run he had for the lay‑up,
guys find him. He's a hard match‑up for some guys defensively because of the
way he moves.  
  
Q. You guys lost your last game to Nebraska, you lost earlier at Minnesota.
You seem like the focus was to get off to a good start tonight. Do you think
you guys did that?  
COACH RYAN: Well, the stats will tell you that. Just go play by play. But
we've gotten off to good starts in some of the games where we've taken bumps,
so it's not a total indicator. But you certainly would like to get on the
right track as soon as you can.  
We've been ahead or got off to good starts in some other ones that we've taken
bumps in, so I can't say that it's universal.  
  
Q. Having a guy like Ben, a senior leader and somebody who's been through so
many big games, what will that mean for a fairly young team going through the
month of March and so many important games here?  
COACH RYAN: I only know of one game, and that's tomorrow's. How important is
that? That's our next 40 minutes, and that will be a challenge, let alone any
other games after that. But we have the right now. We've gained the right to
play another 40 minutes in Indianapolis in the Big Ten Tournament. That's all
this game meant right now.  
They're looking forward to another 40 minutes.  
  
Q. With Villanova getting beat yesterday, you guys have been mentioned as a
possible 1 seed. I just want to know your thoughts about that.  
COACH RYAN: I never answer anything about seeds. Sunflower seeds, when I used
to play baseball, I chewed them. That's the only seeds I know anything about.  
Really, I've never answered any of those questions because I really wouldn't
know what to say.  
  
Q. I was trying to understand how you went through that funk because you
looked so methodical tonight. You took a bubble team systematically apart. Did
you learn something from your funk awhile back? Because I've heard people tell
me that you guys have been rolling ever since.  
COACH RYAN: Well, we've had some ups, we've had some downs. Fortunately more
ups. It's not like making a few shots doesn't cure some things during the
course of a game. I think in a couple of those games, we shoot anywhere near
or within ten points of our three‑point shooting percentage, we come away with
two on the left‑hand side, maybe three.  
But you know how many teams out there are going, Boy, if we just would have
made shots? So the other team's defense had something to do with it. The type
of shots we're getting might have something to do with it, but there were two
or three games there where you go to a shot chart. This is what most coaches
that I know do, and find out if they were the same shots that people had been
getting when you were on the streak the other way. They're not far off. It's
not like we were digressing to something that wasn't us.  
Defensively, a half step on three, four, five possessions at key points in
games, and you get behind, and that's all it takes in this game. That's why
the Big Ten race was so hard to figure out. Not only was that happening to us,
it was happening to other teams in the league, and it was happening to other
teams in the nation. We weren't the only ones by far to go through a period of
losing five out of six, four out of five. I mean, look across the country; I
have never seen it like that. Maybe you guys have.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2014

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Jordan Morgan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26711)

### [Glenn Robinson, III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25143)

### [Nik Stauskas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24438)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan  64  
Illinois ‑ 63

  
COACH BEILEIN: Well, we're thrilled to get that win because as you can see, as
Illinois has shown in their last six games, how well the program has played
after a tough January. To win at Michigan State, to win at Iowa, and to win at
Minnesota in that stretch shows you how good they are. So we had a lot of
respect for them coming in. They proved how good they were, and, fortunately,
we got some good bounces around the basket to finish the game.  
  
Q. Nick, can you talk us through that last look and kind of what your read
was giving it to Jordan?  
NIK STAUSKAS: I just came off a high ball screen. I was looking to be
aggressive, and I raised up to shoot, and the guy guarding me was still
chasing me, and the big came up to me, too, and J‑Mo rolled down the lane and
he was wide open. I hit him with the ball and he laid it in.  
  
Q. For Jordan, if you could go through that play, too, and kind of the
concept of always being ready when you're not a main offensive option?  
JORDAN MORGAN: Well, coming out of time‑out, Nick told me he was going to
shoot it regardless, so I wasn't necessarily ready for the pass. But I don't
know, just watching the shot, there's been times in the past where they've
passed that, and we weren't ready because they thought they were going to
shoot. So just kind of watching the play, and then as far as catching it, I
just put it on the rim and got a nice roll.  
  
Q. Nick, you talked about the importance of going to the postseason playing
your best basketball then. How close or how far do you think you are from
Michigan playing their best basketball at this time?  
NIK STAUSKAS: You know, I think we're coming along pretty well. I think we
still have some strides to make defensively. I think that's where we're really
going to be at our best once we start locking down defensively. But I think
offensively we've been doing a pretty good job so far. Guys are getting better
at communicating on defense, getting in the gaps and all that kind of stuff.
We're confident in our abilities, and, I think, going forward we're only going
to keep getting better.  
  
Q. Nick, Glenn, talk about the zone that they played and toward the end of
that second half, it seemed to give you guys some problems. Was there
something you guys didn't see on film?  
GLENN ROBINSON: They were playing like a 2‑3 zone and it was really high, so
they know we have a lot of shooters on our team, so they were kind of taking
that away. We tried to hit the middle, and once we did that we got a lot of
open looks, but we weren't hitting jump shots today like we normally do. In
the first game we knocked down a lot of threes.  
NIK STAUSKAS: Pretty much what Glenn said. I think we were getting some pretty
good looks in the zone. They were doing a really good job, though. They were
making it tough for us at the end of the shot clock. We were getting some
pretty good looks, and I think this time around we just weren't making the
shots we normally make.  
  
Q. What was going through you guys' mind when Illinois started mounting that
huge run and was starting to get back in the game?  
JORDAN MORGAN: It was tough because they had us in a‑‑ they were in the bonus,
and so they were just attacking the rim, and it was hard for us to necessarily
just stay in front without fouling. So that made it tough defensively. And,
then, offensively we went through that stretch where shots just weren't
falling for us, and I think it kind of just builds, so we just kind of needed
to break out of that.  
  
Q. Jordan mentioned the huddle in there and drawing it up. Can you take us
through what you wanted and what you saw?  
COACH BEILEIN: Well, the difficulty was going to be whether they were going to
be in zone or man, so we tried to call a play that works against both, and we
still had timeouts left. If we didn't like what we saw coming up, I was going
to use another time‑out maybe at the 11, 10‑second mark. But they came out in
man, and so we were just running something to get Nick the ball, and then get
him some action, and then he just read the floor. If he shot it, fine. If he
found somebody else, fine. We had Glenn, we had Caris and we had Derek‑‑ or
Spike, all coming open at the same time, as well.  
  
Q. Jordan mentioned that Nick said he was going to take the shot regardless.
Is that kind of a step in the right direction for him to kind of take the load
on his shoulders, but at the same time be wise enough to make the right
read?  
COACH BEILEIN: Yeah, I don't know if that's good or bad. He doesn't really
predetermine like that, but I want him to think that way, thinking I'm going
to shoot it in. I don't want him to go off that screen looking to pass and
being wide open. So he had the right‑‑ he came off, and then looking to
score‑‑ if he doesn't have his eyes on the rim, he doesn't get double
coverage, and then Jordan is not wide open.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that defense, as well. Was it kind of a 3 ‑2 that they
played a little bit earlier in the second half?  
COACH BEILEIN: No, it was all 2‑3 zone. They ran some full court action just
to slow us down. I'll have to look at the quality of our shot a little bit.
Nick went two for ten in the game and‑‑ I think those were the best shots he
got were against the zone. He didn't knock them down, but we had people knock
down big ones early in the second half between Spike, Glenn Robinson, Derrick
Walton, but we're going to have to make some of those because they were really
packed in there.  
  
Q. I want to ask you about being ready in that situation. Even Horford when
he was in the game with hands up ready, just in case he was going to get the
ball and kind of coaching that mentality?  
COACH BEILEIN: We do a drill, probably every other day, that I saw from a team
we played in the NCAA Tournament. It's just a guy running to the rim with his
head turned looking. It's a lot of action, a screen and roll play, but you
don't know what's happening. You've got to be able to catch it here, catch it
here, catch it with balance and put it in.  
I'm telling you‑‑ I probably exaggerate, 10,000 times‑‑ at least 2,000 times
in five years Jordan Morgan has run that same drill. There's a bag hit him,
you still got to catch it in a crowd and keep it up and dunk it if he can. He
said he wanted to add a little drama to the game, so he decided to put it up
on the rim.  
But he's practiced that very often.  
  
Q. There are six Indiana kids on your roster. How important has the state
been to the recent success of the program?  
COACH BEILEIN: Well, I think it's been‑‑ if you look at the footprint of the
Big Ten, there's some very good players who grew up in this environment
watching these games, so we're looking anywhere within that footprint. And we
have a lot of respect for the coaching in a lot of states because we have guys
from Ohio, we have guys from Michigan, we have Illinois and Indiana. It just
so happened during this little run of recruiting, they sort of all came in
together a little bit.  
It is important, and we're going to continue to recruit in that state as well
as the others within the Big Ten, and anywhere nationally where we find the
right fit.  
  
Q. I'm guessing you don't have a preference who you play tomorrow?  
COACH BEILEIN: Absolutely not, no. These are two really good teams. We've
played Nebraska at home, but we played Nebraska on the road and Ohio State on
the road. They're both really talented teams, or they wouldn't be playing
right now in this game. We'll watch a little bit of the game and see what we
can do.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2014

  

### [Tracy Abrams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25044)

### [John Groce](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20727)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan  64  
Illinois  63

  
COACH GROCE: Obviously we're disappointed. That one stings a little bit. When
you pour your heart and soul into something, you play as hard as our guys did
today, I thought our effort was great, I thought our attitude was off the
charts, and thought our execution for the most part was good.  
You know, we did a good job of taking care of the ball. If you'd have told me
before the game started that we were going to play with nine turnovers,
out‑rebound them, shoot a higher percentage, I probably would have taken it.
Just a bounce or two here or there. We were just talking back in the waiting
area there, obviously Tracy, we got the ball right where we wanted. Tracy has
made big plays for us all year, whether it's Missouri, whether it's
yesterday's performance, you know, his ability to lead and be vocal is a big
key to our team. I just told him it's not about that last play. There were
several other plays during the game.  
After the fact‑‑ I think Bill Belichick said it once and it's always kind of
helped me from a perspective standpoint as a coach ‑‑ that there's all kinds
of things that you can second‑guess after the fact. You can go back, I wish I
would have done this or I wish I would have done that. But decisions that are
made throughout the course of the game are discussed and they're educated
decisions. Most of the times those work, and to be honest with you,
occasionally they don't. I think if any coach was honest with you they would
tell you that. Just a play or two here late in the game, and we obviously had
an opportunity to get a big win today.  
Obviously, we have a lot of respect, certainly, for Michigan. They're a very
good basketball team and made a few plays down the stretch that enabled them
to win today, so we have great respect for them.  
But I'm really proud of our guys the way that they battled and the fact that
they executed our game plan much better certainly than we did just ten days
ago.  
I think you saw what I've been saying now for some time about our DNA, and who
we are, and who the guys are in our locker room as people, the way that they
responded in the last three games since playing them in Game 1 back in
Champaign.  
I'm not surprised. We've got great guys. I'm really proud of their effort, and
now we've just got to try to build on this and see if we can continue to keep
improving. But again, at the end of the day, it's just a play or two right
there. We were right there.  
Questions?  
  
Q. Obviously you guys are disappointed in the result, but it's such a
massive change from the last meeting with these guys. Did you do anything
differently in preparation, not just schematics, but even little things for
this game?  
TRACY ABRAMS: No, we did a better job of executing exactly what it was we
wanted to do. We actually was out there connecting and talking. That was a big
difference from the last game. We were out there communicating and connecting,
and it showed.  
  
Q. Tracy, when you go through that last shot, it was right there, and then
Coach said, it was really close ‑‑ what did you take away from that?   
TRACY ABRAMS: It's obviously an uncontested shot that I probably could make.
But at the end of the day, we obviously wanted to get that one in and we
wanted to win, but it came so close, like Coach said. There was a lot of other
plays that we can account back to that we could have did different or could
have got an extra rebound.  
Of course, we wanted to make it and got a little upset, but you've got to keep
moving on and keeping learning from those experiences.  
  
Q. You kind of stood there for a while after it, kind of in disbelief. What
was going through your mind?  
TRACY ABRAMS: Of course, I thought it was going to go in, and I thought we
were going to win and I had the utmost confidence. I wasn't shocked that we
lost, but shocked the shot didn't go in. But it is what it is.  
  
Q. Now that the regular season is over, what can you take from this and
bring into the postseason next year?  
COACH GROCE: Sure. Well, I think you can take a lot from it. Just for me, I'll
probably appreciate it in terms of what we've been through. We still have
opportunities, obviously, to participate in postseason at this juncture, so we
want to make sure that we finish our second year as strong as possible.  
But just when you look back from March 2012 to now, there's just so much
momentum, and these guys that were up here, as well as the guys in our locker
room, deserve a lot of credit for that, as do last year's seniors. That's two
groups in a row that, I think, certainly in the preseason and maybe even
throughout the middle of both seasons, that people counted like they're done.
And those guys kept battling and kept fighting. I think that's a reflection of
their character.  
Obviously our new building and the renovation of State Farm Center, the
recruiting classes, the momentum that we've had, I think that, beyond a shadow
of a doubt, we're headed in the right direction.  
It certainly is a process, and I've said from Day One, we're not going to take
any shortcuts. We're going to continue to grind and get a little bit better
and keep improving. Our team has done that. I think our program has done that,
and we're excited about where we're going.  
  
Q. You guys showed a lot of resilience today getting down by double figures,
kind of what the trademark of this team has been over the last two or three
weeks. Do you attribute that to the players' attitudes like you said
earlier?  
COACH GROCE: Yeah, no question. Great leadership from our captains, our
assistant coaches do a great job with our kids. We've got a great group to
work with. Even when we were struggling from a win‑loss perspective, they were
great to be around. These guys are a high‑character group. I think it's a big
reason why we've been able to play some really good basketball here late in
the year.  
  
Q. You had some success with your zone against them in the second half, and,
yet, when they went to the play with Morgan you were in man, I believe.  
COACH GROCE: Yep.  
  
Q. Can you talk me through that?  
COACH GROCE: I thought it was the best thing to do at that time, a little bit
like the Bill Belichick deal I was talking about earlier. Just like we
thought, they had changed defenses, out of timeouts. We made the decision
there, basically, Dustin and I kind of talked and decided not to call the
time‑out on the one possession where we got the difficult shot in front of the
bench. Because we wanted to play man‑to‑man knowing if we changed ‑‑ they had
done it the whole game, they changed to the 1‑3‑1\. And we actually had some
success against the 1‑3‑1, so it wasn't an easy decision.  
Obviously, if we score there, we're all saying, great decision not to call
time‑out, and that's kind of what I'm talking about. But we didn't score
there, so now it's like, okay, well, maybe you should have.  
You can second‑guess so many things throughout the course of a game. As long
as it's‑‑ I tell the staff all the time‑‑ as long as it's educated and it's
well thought out and there's a reason, we've got to go with it. Hindsight is
always 20/20 on decisions like that. You're right; now that I know that Morgan
scored that basket as it looked like it was going to roll off the rim, I would
have liked to have gone zone.  
It is what it is. Like Tracy said about the missed shot, I think that's part
of the game, and it can be frustrating, obviously, and that's why you're
disappointed. But one thing about our group is we've never been discouraged.
We've continued just to keep fighting and fighting and fighting, and we'll
learn from it the best we can.  
I can assure you those decisions were thought out, communicated, and we went
with what we thought was best at the time.  
  
Q. Following up on that, you guys did have a lot of success with the zone.
What went into the decision to play it, and how well did you execute it?  
COACH GROCE: Well, we've been really good in it here lately. I think we've
played it really well. Obviously most people‑‑ when you think about playing
Michigan, they made 16 threes last Tuesday‑‑ aren't going to think about, hey,
let's play them 40 minutes of zone. That takes some gumption to do that. But I
thought we had played it well, and I think they're such a rhythm team. They're
so good on offense. They're second in the country in offensive efficiency for
a reason. They execute as good as any team I've seen on film all year in the
half court.  
I thought at the time they were up by 13 we needed to throw them‑‑ it's the
analogy of a pitcher. We had been throwing them fast ball, could we throw them
a curve ball or a change‑up or a slider just to disrupt the rhythm. Did I know
for a fact when I made that change that it was going to be good two, three,
four, and I'd keep playing it? I'll be honest with you: No. It stuck, so we
ended up sticking with it, and I thought it was fairly effective for us down
the stretch.  
  
Q. What was working so well for you guys when you mounted that 19 ‑6 run to
come back and take the lead?   
COACH GROCE: Well, I thought we were getting stops, which was big, and I
thought guys were making some plays, made some big shots. We did go small. I
thought that was good for us there for a little bit, as well, with John Ekey
at the 5 and Malcolm Hill at the 4. We were trying to make some adjustments to
get ourselves‑‑ fight, scratch and claw back into the game, and our guys made
some plays.  
  
Q. Postseason plans, with such a young team, how important is it to keep
playing and have game experience?  
COACH GROCE: I think it's huge. I do. Obviously, your season gets an
opportunity to continue. You get to continue to work with your guys.
Especially our team, I think, has kind of been a work in progress all year.
Now they're starting to experience some fruits from that labor, and for us to
continue to work, to keep getting better, I think is important.  
Not everybody gets an opportunity to participate in postseason play. It's not
just for all 350‑plus teams. Hopefully, we get that opportunity and certainly
can make the most of it.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Devyn Roy Marble](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23400)

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

### [Jarrod Uthoff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26697)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Northwestern  67  
Iowa ‑ 62

  
Q. Can you guys put a finger on maybe what's been going wrong and causing
this late season slump that kind of bled over into today?  
DEVYN MARBLE: Can you repeat the question?  
  
Q. You guys have obviously been in a little bit of a late season slump here,
six out of seven. Can you put your finger on what's gone wrong?  
DEVYN MARBLE: Well, early in the season, we were defending a lot better. I
think we're giving up too many quality shots to opponents and they've been
making them, and everybody is a Division I player, so if you give them open
shots they're going to knock them down. I just think we have to work on our
communication and work on our rotations in and out of slots and stuff like
that.  
JARROD UTHOFF: He covered it. Defensive intensity. I think we need to bring it
more.  
  
Q. Roy, I just want to know what the players thought about the tee shirts
you guys have that say D MAC and what that meant for the Coach.  
DEVYN MARBLE: We created them. We had them come in the other day in practice.
We love Coach McCaffery and his family a lot. They've done a lot for all of
us. When one person is feeling down, we're all feeling down. He's family, and
we just want to know Coach McCaffery that we've got his back and that we'd be
here.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you guys are going through a very tough time, you in
particular. But the question I have is: I made this comment earlier about Ohio
State, I wondered after two victories against Purdue, how would they play
against a team that they clearly were better than, and they almost lost. You
guys blew out Northwestern two times this year. Was there any kind of letdown
coming into this where you want to win the tournament but maybe you didn't
look at Northwestern or your kids didn't look at them?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I really don't think that was the case. I think we have to
give more credit to this Northwestern team and how they played. I don't want
to say that we didn't take them seriously enough. We're thinking down the
road. We have great respect for Drew Crawford. Anybody that's scored 1900
points, he should have your full attention. I thought Olah over the last
month, one of the best ‑‑ or should say one of the most improved players in
the country.  
We know Kale Abrahamson can score the ball. Sobolewski has been banged up all
year. He's playing better, played well today. In this league you're playing a
team that has beaten people, and they made 11 threes. You know, you've got to
tip your hat to a team that shares the ball in a way to make 11 threes. They
weren't just dribbling down and shooting it. They were moving the ball and
running stuff, whether it's against man or zone, and finding each other. You
know, we out‑rebounded them. We didn't particularly turn it over a lot. We
were 0‑9 in the second half from three. It's hard. We were right there. We
were fighting.  
I think at this point you have to say Northwestern played well. They played
better than us today.  
  
Q. Aaron White had two scores right at the beginning of the game there and
didn't attempt a shot the rest of the game. Do you want to talk about what
Northwestern did to limit his attempts?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I mean, I think they guarded him closely. He's a marquee guy,
they're switching, they're up into him. He's got the green light. He turned
down some shot opportunities to move the ball. I give him credit.  
  
Q. How do you hit the reset button now heading towards postseason play and
clear the team's mind of the way the season has ended for them?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: There's no magic formula. You just have to keep working. What
we've said over these last two weeks is you work your way out of things like
this. You don't talk your way out of it, you don't fake your way out of it,
you work your way out of it, and you stay positive. We'll stay positive as
coaches, but we'll stay positive with one another. You can't start pointing
fingers and blaming each other.  
You know, my conversation after the game was very positive with regard to that
because I believe in this team and the character that we have in that locker
room.  
  
Q. What specifically do you think you want to work on? I know this one is
fresh, but what do you think you drill down on over the next week or so?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I really think when you're losing, it's never one thing. It's
easy to point at the defense. We gave up, what, 52 and 48 for three, so it's
easy to say, okay, your defense was terrible. But maybe it's a component, like
late shot clock defense wasn't what it needed to be.  
Overall I thought our half court defense was pretty good at times. I think Dev
hit on‑‑ our rotations are not what they need to be. Going to work on that.  
Offensively we're struggling. We shot 25 percent from three, we shot 25
percent in the second half, we shot 32 percent for the game. Okay, so is that
execution? Is it offensive patience? Is it poor execution in transition? We'll
watch film, we'll break it down, we'll do drills, we'll work individually with
individual players. And like I say, we'll stay positive and address all of
those areas.  
  
Q. You kind of touched on this a little bit. Marble scores 25, the rest of
the four starters have seven. Can you kind of explain that?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Well, I kind of went away from the starting lineup because of
how Uthoff was playing and how Olaseni was playing in particular, so they took
the bulk of Basabe and Woodbury's minutes. Mike was 0 for 10. He's been great.
I love him. He had a rough night, couldn't get one to fall. A pull‑up, a
drive, a three, couldn't get one to fall. I had to work Josh and Pete into the
lineup while we're struggling offensively. So do you downshift and go small,
do you stay big, and we did both. We pressed, we zoned, we went man, we went
small, we went big, pushing different buttons.

### [Andre Hollins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23369)

### [Austin Hollins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24981)

### [DeAndre Mathieu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26127)

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Minnesota  63  
Penn State ‑ 56

  
COACH PITINO: Obviously hard‑fought victory. We knew it wouldn't be easy
because they're a good basketball team, and certainly Pat does a great job. We
found a way to get it done. We found a way to get stops when we needed to,
make big plays when we needed to. Joey made a great pass to Andre at the end
and Andre hit a huge shot, so I'm proud of the effort.  
We knew it was going to be very, very difficult because they're a good team,
and it's so hard to beat a team three times in a row. But I'm really proud of
these guys, and top to bottom I thought we just found a way to win when it was
sloppy, and really happy with the win, certainly.  
  
Q. Andre and Austin, was there much talk amongst the players that you had to
win to have a chance at the NCAA Tournament?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: Of course. You know, this game had a lot of implications, and
it's hard not to ignore it, but you know it's there. It's a game we had to
win, and we came out and we took care of business.  
AUSTIN HOLLINS: You know, like Andre said, we know it's there, but our focus
right now is really the Big Ten Tournament. We want to win four in a row and
that was the first game. So we knew in order to do that you have to win the
first game, and that was the most important one for us.  
  
Q. Andre, after they came within three, what was your mindset? Were you
looking for a three there? Were you hoping to get a big shot just to get a
little bit of momentum back on the side of Minnesota?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: It just happened that way. They were trapping randomly, and Dre
did a good job of breaking the tap pass to Joey and then Joey did a good job
of sucking the guy in, and I was left wide open. It was wide open and I had to
take it. That's how things transpired.  
  
Q. Deandre and Austin, can you just talk about Andre hitting that shot
having struggled throughout the game with foul trouble, just in that moment,
and he hits the biggest shot of the game?  
DEANDRE MATHIEU: He does it all the time. He takes big shots, and he makes big
shots, so I mean, we weren't surprised. We knew it was good when it left his
hands. He's a big time player, and big time players make big time plays.  
AUSTIN HOLLINS: Andre is a confident player and he was wide open, and he had
the shot so he took it, and he knocked it down.  
  
Q. Deandre and Andre, fast forward a little bit, you guys have played
Wisconsin twice now. I'm curious, you handled them up at your place. What did
you learn from the second game in Madison that can help you tomorrow?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: Wisconsin is a very good team. They're consistent in everything
they do. They don't turn the ball over, and they don't really make mistakes,
so we have to limit our mistakes. We can't let them get offensive rebounds. We
can't turn the ball over. We're just going to have to play a solid game
against them.  
DEANDRE MATHIEU: Like Dre said, they don't turn it over, and our style of play
is to force turnovers and things like that. We're going to have to really
defend and lock down the half court and just try to pull out a big one.  
  
Q. I'm going to bring up the NCAA Tournament. Wisconsin, you beat them ‑‑
any of you, what do you think your chances of making it?   
AUSTIN HOLLINS: You know, we're not worried about that right now. Like I said,
we're worried about winning a Big Ten championship right now, and whatever
happens, that will happen. But right now we're focused on trying to beat
Wisconsin and winning a Big Ten championship.  
  
Q. Deandre, about halfway through the second half you made a pretty
spectacular lay ‑up, but it looked like you were holding your hamstring. Do
you feel okay?   
DEANDRE MATHIEU: Yeah, I feel okay. The trainers did a good job of getting me
back. Just cramps from probably dehydration or something like that, but I've
been drinking plenty of water, and I'll be fine for the next few games.  
  
Q. Richard, can you talk a little bit about the start you guys got off to,
especially defensively? I think you held them 2 for 18. Talk about that
start.  
COACH PITINO: Yeah, I thought we did a really good job just coming out of the
locker room. Some of these games are tough, first‑round games. They're not
always packed houses, so we talked about bringing our own energy, bringing our
own enthusiasm, and I thought coming out of the locker room they had that.
They were committed to getting stops. I thought we made every shot they'd take
pretty difficult. The only thing ‑‑ we were getting stops, we weren't getting
rebounds. The offensive rebounds were hurting us a little bit. But certainly
holding them to 32 percent, our goal is always 35 or below, so to do that was
a very, very good defensive effort. It was tough, too. They went small so we
had to go small, but I thought our guys did a really good job of adjusting.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you think was the biggest difference in the second half
when they went on their big run?  
COACH PITINO: There was a segment, and I'm not positive, I think they made
three three‑point plays in a row. I think they hit a three, then they hit an
and‑one, then they hit another three, and that segment got to us a little bit.
We calmed down. They were being aggressive, much like at our place, when they
cut it to nine.  
But Andre hit a big shot, but Joey King made a big time pass at the end. That
was a big time play. That was a game saver.  
  
Q. I get the sense you don't like talking about the NCAA Tournament, but do
you sense this was really important for the team's chances?  
COACH PITINO: Yeah, I'm half kidding. Obviously it's an issue on everybody's
mind. I thought that if we won tonight and things went our way, we could be
in. You get to 20 wins, you get a top five strength of schedule in the
country, I believe that you're rewarded when you play a great schedule. That's
normally what happens.  
But with that being said, we did come in here to win a Big Ten championship.
That's been our goal. We've never done it in school history. We know it would
be really, really difficult, but one down. Certainly we've got another tough
one tomorrow.  
  
Q. Is there something in particular you see in games that you're giving up
offensive rebounds?  
COACH PITINO: They were playing small shooting shots, coming back and getting
rebounds checked check. I think, more than anything, our guards just needed to
start coming back and getting rebounds. I thought we did a much better job in
the second half. Maverick had a couple of big time rebounds. So I thought we
adjusted much better in the second half.  
  
Q. You mentioned tomorrow's game. Just breaking down Wisconsin, you've
played them twice now, is there something that you learned from the second
game? You obviously handled them fairly well at home the first time around.  
COACH PITINO: Yeah, it's a rivalry game, and both home courts are great,
especially for that game. You know, I thought we actually did a couple of good
things at their place, but they're a very talented team and a hard team to
beat at home.  
We were able to beat them at our place. Just offensively, we were very good
that night. But we know it'll be a really, really tough game. They don't beat
themselves. It's a game of possessions, and we've got to take advantage of
every opportunity we have versus them.  
  
Q. Can you put your finger on Austin Hollins and his resurgence the past
four games, the best stretch of his career?  
COACH PITINO: No, like I've said before, I think it's just the ball‑‑ you're
seeing it go in. We didn't change anything offensively, we're not running
anything differently. I think he's just getting really confident, and you see
it. 18 points, and I just think it's one of those things where he just needed
to see the ball go in. And I've said it all along, he's one of the hardest
workers I've ever seen. He just keeps plugging away, and I'm happy for him
because he really deserved it. He was going through a slump offensively, so
I'm happy for him to see the ball go in.  
  
Q. With Andre obviously struggling a lot with fouls through the game, then
having him in there just to be able to take that big shot at the end, a guy
who's kind of been one of the leaders all year, how meaningful is that?  
COACH PITINO: You know, he made a big‑time shot at the end, and normally at
the end of a clock, we'll go high ball screen with Deandre, and Andre said to
me, I can run a high ball screen, too. He kind of got on me a little bit. I
said, all right, relax, because just Deandre is so good at it. But you could
see he's so eager to make a play. He doesn't seem like a fierce competitor
because he's such a smiley, happy kid, but he is as competitive as it gets. He
was dying to hit that big shot, and he certainly did it.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2014

  

### [A.J. Hammons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26680)

### [Terone Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23600)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  63  
Purdue  61

  
COACH PAINTER: Obviously I thought it was a disappointing loss for us. It was
a well fought game. I thought we did some really good things in the first half
defensively but simply couldn't rebound the basketball. And they dominated us
on the glass in the second half. We challenged them at halftime to flip it on
them. And our guys did that.  
We rebounded them by 11 in the second half and really made some good plays.  
I think for us I thought our effort was pretty good and this has kind of been
what we've been able to do at times is we've been able to play hard. And when
we play really hard, we don't play smart. You're not going to beat Ohio State
with 17 turnovers. So at the end of it, you would like to have a handful or
more possessions than we had.  
And we had some unforced errors that got us. But I don't doubt our guys. I
thought our effort was good tonight.  
We weren't able to consistently this year play hard and play smart at the same
time and those are two constants in the game you have to do if you're going to
have a good team.  
  
Q. Terone, I know your career wasn't as great as you like. Do you think with
the new guys coming in you can get it going in the right direction? And what's
it going to have to take?  
TERONE JOHNSON: Yeah, I definitely think we can. We've said that after each
loss each time we talked to the media the talent was there in the room. Those
guys are going to have to be consistent with listening to Coach, listening to
the leaders and just putting together runs and playing hard all of the time. I
think that's something that Coach is going to get them to do, get them rounded
up to do.  
  
Q. Terone, just take me through that last shot and then, kind of what sunk
in afterwards?  
TERONE JOHNSON: We just called the play. We ran the play a couple of times
during the game. But basically I just come out the down screen from AJ. We
knew it was one second on the clock, so I could have a dribble. But I thought
I had enough space to get the shot off to win the game. You know, it looked
good when it was going up. I really couldn't see if it went in or not, but it
missed.  
  
Q. AJ, you played a career high 38minutes tonight, you didn't foul out. You
had four fouls throughout the end of the game. How was that playing so much
and just making such a big impact?  
A.J. HAMMONS: It was just trying to get my men on the boards really, but I
just need to play a little bit harder and after the four fouls I just had to
play smart because Coach was telling me sometimes you got to give some stuff
up so I gave up a couple shots, but really just tried to alter shots.  
  
Q. Matt, in each of the three games against Ohio State, within, you know,
ten, nine, eight ‑minute marks each time, the game was there to be won. A
little different in each scenario. You had a chance at the end of the game.
What has it been about these three games just finishing? Is it their
experience?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, I thought the first two games, it was our turnovers led
to a lot of fast break points. Here we had the turnovers, but they didn't get
fast break points. I'd have to go back and look maybe at the type of turnover
we were having. Sometimes we just don't throw it directly to them, you double
dribble or you travel and you throw it in the stands.  
The score doesn't change. It's not a good thing but the score still doesn't
change. They were converting the turnovers and the points. Tonight we had the
turnovers. They weren't converting them into points. They only had six points
off of 17 turnovers. Which is really really low for 17 turnovers. So we were
fortunate in that regard. I really thought if we would have had 17 turnovers
we would not be in the game.  
So, you know, they didn't shoot well from the field. Some guys on their team
had high scoring nights, but they had to take 21shots to get 19points. They
had to take 16shots to get 16points. So I thought our defense was pretty good,
but I just thought the difference at the end of the day is we turned the ball
over too much.  
I don't like talking about what other people did when we don't do some basic
things. You leave this game and you have eight turnovers and you lose the game
to make you feel better about yourself. But when you have 17 turnovers you
feel like you beat yourself. That's how I always feel when we turn it over too
much.  
  
Q. Coach, do you have any thoughts on that last play, go inside for AJ for
two or were you going for the win?  
COACH PAINTER: The thing that they do if you watched Ohio State is they put
their center on the ball so it's very difficult to go over the top of Amir
Williams and then you got to put some size taking it out. So we did the best
we could with Kendall Stephens there.  
We were going to set a simple screen. A lot of times when you get in those
situations with one second you can overthink yourself and it gets away from
you and all of a sudden you don't get a shot at all. The worst thing you can
do in that situation is not get a shot.  
We were going to set a simple screen with them. If they wanted to switch, then
we were going to go over the top. That was our second option. But if they
weren't, we were going to take our rhythm three to win the game.  
  
Q. Matt, you talked about how seldom it was that you could get this team to
play smart and hard at the same time. For a coach, how frustrating is that and
what can you try to do to change that?  
COACH PAINTER: Get better decision makers. You got to take the guys that you
already have and get them to make better decisions, keeping working with them.
It's a game of repetition. We got to do a better job of playing fast and under
control. Then you got to recruit guys, you know, that can make a better
decision.  
Two years ago we were the number one team in the country with the fewest
turnovers. So this is a big changing of the guard for us from a personnel
standpoint. I don't care who you are, but if you don't give yourself a chance,
you're going to end up losing basketball games. We simply didn't give
ourselves a chance this year because we turned the ball over too much.  
  
Q. Matt, I know you have been reluctant to talk about, with the regular
season still going on, the Big Ten Tournament, but just for the record would
you ‑‑  
COACH PAINTER: No.  
  
Q. This was it? You're done?  
  
Q. Coach, Kendall on one of two threes made today, Kendall making one and
tying it at 54 all, a big play for the Boilermakers, then Ronnie right before
halftime, I think about a minute and a half or so you pulled him off of the
bench, he made a couple of big plays. And then also Ronnie getting that ball
and taking the full length of the court. About a minute and a half to go in
the ball game and cutting the lead down to one. So good moments in the ball
game and some bright spots for the Boilermakers. Just your comments on that?  
COACH PAINTER: We were able to make some plays and be able to do some things
today. I told our guys I didn't doubt their efforts, and our last game of the
season I did doubt their effort. I didn't think we played hard as a group. We
had a couple of individuals play hard, but as a group I didn't think we played
very hard.  
But, you know, it's not good enough. Basketball games, it's one of those
threes you're talking about we banked in, so we must be living right somewhat.
But we just have to be more consistent. We got to take care of the basketball.  
I know I keep getting back to it, but that's the game. That is a constant in
the game that you have to be able to do. We got to make improvements next year
on that.  
  
Q. You mentioned the turnovers a couple of times, but Ronnie had seven
turnovers, 12points, three assists, he got it in the paint, found AJ a few
times. You know, it comes back to the turnovers again. What did you think of
his day overall?  
COACH PAINTER: I thought, you know, he did some good things for us. He has the
ability with his speed to break people down and to put us in situations that
others can't. But he has to be able to take care of the basketball as your
point guard.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

### [Yogi Ferrell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25209)

### [Will Sheehey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23569)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Illinois  64  
Indiana  54

  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations to Illinois. They played an excellent game
today.  
  
Q. You guys got it going from the three ‑point line in the first half,
missed the last 11. Did they come out on you more? What changed the rest of
the game?   
WILL SHEEHEY: The ones in the first half kind of came off movement and
penetration. The second half we didn't necessarily get the same penetration
and movement that we did the first half.  
  
Q. I'll ask both of you, the zones seemed to give you some troubles. Was
that a big factor in the game for you? You came out the second half really
penetrating and they went to the zone. There must have been a reason for it.  
YOGI FERRELL: We needed to move the ball more, still kind of play inside and
out. But we didn't do that the second half.  
WILL SHEEHEY: I think we had some sets where we actually did have some pretty
good movement within the zone but it wasn't on a consistent basis.  
  
Q. For either of you, what about Illinois toward the end of that game, why
were you not able to get over the hump there?  
YOGI FERRELL: When they were running the high ball screen, we weren't
defending that as well as we were especially in the first half and then they
got a couple of key offensive rebounds down the stretch in the second half.  
  
Q. Yogi, specifically, what's it like to play against Abrams that you played
against now for two years at that guard position. It seems like he never
quits.  
YOGI FERRELL: Yeah, I've been playing against him for a while now. You know,
it's a good guard, big body. He attacks the rim really well.  
  
Q. Tom, what was your ‑‑ what is your message to your team at this point?  
COACH CREAN: Bottom line is we can play better. We have to ‑‑ you have to
match the toughness and the competitive spirit every time that you play. And
we've just got to quit making defensive mistakes in coverages and giving them
live ball turnovers. Really what I want to do is try to find a different way
to say that message because I've given it a few times. And that's the biggest
thing.  
  
Q. Coach, you were ‑‑ you guys were down 53 to 52 with a little over a
minute left. What kind of defense‑‑ it looks like you guys were trying to
transition?  
COACH CREAN: It was a defensive mistake. It's something that we practiced. It
was just a mistake. We didn't get into that rotation as quick as we needed to.
We've done it all year. I mean, we've played that kind of defense all year.
And in that situation, going to man, they were really hurting us with our high
ball screen. So that was one reason that we had to go to more of the zone. We
just didn't get over there quick enough based on the person that was up that
had to jump into the zone.  
  
Q. Coach, what were your thoughts on your team's energy, especially down the
stretch? It seems that guys maybe weren't as energetic that maybe they might
normally be in such a close game?  
COACH CREAN: Yeah, I have to watch the film. I didn't think our execution was
where it needed to be today. At some point you have to grow over ‑‑ when
things aren't going right for you in lack of offense, then you have to be able
to overcome it. And you can't make mistakes on the other end.  
  
Q. Tom, how would you define this season?  
COACH CREAN: I wouldn't. Because I hope it's going to continue to keep going.
So I'm really, 15, 20minutes after the game has ended, I really don't have a
definition of ‑‑ I hope we get to continue to play. It would be an honor to
keep playing. And I'd like to see us continuing to get better.  
  
Q. Tom, you mentioned that at some point you have to grow over. What are the
biggest growth areas still out there for these guys?  
COACH CREAN: The value of the basketball is a big one. Just a four‑minute talk
on the court. And sometimes the energy can lacking when the communication is
not where it needs to be. Just continue to make simple basketball plays.  
And probably the biggest word that we use is just that intent ‑‑ the intent of
it ‑‑ intent covers a lot of things. It covers your competitiveness. It covers
your awareness. It covers your grit. It covers your will, you know, the intent
of getting stops.  
We started the second half, I think we had seven or eight stops in a row. So
that's very good intent. I mean, without question, but it's the consistency of
that. And going back to Dana's question, it was your question, right? I think
the biggest thing to me that I don't want to define it as but it's certainly
been that way this season is we've just never been as consistent as we need to
be.  
Like I said, I hope that we're going to continue to play and we can keep
building it. Because there's a lot of talent. There's a lot of work ethic in
there. We've got to keep understanding what our individual responsibilities
are for winning and that means making the game easier for your teammates.  
And that is the hardest thing in my mind to get when you have a lot of guys
that maybe winning came easy or they were surrounded with other good players
or there wasn't a premium put on it. But when there a premium put on winning,
you have to make a simple play. You have to make it about your teammate.  
You cannot lose intent even if it's not going right for you. That's the
hardest process to go through with it. If you don't have enough talent, well,
that's another hard process. We have the talent. They just have to grow up and
they have to continue to learn those lessons.  
And days like today, they're hard. You beat Iowa, you beat Ohio State, those
lessons come alive pretty good. But you lose like today, in the Michigan game,
we had all of that. But again, there was some costly defensive mistakes down
the stretch and a couple of turnovers.  
And that's been the part of our season that's really been the crux, that as
hard as we try to work to get out of it, it still carries over into the games.
And we just want to continue to build on that. Every bit of experience this
team can get, especially being in this league and what we've learned from this
league, to continue to go out and play is very important.  
  
Q. Coach, Vonleh hasn't had double digits in over a month. Do you think
that's kind of a result of the foot injury or do you think it's kind of
hitting the freshman wall?  
COACH CREAN: I don't know. The injury has definitely been there. He was very
limited in practice this week. I think you can see that in his energy at times
in the game. We've really had to hold him back in the practices. And it's part
of it.  
So there's no question he can be more aggressive. There's no question about
that. But he gets a lot of focus too as you see. As good as Yogi is and as
good as Will is, the post double and things like that, the freshman that
misses time, it's like missing considerable amounts.  
And again, you can say they're playing the games but it's that rhythm of
practice. That's why the one zone play we ran at the end when Noah hit Will
and Will hit Troy, that shows how good they can execute it. We ran that two
days ago. The opportunity to learn it and get those things done, you got to
keep doing it time and time again. And young freshmen go through different
walls.  
I don't know if you ever see a proverbial wall where they just run up to it
and smack it. They can hide it pretty well. You can hide it with your
practices and not going as long. But there's no question that missing the
games that he missed and those type of things bothered him.  
But he's going to be a very good player and he's just got to continue to learn
and we got to continue to try to help him get better.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  63  
Purdue ‑ 61

  
COACH MATTA: Well, as I told these guys walking out, it's good to see us win
one of these ugly games. We've been in this position, couldn't finish them
out. We didn't play as well as we wanted to today and I give Purdue all the
credit for that. I thought they played hard, and especially the second half.
For about the first, I don't know, 15 minutes, they beat us up a little bit in
terms of loose balls, that sort of thing.  
But guys made some big plays down the stretch, and were able to get out of
here with a win and play again tomorrow.  
  
Q. Aaron, you've played in an awful lot of these grinder ‑type of games, but
they say it's difficult to beat the same team, especially from the same
conference, three times in one year. I won't use the word ‑‑ were you kind of
leery of that or fearful of that, but did you figure Purdue would give you a
difficult battle because it is tough to beat somebody three times?   
AARON CRAFT: You know, that's just how we play Purdue, like every time we play
them. We know they're going to come out and play hard and play physical. And
if you've got a guy like A.J. inside, that always makes it tough on us. We
don't play against guys that want to sit in the post as much as he does. Like
Coach said, it was good to find a way, whatever it may have been, even dodged
a bullet at the end with that shot he took.  
It feels good, and hopefully ‑‑ we obviously have to play better tomorrow, but
we have to rejuvenate ourselves and try to find a way to get better.  
  
Q. LaQuinton, you've obviously been taking your offense a lot closer to the
basket. Are you doing that consciously? I noticed today there were a couple
times when it looked like you had a three and you still took it in and shot
it.  
LAQUINTON ROSS: I think it's all about match‑ups. Most of the guys that have
been guarding me lately have been pretty small, and I've been able to take
advantage of my size. I think it's all about match‑ups, depending on who's
guarding me at the time.  
  
Q. Aaron, Thad mentioned how this isn't the first type of ‑‑ this type of
game that you guys have been in, and I'm wondering, earlier in the season
maybe, were you guys more nervous when it came down to the end like it has so
many times, and now are you just comfortable with it and just go with it?   
AARON CRAFT: I wouldn't say too nervous. I think there definitely were times
we've played a little tentative down the stretch. We've been in a couple of
games like this where you turn the ball over a little bit more than you think
you should, and everyone is kind of just doing what they want.  
It's finding a way, and, hopefully, those games we played earlier in the year
have helped us to this point, especially if we get another game like that. It
doesn't matter how ugly the game is at this point, it's all about trying to
find a way to keep playing, and luckily we're able to do that again.  
  
Q. LaQuinton, you've had some pretty good games against Purdue, 19 points,
15 rebounds today. Is it a match ‑up thing? Did it just work out that way?
Talk about the boards you got, 15 rebounds.   
LAQUINTON ROSS: I think it's just how it worked out. Purdue is a team that you
know they're going to play physical every game, and they try to beat you up
every game, especially with Hammond and some of other guys they got, having
multiple men come off the bench. And I just take it upon myself to try to
rebound in these types of games, especially since we're not that big of a
team. It's, like, Amir is 6'11" and the next tallest person to me is 6'8".
That's basically it.  
  
Q. Aaron, I'll ask you since this is your fourth year in this tournament: It
seems like the team's first game in this tournament every year always goes
like this. Does it seem the same way to you?  
AARON CRAFT: It has been that way. This is now my fourth Big Ten Tournament,
and luckily in the past, we've done a better job the next game when we come
out. But that doesn't mean we're going to do that this year. It's a different
year, and we need to take it upon ourselves to find a way to get ready. And
it's going to be a quick turnaround for us, obviously, so hopefully our young
bodies can take it, and we've just got to move forward.  
  
Q. Aaron, what do you remember most about Nebraska's guard play with Tai
Webster and Benny Parker coming off the bench? What do you remember about
those two guys?  
AARON CRAFT: I think the biggest thing they do is they do their role very
well. Webster did a good job the second time we played them at their place of
getting to the rim rather easily. And that kind of loosened them up going
forward, and it really kind of opened our defense up, and that wasn't
something he did the first game, so you've got to be ready.  
I think Parker is playing much better now that he knows he's the guy they're
going to. It's got to be a big defensive game for us. They've got bigs that
can shoot the ball, and obviously Petteway and Shields, who are playing great
basketball right now. It's going to be a big team defensive effort for us.  
  
Q. LaQuinton, the team's offensive struggles have been obvious to everybody.
Have you taken it upon yourself ‑‑ I mean, you're the guy, probably the most
natural scorer. Have you decided that you needed to score more? You seemed to
do a lot of that today, seemed to be on that kind of wavelength.   
LAQUINTON ROSS: I mean, we've had our ups and downs this year on offense, and
I just try to do my part, that's it. If you look at a couple games this year,
we have different people step up in every game whether it's Sam, whether it's
Craft, Lenzelle. Everybody had big games this year, so I think it's all about
people doing their part on offense. When we have pace and rhythm to our
offense, there's nobody that can stop us.  
  
Q. Thad, 15 lead changes, and the biggest lead for you was seven, biggest
lead for them was six. Is this the kind of game you expect in this league,
this year, no matter who you're playing? It just seemed like neither team
could shake the other.  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, I didn't like the way we started the game in terms of just
the baskets we were giving them. I think at halftime 10 of their 12 points
were right at the rim, or 10 of their 12 makes were right at the rim. And we
made some ridiculous mental mistakes defensively, and we didn't do a good job
taking care of the basketball. I think nine turnovers in the first half. As
Bob even said ‑‑ and we talked about as a staff‑‑ every year for 10 years,
this game has just been‑‑ it's been tough.  
Hopefully, we can relax and think a little bit better and play a little bit
better tomorrow.  
  
Q. You just answered my question, so I'll ask you another one. The question
I asked Aaron about the guys being more comfortable in this situation, I
wonder, from early in the season to now if you've noticed a difference maybe
in huddles the last eight minutes of the game, whether it be confidence or
whatever?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, you know, it's funny because we talk about that. Early on
today we didn't have‑‑ I didn't feel that energy that we wanted, that we
needed. Second half I thought they did a pretty decent job with that, guys
talking it through, this is what we're going to do, this is how we're going to
do it, more engaged. We executed a lot of timeouts, a little bit better
offensively. But we just‑‑ some of the plays we made, especially in the first
half, we just kind of like, boy, that's uncharacteristic of him or whatever it
was. As hard as it is, we've got to pick ourselves and get ready to go again
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Have you encouraged LaQuinton to go closer to the basket? Seems like for
a while now he's been playing a lot closer to the basket.  
COACH MATTA: I think one of the biggest things, and this has become almost
throughout the Big Ten, the switching that takes place, and he touched on it,
a lot of times it's predicated on match‑ups. Last Sunday against Michigan
State, I said, Q, you're going to have to shoot a three‑point shot here in the
second, and he comes out and bangs that big three for us.  
You know, he's got to, I think, continue to read where things are. I thought
his decision making his pretty good today. I give him credit; he stuck with it
and finished through a lot of contact down there and really even when he
missed he found the ball and got some put‑backs with six offensive rebounds.
He did a good job of that.  
Q is stronger than he looks. He does have some pretty good strength to him.  
  
Q. It's been about two months since that second Nebraska game when they were
able to beat you. Is that the same formula Nebraska is using now, and have you
been watching a lot of their games?  
COACH MATTA: You know, I really haven't. I haven't seen them a whole lot now.
Obviously I'll shift over there, but no, I think as Aaron said, they're on a
roll right now. They are playing great basketball, and obviously Shields and
Petteway are doing a good job. They've got guys that can stretch the defense,
they're shooting the ball well. I think they're playing as well as anybody in
the country right now.  
  
Q. I just want to be sure the time ‑out that you called at 2.8 after he made
the‑‑ after Ronnie Johnson made the first free throw, you knew what they were
going to do with the intentional miss, and you just wanted to get everything
set up?   
COACH MATTA: Yeah. We talked about them intentionally missing, and we also
talked about quick inbounding because I had another time‑out left, and we were
going to go as quick as we could to get it in. But yeah, I mean, what a unique
play because Lenzelle said, he goes, it's off me. So then we were able to kind
of set what we were going to do next.  
  
Q. You seemed to have an ongoing dialogue with one of the officials, and you
were awarded a time ‑out that I don't believe you called. Did you get any
further explanation on that?   
COACH MATTA: No. Here's what happened: And Mike probably did the right thing,
but I said, at 15 I'm going to call time‑out, and as soon as he heard me say
"time‑out," he called time‑out, and I was like, no, not yet. He heard
time‑out. He did the right thing, yes.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Northwestern  67  
Iowa  62

  
COACH COLLINS: Well, certainly for us it was a special win. You know,
considering what we've had to go through since we lost JerShon about three
weeks ago, who was such a key part of our team, and we were playing really
well. And then we kind of had to reinvent ourselves again here, had our
struggles for a while, were able to get a good win last Sunday at Purdue,
which I thought was huge for our confidence.  
I was just really pleased with the way my team approached the last couple days
heading into this game. A lot of times for a team like ours with the record we
have, you can have a tendency‑‑ we're playing a team that would beat us by
close to 30 points both times we played them. You can have a tendency to maybe
just come here to Indy, enjoy the day, play a little ball and be done with
things. But that's not what my group wanted to do, and that's not who they've
been, and I thought they played outstanding. We played maybe our best game of
the year.  
It's easy to say that; I hate clichés. But I thought on both sides of the ball
we played really well, especially offensively. I thought we shared the ball
well. They really tried to come after us. They trapped us on a lot of ball
screens. They were trying to be real aggressive on the perimeter, and I
thought our guards did a great job of not only attacking the pressure, but
then making the right reads and hitting guys.  
And then we made shots, and that hasn't been something we've done a lot this
year. It was nice to see the ball go in the basket.  
I thought the end of the first half was a really key stretch of the game. We
came out of the under 4:00 time‑out. I think marble got a three‑point play to
push the lead to 28‑21\. We were down by seven, and we talked about going into
the half trying to play a good four minutes to get some momentum heading into
the second half, and we outscored them 10‑3\. Trey hit a good shot at the
buzzer to get us to tied and then it was our ball coming out of the half.  
I thought that might have been the biggest four minutes of the game when they
had a chance to kind of run away from us a little bit. And we got it back and
got it tied at halftime.  
It was a great time. Iowa is a terrific team. I have nothing but respect for
Coach McCaffery. I've known him since I was a little kid. I used to be a ball
boy when he was a player at the University of Pennsylvania when I was eight
years old. I have great respect for him and his program, so for us to play
well and win this game against a really good team showed a lot about our team
and about our program.  
  
Q. Guys, you guys had a lot more threes than lay ‑ups this game as opposed
to mid‑range jumpers. Is that something you worked on heading into the game?
  
DREW CRAWFORD: I think a big thing was we were trying to get into the lane,
penetrate, and they did a great job of collapsing and kind of taking away our
drives. So when they were doing that, that's when we had shooters on the
perimeter. We were able to find our kicks, get it to three‑point shooters on
the perimeter, and in the case that they didn't step up and collapse, then we
were able to get to the basket.  
TRE DEMPS: I mean, Iowa, they're great at hedging on ball screens, so we tried
to just get them strung out a little bit. And just like Drew said, once you
come off that ball screen, to give yourself up as a ball handler and swing the
ball and find the open guy in the rotation.  
  
Q. Trey, you had a couple really good assists in this game, including a
great dish out to Dave Sobolewski. Talk about what that momentum swing was.  
TRE DEMPS: Yeah, seems like when we have connecting plays, those points mean
more than even somebody going one‑on‑one, because everybody is involved and
everybody contributed. So when you have a connecting play like the one that I
had to Dave and guys hit me‑‑ did a great job hitting me for threes, I think
we play better defense when that happens.  
  
Q. What Chris said about could have had an attitude of just come to Indy,
enjoy the day, what has been motivating you guys?  
DREW CRAWFORD: You know, it's just a fighting spirit that we have. From the
beginning, Coach told us the way we were going to play every night is just we
were going to work our hardest for 40 minutes every game. So that's really our
motivation, and knowing that this is the last time that this group is going to
be together, there will be guys graduating, guys leaving, so we've got to
enjoy every moment we have as a group.  
You know, the fact that no one really gives us a chance, that's big time
motivation, too, and we like it that way. That really drives us because we
know we're capable, and we're capable of being a great team, and we were able
to show out and play well tonight.  
TRE DEMPS: I think just to add to that, when you see the coaching staff every
day meeting up there for hours and hours when I walk into the gym, that just
shows their commitment, and it makes you want to go that much harder. They did
a great job putting us in positions to make plays.  
  
Q. The way the team played defense tonight, was that reminiscent of the way
you guys played defense when you strung together the wins during the middle of
the season? When you're successful against a team like Iowa, do you feel like
that sparks you on the other end of the floor?  
DREW CRAWFORD: Yeah, it definitely does. That's what we've hung our hat on all
year is our defense, and then defense is really when we're most together.
That's when we're most united because we have to move as a unit and really
communicate with each other. So when we're playing great defense, getting
stops and rebounds, that really leads into offense because we're feeling good
and we know we're playing together.  
  
Q. Looking forward to tomorrow's game against Michigan State, have you
started to think about the Spartans at all and will your mindset change after
you have one win under your belt?  
TRE DEMPS: Yeah, even just waiting there, as a competitor, I start thinking
about the game. We didn't do a good job of playing defense against them. We
felt like we scored the ball well, but we didn't fight that game. I think
playing against those guys, they're very similar to Iowa. They like to push
the ball up‑and‑down. They play really physical on the glass. We're going to
have to have the same physicality that we had tonight.  
  
Q. Drew and Tre, earlier in the season when teams would make runs against
you, you had sort of a tendency to let games leave your grasp. Tonight, every
time Iowa made a run, you fought back, especially both you guys hit big shots.
How important was that, and was it anything with the team's mentality
changing?  
DREW CRAWFORD: Yeah, I think part of that is just the experience, kind of as
guys get more comfortable on the court, we get more comfortable playing with
each other. Basketball, it's a game of runs. There's always going to be teams
going on runs against you, and you have to be able to deal with that
adversity. And I think one thing is I really tried to huddle the team. We get
good huddles during the game, get everyone together, and just calm everyone
down. You can't let one big play by the other team turn into a string of
plays. We did a great job of shifting that momentum tonight.  
TRE DEMPS: I think when teams get on runs like that, you know, it's also
important to make shots. You know, when they were on that run, Kale hit two
big shots finishing strong, and Sanjay had a couple‑‑ he hit a three and a
pull‑up jumper. When those guys get going, it motivates them and it motivates
our whole team because we're so excited when they score.  
  
Q. Chris, what's the difference between Tre hitting that three at the end of
the half and not, just kind of mentally? And also, can you talk about the way
Dave played?  
COACH COLLINS: Well, in terms of the shot, there's no question it was a big
momentum boost because Marble had just hit a three for them. It was tied,
Marble hit a three to give them a three‑point lead, and then Tre, we pushed
the ball up and Tre hits a great shot. You go in feeling good. It's a tie
game, and it was our ball, so we came out and we were able to score, so we got
the lead right away. I thought it was a huge momentum boost.  
In terms of Dave, it was his best game of the year. I thought he had a really
good‑‑ he had a very good presence to him tonight. He got us organized. He was
strong with the ball, and, of course, he made shots. Everybody has documented
he hasn't shot the ball this well this year, and I thought he hit a little
floater in the lane that was huge. He hit two huge threes and then two
big‑time free throws when they cut it to two to put it to a four‑point lead.  
The thing about Dave, which is great, is he's not afraid. He wants to take
those big shots, he wants the ball, and I know a guy having that kind of
experience, I know his year has been up‑and‑down. And for him to come out
here, and he played well in our last game, he was really big at Purdue and
played his best game today. I'm really happy for him. I thought he played a
really good basketball game.  
  
Q. You told us a couple of days ago that one thing that would be really
important for your team tonight would be to control the tempo. How did you do
that?  
COACH COLLINS: Well, we were a little bit fortunate they were missing shots.
We started the game, we played some zone. We just wanted to give them a little
different look. I just felt it was important. They had such a rhythm against
us the two times we played them before. They scored pretty much at will. They
were high‑scoring games. We would have had tough match‑ups. We started the
game in zone, we missed some shots, then they got comfortable against it.  
I just said, look, I'm not going to sit in the zone. That's not who we are. If
we're going to go down, we are going to go down being the team we've been. We
went to our man‑to‑man and we played that the rest of the game, and our guys
just dug in and stuck to our principles. We weren't perfect, but we made them
work.  
Any time you play a really good team, it helps if guys miss some shots they
normally make. I thought Gesell missed shots that he normally makes. We were
fortunate that Oglesby never got it going against us. I thought Uthoff and
Marble played great, but we were able to do a pretty good job on the other
guys.  
Our whole goal going into this game was to keep this game in the 60s, if we
could, and give ourselves a chance in the last five minutes. Let's have some
game pressure on them and then we would have to make some plays and execute,
and that's what we were able to do.  
  
Q. With what you had mentioned about the two games not being close and then,
really, coming into a tournament, rather than winning it, you don't have a lot
to play for on paper. Did that actually help your team in your mindset loosen
up?  
COACH COLLINS: Yeah, I think it helped us relax. We talked about the fact that
there is really no pressure on us. We can just play. We can just compete, we
can play. We should take our shots confidently. We should play with a spirit
to us that there's nothing holding us back. But our guys did a great job, and
sometimes it's funny, the power of the mind. When you do that, it's funny how
sometimes you shoot better.  
I really believe that's one of the reasons why a lot of the shots that we
haven't made all year we made tonight, just because guys were a little bit
more free in their minds, like you said. The regular season is over, we're
here at the Big Ten Tournament. It's a great venue, an exciting place to play.
Let's just go have fun and compete and play and see what happens.  
Our guys, you never feel good when you're playing a team that's pretty much
owned them. I think they had beaten us five times in a row, and I don't know
if any of the games were even that close. I know the ones this year weren't,
under my watch. I know in our locker room our guys were determined to play
these guys better. We haven't had any success against them. I know that was a
driving force for the players to play much better against this team.  
  
Q. As far as your game plan, what was the game plan going in, and then did
you change it at all as the score kept staying really close?  
COACH COLLINS: Well, at the start of the game, we were going to start in the
zone. I knew they were going to come out with a lot of energy, just they‑‑
they felt like they had some games maybe they should have won, and they wanted
to play well. And they have a lot of pride, and they're well coached and
they're really talented. One of the things we thought was if maybe we came out
in the zone it might slow them down a little bit.  
Fortunately, they missed some shots early. I thought they got some open looks.
They missed them. So the first four minutes, we never really got hit with like
a monster surge. And then I thought they got comfortable against our zone
after the first four or five minutes of the game, and that's when I scrapped
it and I said we're going to play man. That's what we work on every day.
That's our identity. That's who we are. If we're going to go down, we're going
to go down being who we are, so we ended up playing man the rest of the game.  
When you play Iowa, No.1 on the board is get back in transition, No.2 on the
board is get back in transition, and then No.3 is rebound. I thought in the
first half we rebounded the ball really well. In the second half, they wore us
down on the glass. I think we were plus seven or plus eight at halftime, and
we ended up minus eight. We got hammered on the boards in the second half, but
fortunately with our ability to make shots, it allowed us to counteract that a
little bit.  
  
Q. You kind of touched on this a little bit, but kind of put it in
perspective, no 11 seed has ever won a game in the Big Ten Tournament. Talk
about that.  
COACH COLLINS: Well, I didn't really know that, which is probably crazy
because I usually‑‑ you ask my wife, I have too much useless basketball
knowledge in my head. That's the one thing I probably didn't know.  
You know, we never really looked at it like that, but to hear that, it means
something. For us‑‑ look, we're year one, and we're trying to build a program.
We're trying to build, we're trying to climb the mountain of this Big Ten. We
have aspirations of, eventually, one day being a program that contends for
championships year in and year out, and it takes time and it takes experience.
And in order to do that, you have to take steps as they come.  
And one of those steps is you've got to learn how to win in the postseason
tournament. And so for us to come here and prepare and to get a win and now
have a chance to be able to play Michigan State, which to me is the standard
of excellence in this league. There's a lot of great, great programs, and that
in no way, shape or form does it disrespect anyone else in our league. We've
got as good a league as there is.  
But what Coach Izzo has done with his program, the kind of kids he has, the
way he's won, that's a standard of excellence, and now we have a chance to
rest up and come back tomorrow and compete against them and see how we can do.
To me the only thing that can come out of that for our program is positive.  
  
Q. You mentioned rest up. There's not going to be a lot of time for rest.
You guys played a lot of minutes. Do you feel like they'll just have a surge
of energy because of the stage tomorrow, or is fatigue going to be a
problem?  
COACH COLLINS: Yeah, there's no other option. We are who we are. The guys
playing are the guys that are going to play. That's where we've got to
utilize‑‑ we have a great training staff, we have great medical people. It's
very important now when the game ends with hydration, with treatment, with
rest, with different things you can do now. We're going to do everything we
have within our power to get our guys' legs fresh and get them some rest and
try to put a game plan together.  
This time of year, though, a lot of it is guts, it's heart, and then it'll be
on me. I'm going to have to do a good job using our timeouts, managing tempo,
things of that nature, give guys maybe a rest around the timeouts if I can get
a guy a minute here and a minute there. Again, it's going to be a similar
formula. We've got to try to keep the game at bay, keep it at a manageable
number, and give ourselves a chance in the last five, six minutes to see if we
can be competitive.  
I think it's going to be very similar to what we tried to do tonight.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Patrick Chambers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22067)

### [Tim Frazier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21969)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Minnesota  63  
Penn State ‑ 56

  
Q. Tim, you guys got behind at the start. I think you were 2 of 18. Can you
just talk about what Minnesota did to you guys, or were you just missing
shots?  
TIM FRAZIER: I think we just missed shots, but obviously Minnesota wants to
speed you up with their defense. That's why they pressed full court throughout
the whole game. I don't know if we shot our shots fast, but it took us a while
to knock down some shots.  
  
Q. Just talk about ‑‑ I think you guys got down 13 or 14. Talk about how you
got back into the game and there was that one big shot that Hollins made.   
TIM FRANZIER: We just wanted to continue to fight. Never once did we think we
were out of the game. We were making runs and wanted to continue to fight to
get back into the game, cut it down to a single possession game, single
possession points, and obviously Austin Hollins made a great shot.  
  
Q. Talk about the resolve of this team. You guys played a full 40 minutes.
Talk about coming back and digging in as long as you could and just making it
a game.  
TIM FRAZIER: We just wanted to continue to fight. That's one of our staples,
to have a great attitude no matter what, continue to play as hard as we can.
We continued to do that, and we cut it back it down to single digits and made
it a single possession game. They made the winning plays they needed to make
to win.  
COACH CHAMBERS: I don't make opening statements. Please, go ahead. That's an
opening statement (laughing).  
  
Q. You guys clawed back and didn't pull it off, but got close. Your thoughts
on how everything transpired down the stretch and the whole game?  
COACH CHAMBERS: You know, you just can't give a Big Ten team a 12, 14‑point
lead. You just can't do it. You hit the word right on the head; this has been
the year of close. I'm really tired of getting close. We have to start getting
over the hump and winning these games, and I don't know if it's a perception,
I don't know if it's a mindset, I'm not sure what it is, but I've got to
figure it out where we can come out and compete and know that we can win
games, especially on this stage.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2014

  

### [Tracy Abrams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25044)

### [John Groce](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20727)

### [Rayvonte Rice](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21779)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Illinois  64  
Indiana  54

  
COACH GROCE: I thought that kind of flipped it around for us a little bit
offensively in the second half. And then to finish the game 11 to 9 on that
run and defend the way that we did to take care of the basketball today with
turnovers. You know, I thought we did a lot of the little things really well.
Obviously we got a great challenge tomorrow playing Michigan. Our guys are
looking forward to it. We're going to worry about them when we get back to the
hotel. I told them they can enjoy this one between now and the 45‑second bus
ride back to our hotel and then we got to start to turn our focus on to a very
good Michigan ball club questions.  
  
Q. Tracy, have you ever had had a better game at Illinois, 25points, 7
rebounds, one turnover?  
TRACY ABRAMS: I'm not really concerned about the points and stuff. I'm just
glad we was able to be together, pull it out and fight as a team, as a unit.
We rely heavily on Rayvonte. He came through for us.  
  
Q. Tracy, just what did you see in Indiana's ball training defense, it seems
like you really attacked them off of the screen and roll?  
TRACY ABRAMS: They was playing a lot of cross match‑up. We was just using what
they give us. Trying to be aggressive and attack and making good decisions,
whether that was going up and in front or kicking it up?  
  
Q. Ray, the last few games you guys have really come together as a team.
Talk a little bit what that's meant for the morale as the season ended for you
guys?  
RAYVONTE RICE: Just everybody stepping up and doing what they're good at.
We're just finding out what each other is good at and we execute it.  
  
Q. Ray, in reference to your last answer, now five and one in your last five
road games, what's the turning point for you guys?  
RAYVONTE RICE: I mean, we're letting our defense I ‑‑ I mean, we're just
stepping up and playing defense. We're just executing our game plans.  
  
Q. At Indiana, it was a lot like this through their run to open the second
half. And then you never recovered from that. That was number 6, 7 and 8 game
streak. How different do things feel now?  
TRACY ABRAMS: It's a lot different. We rely on each other more. We trust each
other more and we're there for each other more, most importantly. When you
know that it's easy, you know, to bounce back after a bad play because you
know you got guys with positive energy just motivating you?  
RAYVONTE RICE: We're just doing better, just finishing games and just playing
great defense.  
  
Q. Tracy, I know you said the points don't really matter to you, but you had
a couple of rough games this season. How gratifying is it to, you know, have a
game like this for this type of moment?  
TRACY ABRAMS: I'm positive all of the time. I'm a leader. I'm a captain. If I
worried about the bad games that I had, what example is that to our younger
guys? For me, you know, I'm just positive. And coach does a great job, staff
does a great job helping me out regardless of the struggles I've been having
offensively.  
  
Q. Ray, when you're talking about the defense, talk about the roll that
Nnanna played today with five blocks and seven rebounds?  
RAYVONTE RICE: He's just helping us. Covering for his teammates, that's what
it's all about. Just helping each other on defense.  
  
Q. Coach, ever since you put the two freshmen in the starting lineup. I
think there's six and three with the new lineup. What do these guys that bring
to the table that's made this big improvement?  
COACH GROCE: Sure. I thought ‑‑ I've said this numerous times. I've been asked
the question obviously a lot. It was something that we had thought about doing
a little bit earlier than what we did. I just didn't feel like that either guy
at that point in time was accountable enough defensively. So we kept working
with them. They were very coachable. They were very teachable. That's okay. It
takes some time. It's a process. Once we realized that they got it, that light
bulb went on. They understood our system and understood the terminology, we
knew how talented they were in the offensive end, in terms they can make shots
and make place. What that allowed us to do was then take a bench that was
entirely compromised of five fresh men and one sophomore and have a little bit
more of a blend of experience. Obviously Ekey has played really well both as a
starter and off the bench. Joe's been a little bit up and down. But those guys
have been willing to sacrifice in order for the team to be better. So I
couldn't ask for two better seniors. I think that's been the key to the
transition. A lot of the focus has been on the freshmen and how they played
and rightly so. They played well. But I this think the senior's ability to
adapt not to be a distraction but to be an enhancer of what they're doing in
their new role, that's pretty special for a senior to did that. It's not
surprising if you know John and Joe and their DNA and their makeup, you know,
they're great people first and then obviously very good basketball players
second.  
  
Q. John, how much were you in the zone and why were you in the zone were you
in the zone more today maybe than you have in most games?  
COACH GROCE: Yeah, we used it more a little bit late in games here lately. We
did in Iowa city as well. I thought it was good for us today. You know, I
thought that you know, that on lay was trying to attack ago lieu a little bit.
So that was one of the reasons. You know, make a few passes. Try to disrupt
rhyme agents a little bit. I thought they got in a little bit of a rhythm
driving the basketball when they got out to a 38‑33 lead. Fortunately today it
was good for us. I thought we got some key stops late in the game certainly
using the zone.  
  
Q. Coach, I guess bouncing back from what happened last Tuesday, what's
kinds of the message over these next few hours basically?  
COACH GROCE: Well, we learned a lot. We take advantage of every circumstance
that we're in. I try to tell our guys how important it is to be life long
learners. We talk about that a lot. We all to live kind of up to that.
Regardless, win or loss all year, we've watched clips of every game. We
watched the clips after that game the next day. Certainly we got a lot of
respect for them. I thought they played terrific. There was some things this
the game we could have controlled a little bit better. I didn't think we
execute quite as well as we should have. We'll talk more about that this
afternoon as we prepare for tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. Going in to tomorrow, is it more important to get out to a fast start, or
how do you look at the mental side of a loss like that?  
COACH GROCE: As my college coach that just got inn ducted to the haul of fame
I talked to him yesterday, Patterson at Taylor, great coach, great hub. He
said to me, you'll be surprised 18 to 22‑year‑olds have amnesia, a lot quicker
than coaches do. Like Tracy said, if they had got too caught up, you know,
that game was a rough one for us. And we can play better. But to do what
they've done here late in the year after the losing streak, I think that's the
answer to the question. You know, they're on to the next one. You know, you
don't go to Iowa city that's a hard place to plan. Fran does a great job. Play
the way we played like three or four days later if you don't have some
toughness about you. I think our group is pretty tough. They got to understand
that that was two games ago. Tomorrow's game could be a completely different
type of game. It's a separate entity within its. We've got to play well
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Us just mentioned the word toughness, you talked about execution very
briefly and after the Michigan game you said that you saw what I saw all that
shooting. But is the missing ingredient from that game, was it toughness and
if not, what is it?  
COACH GROCE: Well, I mean, we'll look at it more obviously here this
afternoon. We already looked at the clips once before, as I just said. I
thought there was some things that we can control. We want to worry about the
things that we can control. We can always control our attitude. Always control
our effort. We can always choose to not be discouraged regardless of whether
shots were going in for us or the opponent. We can control executing and doing
our job on every possession. Those are the things that we'll take a look at.
The things you can't control, if you get too if focused on that, I think you
can drive yourself crazy in this profession and lose as much hair as I've lot.  
  
Q. The first half they hit six of ten threes they don't make another three
the rest of the way, was that a strategy at halftime or just the way the game
flowed?  
COACH GROCE: No. I was concerned at the half. We had a plan in place. I felt
like boy, if they could get the ball into the paint. They've got such great
drivers with Robinson and Williams and Ferrell is explosive, does a great job
with getting the ball into the paint. I was more concerned don't get overly
concerned about them making the ‑‑ I thought in the second half when they made
that run, to get three, ironically, I thought they livened our defense a
little bit. Give those kids credit in the second half, they stepped up. And
our guys probably get tired of me talking about them. He moves without the
ball. He seems like a great teammate. Plays hard all of the time shoots, pass
and dribble. Has good size. He just reeks of winning. I love him. He goes
three for three in the first half. As you guys know who covered them, he had
been on a tear here lately. We have a lot of respect for him. He made three
big shots in the first half of three as well as some other plays throughout
the game and fortunately we were able to weather that.

# [CBS SPORTS
CLASSIC](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=CBS+SPORTS+CLASSIC)

  

## December 20, 2014

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

North Carolina  82  
Ohio State - 74

  
ROY WILLIAMS: Opening thoughts is thank God it's Christmas. Let's get the crap
out of town and enjoy Christmas for a while. That's the opening thought. We
were fortunate, I thought we did some really good things. I thought
defensively we were pretty good, and then all of a sudden at the end we
started fouling about every possession and they were fouling, and our best
free‑throw shooters were missing free throws, and we turned it over, and then
Kennedy missed a lay‑up or maybe two inside six inches, and it didn't look
good. But we kept getting them to take one shot, and us rebounding it on the
other end. I think they cut it to eight at one time, but I was very
discouraged with the way we finished the half because they scored the last
four points of the half on easy, easy shots and we made an extremely
difficult‑‑ not extremely, but I'm trying to figure out the right thing to say
without cursing or anything.  
I was really ticked at halftime. If I want the last shot, you know what I
want? The last shot. I don't want to shoot the ball with six seconds left to
play and give them on the lay‑up on the other end, so that's my fault as a
coach. We've got to get people to understand the last shot means the last
shot. They scored the last four points, and yet early in the second half, we
would miss, they would miss, we would make, they would make, and then we had
some good plays, but totally for us it's just a weird, weird game at the end.
Kennedy rebounded the ball very well, but we didn't make enough shots, and yet
our defense was pretty doggone good, or they missed some open shots that they
normally make.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
ROY WILLIAMS: I'd say both. A coach can't say, oh, gosh, we were really good
for 33 minutes, I'll forget how we stunk it up the last seven. That just
doesn't happen. I congratulated them, because I think Ohio State is a really
good basketball team, and yet we did some very good things and had, I don't
know what the lead was, at one point in the second half, I know we had 16 in
the first half, but we were controlling the game, and then all of a sudden we
didn't. I'll tell you one thing, Marc Loving made a very difficult three from
over in the corner that goes all the way around, goes up, comes back down, and
it was challenged, so you have to congratulate him. But I can't separate‑‑ if
any coach can separate that, he's a better man than I am.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
ROY WILLIAMS: No, I wouldn't say that, but we turned it over, we had
17‑percent turnover percentage in the first half, so usually that means that
somebody is trying to hit a home run instead of just making the easy play. I
don't think we had anybody in double figures. We had a lot of guys score. We
share the ball. We're not a selfish team. Every now and then you'll make a
silly play and J.P. trying to throw it in the middle against the zone when the
game is on the line and they bat it up in the air and turned over. Kennedy's
got three guys guarding him and he has got Marcus Paige pretty good player
standing out there wide open what does he do? He fakes the pass to Marcus.
Faking the pass to an open guy is a very selfish act, and we talk about that a
lot. I told him  
Tyler Hansbrough, I let Tyler try to score against two guys, but I even made
Tyler throw it out against three. So we'll have some of those moments, but we
are an unselfish bunch.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
ROY WILLIAMS: First half Joel gave us air nice lift. I was mad at him in the
second half, because of a loose ball. He should have gotten a loose ball over
there on the far corner, but he did some good things. I guess he's had at
least three games in a row that he's given us a spark and hopefully that'll
get him started off good.  
  
Q. They've gotten an awful lot in transition this year off turnovers, and
for most of the game you guys handled it pretty well. How did you do that?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, until the very end, we didn't make many silly turnovers.
But we missed a shot‑‑ I forgot now who missed a wide‑open shot and it bounces
out and Bryce tries to stop the fast break high. I mean, Bryce against Shannon
in open court is not very smart, so now they have a three on one. I didn't
think we did. In fact, I'll put it to this, in the second half that's what I
harped on in the timeouts more than anything was sprinting back and getting
picked up because I thought that was one of the things that really hurt us.
But they've got ball handlers and shooters and they're athletic. They do a
better job of making you turn it over and playing the zone than anybody except
Syracuse, and I think they really did a nice job of that.  
  
Q. What was working so well against their zone, especially in the first
half?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, we had good movement, movement of the ball and movement of
the bodies. I always say move yourself and move the ball intelligently, and I
think we did that. We didn't make many shots. I've never seen Marcus Paige
miss as many open shots as he had in the second half, and two lay‑ups. But I
still think that says a lot about how good we can be, because eventually he's
going to start really playing. But I think it's just ball movement and player
movement.  
  
Q. A setting like this is probably good for matching up teams that are
obviously top ‑ranked teams. Do you like this for later on in the season
especially?  
A.Well, I like it a lot better than I did against Kentucky and some of those
other games that we've lost. But we play, I think I'm right on it, the
previous 11 years, I think our schedule has been ranked in the top 25 almost
every year. One year it was ranked as the most difficult schedule, and I do
believe in playing a tough schedule and hope that gets you ready for later on.
But I'm extremely relieved. I'm not sitting up here saying I'm as happy as you
can possibly be. I don't hear the happy song in my ears right now. We stunk it
up down the stretch, and I think we've got to get better there.  
  
Q. Were you expecting to have a big advantage on the inside, or did that
surprise you a little bit?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, you know, their zone, there's a big hole right in there
below the free‑throw line, but they're so athletic and quick that sometimes
they cover up for it. In practice trying to get our blue squad to simulate
that, we'd throw it in there and it was a bounce pass and a dunk almost every
time, but they can't simulate Ohio State's practicing as much as they do and
their athleticism. I think the first half we shoot 52 percent and we missed a
ton of really easy shots. But in the second half we didn't shoot it as well.  
  
Q. Big win in the house that MJ built. Do you talk to your players at all
about that, and do you get any different feelings when you come play in
Chicago?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, I think yesterday's practice was weird for us because it
was almost like we were out in left field. I said, guys, come on, we've got to
have more enthusiasm, got to have more spirit kind of thing. But they're sort
of looking around, we practiced in the practice facility and then came over
here and practiced over here and then we went outside and had a team picture
made in front of the statue and all that kind of stuff so it's a great
experience for all the guys. He's the greatest player to ever play the game. I
feel very flattered and very honored that I helped recruit him, helped coach
him, consider him a great friend, and every time I come up here, I think of a
few times in that locker room after they won the world's championships I was
up here two times when they won the world's championships. One of them may
have been in the old Chicago Stadium, I'm not sure, but the House That Michael
Built will always stand, I can tell you that.  
  
Q. You did a really nice job at kind of shutting down D'Angelo Russell who's
had a great freshman year. Can you talk about your defensive execution?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, we really thought D'Angelo was really an effective player
for them and really has been in every game. He can shoot the ball from three,
take it to the basket, he had left‑handed but he can expand and go right hand.
I think all of our guys knew how good he was and we tried to emphasize to stay
in front of the basketball. I watched last night up until, gosh, 1:00 in the
morning or something, their tape of the Louisville game, and in the Louisville
game the whole second half he played almost point guard the whole half. He was
pretty doggone good in that game. And we recruited him a little bit early, so
I know a little bit about him, but we hit him on a day where he missed some
shots that he would normally make, and hopefully we bothered him a little bit.  
  
Q. Heading into conference play what would you like to see your team improve
upon the most?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Nothing other than the game of basketball. I mean, I'm serious,
and everybody sort of giggles like you did. There is not one phase that we
can't get a lot better at, which is good. We need to shoot it better, we need
to rebound it better, we need to defend better, we need to talk more on the
defensive end. When they got the little lob for the dunk, it infuriated me
because it was just one simple little screen and we didn't talk on it. So
we've got to talk so much better and get better defensively. The other thing
is that the kids got to have some pride and toughness because it's a man's
game out there, and we missed an awful lot of easy shots today.  
  
Q. Will appearing in Chicago help the program, or does the program recruits
itself naturally?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, no program really recruits to itself. I mean, if I go see
a game, Calipari is there, if Calipari goes to see a game, Krzyzewski is
there. You know, we all work extremely hard. I'm going to see a game tonight,
so I don't think any program just recruits by itself. The coaches really work
extremely hard. But we try to play about everywhere, and I think that North
Carolina can recruit nationally and will always try to do that, and there's a
couple guys in this town that are really doggone good, every year, not just
this year.

# [CBS SPORTS
CLASSIC](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=CBS+SPORTS+CLASSIC)

  

## December 20, 2014

  

### [Shannon Scott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25236)

### [Sam Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25222)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

North Carolina  82  
Ohio State - 74

  
Q. Shannon, it seemed like when you guys were on offense that their length
made it very difficult to get inside against them and get really good two
‑point looks. I just wondered how much of an effect that had on you guys
making shots today?   
SHANNON SCOTT: I mean, they're a long team, but we settled a lot. We shot 29
three‑pointers, and we don't need to shoot that many threes to win a game. We
need to get inside the paint a little bit more to make it easier on ourselves.  
  
Q. Sam, on top of that you guys had a lot of really good looks from the
outside, and at times were some big ones if they would have gone down might
have changed the game. Was it just a tough shooting night?  
SAM THOMPSON: Yeah, we knew North Carolina were going to step up and load the
guys in the paint on our drives, and we were going to have a lot of kick‑out
threes. Like Shannon said, I think we settled a little bit. We also needed to
do a better job of stepping up and knocking down shots. That's what we've been
doing all year, and we didn't do it today.  
  
Q. Shannon and Sam, you guys are always trying to get the best out of Amir.
Can you talk about what he gives you when he's playing well and how you can
get that from him more often?  
SHANNON SCOTT: We've just got to keep him active, really. He's a great player.
We've just got to keep him motivated and keep making sure he plays every
possession.  
SAM THOMPSON: Like Shannon said, he's a great player. We think he's one of the
best defensive centers in the country. He can really dominate the game on the
defensive end. He's one of the best finishers in the country. We've got to do
a better job of getting him the ball. We've got to do a better job of getting
him the ball early.  
  
Q. Sam, for most of the game, they were able to handle your pressure pretty
well, and you guys weren't able to either buy a turnover, or rebounding you
guys weren't able to get out and run much. What was the key to that not
happening?  
SAM THOMPSON: We didn't rebound the ball. We felt that our pressure did what
we wanted it to do. They were chewing up some clock. They got some buckets in
transition after missing that made basket that we can't allow, but they bottom
line is that we knew that we had to rebound the ball. We knew they were going
to shoot a ton of threes and if they weren't shooting a great percentage, the
game would be won on the backboards, and we didn't do a good job of doing it.  
  
Q. Sam, you guys obviously didn't get the result that you wanted, but what
was it like for you to be back here in the city?  
SAM THOMPSON: It's just another game. It's another game that we have to win.
It's a big game, big‑time venue, but at the end of the day, you're not
thinking about being back home and playing. I'm just thinking about winning
the basketball game.  
  
Q. Sam, this is the second big non ‑conference game you guys have had
against a ranked opponent. How disappointing is it to have the opportunity on
this stage to maybe make a statement, prove something to yourself and come up
short?   
SAM THOMPSON: I was very disappointed not in the sense that we just came up
short but in the way that we came up short. This is the second time we've dug
ourselves a big hole and tried to fight out of it. We did a good job fighting
out of it, we did some things we wanted to do, but again, in the first half we
weren't really able to strap up, get a stop, get a bucket when we needed to,
and that hurt us again.  
  
Q. Sam, you've got two days until your next game, really quick turnaround.
As far as getting everybody back up to play on Monday, you guys are seniors,
what do you have to do?  
SAM THOMPSON: Everybody understands that we didn't show up to play today the
way we needed to, and they understand the best part about the game of
basketball is that we've got another chance to do it in less than 48 hours. We
have no issues about being ready to play. We're going to come in, we're going
to practice tomorrow, we're going to do what we need to do, and we're going to
take care of Miami.

# [CBS SPORTS
CLASSIC](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=CBS+SPORTS+CLASSIC)

  

## December 20, 2014

  

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

North Carolina  82  
Ohio State - 74

  
THAD MATTA: You guys, go ahead with questions.  
  
Q. Any general positives you took from today and general overview of where
you believe you guys are at this point?  
THAD MATTA: You know, I think as I replay the game in my mind, I give North
Carolina a lot of credit. I mean, they made all the plays they needed to make
when they needed to make them, and we weren't able, especially in the first
half, to really draw the line and say, hey, we need some consecutive stops
here, we need some consecutive scores. Today they played like the team
everybody I think thought they were going to be. I thought that they were
tremendous.  
We seem to bring the best out of a lot of people. For us, you could say a
positive is scraping, clawing back into it, but we've got to figure out why
we're getting in that position in the first half and even early into the
second half.  
  
Q. What do you need to do to be maybe the best team in the Big Ten or at
least a top ‑two team in the Big Ten? What progress do you need to make?  
THAD MATTA: Well, we've got to find an element about us just in terms of the
focus on every single possession. You look, both ways, there was a lot of
high‑level plays made out there today, and just from the standpoint of a guy,
elbow above the rim, blocking a shot both ways. When that happens against you,
you've got to pick yourself up and dust yourself off, and you've got to go
back and you've got to make the next play.  
When you're playing in a game of this magnitude, all the little things make a
big difference towards the outcome of the game, and we had some plays early on
in the game that didn't seem like much, but it all adds up, and I think that's
the biggest thing we've got to try to get our guys to understand is it's
possession by possession by possession every time you take the floor.  
  
Q. Are you getting enough production from your bigs?  
THAD MATTA: You know, I've been saying this the last couple weeks. We need
more production out of those guys, and it's not what everybody wants to say, I
need touches. Well, there's other things we can do to impact that, and
obviously we want to get an inside game established, but there's got to be
that element of consistency of knowing what we're going to get at all times.  
  
Q. In the first half what was Carolina doing offensively? Were they making
shots or were you not getting out and contesting?  
THAD MATTA: No, they were making shots. A lot of times you try to play the
percentages, and they hit early on a couple shots that ‑‑ we have charted
every shot that has been made against us, and they made two in the first 10
minutes of the game where there's only been one shot made from there all
season long, so I'm saying to myself, like, okay, that's okay, they can't make
another one percentage‑wise, and then they make it on the other side the next
time down the floor. All right.  
But I think it's the transition, the easier buckets we gave them. And then we
had chances to finish and didn't finish. We had some right at the bucket, and
their size affects that. There's no doubt about it.  
  
Q. D'Angelo had some good looks, didn't go down, maybe took a few shots you
probably didn't want him to take. How do you assess the way he played the game
today and how important is his production for the team's success?  
THAD MATTA: Well, D'Angelo is obviously a pivotal part of what we do. He had
some that really, really went in and out and I thought good looks. The great
thing about him is he wants to take the shot. He doesn't remember the last
shot. He says, hey, give me the next one, and I love that about him. I thought
overall he had a pretty good command. Unfortunately shots just didn't fall for
him.  
  
Q. You get into a situation like this and your seniors have played a ton of
big games in big environments and things like that. I looked at halftime and I
think the five of them had a combined 10 points and six rebounds and were
shooting 10 of 30 or something like that, very low percentage. They played
much better in the second half. Was there a message at halftime that we're
leaning on you guys and you need to pick it up? Where are you with that right
now?  
THAD MATTA: No, I didn't, per se, say that. It's more just in lines of the
adjustments that we had to make. Like you said, those guys have been in some
big basketball games, but we have to figure out why we put ourselves in that
position. If it's those guys playing better or whatever it is playing better,
those have got to be the things that we've got to collectively do a better job
of.  
  
Q. Along the lines of how you got into that hole, it seemed some of the
possessions resembled at Louisville where guys were trying to put the team on
their back and do it all on their own several possessions in a row without
working the half ‑court set. Was that troubling that they didn't have the
patience to work the ball and try to get the good shot, instead tried to get
it to the rim and could never get the ball to the rim?  
THAD MATTA: Well, yeah, definitely, but I think a lot of that goes to
Carolina's defense. That's one of the best defenses in the country, and you
look at the size, you've got to make‑‑ you're going to have to make some tough
shots in order to beat those guys just in terms of their length. We had a
couple possessions where we really, really moved the basketball and missed
open shots, but you've got to stay and you've got to do it the next
possession, you've got to do it the next possession. I think those are things
that we have to continue to build on in terms of getting ourselves better and
putting ourselves in a better position early on in basketball games.  
  
Q. D'Angelo looks like full of life, energy, all that kind of stuff. What's
it like coaching him?  
THAD MATTA: Well, it's a pleasure coaching him because he cares. D'Angelo
wants to win, most importantly. He wants to be a great player. He's a kid
that's very hard on himself, which is a good thing. We need more guys like
that that know they didn't particularly shoot the ball well or whatever, but
chances are he'll probably be in the gym tonight when we get back.  
  
Q. This was obviously D'Angelo's first game against this type of length. I
don't know if that affected his shooting or not, but what does he have to
learn from this game as far as going against those kind of defenders?  
THAD MATTA: Well, you know, I think he's at times maybe shooting the pull‑up
as opposed to one more dribble because he has a great mid‑range game. When you
get in there amongst 6'10", 6'10", and 6'8" swiping at it, it makes it a
little bit more of a challenge, but maybe just the one quick dribble because
he's elusive with the ball, he can get by guys, but by the same token he finds
guys. We didn't do a great job moving for him when he stepped up trying to
find guys.  
  
Q. You've talked about how you continued to show the Louisville tape, and at
times maybe it's been hard between now and then how to assess how far you guys
have actually come. Now that you've played another team on your level and on
Louisville's level, how do you assess the growth of your team? Are you happy
with where you guys are standing a few days away from Big Ten play?  
THAD MATTA: Yeah, I think there's obviously issues. We've got two losses to
two really, really, really good basketball teams, great basketball teams. I
think to put ourselves in that position, we've got to look ourselves in the
mirror and say, hey, we're not there yet, which is fine, but we've got to look
at all the little things that we have to do to get better and get that
established. Knowing that it's‑‑ I don't want to say it's early, but it's
still December, we've got January, February, March still to play basketball.
How much better can we get in that time.

_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Kentucky  83  
UCLA - 42

  
JOHN CALIPARI: My only comment is these guys are so excited about going home
for Christmas and spending four days with their families. It showed on that
basketball court. They were excited about playing, and I think just as
excited, they are running out of here right now.  
  
Q. Devin, could you talk about the way you were part of the 16 ‑0 run, you
were watching and then came in and got the next eight points to make it 24‑0?
  
DEVIN BOOKER: I think most importantly they started out with energy. Everyone
is excited, we're all excited to go home, and we knew we had to go through
this first game and it wasn't going to be easy, but we just brought energy to
the floor, and that's what put it over the top.  
  
Q. Devin, how does it play on your mind when you see the score is 24 ‑0 or
41‑7?   
DEVIN BOOKER: We have to deep playing against our self. Coach always stresses
to us that we're not playing against the other team, we're against ourselves.
Just keep playing, and you can't look at the score, just keep going.  
  
Q. Tyler, two days ago your coach talked about teams licking their chops to
play you guys. Can you imagine that anybody is licking their chops now?  
TYLER ULIS: I'm pretty sure people are still out there trying to get a game
with us, to beat us, just because we're sitting at No.1 team right now. But as
a team we're not really worried about that. Just like Devin said, we just got
to keep playing against ourselves, which coach stresses, and just try to go
out there and try to win and compete.  
  
Q. Tyler, how did this match ‑up for your expectations for your homecoming?
  
TYLER ULIS: It was fun coming out here, getting a big win like that, coming
out with energy, like you said. Andrew and Aaron started off the run so well,
and then we came in and just pushed it from there, so it's great to win like
that at home.  
  
Q. Tyler had six assists, Andrew had eight. What is it like to have two
point guards like that going at them and different looks defensively and
offensively?  
TYLER ULIS: It's hard for them because we're coming in five in, five out, and
we're just trying to wear the other team down. They came out with energy,
which made it even better. When we came out on the floor they were really
tired and gassed, and it just helps us even more.  
  
Q. Just curious, when it's seven points at halftime, how long do you say,
hey, we don't want to give them double figures? It was 22 minutes or so.  
TYLER ULIS: Yeah, we just came out trying to do the same thing in the second
half. They got a couple baskets early, but as a team we're just trying to push
ourselves, play against ourselves, like Coach says, again, and just play hard.  
  
Q. Devin, is your shot different now than it was earlier when you were
struggling with it, and if so, why?  
DEVIN BOOKER: I wouldn't say it's different at all. I keep all my mechanics
the same, always. I always have my whole life. I feel like shooters go through
slumps sometimes and you have to shoot your way out of it. When you have a
team behind you that tells you to keep shooting it and a coach that tells you
to keep shooting it, it makes it easy for me.  
  
Q. Tyler, you know Devin pretty well. When his shot wasn't falling what did
you expect to happen and what did you see out of him? Did you see him going to
the gym late at night?  
TYLER ULIS: Devin is really confident in his jump shot. We go back and forth
about who shoots better. He was in a slump, but he kept playing, kept
shooting. Every time he was in a slump, he just told me I'm going to keep
shooting the ball, keep shooting, and it's getting better.  
  
Q. Devin, what kind of looks were you getting today?  
DEVIN BOOKER: A lot of good looks. I think Aaron started the game out with two
big threes because they started out in a zone‑and‑one to cram the middle, but
once he did that they had to open it up and give our bigs man‑to‑man looks so
we threw them it into our big, and my man would help and it just gave me a
wide‑open shot. Dakari made passes and made it a lot easier on me.  
  
Q. Have you ever been in a game like that where you just sort of removed all
hope from the other team so quickly?  
DEVIN BOOKER: Not at this level. In high school, of course, playing against
competition like that, but today I feel like as a team it was a great
performance. We came out with energy, and we just kept it up throughout the
entire game.  
  
Q. Coach, you're heading into the Louisville game undefeated. You held one
of the best scoring teams in college basketball to seven points at the half.
At what point in your mind do you start thinking you could be in the middle of
something historic this season?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I'm day‑to‑day. I'm in a grind and I'm staying in the moment.
The one thing I'm doing is really enjoying these guys. We can all talk about
defense and blocking shots and playing hard, but you've got 10 guys, 11 guys
sharing minutes. You have two point guards that are two of the best point
guards in the country, both of them, and sharing minutes. You have big guys,
Karl Towns and Dakari Johnson, sharing minutes. You have Willie, one of the
best big guys in the country, sharing minutes with Marcus Lee. You've got
Aaron Harrison, who's really good, and then you've got Devin sharing minutes.
That's the story, and I would say to all of you, if it were your son and he
had pro potential and he was on that board to be drafted, would you be okay
with him playing 20 minutes? I mean, we've got a great group of parents that
accept and trust that we have their sons' back, and we've got a great group of
kids. I mean, that's the story. We're playing‑‑ today we played 11, but no one
played more than 23 minutes. Andrew and Aaron played 23 minutes. No one else
did. That was it. Everybody else played 18‑to‑20 minutes.  
  
Q. After the Kansas game the first thing you said was we're not that good.
What about are you guys this good?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, this game, the way we started, we haven't always done
that, and that's why these two kept saying about energy. I thought Andrew
Harrison was unbelievable. I mean, he did stuff, flying up and down the court.
He had eight assists. He could have had two others that were kind of dropped,
and he could have had a 10‑assist game in 23 minutes. What? Missed a couple
shots, and I keep telling him, quit playing to get fouled. Score. You can get
10, 12 points in the time you're playing and get assists, and then it's‑‑
Tyler is different. He's just a different kind of point guard. But see, I've
been in there where there are times where smaller point guards, you just can't
leave them in the game if you're trying to win at the highest level. Late in
the game, they've got a 6'3" point guard that can just score over him, he
couldn't be in at that point. But I'll tell you this, he makes a difference in
the game just pressuring the ball, sprinting it up the court. I had to get on
him. I said, score the ball in the second half. Shoot the ball and score,
because he's getting away from that, and that makes him even better as a
player.  
  
Q. What did you tell ‑‑  
JOHN CALIPARI: Again, I just said, that's our good game right there. That's as
good as we go, and I told Steve that, and to be honest with you, I think we're
both worried about coaching our own teams. I didn't look at the score like in
the first half, I did not know what the score was. I knew it was pretty good,
but I did not look‑‑ to be honest, I couldn't find it in the arena. I didn't
know where it was. The second half I glanced up there one time because they
said it's over there in the end zone. That's up there. Which is fine, and
that's the best way to coach if you don't have to look at that scoreboard,
you're just looking at your team.  
Believe me, Karl Towns, he's got to be better, and he's better. Ten rebounds,
but he's still a scorer, but you can't run plays to score for him because they
double‑team, then you're a passer. So that means you've got to fight down the
court and create positions so we can throw to you early so they can't
double‑team. There's things, Dakari, the same thing. Marcus Lee has got to be
more focused. I thought Trey Lyles was great today, too. He played a great
ballgame. And Trey is playing guards. Here's a 6'10" center in high school
playing guards, and then Willie is 7‑foot and all of a sudden you are a 6'3"
guard, and you're like, why are you on me? And he can guard him. See, I think
Marcus Lee could do it, he's just got as confident or focused as Willie right
now.  
  
Q. You said a few games back that this team could, if it wants to be, a
defensive team for the ages. At halftime you guys were on pace for NCAA
records for points allowed and field ‑goal percentage. Have they truly bought
into that idea, and do you think this is an all‑time defensive team?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I don't know. We're going to let this thing play out. I can
tell you, again, we gave up 20 offensive rebounds. We are the worst defensive
rebounding tall team in the history of basketball. We give up too many
offensive rebounds, and it's going to cost you. This team missed a lot of
shots, a lot of open shots, and after they settled down, they made those shots
in the second half. As we go forward, we've got one thing, how do we continue,
let's make this world class. How do we become that world‑class team, and it's
real simple. One, you have few errors and you have no unforced errors. That's
what a world‑class team is about. The second thing a world‑class team is
about, they absolutely enjoy, even the tough times. They enjoy playing. You
know, we're trying to build something here to say, you're going out, playing
against yourself, and you hear these kids talking about it. World‑class teams
play against themselves, they don't play against the opponent. So if we're to
be that, but please don't compare us to teams in college that have three Hall
of Famers on their teams, like real Hall of Fame, like Hall of Fame, Hall of
Fame, three and four, and don't compare us to them. What we are, playing the
way we're playing is a high‑energy team for 40 minutes, but it's not helter
skelter. See, in my opinion, 40 minutes of helter skelter doesn't teach the
kids how to play to prepare them for that next, where they're trying to go.
How do you play pick‑and‑roll? How do you play your man? How do you stop
straight‑line drives? How do you dig off the weak side? We're not just going
to scramble and trap‑and‑run and all of a sudden we're playing a game, but‑‑
so we are playing aggressive and we're playing fast, but we're trying to make
sure‑‑ loved it. We set up some stuff for Dakari and Willie to shoot jumpers.
Walking out, I said, let them shoot that elbow shot, Dakari, because he can
make it. Here's a kid who's in the gym every night working on that. Why
shouldn't I let him do that? Why shouldn't people know that he can do it?
These kids are spending extra time at night on their own with the coaches.
They deserve all these good things, but more important, you think of the kind
of kids they are that they're sharing these minutes. It's hard now. And then
they're being compared‑‑ well, he's not that good. How about this statement:
Are you ready, this statement? He's not going to get the numbers to be the
best player in the country. Was that your hope or your opinion? See, people
can watch these guys in 20 minutes and know how really good they are. They
don't need 40 minutes, and these kids are great. We're a really good team with
a bunch of guys, 10 guys that all can score double figures.  
  
Q. With playing 11 guys like that, going into the season, it had to be a big
concern of yours, just how the players and like their families would handle
it. When did you become convinced that wouldn't be a problem?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, we went to Bahamas and it worked, and that's why we went
to the Bahamas, and we played professional teams, older teams, professional.
We didn't play the normal team that you're going to beat by 100. We wanted to
know against good teams would it work, and everybody ate, if you know what I'm
saying. Everybody felt full. And then I knew. Jay Bilas gave a great talk
about the clutter that the media will try to break you down, they're going to
evaluate one against another. They'll really promote one guy to try to
separate the team and make the other guy out to be a schmo. I've got no schmos
on this team. And he went through what would happen. We call it clutter, you
know, the clutter of what's going on around. They also have to hear clutter
that's close to them, and they've got to withstand it all, and they are. I
think the story is how good are these kids, and how strong are these families
and how trusting they are. Willie said it after the Kansas game. He came in
and said, we trust the coaches, and we trust each other. That's what this is.
It's a group of kids that trust. Now, it doesn't mean we're not going to get
dinged. It doesn't mean there's not something‑‑ I'm not married to platoons,
folks. I'm not. I'm doing it because it's the best thing for the players. I've
never done this in my life. I've never coached this way. I'll tell you the
truth, I kind of like it. I don't have to worry about subbing. Think about
taking that off a coach's plate. I don't have to worry about subbing. You're
going in in two minutes. Like Marcus Lee, you don't get a rebound, you don't
block out, things that we worked on, you're out. That's an easy one. But I
don't have to worry about who's tired, who's not. But will I ever do this
again? I doubt it. I'll go right back to the seven, six, eight guys I'll have.
Next year that's what we'll have, and we'll play that. But I'm enjoying this.
There's nothing that anybody is going to say or do to get me to not‑‑ I wake
up every morning. If we don't practice I'm antsy, and I'm sending them emails,
and they're like, oh, please, Coach, stop.  
  
Q. It seems like the bigger the stage, the better your guys have been. How
much have they embraced these big settings?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, the veterans, you know how well Andrew played, how well
Aaron played in the NCAA Tournament. You think about the veterans and how they
play, if they're kind of dragging all these young kids. But my young kids are
really‑‑ Tyler, Devin, Trey and Karl are really‑‑ I'll take mine, you take
yours. I like mine. They're really good. But they also have these veterans
that are there for them.  
But each of them are feeding each other. Each group is feeding the other. Like
they said, when that first group starts like that and they can go in and just
run it right down too, we're really good. Listen, we were down 11‑0 to
Columbia, like no, it was going to go 15‑0\. It was 11‑0 to Columbia. We were
down five to Buffalo at halftime. We were down to Boston U at half. They're
not machines and they're not computers. They don't play great every time out.

## December 20, 2014

  

### [Bryce Alford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28012)

### [Steve Alford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17050)

### [Kevon Looney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28013)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Kentucky  83  
UCLA - 42

  
STEVE ALFORD: Well, obviously a very difficult first half. Haven't been
involved in many halves like that, and I'm sure our guys haven't, either. That
was the tough part. I thought we settled down much more in the second half,
had a little bit of a tendency to do that in the Gonzaga game, as well. But
when you're playing a team like this, you just can't get yourselves in a hole
like we got ourselves in a hole in the first 20 minutes. That's a tough one.
There are no excuses. We just didn't get the job done on either side of the
ball in that first 20 minutes, and that made it really, really difficult for
us.  
  
Q. Bryce, Coach Alford mentioned starting the Gonzaga game. What explains
that tendencies to start games like that?  
BRYCE ALFORD: I can't really tell you honestly. We've just got to focus more
and be ready to play right out of the gate. We can't come out scared, we can't
come out tentative or passive. We've got to come out and know the capabilities
we have as a team and trust each other and trust our abilities and just be
aggressive right out of the gate.  
  
Q. Could you maybe talk about how much credit does Kentucky maybe deserve
for the way the game started, 24 ‑0?   
BRYCE ALFORD: Yeah, obviously they're one of the best teams in the country if
not the best team in the country right now. You've got to give credit to them.
They made it extremely hard on us and they took our confidence out of us right
at the beginning of the game, and they put it to us from then on. Definitely a
lot of credit to them.  
  
Q. Steve, when they jump off to that 16 ‑0 start and you call a time‑out
what do you say to the guys in the huddle?   
STEVE ALFORD: You know, it's not because they don't care and they're not
trying. The guys are trying hard, and they're giving great effort. It's just
when nothing goes right, it gets very frustrating and kind of steamrolls. I
think that's what happened at the start of the game. The ball didn't move. We
took shots off 0, 1, 2 passes, and you're playing a defensive team like this,
this team is long‑‑ I've been here 24 years, and I thought Bo Ryan's team, my
fourth year at Manchester, when we were both 31‑0, I thought that was an
awfully good team that we played in the championship game from a Division III
standpoint. I don't know in my 20 years of coaching at the Division I level
that I've coached against a better team than what this team looks like. They
have everything. They can shoot the basketball much better against us tonight
than they have in the long time, but they're long, they're athletic, they
present so many problems for you because they're so deep, and your first
question to Bryce, how does it happen when you list Carolina and Gonzaga and
Kentucky? When we played them, I think Carolina was sixth, Kentucky is one,
Gonzaga is nine. This is a team that is full of inexperience. It's not an
excuse. We had three guys go hardship. This team we just played had three guys
that could have entered the draft and came back. There's a reason why they're
where they're at, and our guys are fighting. As long as they keep fighting and
we learn, we're probably not ready‑‑ now, I'm not giving any excuses for
41‑7\. That should not take place. That's bad, and our guys know that, and
they feel bad about it. The next 20 we settled down. We had similar games
against Carolina and Gonzaga, but they're not ready for that. We've got one
returning starter, Norman Powell. He was the only guy in the starting lineup
for us last year. In my mind those are the reasons for those three games. Now,
in a month from now will we be able to play a team that's nationally ranked
and do the things? I hope so. That's what we have to be able to do.  
But the expectation obviously is big, regardless, but we do have to be a
little bit‑‑ I've told the media at the beginning of the year, you've got to
be patient. I've said it, there are going to be games where you go, whoa, how
did these guys do that, and then there are going to be games just like today
where you go, whoa, how did that happen? But I'm not going to quit on these
guys. Am I frustrated and down? Sure, but we'll get back. After the break,
we'll get back and we'll keep fighting, and this group will keep getting
better. But they're a little bit inexperienced now to play a team‑‑ at least I
told these guys, in my 24 years of coaching, this is the best team I've
coached against. This team is really, really good. It doesn't excuse a 41‑7
half, but we'll get better and we'll learn from it.  
  
Q. Bryce, when you go to the locker room with seven points, what do you say
to each other and how do you come up with a plan coming into the second
half?  
BRYCE ALFORD: That's the hard part. None of us have ever been in that
situation. None of us have ever had a seven‑point half before, been down that
much at half or really at any point. Yeah, it's tough, and as leaders with
Norm and myself and even Kevon, we've got to try to just keep our spirits up
and just have everybody believe, not only in themselves but each other and
just try to keep the spirits up and get us ready to go out and have a better
second half.  
  
Q. Kevon, I don't think you've seen a team ‑‑ you definitely haven't seen a
team this tall, probably won't see a team this tall again. What's it like to
play against a team that has three guys that are 6'11" or taller?   
KEVON LOONEY: It was pretty difficult, hard to get scoring angles on your
layups and try to finish over the top, the real long, great shot blockers. But
it was a lot of fun and a great experience playing out there. Hopefully we see
them again, because that was embarrassing and we want another stab at it. But
it was a lot of fun, and that was really good. It makes it really difficult.  
  
Q. Kevon, what goes through your mind when it gets to 24 ‑0? Are you even
conscious of the score at that point or do you just write it off as a bad day?
  
KEVON LOONEY: Very, very conscious of it. You've got to score a basket. That's
terrible. You never should play a game where you score seven points in a half.
Coach drills us better than that in practice and we're a much better offensive
team than that. Going through my head, we've got to score. We've got to make
the game closer, and we couldn't do it.  
  
Q. What was it that was different about the way Kentucky plays defense than
other teams you've faced? Obviously size is a part of it, but what stood out
to you?  
KEVON LOONEY: I would say mainly just the size. We couldn't get to the basket
how we wanted. When we did get there it wasn't easy to finish. When we was
driving we wanted to kick it out and we didn't get no movement in the first
half, so their shot blocking really made a difference.  
  
Q. Steve, when he says we hope to see them again and like another stab at it
‑‑  
STEVE ALFORD: Not right now. (Laughter). I appreciate Kevon's enthusiasm, but
not right now. But Kevon, I've been around a long time as a player and as a
coach, and I played for the best in Coach Knight. When you talk about a Dream
Team, a team that‑‑ other than Ulis, who then Ulis comes in and gives you a
whole different element because the starting five that they have, they can
basically switch five ways, and Coach Knight, I think that was always his
dream, that he could get five guys 6'7" and 6'8" and just switch everything.
That's hard to score on. That's why if you look at their numbers‑‑ they've
played 12 games now. Look at their numbers. They're holding teams ‑‑ we scored
42, we came into this game, they were holding teams to 48. We're not the only
team that they've really pounded that way from that standpoint. They're really
good defensively. They can switch on you, they guard the pick‑and‑rolls well,
and then when you beat them‑‑ and I thought we did, we got some angles, we
beat them, but then you've got two guys 6'10", 6'11", 7‑foot, one of them
jumps, if he misses it, the other one gets it. You don't see that kind of
size, and I think that affects you, and that's hard to prepare for.  
Going into a week here and trying to prep for this, you can't simulate what
you see. I joked with Cal before the game because Coach Schilling came up to
me before the game and said, hey, I know when you prepare for teams and then
you see them in person, the majority of the teams have over‑hyped sizes and
the sizes aren't correct. He came up to me, and he goes, that's not true with
this team. It's legit. What they are size‑wise is legit, and when you have
that kind of size, you can do so many different things defensively. Give Cal
credit, give his staff credit. They've really got this team playing hard at
the defensive end. They continue to play at that level defensively, I'm a firm
believer they've got a chance to run this thing out. They're that good,
they're that talented.  
  
Q. You talked about the lack of experience on your team. How do you use this
game as a teaching tool?  
STEVE ALFORD: Well, you communicate with them just like we did at halftime,
just like we did at postgame. You come back‑‑ I don't know how much video you
want to show them of this game because it's a sensitive deal, because we've
got to have confidence moving forward. But there's teaching moments. For
instance, in the first half, the ball didn't move. We're a team where the ball
has got to move. In the second half the ball moved, and we got better shots,
and we made shots. Even if we would have missed those shots in the second
half, we got better shots in the second half. So we can teach that way.  
Defensively we've got to look at how we're guarding, how we were set up. For
instance, Booker, we didn't want to‑‑ we didn't really want to come off Booker
and we give him all kinds of open looks, so we have a lot of breakdowns, and
right now our defense is too much predicated on what's happening offensively.
If we're good offensively then we do some better things defensively, and
that's what a young, inexperienced team does. We've got to learn from that.
We've got to get tougher and nastier and better defensively, which I think
that'll help our offense. These three ranked opponents, they bring those
things out in you. That's why they're ranked. That's why they're really good.
They're going to exploit that and bring it out, and those things have been
exposed. It hadn't been so exposed in the other games. We've been able to do
pretty well in those, but when you play teams like that, that's going to get
exposed to you.  
  
Q. When you watch the tape on them, do they look different when the jersey
is Kansas or UCLA or even when they played Texas?  
STEVE ALFORD: You know, that's hard. Obviously they probably played really
well against Kansas and they played really well against us. Cal told me it was
the best they've played all year. He might have been just being nice. But
those are two games that I would say they played at a really high level. But
you're 12‑0\. What's the win margin? 28 coming into tonight? That didn't go
down. You've got a win margin of 30‑plus and you've played 12 games and you've
played the likes of Kansas and UCLA and played Providence and played Texas,
and they played a pretty‑good schedule, and they're 12‑0 with a plus‑30 win
margin and they're holding teams to about 45 points. So even if you say, hey,
Columbia played them a little bit tougher or Boston ‑‑ you've got a target on
your back the size of the state of Kentucky the way it is. For them to perform
at the level‑‑ you're coming into break, those are always tough games to begin
with. I thought they were tremendous. Cal has got them playing at a very high
level, believing in what they want to do. Like I said, I don't know of too
many teams in my career that I've coached against that's been any better.  
  
Q. Barring additional injury for them, what is it going to take? What kind
of team is it going to take to beat them?  
STEVE ALFORD: You know, they're a hard team to man, and we tried zoning, and
that didn't work. So we went man, and they're a very difficult team to man
because they've got very good inside out, and if the Harrisons, if they'll
shoot and play that way and that‑‑ I thought they were really under control
and did a lot of good things tonight as far as shot selection, and if they
make shots like that, they even become harder to play against because they're
just so hard to guard. I would think if a team can come in with a lot of
length and throw a zone out there that's got length and really gets them out
of the paint to where they have to shoot jump shot after jump shot, okay, and
that might sound like a good game plan, but they rebound‑‑ for every two shots
they take, they rebound one of them. It's just a hard team to play against. I
think their key is defensively. I really think this is a team that if you
guard them well and they score 50 points and shoot 20 percent from the field,
they still beat you because they hold you to 35. I just think that's their
makeup. This team is focused, it's driven. There's not a weakness on the team.
It is, it wasn't a fun team for me to watch today, but I'll enjoy watching it
the rest of the season, because it's good basketball that's really well
coached with really good players.  
  
Q. You know what it's like to make it to a title game undefeated. What does
it take or what will it take for this Kentucky team mentally to be able to
‑‑  
STEVE ALFORD: You know, I did it at the Division III level. Bo and I both had
undefeated teams going into that, but that was fun. You're going to be down
six or seven with a minute to go and try to figure a way that pull that out.
Who knows what's going to happen in league play. But they're such a dominant
team, I think it really is a mindset. If they have no injuries, further
injuries, it's really a mindset within the players. They know what they have
to do. It's just staying driven where you've got to play pretty much all of us
are going to be playing two games a week now, so you're away from the three
games in three days, or we went through seven games in 14 days. You're away
from that now. Now it's two games a week. Really taking care of their bodies
off the court, not listening to all the‑‑ it's going to be hard because
they're going to get praised a lot, and they deserve that praise. But if what
they truly want and what they're truly trying to get to, you've got to kind of
block all that out and listen to your coaching staff and know that there's
still room to get better, and that's the scary part about them. I think they
can probably still get better as they continue to get more and more experience
and they go along this thing. As it grows, I think a lot of times you think
that there becomes more pressure. I think as it grows, they're going to get
hungrier with it. Just looking at their demeanor, this thing reaches 18, 19,
20 in a row, you may not get them because I think they'll get really hungry
and think that they can do it now.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 26, 2014

  

### [Rondae Hollis-
Jefferson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26943)

### [Stanley Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27925)

### [Sean Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18211)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Arizona  61  
San Diego State  59

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Coach Sean Miller, Rondae Hollis‑Jefferson, and
Stanley Johnson to the interview room. Opening statement on tonight's game?  
COACH MILLER: First of all, the respect we have for San Diego State can't be
any greater. We have some great, great games, important games, championship or
in the NCAA tournament, and it was a big difference between winning them and
losing them. But believe me, although we've won a few in a row here, each of
those games could have gone to their side. Tonight was no different.  
So when you play them, you get better and learn a lot about your team. To win
the championship here at the Maui Invitational, you need great players, and
you need players that rise up to a challenge, and these two guys right here,
they earned their all‑tournament accolades by their performance. Not their
reputation, but how they played in these three games in three days. So we
leave here feeling very good about what we accomplished. I know we have a long
way to go, but I feel like our team really took a big step, grew up, improved,
and that's what happens when you challenge yourself against this type of
competition.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players?  
  
Q. Just being a freshman, are you surprised at how quickly you've adjusted
to the college game?  
STANLEY JOHNSON: I don't think I've fully adjusted yet, to be honest. There is
still a lot of stuff that we do as a team that I'm not physically good at yet.
I think I've gotten a lot better since I got here, and I know me and Coach
Miller in the meeting, he's just telling me to get better every day, even if
it's a little bit. I've been feeling that part of it ever since that meeting.
So I still have a long way to go as a player on the team. But little stuff our
team knows about, but I've definitely gotten better?  
  
Q. Rondae, can you talk about the defense on both sides tonight? It seemed
like a real battle out there?  
RONDAE HOLLIS‑JEFFERSON: Well, San Diego State, they're a tough team, great
defensively. We knew it would be a war out there tonight, and our coach told
us that from the beginning. We take pride in our defense, and we all know that
defense comes first, defense wins championships, and we just took our time out
there and we were patient and it showed out there.  
  
Q. Stanley, you had a great block with about eight minutes left. Just talk
about that play and how it energized your team?  
STANLEY JOHNSON: Saw them going down the lane, and we (No Microphone), picks
up the ball. Took a bad shot, and it was an error, so I just tossed the
bounce.  
  
Q. Coming down the stretch, you might not have adjusted to the game, but you
adjusted to the spotlight in terms of having to hit those big free throws. And
you had a lot of them at the end, and you stepped up to a lot of plays. Just
talk about that?  
STANLEY JOHNSON: At practice every day, Coach Miller takes free‑throw shooting
seriously. So it makes it easy to focus when you practice it. You practice it
in free throws, and you take it seriously in games and when it comes down to
it, you come to the line, knock the free throws down and go the other way?  
  
Q. Stanley, I saw in most of the game your mouth piece is hanging out. Do
you even realize you're doing that?  
STANLEY JOHNSON: I just started wearing the mouth piece this week. It's hard
to talk, and sometimes hard to breathe, especially in a hot gym like this. I
need to be able to communicate on defense, so sometimes I take it out at the
beginning of the play we scout stuff, and if I see something coming, I'll say
watch out for this, that, and the other. During the play I'll put it back in
and I can grunt and moan or something like that and they can see me coming
through or whatever. But it's definitely not one of these things where I'm
playing with something in my mouth, but I'm trying to talk.  
  
Q. Stanley, I know you've been on a lot of big stages before you came to
Arizona. How did this compare being a freshman in such a big tournament and
then with the free throws and everything you did tonight. How did it feel out
there?  
STANLEY JOHNSON: It doesn't compare to what happened in high school. It's a
whole different type of deal here at Arizona. This game is a lot more intense,
lot more energy used, a lot more effort. At the end of the game, you come up
short here, and you go home with a really bad taste in your mouth. I think all
of our team has a lot of heart and a lot of leadership, starting with Coach
Miller, to T.J. and Brandon, Kaleb, to Rondae. We have a lot of guys that
don't like losing here. That just helps me out, and I'm the same way. So as
they go, I go. I think they're doing a great job helping me out.  
  
Q. Rondae, can you talk a little bit about what this three wins in three
days, the tournament title? Where can you go from here? Where can this kind of
propel you right now?  
RONDAE HOLLIS‑JEFFERSON: Thanksgiving dinner (laughing). Seriously, you know,
it's great to win tournaments like this. Very prestigious, great tournament to
be at during this time. To come out with a victory is big time, big time,
definitely big time. I think it's about the grind. It doesn't stop here. You
win and you want to keep winning. So you've got to go back to practice and
keep working hard and just prepare for the next win. Take it day by day, get
better, honor the practice and work hard. You've got to enjoy it, man. Enjoy
it, reap the benefits, and keep moving.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Miller.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Stanley who was named the tournament MVP for this
tournament?  
COACH MILLER: Well, we know Stanley very well. We recruited him really for a
number of years. This past summer I was one of his assistant coaches on team
USA under 18, and I learned a lot about Stanley during that period of time. I
feel like it was helpful here establishing a few things once he became a
freshman at Arizona. When you have a player like him that is already given so
many accolades before he ever plays a game or even practices, there is a fine
line of bringing his talent along, and at the same time teaching him. I would
say that over the last four or five weeks, Stanley as a player in our program
has really become more of a student, like everybody else. He practices hard,
makes mistakes, tries to learn from them. And that spurred him on to, I think,
where he played in this tournament. If we would have played this tournament a
month ago, he would not have been the MVP. But what I hope happens is a month
from now that he's even more consistent on defense and some of the things that
we're going to need him to be for our team to grow.  
So we're pleased with Stanley as much as anything, because he's on the right
track being very coachable, being a good teammate, and working hard. That's
really where it starts especially with someone who has the talent that he has
as a freshman.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that same question I asked the players. What can this
week mean for the team from here?  
COACH MILLER: Well, we're excited that we won this tournament. Sometimes over
the long haul we're in a program of great expectations. I think we all have to
be careful that we enjoy what we're doing, and enjoy Maui, enjoy being here
with each other, and enjoy this great moment that we have tonight, a
hard‑earned championship.  
Now having said that, when we get back we'll have two games. We play Gonzaga
next Saturday. So if we're not working to become better, we'll find out right
away what happens when we play that game. We also play Gardner‑Webb, beat
Clemson earlier. There is so much parity in college basketball. If we rest on
our laurels and not improve the things we need, we won't continue to have the
success we had in this tournament. But we have a good group. Rondae and
Stanley both guys know how to win. They came to Arizona in large part to try
to win these types of things that we're in. So from that perspective, we have
a great group of kids and we're excited to move on.  
  
Q. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on what you and Stanley were
going for there. Whether a lot of what you wanted from him was that approach
and attitude, things like that or is it more so skills? You had said he was
kind of a different attitude starting the year.  
COACH MILLER: Stanley is a very intelligent kid. Played at Mater Dei High
School. Think about this, he won four consecutive California State
Championships. I think he's won three gold medals, and yet never played in
college. So he came to us very decorated as a winner. I kind of let about six
to eight weeks ago just trying to talk to him and watch him move through it.
Then I think the meeting he's talked about was one of those where he needed to
do a better job working every day. He didn't know how hard college basketball
was. None of these guys do. But to his credit, like I said over the last four
to six weeks, he's really, really turned that part around. I think his
teammates expected a great deal. All of a sudden, he plays like he played
here. And that's what happens when you process like we tried to talk about.  
He's doing a better job of making every day important, and not cutting
corners. That's why he came to college so that he gets better on and off the
court. And I think he's really doing that.  
  
Q. You really stopped them the last eight, nine minutes of the game. I think
outside of those last two threes, they had one basket. Did you change
something? Did you notice some tendencies? What happened there? Did you guys
just sort of dig in?  
COACH MILLER: No, we really didn't change. Sometimes if you're a very good
defensive team, and I think we are, as the game wears on, it becomes harder
and harder to score against you if you stick to what you do well.  
Rondae Jefferson is an incredible defensive player, and once we got through
not fouling, we didn't foul as much in the end as we did throughout, that
helped us. The story line goes both ways. San Diego State had a bad night from
the foul line. They needed to make their free throws tonight. If they did, we
might have lost. As coaches we've all been there. In games like this, you need
everything. Their free‑throw shooting certainly hurt them. Nothing like we
did.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 26, 2014

  

### [Thomas Gipson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26659)

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Pittsburgh  70  
Kansas State- 47

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your opening thoughts on this afternoon's game?  
COACH WEBER: Not much we can say. Obviously we're disappointed. They just out
toughed us. I thought we got off to a good start. I thought a key was going to
be our bench because we had played two very, very hard fought games the last
two days. We used a lot of energy, so I thought the bench would be key.  
So probably put too many guys in at one time where we were up 10‑4 or
something, and they made the run to get it back. We never really got going
again. They just had more toughness, more will to win, competitive spirit. We
have guys play 34, 34, 34, 34, and they had the same schedule as us. They came
over and played Hawaii, so there is no excuses.  
I thought we had very‑‑ we had to share the ball better. When we move the ball
and get it to open people, we're a better team. There was one possession in
the first half where we moved the ball and got Nino a little jumper. After
that we didn't seem to make the extra pass, get it to where we didn't have
much continuity. That's my fault. We've got to go home and learn a lot about
our team, and see we can make some strides.  
  
Q. Thomas, I know you can't use fatigue as an excuse. But how fatigued was
the team?  
THOMAS GIPSON: I felt like we put everything in on the first two games. But
like you said, it's not an excuse. We needed to come out and play, and they
out-toughed us. So we just all have to overcome that fatigue and just play
harder.  
  
Q. Thomas, you played four games away from home now. How would you rate your
experience? Where do you think the team is at this point?  
THOMAS GIPSON: It's a good experience. Hopefully we can learn from it and go
back home and get ready for the Big 12. We've still got a long ways to go, but
I feel like this was a good first step for our experience in away games and
neutral games.  
  
Q. What were they doing defensively that maybe the other teams weren't that
caused you some problems?  
THOMAS GIPSON: They weren't really doing anything. We just got out-toughed. I
don't know if we got outrebounded or not. But we weren't as aggressive as we
were in the first two games. We weren't making the extra pass to the open
game. That's just what happens when fatigue hits. Like I said, it's not an
excuse. We've just got to keep moving forward.  
  
Q. You mentioned that mass substitution in the first half. Is that something
you were maybe trying to see rotation ‑wise?   
COACH WEBER: There were two or three guys out all at the same time. Obviously
other games at Long Beach or Purdue, that bench had played pretty good. But
this game, we probably had too many guys at one time and didn't get a good
mix. We didn't shoot the ball well. Pittsburgh, I'm sure Jamie will tell you
they haven't shot it real well. And tonight they had some guys jump up and
make shots. And then you feel better. I think they got energized when they
made shots that last stretch of the half. We still have a good close to the
half, and we were one possession.  
But first five minutes of the second half we just couldn't seem to get over
the hump. We just didn't make the right read, the right play. You know, I
think we had some guys trying to make plays on their own instead of doing
things as a team.  
  
Q. You said this is the kind of deal where you learn a lot about your team.
So now that it's over, what would you say you learned about these guys?  
COACH WEBER: I'd like to take this game out of it, but obviously you can't.
But I thought we showed some competitive spirit since Long Beach. We showed a
little better defensive intensity. We just got to find a little better niche
offensively. I don't know what we got against Purdue, 80‑something, but that
was a lot against zone. We were horrible yesterday against a very good
defensive team.  
But we can't rely‑‑ if we don't make shots, we've still got to find ways to
win games. We've got to go back, watch film, figure it out, and move forward.  
  
Q. Justin had a little better game today. What does he need to do to take it
even further and get going?  
COACH WEBER: I think he played a little tentative. It was good. He got the
dunk down, got a little excitement, I think he got a little better intensity.
Now if we've got to make some shots, that would help us because we need some
other offensive weapons. If we were like totally on Marcus, people pinch
Marcus. So some other people have to make some plays and make some shots. We
had hoped Justin would be a guy. Wes can do a little bit with slashing. Nigel
can jump up and make some shots, but we didn't have anybody doing that today
except really Thomas.  
I think Jevon had a good‑‑ he still had the best energy of anybody. He still
has to learn how to play and hopefully he loves the game. He wants to learn
when we go back and watch film and figure some things out.  
  
Q. Bruce, is that something you still have to emphasize with Marcus is other
guys have got to make plays?  
COACH WEBER: He drives. We've got some actions where we're creating
opportunities for him. Now you've got to pinch on him. We told him an assist
is a good stat too. Just besides, sometimes we've got to take away the three
ball and make some other plays. We've got to help them with that. That's our
job as coaches.  
  
Q. In hindsight, that Long Beach game, is it still a good thing for you guys
to have done that? This is a tough tournament, three games in three days?  
COACH WEBER: I'm sure it is. And if you asked Jamie, should we play Hawaii,
and we both talked about it this summer, people go home. There is one team
3‑0, 3‑2‑1, 3‑1‑2, or somebody 0‑3, and we're one of that group with 1‑2, and
now we have our schedule, power rating and all that stuff will be good. But
we've got to get better and get some wins here quickly. It's not going to be
any easier with Nebraska‑Omaha. Long Beach, we learned about ourselves. It
helped us with Purdue, helped us with Arizona, but obviously we didn't have
enough ammo in the gun for today.  
  
Q. How would you assess the way your team played defense today?  
COACH WEBER: I didn't think it was bad. Halftime it's 30‑27\. I just think we
got to that point in the second half where we had a lot of guys hit walls, and
we couldn't make baskets. Just a little disappointed in that competitive
spirit at that point to keep fighting it out and keep it where it's at 8 or
10. I mean, that's where the game should have been, probably, and we didn't do
that.

### [J.J. O'Brien](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24385)

_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Arizona  61  
San Diego State  59

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Fisher, Winston Shepard, and JJ O'Brien. Coach, some
opening comments?  
COACH FISHER: When you come and win two games, you want to win the third one.
So we're very disappointed that we're taking home the second place trophy, and
yet this was a phenomenal experience for our team, and in so many different
ways, from the atmosphere from being here on Maui to the hospitality, to the
game that's we played. We grew as a basketball team, and I know that when we
go back and look and think and talk about things that were very costly to us
in this game, we'll be better as we move forward with our own season. That's
what everybody wants to do. We wanted to win. We thought we were going to win.
We knew we could win, but we didn't win.  
So that's a disappointing thing. I told our team, other than the score, I
could not be more proud of our effort, our toughness. We made mistakes, but so
did they. We will learn from them, and hopefully the next time we're in this
type of an environment situation with an elite team we'll find a way to make
two or three more plays, or not make two or three of the plays that we did
that will allow us to be successful. So it was a wonderful experience for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Obviously, it's a very disappointing loss. Just talk about what this will
do for the rest of the season?  
JJ O'BRIEN: We played some quality teams out here, so that definitely made us
better. We went through a double overtime win just to start it. That shows
character in ourselves. We played a good team tonight, and played a good team
last night. So we've proven something to ourselves a little bit, and we can
move forward with that.  
  
Q. For both of you, outside those two threes you had late, you only had one
basket in the game. Could you talk about the offense? Did you have tired legs?
Did things just start to slow down a little bit?  
JJ O'BRIEN: We've just got to continue to get better. Continue to be
aggressive Arizona ease a good team, and you've got to give them a lot of
credit. We'll take this as a learning experience. I'm glad it's early in the
season. We have a long way to go.  
  
Q. Winston, did this battle with Arizona seem at all similar or was it
different than your past battles with them in the last few years?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: All of them are pretty similar. I feel like we should at
least have won three out of the last four, in my opinion. But like I said,
they're a great team. We don't take moral victories, but we've just got to
continue to grow and learn from it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Fisher.  
  
Q. It was a really good game, but what a defensive battle it was. Could you
talk about both teams on the defensive end?  
COACH FISHER: They're good. They're long, they're athletic. What appears to be
a good look sometimes gets blocked, sometimes gets altered because of the
length and the aggressiveness, and that happened to us. We took a couple shots
that we shouldn't have taken, and they made us pay. If you're shooting a
perimeter shot and you get a block, then it's probably not a good shot. If
you're on the bounce taking it to the rim, it's a little different story. So
we had some plays that we'd obviously like to have over again. So did they. So
did they.  
They have length. They have elite athletes in multiple spots, and they make it
hard for you to score. So do we. 61 to 59 game is indicative of that. We had a
couple of plays where I'll go back and look. If I talked to you tomorrow, I'd
have a couple more. But the ones that stick out in my mind are the two
turnovers out of bounds, and we had a two‑point lead where they scored, I
know, I think on both of them. Then we had another turnover shortly after
that.  
So we had three turnovers in like four possessions, and they hit us. They hit
us in the chops and we didn't respond the way we needed to. We did regain our
composure and come back. But that was a critical little stretch there.  
  
Q. You've said all along this offense is going to be a work in progress and
it's different from last season. But it seems you guys reverted a lot the
screen roll late in the game and you don't have Xavier Thames. Is this part of
the learning and maturation process for this team to go through learning
stretches like that in a game?  
COACH FISHER: I think it is. Again, if we could roll back the clock and know
what I know now, we as coaches would probably have tried to do some other
things before we ended up in a pick‑and‑roll. So we're growing, as is every
team that came here, and we'll be better served because of it. But you have to
find a way to make a play, and I thought we, right to the end when we threw
the home run play and said, let's see if we can make it work. Winston went up
and got it and shot a basket.  
So now there was a gasp of breath still left in us, so we competed hard, but
we've got to get better. That's why we came here and this will help us get
better.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys leave here 2 ‑1\. BYU, who you went double overtime with
on Monday, leaves you 1‑2, the only win over Chaminade. Does that kind of
illustrate the razor's edge and how quality this tournament can be and how it
really takes a great effort to get much out of this tournament?   
COACH FISHER: I think that's exactly the mindset that I had when we came over
here. I watched BYU's game today. Dave Rose and Cheryl Rose are good friends
of the Fishers. And Angie and I talked, and I said, one play and that could
have been us in the first game. One play and they could have been playing in
the championship. So there is that razor's edge, and there is quality right
down the line. You look at the teams that were here, and they are good teams
that were here. I told our team before the game, when I was a high school
coach a long time ago I had thought of the year and I thought I was clever. My
first year it was George Allen, from his book. I had a big hand in his trophy
case. The difference between winning and losing is this much. I told our kids
that before the game.  
I don't talk about winning and losing, so I said the difference between
success and failure is this much. And it is, and it is, and it was proven here
in a lot of the games. It's a great example. We could have been playing for
sixth place.  
  
Q. Coach, you've seen a lot of really good players in your career and
coached them both for and against. Could you comment on Stanley Johnson and
his performance in this tournament?  
COACH FISHER: He's pretty good. He's pretty good. He'll make a pretty good NBA
player in about six months. I saw him in high school a lot of times. We were
early on involved in recruiting him. He's no surprise. He's a terrific talent
that competes like crazy and helps his team win. So he's good. He's a very
good player. They have a lot of very good players.

_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Pittsburgh  70  
Kansas State- 47

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, some opening comments on tonight's win.  
COACH DIXON: Obviously, we showed a lot of character from a young group that's
gone through a lot of changes over a short period of time here in the last
couple of months, and they responded in a big way. That's a very good team,
Kansas State, that we beat, and we beat it the way we wanted to do it as far
as defense, execution on the offensive end, and smart play throughout.  
So very proud of our guys how they responded. We were obviously embarrassed by
our performance yesterday and they responded in a big way. So really a true
test of character by our guys in this situation. Very proud of them, and I
look forward to practicing on the layover on the way back. We've got a tired
group. We've got a tired group that they've everything they can. They've been
through a lot, and I think going forward here we're going to be in good shape.  
  
Q. Just talk about the team's surge in the second half and what was going
right for your team?  
JAMES ROBINSON: We had a three‑point lead going into the half, and we were
pretty excited at our first half performance, but we knew we had 20 more
minutes, and Kansas State wasn't going to back down. Basically we knew they
were not going to quit, so we had to turn it up another notch for that last 20
minutes. We still made some mistakes. We still did some things we need to
correct. But for the most part we needed to execute and finish strong down
towards the end of the game.  
  
Q. James, this is the probably the first time you guys as a team looked like
Pitt, in terms of how you defended and the urgency on that side of the ball.
What changed from last night to today that you were able to come back out and
play that way?  
JAMES ROBINSON: Being embarrassed on national television. I mean, that will do
it. I mean, basically we got embarrassed last night and everybody went back to
the hotel and it was a bad feeling. Coach told us we have an hour to feel bad
and then turn around and you've got a good team in Kansas State who played
Arizona stuff the day before.  
So we knew we had to come out and play hard. I just challenged everybody last
night to find it within themselves to play as hard as they could. We came out
and played really, really hard on defense. We paid attention to detail and got
the job done.  
  
Q. Ryan, first podium game for you comes on this stage in Maui and a big win
like this, how encouraging is that for you as a young guy going forward with
the way you played tonight?  
RYAN LUTHER: It was definitely good to get a little confidence, couple more
minutes. When they get on the floor, I'm looking to play defense. Really I
made a couple shots because I was working on defense, and got some easy looks
and some good set‑ups there.  
  
Q. Talk about how happy you guys were that Joshua hit that last shot?  
JAMES ROBINSON: It's always good to see guys like Josh Ko, Mike Lecak, and
Aron Phillips‑Nwankwo get in the game. But especially for Josh's homecoming,
to have him come out and hit that shot was big. I think we were all really
excited for him. It was just big time. I think that's something we're all
going to remember, and hopefully he does too.  
  
Q. Just overall thoughts on the tournament now that it's over. What you guys
got out of it, and what you can take from it going forward?  
MICHAEL YOUNG: Well, we ended up beating a good team in Kansas State, and
we're taking this game to our next‑‑ I think it's Indiana. Just from the
tournament, a lot of experience for me being a sophomore and being a captain
on this team for the first year, and really trying to lead this team
offensively and defensively. That was a lot of experience for me going up
against different types of teams that we might see in the ACC. Also good
experience for our young guys, Cameron and Ryan. Ryan played really big today.
I was proud of him as far as defense and offense, and making shots.  
Overall as a team, we're a pretty young team. So this was a great experience.
Having this game and winning big I think is what we're going to take off.
We've seen it once. We knew we were going to play defense. We went out there
and showed it, and I think as a team we're going to take off.  
  
Q. Jamie, what exactly were you able to do to get them to play as well as
they did defensively considering the battles you've been fighting for the last
couple of weeks?  
COACH DIXON: Well, we felt like we were making strides even though the numbers
didn't seem to indicate it in the last couple games. So I think getting
healthy, I think getting Ryan, getting Derrick back. I think those are
important things. Obviously we've been kind of‑‑ no team has gone through as
much changes in a month and a half, two months than we have as far as what we
thought we were going to have and what we did have.  
So it's just been a process. Every day has been something new. I think we
responded in a big way. We let some things bother us on the offensive end that
hurt us and affected our defense. That's something we've got to get beyond.
But playing‑‑ Ryan has become one of our best post defenders, if not our best.
It's been an amazing transformation considering where he came from in the
summer.  
So it's just getting guys better, and just having guys available I think is
usually a factor. We don't spend too much time talking about what we don't
have, but we've got some good performances from a lot of guys, and I think
they'll get better. This is something they needed and they earned it.  
  
Q. You guys held Kansas State to one guy in double figures, Thomas Gipson.
What do you think he did well across the board defensively?  
COACH DIXON: Well, we double teamed him pretty much throughout the game. I
thought we turned it on and off a little bit, trying to keep him off balance.
I thought that helped some. I thought we did a very good job on Foster. I
can't really explain that because I saw some of the shots he hit and the plays
he made last night in the semifinal game. He's very good, very good.  
But I don't know how we were able to contain. We did a good job on the ball
screens with him. I thought that was important. He scores off of that, and we
didn't want him to get to the foul line, I thought that was important. We
didn't want to give him any easy ones. We thought we made a mistake on the one
he hit in the first half on the simple to the corner pass. But other than
that, I thought everything was pretty well guarded.  
  
Q. What happened? They got you guys down quick. What did you do offensively?
What happened right there?  
COACH DIXON: To me there were some strange turnovers. You had a drive to the
rim, and we were in a pretty good spot. He slips. Drops it out of bounds. But
that's what killed us other the night. The turnovers in the transition
baskets, our defense. You look at the stats and look at field goal percentage
defense. You go, if you turn it over and they get lay‑ups on the back end,
that's not much defense that can be played. That's what started again today
early in the game. We're a low turnover team. That's what we're going to be. I
think we have to find I think our personnel.  
We obviously went into a season thinking our two leading scorers were going to
be two other guys, and now we have to readjust, and that's not what you
normally do at this time of the year. But we're fighting. We're battling, and
I think they showed a whole lot of character going forward. So we have guys in
roles that never even thought a possibility. You may have guys in new roles,
but then you're talking about putting guys in new roles they didn't even think
about going into the season, and that's what you have in this situation right
now. I mean, we're going to red‑shirt Ryan Luther and Cameron Johnson.
Obviously a couple things happen and now you can't, so you have to readjust.  
  
Q. What did you learn about your team in these four games here on the
island. Did you get what you wanted out of it?  
COACH DIXON: We're exhausted. There is no question. Probably more so than I
anticipated. The travel was tougher than I thought, and I've done it a few
times. But just how things worked out. But what we saw is this is the team we
are. Not the team we were a week ago or two weeks ago, and this is what we are
going forward. I'd rather be at this point at the end of the week than the
other way around.  
So that's what you want to do. You want the team that gets better, and we
obviously have. We've got an opportunity to grow here going forward. We've got
some adjusting to do still, but they're hungry. They did‑‑ we executed, and
they had success with it, and we needed that.  
  
Q. Going after the UH game and going into this tournament you talked about
the last game is usually how you feel going back. Now that it's done, how do
you feel with all your Hawaii ties and at the end of this trip now with your
team, how do you personally feel about this journey out here?  
COACH DIXON: Obviously, you don't have the guys you think you're going to
have, and you make plans and it doesn't work out the way you want it to, and
we wanted to win the whole tournament. But Kansas State's really good. I'd
rather, like I said, finish the way we just did beating a team like that as we
did and the way we did it. So I feel good right now because you're only as
good as your last game. But these guys needed to see what defense could do and
what it could do for your offense. That was, I think, a big part of‑‑ a big,
big benefit of this afternoon's game.

_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Purdue  87  
BYU  85

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Coach Painter, Rapheal Davis, Vince Edwards and A.J.
Hammons to the media room. Coach, some opening thoughts on today's win?  
COACH PAINTER: This obviously was a huge win for us. We have all the respect
in the world for BYU. Just a great program and what Coach Rose has been able
to do with those guys. Just a tough guard. It's really difficult guarding what
BYU does offensively and then trying to slow them down in transition well.
Obviously they scored in the 80s, so I don't know how much we slowed them
down.  
But I thought our guys were able to hang in there and win the game. We had
some really good performances across the board. These guys were great. Very
rarely do you play in a game where the ball gets loose in their key moments
and you get none of them, and you win the game. BYU on about four or five
different possessions in the second half and in overtime got some loose balls
and converted them into baskets. They got that rebound with 22 seconds to go
in regulation, and we were very fortunate Tyler Haws, because he got a little
separation, missed that shot and kind of got out of rhythm, it looked like
from my angle. But we were able to hang in there and grind it. Then obviously
make some plays at the end.  
  
Q. A.J., tell me what happened going down the floor on that last play and
what you saw when you were taking that shot?  
A.J. HAMMONS: I just pretty much just Coach just saw the play for me to get in
the post. Only thought I had in my mind was pretty much just to get the shot
up. So I was dribbling, and I thought he was going to double, so I spent. So
he went for the fake. So hopefully I thought the up and under was going to
fall. So I knew I had my teammate to rebound for me. So either way we were
going to try to get a tip back or something like that.  
  
Q. A.J., did it feel good out of your hand?  
A.J. HAMMONS: Yeah, it did. It felt good. It felt really good. Even though
you'd never know that because it hit the back of the rim. But I'm just glad it
fell, and we got the win.  
  
Q. Ray, what did you guys do defensively? BYU came in one of the best
shooting teams in the country, and you held them 7 for 21?  
RAPHEAL DAVIS: We watched a lot of film last night. We went through a walk
through, and we knew they could shoot the ball. We knew they had a guy with a
90% for 3 yesterday. Knowing a team like that that can shoot the ball so well,
we just had to stick to our defensive principals and have an all-around team
effort.  
  
Q. Vince, it seemed you had a pretty good match ‑up with your skill set and
some of their size. Were you able to exploit that with some of the offensive
success you were able to have?   
VINCE EDWARDS: Yeah, most definitely. Coach Painter said when you get on the
floor, guys, you have to be able to make plays for us. Fortunately, my
teammates found me and I was able to drive and get off the shots. We were
playing great team ball. We just got the W, and I'm thankful for that.  
  
Q. Vince, what did Rapheal mean to you guys the last two days coming out and
setting tone on defense, and the way he was able to get to the basket so often
hitting free throws and that sort of thing?  
VINCE EDWARDS: Rapheal's been a flat‑out leader. We didn't have a good game
the first game, and Ray took it upon himself because he knew he was going to
be the one to step out as being one of the older guys to get us back on track.
Ray did a tremendous job. He played with intensity and defense, and he played
hard every possession. He's diving on the floor and did everything he could to
help us win. That's what we're going to need out of a guy like Rapheal. That's
the leadership we need on this team.  
  
Q. Vince or Rapheal, I don't know who had Haws on that last play, but
whoever, was it one of you guys? I'm not sure?  
VINCE EDWARDS: I think it was Octeus.  
  
Q. So Vince, how sure were you the ball was going to him?  
VINCE EDWARDS: I was praying that it wasn't going to him. In my mind I was
like, no. I'm not giving it any chance. And the basketball Gods were on our
side, and we were fortunate enough that Tyler Haws, a great player, he just
came up short. So we were very thankful for that. We knew once we went into
overtime, we had to have it. We had to get the win. It fell short, we came out
strong and executed in the end. Got a bucket and we won.  
  
Q. For whoever wants to answer, that's fine with us, if it's fine with them.
What did you guys learn about you are why selves these past three days?  
RAPHEAL DAVIS: I learned that all the work we put in this summer didn't go to
waste. Everybody says they had a good summer and they worked really hard. But
the way we fought at the end and the way we came together like that and the
way our bench was jumping up and down, screaming helping us out and showing us
different things, I think we came together. Everything we put in this summer,
it showed toward the end.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Rapheal. Vince, do you want to make any comments on
that question?  
VINCE EDWARDS: Yeah, we really did come together this summer and put a lot of
hard work in. We have to give credit to the coaches. They did a great job.
They're in the offices every night on scouting reports. They get us ready. We
know everything that's coming because our coaches do a tremendous job of
scouting. Then we all come together, and the hard work pays off.  
  
Q. Rapheal, how sure were you guys that that ball was going to Haws at the
end of regulation?  
RAPHEAL DAVIS: I knew a hundred percent it was. I don't think the other
players wanted it. I mean, you could tell it was just spread out. He got the
ball out to the other side, and Jon got him out of rhythm. He made him shoot.
Contested it. He fell down at the end, but he tried to contest it, so that's
all we can ask for.  
  
Q. Ray, Kendall is known for his jump shooting. He's out there playing with
a sideways finger and makes two big defensive plays for you. What's that say
about him?  
RAPHEAL DAVIS: To say Kendall Stephens isn't making defensive plays in
senseless. It's huge for us. I know that block was huge. He got a tip at the
end of the game and then ended up with it still. Knowing his finger was messed
up, he fought through the pain, and he came out big for us. He fought through
it. That was big time for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Painter.  
  
Q. What do you think the freshman class coming in, high ‑level game, raucous
environment, and they had like 43 of 87 points today?   
COACH PAINTER: Well, I think all these guys have come in with a good attitude
and good work ethic. It's different in college basketball now. You step on
campus in June and everybody wants to play immediately. These guys have come
on with a good attitude and worked hard and they're good listeners. What he
says, he means that.  
Vince Edwards is a good player and knows what's going on. He grew up in a
household with a brother who played in the Big Ten. A dad who is an all‑time
leading scorer at Wright State. So he understands basketball. So coming in at
this moment and playing big. Yesterday Isaac Haws was 0 for 5 from the line,
and he goes to a local high school. I take him over there, and shoot 300 free
throws. Going 4 for 6 isn't the greatest thing in the row from the free‑throw
line. But when you're struggling like that and both of our bigs are in foul
trouble. It was huge. P.J. Thompson and Dakota Mathias both did a good job
contributing. When we were reeling, Dakota Mathias made a big jumpshot, and
P.J. Thompson just settles us down and plays a big role. We had a lot of
impact from those guys. Then Jon Octeus was a blessing in October for us, to
get a guy that can have that kind of experience and being able to defend, he's
done a good job morphing into a point guard.  
  
Q. What can this mean for your team now?  
COACH PAINTER: I think it's very similar to what we did eight years ago. I
talked about that at the onset. When we lost the first game, and we have to
look at this as a challenge, and we've got to be able to bounce back and win
these next two games. Very similar to what we did. Our second game where we
won handily eight years ago, and then we had a nail biter versus Oklahoma,
which had a pretty good team.  
Now we're able to beat, in my opinion, a really good BYU team. Hopefully we
can use it going into the Big Ten, ACC challenge as motivation. We have a
tough opponent in N.C. State who has a very talented group, so we're going to
have our hands full. So hopefully we can just think about that next game and
take this game‑‑ anytime you can get into close games or overtime games and
pull it out, it's great for your confidence.  
  
Q. The last offensive possession for you, A.J. said you had called that
play. Was that before the free throws or as you guys were coming up the floor
you had called something?  
COACH PAINTER: We had talked about it before we had done that. A lot of times
with so many things back and forth, we were in a position where they were
going to play the foul game, then all of a sudden we're out of that spot. So
we're just running. And Vince, you know, it's a hard lesson to learn if you
lose that game. But you catch the ball when they're playing a foul game and
you try to turn the corner to go score. In that situation, you catch the ball
and look at your basket and jump stop and be strong and take those fouls.
Especially for a guy that's played so well. Let him foul you and let him knock
down the two free throws. You're still in a tough position because you're up
three, and now do you foul, do you not foul, especially against these guys.
But I'd rather be in that position than the one we were, even though we pulled
it out.  
  
Q. You smiled when Rapheal said that about Kendall. Nice to say him and
defensive stop in the same sentence. How important is that to see him step up
and make those plays because that's been a deficiency?  
COACH PAINTER: Just to play 32 minutes against good people and not foul,
that's an accomplishment. Last year when he was in the game he was a shooter
for us. But when we played good people, they put him on alert, and he normally
got fouls. Now he's done a good job of using his size, using his wingspan,
keeping the ball in front of him. He came up with two huge plays on the
defensive end.  
  
Q. The way Vince was able to win the match ‑up game for you, it's kind of
what you saw in him all along, I would imagine?   
COACH PAINTER: No question. I think one thing is you get spoiled when you have
a great player. Robbie Hummel was a great player for us, and we'll be striving
to sign somebody like him the rest of our careers. But he was a guy as a four,
if you're going to run motion and spread it out and have a huge post, if you
can pass and shoot it and handle the basketball and break him down off the
dribble a little bit, he's not the fastest guy in the world, but he's got a
good first step and understands angles.  
But, no, we recruited him as a stretch four. Sometimes 6'6", 6'7" guys don't
like to hear that in recruiting. But he embraced it. He liked it. It's really
worked out for us immediately.

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Missouri  74  
Chaminade  60

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement about this morning's game?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Well, coming into it we knew it was going to be three grueling
days against really good teams. Our goal coming in, obviously we'd love to win
a game, win a couple games and stuff like that. But the thing I talked to
these guys about is we have the best opportunity in Division II to play
against good competition to make us better. At Division II you don't get that
opportunity. You might get the chance to play one, but we've got the chance to
play three and the University of Hawaii. So it's definitely going to help us
in our quest to compete for Division II National Championships.  
  
Q. Even after the three tough defeats in this tournament, how do you feel
about your team's upside going forward and into Pac West play?  
LEE BAILEY: I think we're feeling pretty good going into Pac West play. This
tournament always helps just energy‑wise and battle test us before we hit the
conference play. I think that we come in with an aggressiveness and kind of a
toughness that no other Division II‑‑ they can't simulate these kind of games
we play in going against much taller, stronger, quicker, more athletic guys.  
So we liked a lot of things that we saw. We obviously have a lot to work on,
but we're feeling pretty good about the season this year.  
  
Q. Kuany, you had a big second half, did you want to take over the game and
run the offense and try to take over the score your own?  
KUANY KUANY: No, not really we run a lot of high ball screens and defensive
driving kicks. I was I took a bad shot at the end, definitely, but Coach let
me hear about that one. Other than that, I was just trying to take what the
defense gave me. I was trying to drive and hit open shooters when they
weren't, and when they were helping, just tried on hit the basket.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned the Hawaii game coming up. Anything specifically you
need to work on before you play UH mid- December?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Just to be 100%, I have some things in the back of my head that
we'll use when we get one game away, when they're our next game. We won't even
talk about the University of Hawaii until I think it's the day before the game
because we have a game that day before. So we're going to focus on trying to
get better from these three days. We have the University of Hawaii, Hilo next
Thursday in a conference game, and they're really good this year.  
So I know it's big for a lot of the people in Hawaii, but we've got to start
with our conference game next Thursday. Hilo, and that's all they'll hear from
me until it gets really close to the Hawaii game.  
  
Q. There were times Missouri went with a smaller lineup, at least not what
they're used to going with. Did that give you guys any kind of trouble with
Gill ‑Caesar and Wright from the shots they were hitting?   
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, yeah, it did. I kind of got surprised a few times. There
were about three or four games over my years here in the Maui Invitational
I've seen the major Division Is adjust their lineup to try to match ours. I
think it's a smart move. If they're not able to take advantage of their size
and strength, they might as well go with the five guards, because most of the
time that's pretty much what we have on the floor.  
Sometimes we have one big guy and four guards. But, yeah, I was a little
surprised that they switched. They weren't as effective in the post as I know
they want to be. Went with the five guards, and next thing I know number 13's
hitting three‑pointers in the corner.

### [Nate Austin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25307)

### [Dave Rose](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13817)

### [Anson Winder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26784)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Purdue  87  
BYU  85

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Coach Rose, Anson Winder, and Nate Austin to the
media room. Coach, an opening statement on today's game?  
COACH ROSE: Well, it was a good college basketball game. I think both teams
fought really hard. It was kind of interesting how the game kind of went in
stretches for each team. I think that both battled really hard. They made a
couple big plays down the stretch, especially on the offensive end, rebounding
the ball. We got a miss and didn't secure the defensive rebound.  
But we made some really big plays on the other end. I think our guys all left
it out there. We just didn't have enough to get the win. So I think the most
important thing for us is when you look forward, is the fact that these are
three days where we learned a lot about ourselves and I think we got better as
a team and hopefully that will help us down the stretch.  
  
Q. Anson, can you expound a little bit on what Coach just finished with
there, with two obviously overtime losses? What's this going to do for you
guys?  
ANSON WINDER: Definitely a team builder. We'll take what we learned here and
we learned about ourselves and grow from it. It's different if you come here
and you lose by 20 and you have a lot of things that you have to work on, but
here you come and you lose in two overtimes, there are a few things we have
things to tune‑up and close it out.  
  
Q. Nate, what was your game plan and how do you think you executed?  
NATE AUSTIN: Our game plan to make them get tough passes and we were going to
get around the post. We made them make tough passes out of the double team. I
thought their bigs did a good job of getting good catches and easy scores. I
think we did it, and we did a little better job of making it a little tougher
for them to get catches.  
But I think the game was called pretty tight. So any physicality down low was
called for a foul. So it was a little tough to push them out or get around
because a lot of fouls were called.  
  
Q. Anson, you're a senior and you've seen a lot of these games. What do you
have to do to win these close ones?  
ANSON WINDER: I think it's just the rebounding, like Coach said, on the
defensive end. We gave up one too many towards the end. I think as these games
go along, rebounding is the main factor. That's how you close out games.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Same question to Anson was about closing out close games. You have a
senior group and probably expect them to make those plays?  
COACH ROSE: Well, it's really important when you get into games where it comes
down to the last couple of possessions that they execute. I think that
offensively we've got pretty good looks. In these games, the game against San
Diego State, I think that second overtime we probably settled for too many
perimeter shots on some pretty tired legs after double overtime. Tonight I
thought we did a pretty good job of getting good shots. We're still trying to
find that guy in the post where we can throw it in the post with his back to
the basket and come up with some points. But you've got to, on that defensive
end, we had the lead a few times, and with that lead you get a couple stops
and then you can finish these things off. We got the miss, and you just need
to secure the ball and get the rebound.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about that final possession regulation Tyler got
the shot. It looked like he had an open look but it just didn't fall down. Can
you talk about that?  
COACH ROSE: Yeah, we've seen Ty make that shot many times. He'll get it again,
and he'll shoot it again, and next time hopefully it goes in. He read that
thing perfectly, and they jumped out on that ball screen, and he refused it,
and went to the baseline and shot in good rhythm. You know, maybe could have
shot it a little bit earlier with what we talked about in the timeouts. We'd
have a chance to get an offensive rebound if we had a miss, but it was a clean
look, good shot.  
  
Q. You limited Collinsworth minutes early in the season, now he has the most
minutes out of anybody on the team. What did you see from him this tournament,
and how do you think you'll use that going forward?  
COACH ROSE: Well, when you think about our team coming in and now our team
leaving going back, we have two losses so that seems like maybe kind of a
waste of time. But the fact is the minutes that we played, and you would think
it would be from the two losses, 80 minutes, but turned out to be 95 minutes,
that we've learned a lot about our team, like I said earlier. The fact that
Kyle has kind of found himself, and we've got some good play off of our bench,
different guys, different nights.  
We'll go home and kind of regroup and get started on Saturday with Eastern
Kentucky, and then a really tough December. I mean, our December is a really
brutal schedule, so we'll see how we do. But these three games here I think
have really helped us find a little more about our team.

### [Montaque Gill-Ceasar](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27914)

### [Namon Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27927)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Missouri  74  
Chaminade  60

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, some opening comments blood pressure today's game.  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, it's good to be able to come over here and win a game. I
think we got a little bit better today. We had to play some different lineups.
We had some guys hurt, and we had some guys get in foul trouble and stuff, so
we had to move things around a little bit.  
But I thought we responded. Played a team that shoots the ball well normally.
Present match‑up problems for us because they can play five guys that can
shoot the ball. But I thought we didn't, by any means, it wasn't very pretty,
but I thought we played well enough to win. On the third day, to be able to
come and get a win is important. So proud of these guys for hanging in there
and preparing pretty well on a short amount of time.  
  
Q. A big day for you. Were you waiting for this kind of performance and you
just hadn't been able to get as many opportunities today? What about today
allowed that to happen?  
NAMON WRIGHT: I just stayed prepared in warm‑ups just to make sure I hit a
good amount of jump shots up and just stayed ready.  
  
Q. Montaque, how hard was it to play with those unconventional line ‑ups
that you had to use in the second half?  
MONTAQUE GILL‑CAESAR: That means we're gelling better as a team. We grew
better as a team. Forced to use different lineups, so I think we did a good
job with those.  
  
Q. You hit three, three pointers for your team in a row there. Just talk
about your second half and how you're feeling in the second half?  
MONTAQUE GILL‑CAESAR: We're feeling a little more confident in ourselves. We
kind of went into halftime with the mentality that we weren't going to be
bullied any more. So when we came out in the second half, we were just
attacking on both sides of the floor. I think we just got easy stuff because
we had that mindset.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Montaque.  
  
Q. Montaque, did you feel like you had to bounce back after yesterday? Were
you frustrated with the way you played? What was your kind of mentality coming
into this game after that one?  
MONTAQUE GILL‑CAESAR: Everybody has a bad game. Some games just aren't going
to go your way. Yesterday our team had a bad game, so I think as a team our
mentality coming in today, not just personally, but our team was that we're
not going to leave Hawaii without a W, and I think we responded really well.  
  
Q. What was it about today's game that seemed like all of you freshmen were
playing with maybe more confidence than you've had?  
MONTAQUE GILL‑CAESAR: We actually had a team talk yesterday, and the leaders
of the team kind of reached out to everybody else and kind of gave everybody
else confidence. So when you have guys like that, you're going to have a
boost, and I think it showed today.  
  
Q. First of all, how's Johnathan?  
COACH ANDERSON: You know, I don't know. I had no idea he was hurt until he
asked to come out of the game there early. I haven't had a chance to talk to
Pat very much about it, he apparently just woke up this morning sore. At this
point I don't think it's anything serious, but Pat said he was tight. His knee
was tight. So we were able to‑‑ I was really pleased with the way D.A. came in
and gave us some minutes, and then we played some unconventional lineups,
Deuce, and Techie, but we were playing a team that played smaller a lot of
times. So it wasn't as bad as if we were playing a team with two seven‑footers
or something.  
  
Q. Coach you have a lot of experience in the D ‑II level, and the experience
they've got and their level of play as well?   
COACH ANDERSON: Well, I'm really impressed with their team. I was talking to
Coach there after the game at half court, and I know they're going to have a
great year. This type of experience for those guys is just immeasurable. I
know when I was at central Missouri we were fortunate enough to play Missouri,
and we were fortunate enough to play some other Division I teams. Even played
Kansas, Kansas State, Creighton, a lot of those. We played Austin pea every
year because my assistant's dad was the head coach there. So getting that
opportunity only makes them better. I think they're going to have a good team.  
The only difference, a lot of times the difference in Division II is size, you
know, and maybe some quickness and some strength. I've always, after playing
West Liberty last year it was fun to play these guys because they play, they
play. I know they'll do well this year.  
  
Q. How nice was it to see Namon have a breakout game, and how do you get him
to carry that with him back home?  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, the big thing with those young guys is confidence. You
look today and you guys can do the math, but you look at the play of Techie,
you look at the play I thought Tramaine gave us a big boost especially in the
first half. You have name on, the job that he did, and D.A., you know, that's
four freshmen out there playing a lot of minutes today.  
So that is encouraging. Hopefully it will give them some confidence because
certainly the first two days were very difficult here. I don't think we were
as physically prepared as we needed to be. In other words, I don't think we
understood how tough the games are.  
So this was good, this was good that we could come out. You don't want to come
over here and not win a game. I told our guys I don't know how they do the
place, but I said you want just as many games as the fourth place team is
going to win. You're always looking for something, you know?  
  
Q. Did you have to challenge the guys yesterday after that loss or did you
let the older players deal with it? Montaque talked about the leaders kind of
helping out with that?  
COACH ANDERSON: You know, we had kind of a spontaneous meeting. I mean, we
were meeting last night, and this is a short turnaround, so you've got a lot
of work to do in a short period of time. We were meeting last night and a
couple of the older guys, I think kind of challenged everybody to perform.
They performed. I'll give them credit. They took the challenge and came out
and played well. Not just younger guys, but everybody.  
  
Q. It seemed like Wes did a lot of things for you, but he hasn't shot the
ball well for three games now. I guess, first of all, how impressive is it
that he's able to do the other things, but how do you get him back scoring the
ball again?  
COACH ANDERSON: Yeah, I think obviously you get a chance to get home and get
some rest. Wes was really key defensively for us. He's a guy that even though
Bailey, I think Bailey had some points, I thought Wes did a pretty good job on
him there for a while. We were up there trying to press him and put pressure
on him, and he just would go around us. So we finally backed off a little bit
and he missed a couple shots. I don't know if we had anything to do with it or
not, but certainly a good player. But Wes brings a lot to the table other than
scoring. You look at our two starting guards today, and they were 0 for 13,
and we were still able to win a game. So that's, I think that's good. That
just shows how important both of those guys are to our team, and when they're
not scoring, they still bring other things to the table.

_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Arizona  72  
Kansas State  68

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Coach Sean Miller, Stanley Johnson, and T.J.
McConnell to the press room. Coach, some opening statements on today's win?  
COACH MILLER: Well, first of all, really especially this early in the season
there is not a loser in tonight's game. We knew before we played Kansas State
that they're a very, very good team. You don't share in a Big 12 title a year
ago and return the players and obviously a great coach and coaching staff and
you're just going to go out there and be clearly the better team. There isn't
a lot of difference between our teams. I say that because I feel like we left
with a hard‑fought victory over an excellent pass ball team.  
On our end, tonight was the first game this season where comprehensively we
knew we were in a high level game. A number of players go through things
individually. Stanley is one where he was in immense foul trouble and yet put
that behind him. Came in very, very late in the game and made key winning
plays. Brandon Ashley, who he hasn't played in a game like this in fairness to
him in a long time, you could see that for most of the first half. But in the
second half, Brandon was as big of a reason we won as anybody. Then I could
keep going on.  
Kaleb Tarczewski hasn't been scoring as much. Tonight was his night. We got
the ball to him and he delivered. Then obviously T.J. who, in my opinion, is
our team's heart and soul. You can't define his game by points. You have to
define his game by his leadership and play making. So we're very, very proud
of tonight's win. We feel like we beat a great team, and that's why you come
to Maui to challenge yourself on a neutral court like we just did.  
  
Q. I wondered how it felt like to come back after that long and that first
test you've had in this level of situation, and how did it go? Were you able
to feel pretty normal coming back?  
STANLEY JOHNSON: I think as a freshman, this was my first game where it was
like super intense. You kind of feel it from the start of the game. I think,
you know, we have great leadership and great coaching, because every I need a
little stint from myself, I can look at Coach Miller, T.J. or Kaleb or Brandon
and keep going, while I'm on the bench, and staying engaged in the game
knowing what's going on, and also knowing how to control my body a little bit
more.  
At the end of the day, it's all about winning games. When I went Wac in the
game, it was time to rebound, and get it to our leader, T.J., and have him
orchestrate stuff.  
  
Q. Stanley, at the end of the game, you had lots of games that were similar
to this in high school. Did all of those games back then make the end of the
game easier?  
STANLEY JOHNSON: Not really. College is very different from high school. If
there is a game I miss there on the four and five, and I'm in trouble now.
It's way different. Way more stakes on the line.  
  
Q. T.J., Coach just mentioned about it being the heart and soul, and your
teammate mentioned about leadership. Can you talk about your role this year as
a senior starting with the team and big expectations?  
T.J. McCONNELL: We came in as the number two team in the nation. My job is to
keep everyone level headed. That ranking doesn't matter until the end of
March, early April. Pretty much my job is to show how hard I'm working on
defense and get us into our offense. Kind of just make sure things run
smoothly for this team. I know my teammates do a great job of making shots
when I give it to them. So it's a team effort leadership‑wise, but I do as
best as I can.  
  
Q. Stanley, just talk about that steal you had near the end of the game
where they were trying to inbound it and you were able to get it?  
STANLEY JOHNSON: You know, with our boxing stance here, just in the lane. Once
everybody cleared out it was just me and him on the island, I feel like. I
knew it was coming, and I was right inside of him. The only way he could get
it is if he passed to his outside hand. So I kind of gambled knowing I could
make up for it. And he passed it right to his chest, and I just stepped in
front of him and stole it from him.  
COACH MILLER: I think that's the first time he's been in a boxer's stance
since he's been at Arizona. Good. Hopefully that's more things to come.  
  
Q. T.J., I just wonder if you could elaborate on the team's mindset this
first time that you guys have had a game like this. Was there any sense out
there how it was going or tricky or nerve ‑racking?   
T.J. McCONNELL: I thought when we played UC Irvine we grew up a lot. But after
this game it kind of shows how resilient our team is. The score was going back
and forth, and you weren't really sure which way the score was going to go. I
mean, we just played hard. We knew this game was going to be close. Kansas
State is an NCAA tournament team. They're very good. They're very well
coached. I thought we didn't get down when we were down scoring. We didn't get
too high when we were up. So I think we did a good job.  
  
Q. T.J., how did the loss of Aaron Guarino affect this team this year?  
T.J. McCONNELL: You can't replace a guy like Aaron Guarino what he does on the
court. He works hard. He defends. He doesn't force shots. But this guy next to
me, we brought him in and he's doing as good a job as anybody in the country.
It's hard to replace a guy like Aaron Guarino. But that's last year, and we
have to move on. It's a new team.  
  
Q. T.J., can you look back a couple years ago and see how things have gone
and where you are now and the situation for yourself? Is this kind of some of
the things that you envisioned?  
T.J. McCONNELL: I thank them for giving me my start. But I've been watching
this tournament since I was five years old. To be playing in it with Coach
Miller who I've been growing up and hearing about in Pittsburgh and the fans
where we play in front of every night, words can't describe how thankful I am
for Coach Miller and all these fans for giving me this opportunity to play
here. That's why I play so hard every night is because there are many people
that want to be where I'm at, and I wouldn't give it up for anything.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Marcus Foster was kind of quiet in the second half. Did you get the
feeling he would kind of get going there and lead their team back?  
COACH MILLER: We watched Marcus quite a bit on film as much as we could in one
day, and we scouted Kansas State ahead of time. Respect isn't a good enough
word to describe how we categorize him as a player. There aren't too many
guards in this country who are better basketball players who mean more to
their team. The thing that I admire about him is he really does things through
the flow of his team. He forces very little. He takes great shots and makes
his teammates better. Seems like a great kid. Obviously one heck of a player,
and he proved that tonight. He was challenged at a high level, but I think we
guarded him with three different players; and for him to put up the numbers he
put up, it wasn't like we were giving him threes. His six threes were hard
earned. Kansas State did a good job of freeing him up. I have no regrets of
how we defended him from the three‑point line. It's just he's that good.  
I'll also tell you this, Thomas Gipson is very good as well. I mean, he's a
load. Again, on our end, Kaleb Tarczewski is an excellent, excellent low‑post
defender. There aren't many guys playing that bring to their teams what Kaleb
brings to our team defensively. One of the keys to our victory tonight was I
thought his really good defense on number 42.

THE MODERATOR: We welcome Coach Bruce Weber, Thomas Gipson, and Marcus Foster
to the interview room. Coach, an opening statement on tonight's game?  
COACH WEBER: Well, you come to these tournaments to play against good
competition if on a neutral floor and learn about your team. I think we've
made a lot of progress since last Friday. I've asked them to have an urgency,
and I think we've done that. We've competed. We've played hard. Now we've do
got to do some little things, some execution and get better on that part.  
But they're very good. They just have a sound system. They guard you. They, I
think rebounding hurt us a little bit, and just some little plays here and
there that we could have easily found a way to win it. Just a little more
discipline and some little execution. Whether it's on offense or on defense
with our system. These two guys were very, very good, they gave us a chance to
win. I thought Wesley Iwundu in the second half also did a great job.  
But we need to keep Thomas in the game. It hurts when he doesn't play his many
minutes, and I thought our young guys, it was a good experience for them, but
the new guys kind of struggled. Now we've got to find a way to get some energy
and some excitement, and wherever we play tomorrow, Pittsburgh or San Diego
State will be very good teams. We're going to have another tough competition
and we'll see what we can do.  
  
Q. Marcus, you guys went through a little function there after the 2 minute
mark. I think four empty possessions. Kind of talk about that and raising up
and hitting the three with 11 seconds left? Also trying to get into the act of
shooting on that other foul call?  
MARCUS FOSTER: We just needed to execute a little bit down the stretch. I
think we turned it up a little bit too late. I think we guarded a little bit
better at the end, but it was able to bring us back in. But they're a tough
opponent. I felt we played hard out there.  
  
Q. Do you think it was the foul call?  
MARCUS FOSTER: You could go back and forth. I felt like I fouled, the ref
didn't see it, so it's something we've got to play through.  
  
Q. Marcus, you seemed awfully fired up throughout the whole second half,
maybe more so than usual. I guess, it looked like this game meant a lot to
you. Why do you think that was?  
MARCUS FOSTER: It's funny how a number at the beginning of a team name brings
so much urgency and fires up a team. It's the No. 3 team in the country, and
you know we're playing in the tournament we all wanted to play against on a
big stage and on ESPN. So the guys are really fired up for this game.  
  
Q. Marcus, you kind of were quiet in the second half and you hit a lay ‑up.
Did that get you going and loosen you up a little bit?   
MARCUS FOSTER: Always when I see the ball go through the hole it loosens me up
a little bit. I felt a little tight because I hadn't scored in the second half
yet, but that definitely loosened me up a little bit.  
  
Q. Thomas, in the second half about midway through you went from down one to
up 10 or 11. What do you think was the key for you to stay in it, keep
fighting back and give yourself a shot late?  
THOMAS GIPSON: We just have to rebound. We didn't do a good job of that. I
felt like we were just going back and forth with scoring, and that's not going
to help us win, especially if they're up. So we just had to get stops, and
late down the stretch, we didn't do that.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I guess the same thing. How tough was it, I think, four trips there
inside the two minute mark you guys didn't get a point, and you still made it
at the end. But how critical were those?  
COACH WEBER: A couple opportunities. Nino had a little jumper that went in and
out. I think that would have been the one to tie it. We got down on the shot
clock. I guess I should have maybe used the time out when our play didn't work
the next possession. Nino, he took it to the hoop. What you want to do is try
to draw a foul. Again, that one rolled off the basket. They just did a little
better job of executing down the stretch.  
You asked about when they got up 11. We got stops in that stretch. That's how
we got back into it. We had some opportunities. We've got to make the easy
lay‑ups. We need Justin Edwards. This is all new to him. It's a big stage. We
had one lob dunk in the first half. We followed our own guide. Both of them
are going for the lob dunks and we followed each other. And all those little
plays add up. We kept battling. I thought we made a lot of plays, but they
made a couple more that helped them win the game.  
  
Q. Was that kind of the ideal effort you want your guys to play with all the
time?  
COACH WEBER: Well, I told them if we play like yesterday and today we're going
to beat a lot of good teams. We've got to get a little better on the offensive
end against good people, against teams that really guard. Hopefully that will
come when we get back. But right now we've got to come up with that big‑ time
effort tomorrow and see if we can get a third‑place finish here and go home
with a good feeling against playing pretty good competition and kind of
regroup. You've got home game Tuesday, next week, and then go on the road to
Tennessee. It's not going to be any easier.  
  
Q. Thomas mentioned it, but how critical was the rebounding difference?  
COACH WEBER: They had eight offensive and we had seven. But it seemed like
theirs, they get 12 second‑chance points and we had six. So those few baskets,
it's a four‑point game, a two‑possession game. Those are the differences. We
got called for an over the back. They go over the back and they don't get
called. There are some little plays like that. But you can't rely on the refs.
You've got to box out and make sure you get the ball on and the call. I think
they had a couple of put backs there in key times.  
  
Q. Can you analyze that stretch when they did go up 11? What went right and
what went wrong for them?  
COACH WEBER: I think we missed a few shots. We broke down defensively, and we
got it. That's where we've got to grow up and learn when teams make runs, to
make sure we get a good shot. You can't be casual with passes and then really
be disciplined on the defensive end.  
I guess the only way you can do that is to go through these experiences. We
took a gamble coming here and going to Long Beach on the way. Hopefully we
learned a lot about our team and we can use it as a positive step forward as
we get deeper into December and into the conference.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 25, 2014

  

### [Steve Fisher](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13806)

### [Trey Kell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27926)

_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

San Diego State  74  
Pittsburgh  57

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Fisher, some opening comments on tonight's game?  
COACH FISHER: I like how we played. We played together. We guarded hard, made
it difficult for them to get easy shots, and we fought like crazy on the
glass. They're a very good offensive rebounding team, and they showed it again
tonight. You look at the total 17, and it's hard to keep them off the glass. I
thought the way we played and shared the ball and moved the ball is indicative
of a mature team that cares more about winning than their own personal stats.
When you do that, you've got a chance because we've got good players. You know
that.  
We're proud of what we've done and we look forward to an opportunity tomorrow
to play a team that's as good as anybody in the country. We're excite about
that opportunity. When we talked down here, Winston said I hope they ask me a
question tonight. So somebody ask him a question.  
  
Q. Winston, last night you were the guy who kind of ignited the team.
Tonight Trey did. Can you just talk about how much you've seen him grow just
in five games and what he brought to the table? Trey, can you just talk about
are you feeling more comfortable out there in what you saw?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: Well, Trey's been great. I think these last two games the
country is starting to see what we've known really since this summer. He's a
good player. I know it's his first time playing point guard, but I thought he
was being more aggressive this tournament and looking for his shot. That's
going to open it up for everybody. Just got to continue to work at it and
continue to get better every day.  
TREY KELL: For me, basically the same as Winston was saying. The first couple
games came out tentative, nervous, the big stage and over these past games I
felt like myself out there, felt comfortable with my coaches and teammates
pushing me to be aggressive. I'm helping the team and coming out with
victories.  
  
Q. Trey, you guys seemed to get to the basket almost every time you wanted
to. Is that something you saw that maybe you'd be able to take advantage of
against Pitt or is it what you're trying to do every single night?  
TREY KELL: For us, I think it's more of a read because he come off the screen,
and we can always swing it. If they go underneath, we can always shoot it. I
felt like today with the hedge, some of the bigs were hedging a little soft so
we could take advantage of that and get to the rim.  
  
Q. San Diego State seems like it just keeps bumping into Arizona. Can you
just talk about playing these guys one more time out here?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: For me, this will be my fourth time playing them. 0‑3 so far,
so I just want to be able to get a win. We just happened to be two great teams
in a lot of the same tournaments, I guess.  
TREY KELL: For me, this is my first time, but I've seen all the games on TV,
so I feel like I'm part of it. I'm just trying to help these guys get their
first victory against them, and have me start off on the right note.  
  
Q. Since you're the last players to ask a question today, I'd like to ask
you a frivolous one. What do you think of Maui?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: I love it. Hopefully when I get Coach Fisher's age, I can
have a house out here.  
  
Q. Is Coach going to let you jump off black rock after the game tomorrow?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: What's that? I haven't heard of it.  
  
Q. You get to dive however many feet into the ocean?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: Not me. Not me.  
  
Q. Winston, you had a big game last night, and tonight, 13, 7 rebounds and
three assists. Do you feel like you've talked a lot about the potential living
up to the hype fairly or unfairly? Do you feel like you're starting to turn
that corner now?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: Absolutely. I don't mean to be funny at all, but do you
remember what I said to your wife the other night? I told her I would pick it
up. She told me I was one of her favorite players. Sometimes I feel like I get
judged unfairly, but some of it is fair.  
At the end of the day, I just try not to worry about it. I come out and try to
get to the glass. Try to rebound and try to get to the free‑throw line and do
whatever I can to help my team win. So I think I got off to an okay start back
in Viejas. I think I had two games in a row where I wasn't so good. But this
is the stage, and I pride myself in performing on the biggest stage.  
  
Q. Winston of all the times you've played Arizona, I was wondering what your
memories were that game in Honolulu a couple years ago? It really went down to
the wire, a terrific game. What do you recall?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: I remember my old teammate, Nick Johnson stealing the wind
from us. I thought we'd played great. I thought Chase Tapley had an open look,
and Nick just, he made a great play. That's why he's in the NBA right now. So
me personally I just want to redeem it. Like I said so far, since I've been
here, 0‑3 versus them. So hopefully we can turn the corner tomorrow. I think
we have a great team and match up pretty good with them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You guys allowed by far the most points that you had this season last
night to BYU. What did you do to sort of ratchet it up defensively tonight
again against Pitt?  
COACH FISHER: I thought we played really good defense against BYU. I don't
know what the score was as it came down to the end of regulation, but they
were well below what they had been averaging. You throw an extra half of a
half in and you're going to have more points. We're a good defensive team. If
we continue to work on keeping the guy in front of us, keeping the guy in
front of us. Don't give him anything on run outs, box out and rebound, we'll
make it hard for people to score a lot of points because we're long, we're
athletic.  
At times we can say, okay, we're going to switch one through four. At times
we're going to say don't switch anything. At times we're going to say run
double in the post. Sometimes we'll say we're not going to double. So I think
we can say what do we think in this game will help us, and we've got a lot of
different ways to go. I think good defensive teams can do that. But it starts
with guarding the ball and having a collective effort of be a good teammate,
stunt, help, make it hard for them to get good looks.  
  
Q. You talked about the unselfishness of your team and how you play as a
team and guys give up their own personal stats to win. Do you recruit that
kind of player or is that something that you have to instill in them because
the stereotype now is young players, that's not what they want to do or that's
not how they play the game anymore.  
COACH FISHER: I think everybody wants to win. There is not a player that we
recruit or anybody else recruits who doesn't want to be on the floor. You
know. That's what we all have to negotiate and to teach to is you have to be
the ultimate teammate. How can you be that? By being unselfish. By being happy
for someone else's successes. Hard to do. We try to recruit the best players
we can. We want good character, but we're no different than anybody else. We
teach, and prepare share the ball, early up, give it to the first open man. We
have three fifth‑year seniors, and I think our older guys set the table for
our younger guys. We have four new recruits in, all highly regarded, and they
very quickly fell into the group theory of play together. Don't worry about
me, worry about me and we'll be good.  
So I think we're now at a stage where the older guys could help the younger
guys, and we get good kids, but most of these teams who are here, I would say
all these teams who are here have good kids in their programs.  
  
Q. Coach, you played really heavy minutes last time against BYU. JJ played
48, and couple other guys played in their 40s. Bunch of career high in
minutes. How imperative was it for you to go to your bench early, and how
important was it that they kind of responded and allowed you to not to play
more. I'm looking here, and Winston played 28, and that's pretty much it.  
COACH FISHER: We knew we were going to have to sub frequently, that multitude
of Sky's play would be impactful on tonight's game. So I told the players I
don't know exactly how, but we're going to play a lot of you, so be ready. We
subbed four people starting with the first TV timeout and we've got good
results.  
But we've got good players, and all those guys are nipping at the heels of the
guys who get called to be part of the starting lineup. They want to be there.
So they come in, compete hard. I thought we got great defensive play from
Dakarai Allen tonight when he came in. He needs to go from fifth gear on
defense to two and half gears on offense at times when he tries to lower his
head.  
But I thought he did some really good things. Angelo did a nice job, and we've
been steady with those other guys, AQ, and Zabo. It's good to see Malik get
in, and I told him after the game, progress, progress, and progress is our
most important goal. Just inch forward. Don't get in a hurry.

_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

BYU  121  
Chaminade  85

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Coach Dave Rose, Anson Winder, and Chase Fischer to
the media room this afternoon. Coach, some opening comments on today's win?  
COACH ROSE: Well, first of all, I think that I couldn't be more pleased or
really impressed with our guys today. I think that we fought hard and we
competed well last night and didn't come up with the win, and a double
overtime loss. With a quick turnaround, you just kind of wonder what you're
going to get from your guys. I was just really impressed with how focused they
were, how dialed in they were.  
We were really good offensively and got better as the game went on
defensively. But I've been through some pretty tough turnarounds with a lot of
teams, and this one was maybe as impressive as I've seen. So I'm happy for our
guys. Happy for our fans that we got a win, and look forward to a big game
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Chase, you break a record held by Jimmer Fredette. That's pretty cool.
Can you give me your thoughts on that?  
CHASE FISCHER: Yeah, it's awesome. I grew up and my junior and senior in high
school I watched Jimmer all the time, and never really knew I'd end up at BYU.
It's awesome to break that record for such a good player. But I think I'm more
excited about the win and bouncing back from yesterday.  
  
Q. Chase, Adam Morrison's record for this tournament is 43. Did you ever
think about it in the back of your mind to try to break that record?  
CHASE FISCHER: No, I didn't. Maybe for a second I thought I could get like
maybe 50 when I was back in my high school days. But that's awesome. I'm just
glad we won it. I'm glad my teammates were finding me and the ball was going
in the hoop.  
  
Q. Chase, you were 9 for 10 from three ‑point land in the first half. Have
you ever in your life shot the ball like that for a half?   
CHASE FISCHER: My first game of my senior year in high school I had a 10 for
10 half. So it was kind of the same deal. I don't know. Just the hoop was
really big for me in the first half, so I didn't even realize I actually shot
that many threes in the first half. Didn't feel like it. So, yeah, it was
good.  
  
Q. Anson, could you talk about your team's mindset after that tough loss and
quick turnaround? What was going through your mind as you prepared for this
game today?  
ANSON WINDER: It's a pretty bittersweet feeling. It hurt to go home after a
loss like yesterday. But to know we're going to play again today is an
exciting feeling. We were able to get up and get ready for this team we played
today. It was exciting to know that you can bounce back from a loss like that
and get a W.  
  
Q. Chase, could you just talk about from your time at Wake Forest and red
‑shirting until now and just kind of finding your role and your way on this
team and what that journey has been like?   
CHASE FISCHER: Yeah, it's been a really long journey. I had two great years at
Wake Forest that I really enjoyed. I just kind of wanted a change of scenery,
change of pace. I transferred to BYU, and the red‑shirt year was I think the
best thing that could have happened for me in my basketball career. I've
matured a lot. I've learned how to really work hard in the college level, and
I learned the system at BYU. I'm so happy and blessed to be here at BYU with a
great coaching staff and best teammates I could ever have.  
Yeah, it's been a long journey, and it's awesome playing with these guys every
day.  
  
Q. Anson, you guys shot the ball really well from three tonight, but it
seemed you also set the tone in getting to the basket early and kind of
getting to the rim. Was that a focus for you and was that a role you look to
fill on this team?  
ANSON WINDER: I feel that whatever role was needed at the time is what I hope
to bring to the table. Yeah, the basket was pretty big for us in the beginning
of the half. We were hitting some big shots. I think it just adds another
dimension to our team if we can get to the basket and get the bigs in foul
trouble and just kind of bring a different mindset to our offense. We were
hitting on all cylinders so it helped to get to the rim and hit open shots, so
it worked in our favor tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, was fatigue at all a factor early in the game? I mean, basically
14 hours earlier you guys had just finished a 50 ‑minute game?   
COACH ROSE: I think we looked a little bit slow defensively to start. They
seemed to make a couple quick shots and then drove it, got the offensive
rebound. After that first four‑minute timeout I thought our guys kind of
changed gears a little bit. But fatigue shouldn't be an issue. It's early in
the year. We've got every form of hydration possible to keep our guys going.
The message that I try to give to our guys is that it's a long summer. It's a
long off‑season. You think about the days when you're trying to find ten guys
to get in the gym and play a pick‑up game and get going, and we've got a game.
We've got fans and we've got referees. We were disappointed from the loss, but
we got a chance to really go out and play ask compete.  
I think it was Anson that said he was really excited to be able to play
another game and so quickly and get that kind of bitter taste out of your
mouth. Our guys did a good job with that.  
Like I said, I was really impressed. I've had a lot of teams, and there could
have been a lot of different types of performances out there, and that was
pretty i for me.  
  
Q. So you guys playing a Division II team, did that change the strategy at
all during the course of the game?  
COACH ROSE: No. The most important thing for us is to, we put a scouting
report together. We prepare for the other team. But half of that scouting
report is us, and how we're going to perform, and what we're going to do in
our system and our style and what we want to play.  
You get a guy like chase that makes shots, and we've got about three or four
guys on our team that are capable of having runs like that. We saw that a lot
last year from chase against us in practice. When he was on the scout team.
That's when I turned to one of my assistants and I said we've seen this before
on days when he would come in and just in that 12 to 15‑minute time span in
practice shoot eight or nine threes. I was just happy that we had something
really positive early in that game to build on and it was how we were shooting
the ball.  
  
Q. Were you calling plays specifically for Chase to get the ball or did it
just come out of a natural progression?  
COACH ROSE: No, I think the last one was a call, a set form. I just told Coach
that I was going to get him out, so let's get him another shot. He hit the one
from the corner. We called a few sets for Jake Toolson because we're trying to
get Jake going a little bit. He played really well the last couple games at
home, but a lot of this tonight was just guys penetrating, moving the ball,
finding each other, and chase just got loose. He's one of those guys that can
kind of float around the three‑point line and find space, and then he's got a
pretty quick release. So it was good today.

_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

San Diego State  74  
Pittsburgh  57

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Dixon. Coach, some comments on tonight's
game?  
COACH DIXON: We don't feel really good about our performance tonight.
Disappointed. I told our players we have an hour to feel sorry for ourselves
and get ready, after that. After dinner we're getting ready for Kansas State.
We know they're good as well, and we'd played against a very good team tonight
who is older, quicker, stronger to the ball to us, and it showed.  
So we're going to come back and play better tomorrow, and that is the message
we got across to our guys. They're very good. They're very well‑coached.
They're big, they're strong, they've got depth, and we hopefully learned a lot
from this game and going forward here. So I give them a lot of credit. We've
got obviously some things to work on. If you told me we outrebounded by 14, I
would have felt pretty good going into it. I would have felt really good. The
turnovers were extremely costly. We're a low‑turnover team, but right now we
definitely struggled with that tonight, and it got them a lot of transition
baskets. So we know where our problems lie. We'll address it, and we'll get
better.  
  
Q. Early in the game they had, I think it was three. You guys had three shot
clock violations. Couldn't seem to get into your offense. Was it just trying
to get used to their size and athleticism, and what they were doing on defense
that was causing that?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: I think that's pretty much on me, and I've got to learn from
it and take it into tomorrow's game and make sure we're better off, especially
early.  
  
Q. Something you guys haven't really seen yet this season, how tough is that
to adjust to for you the way you played last night against Chaminade and then
going up against a team like that.  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: I played against guys my height or taller, I think it was the
guards, pulling, 6'7", 6'8", the point guard was 6'4", and you've got Shepard
who is also the other one who is about 6'8". And they're coming in and
rebounding. So I think that expected it more so the first game. The first game
I would get my man and go for the rebound. This game I would seal my man, and
it was me, my man, and Shepard, and Polee, so it was difficult. Just the
taller, more athletic, and also they were just going after rebounds harder
than we were, and they just wanted it more than us as a team. So I don't think
it was any different. I just think they wanted it more than us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the Coach.  
COACH DIXON: We played on it. I don't think it was effective. We got to get
better with our man‑to‑man defense. They hurt us inside in the zone, and they
hurt us up top in the zone. So question ran it about four or five possessions,
and I think they scored every time. So, you know, they're good and we're not
defensively where we need to be. That's where it went off. Man or zone. And we
did both. We did well. We wanted to control the boards. I thought we got hurt
on the boards in the zone and that did occur, and then obviously they hurt us
by interior passing as well against the zone as well. You can look at
different ways, but they beat us soundly both on man and zone.  
  
Q. San Diego State's stuck down there in the corner of the country. Do you
have a sense how good they are and how good this team can be?  
COACH DIXON: I do. I believe that. The size, once you play against them you
see how big they are. They've got depth. They added another guy so they seem
to have a lot of guys, a lot of guys that can play and they're very
experienced. You've got transfers from all over the place, and they're old,
and they're big. They're well‑coached and they know what they want to do, and
they stuck with it.  
But I think the depth is the thing that really stands out. You have Pope back
in there, and you see Chol making free throws and knocking down jump shots.
It's, again, they've done very well in the transfer market, that's for sure.  
  
Q. I know Cameron's still out for the year. But how much is the lineup still
a work in progress? Guys are playing sort of minutes, fluctuating, game ‑in,
and game‑out, Joel hasn't played much the past couple of games. Ryan's playing
more.   
COACH DIXON: Ryan was hurt, Derrick was hurt. So those are things that have
factors into a lot of things. We have had a unique situation. There is no
question we've got to battle through it, and we've got to get better as the
year progresses. That's where we're at. Nothing is set in stone, as you might
expect. When you have guys out that can't play in certain games and then
practice, you're going to have fluctuating minutes for obvious reasons.  
Obviously, Cameron will be back in where in the near future, and we've got to
get better. So we're a team that certainly isn't where we‑‑ who we thought
we'd be first off. And we've got to figure that out. We lost to a very good
team today. That's clear. So hopefully we'll learn something from a very good
team.  
  
Q. Jamie, was it their length on defense that was giving you guys problems
early in the game? Is that why you were getting a couple of shots?  
COACH DIXON: I said to our guys we did exactly what we wanted to do. Came out,
ran a play and executed it the way we wanted to do it. Got a bucket, got a
charge on the first play, and those are two things we emphasize. The next 39
minutes we seem to go doing things different in how we planned and prepared. I
mean, penetration, we were forcing shots and that's not who we are. We made
bad decisions to pass to the wrong guy. They're going to help down, and we've
got to kick out. We just didn't handle the adversity well and what they did.
That's my fault for not preparing them and having them ready to handle that.

THE MODERATOR: Coach, opening comments about today's game?  
COACH PAINTER: Thank you. I thought our guys were ready to play. I thought we
did a good job on the glass, and then defensively thought we did a good job of
keeping the ball out of the interior for Missouri. We were able to get on the
break and kind of steal some points.  
Also, I just thought we executed well in that first half. So having to wake up
and both teams lose and being able to play at 9:00 a.m., I thought our guys
responded.  
  
Q. You obviously embraced a big leadership role with this team. How did you
process the disappointment yesterday and how did that fuel you coming into
today? It seemed like you tried to set a tone defensively?  
RAPHEAL DAVIS: I put a lot of yesterday on my self. Being an upperclassman, I
played like an underclass man. I played softer than I should have played. I
didn't play as hard as I could. I had a long talk watching film with Coach,
and last night I had a long night thinking about last night's game. They be I
realized it was over and there is nothing I could do about it. Just go into
this game and play as hard as I could, and help us lead to victory?  
  
Q. Jon, you really seemed to, your whole team seemed to take them out of
what they wanted to do offensively. Where did that effort come from in the
first half?  
JON OCTEUS: We watched film yesterday, and we kind of saw that we didn't play
hard. And that is one thing that's unacceptable. You never want to say we lost
the game because we didn't play hard enough. So we just took that approach.
Did a good job scouting them. We knew what was coming and it was going to come
down to a ball screen and staying in front of them. So that's what we folk
used on.  
  
Q. Rapheal, yesterday it seemed like you had difficulty kind of getting into
the game. Today you were very aggressive. Got to the free ‑throw line a lot.
Just what was the difference today?   
RAPHEAL DAVIS: I just was talking to our other captain today, Neal Beshears,
and just talked about going out and playing as hard as I could. Not worrying
about nothing else but the scouting report and playing as hard as I could.
That ended up getting me to the free‑throw line and getting me aggressive.  
  
Q. Basil, we talked all summer about your role on this team to potentially
be running the floor and playing with a lot of energy. It seems that's exactly
what you did today. Could you talk about the ways you feel you impacted this
game?  
BASIL SMOTHERMAN: I feel like I impacted the game today just by my energy and
kind of just being out there and talking on defense and kind of having guys
back when they got beat. Coming on help side a lot. And Jon Octeus told me
you're our energy guy, and that's what I did today. Just kind of running the
floor. Coach Paint tells me all the time just to run to the basket when I'm on
a break or something like that, and that's what I did. I kind of just played
off my energy, and just fed off of everybody's energy today.  
  
Q. Jon, in what ways did Rapheal come out and set a defensive tone today? In
what ways did defense fuel everything that you guys did in sort of taking over
in the first half?  
RAPHEAL DAVIS: He started off on one of their best players, kind of knocked
him out in beginning. He had a hard time scoring the ball. He everybody did a
good job of understanding the scouting report, and it all goes back to playing
hard. We got back to playing hard, and it showed today?  
  
Q. Rapheal, in the way you guys responded from yesterday, what do you feel
you learned about your team today?  
RAPHEAL DAVIS: We set a new bar for ourselves being able to wake up this early
in the morning, eat breakfast and come to the gym and being at a place to play
as hard as we did. Especially in the first half, and being so early, and the
time difference being back home. It showed us how hard we can play and how
hard we can continue to play and keep setting new bars for ourselves.  
  
Q. Basil, put you on the spot because you're sitting next to him. But how
has it impacted this team to have Jon sort of fall into your laps right before
the season started and make this kind of impact?  
BASIL SMOTHERMAN: It was an early Christmas present for us. He's a great kid.
He's a great player on the court. He's a leader. He's an old man, kind of.
He's old man on the team. He just came in and didn't hold back. He just kind
of embraced the leadership role with Neal, and he's just been great for us.
Bringing energy every day and guarding and jamming and just giving 110% every
day. That's great. He learned everything quickly, so that was great for us.  
  
Q. Rapheal, what has Isaacs personality, sort of the physicality he plays
with, sort of the intensity he's been playing without here, what's that
brought to your team?  
RAPHEAL DAVIS: Just a physical presence. I actually heard Missouri players
getting down there, I heard them huddle up one time and they were talking
about they didn't know what to do. They felt he was hitting them in all types
of ways they'd never been hit before. So him being that physical was just a
boost to our team and adds that physicality that we need.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Painter.  
  
Q. You said Sunday that you thought that Kansas State could in some way
benefit from that first loss. Sometimes you benefit from that first loss. Do
you feel like that happened with you guys at all?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, we were shell shocked in the first half of our Kansas
State game. We threw the ball to Kansas State. Just threw the ball to them on
the press a couple times. They didn't trap us. They didn't run at us. Just
gave them easy baskets. Then we had a five second count where guys didn't cut
hard. We had faced a team in Samford that pressed the whole time. You know,
Rick Pitino, Tubby Smith type background and the way they pressed. Our guys
did a great job and handled that. And Kansas State that's not really their
blueprint; they'll mix it up and throw something at you. Then they were able
to smell blood in the water and they pressured us into some turnovers. I
thought once we calmed down we were a lot better. We still couldn't stop them
in the second half after scoring 55 points.  
But we competed in the second half. I thought today we were ready to go and we
really competed. But I think them getting beaten by Long Beach State has got
you on edge. You can learn a lot from one loss. There is no need to have two
losses, but you can learn a lot from one loss.  
  
Q. What thank you learn about your team today in the way it responded to
yesterday?  
COACH PAINTER: It was very similar to when we were in Maui eight years ago. I
thought we had a pretty good effort against Georgia Tech, and we were able to
bounce back in the 9:00 a.m. game the next day and be ready to play. Anytime
you have to wake up 6:30 in the morning, you're not used to it. And get
prepared for a basketball game and play, I think it shows the character of
your team. We had some guys that want to understand the game. They want to win
and put in a lot of time. But still need to play under these circumstances,
but they were able to step up and play well today.  
  
Q. The job that Rapheal did today was a tone setter. It seemed he came out
with a lot of intensity, and that sparked the offense?  
COACH PAINTER: I think anytime you have big posts and you get those guys to
really post strong, even when they don't get the basketball, they take on that
back line help. So Rapheal was able to get past his man, and he got a lot of
fouls called that way for him. And he was able to make his free throws. That
was great. Rapheal really just capitalized on some opportunities, getting in
transition and breaking people down and finishing at the basket. Most of his
points came from the free‑throw line.  
  
Q. Do you feel this is a team that could generate offense off of defense or
was tonight an outlier?  
COACH PAINTER: I think so. The one thing we struggled at Kansas State is we
had some opportunities and then we just didn't finish. You can't come away
empty handed when you get into primary breaks. You get into a two on one or
three on two. You need to get two points, or three points or get fouled. We
had too many of those possessions and opportunities where we didn't get
anything. I think we've got to continue to do that, but we have to be solid.
We have to be solid on defense and be able to take what they give us. If they
don't give us anything, anytime we gamble, they made us pay. That's the type
of defensive team we're going to be.  
  
Q. How did you feel your team responded to yesterday's result and just kind
of what are your thoughts now 24 hours later?  
COACH PAINTER: I thought they did a good job. They responded. Both teams are
in the same position where they lose a game and they have to play the early
morning game. They played the game after us yesterday, so they didn't have as
much rest. I don't think that matters. It's still waking up and having a
focus. Our guys are ready. I thought we rebounded the ball well. Our guards
took care of the ball in the first half. Our guards only had two turnovers in
the first half, and that was an important part of the game.  
  
Q. I think you made 15 straight free throws there at the end. What's that
say about your team's concentration? It's poised in a big moment.  
COACH PAINTER: Obviously, it's not a possession game or anything and they're
making them. You're up 20 points or 25 points. It's good to make free throws
because that's what wins or loses games. So we lost a handful of games last
year where you can simply earmark the free throw category that beat us. Now if
you can do those things, you're going to put yourself in a better position to
hopefully win those.  
  
Q. Gill ‑Caesar came in as their leading scorer. Was he a point of emphasis
in your game plan?   
COACH PAINTER: Without question. We recruited Techie and went to Canada and
met with his family. Just a tough match‑up with his size, his athleticism, his
strength. He can post you up. He can play on the perimeter. He can drive it.
He can shoot it. And that's Rapheal Davis I think kind of got himself going
today. We didn't want him to catch it in the post. We wanted to keep it in
front of us. I thought Rapheal did a good job.

## November 25, 2014

### [Kiran Shastri](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27924)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

BYU  121  
Chaminade  85

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Chaminade to the media room. Coach, some opening
comments about the game?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Well, first of all, we've had Dave Odom over here for four
years giving defensive clinic presentations on the aisle. I probably should
have paid attention. But besides that we're a record‑setting team either one
way or the other. We either give up records or sometimes break them. Yeah,
obviously when you shoot the ball 14 for 18 from the three‑point line in the
first half, it's a tough road to go down after that. I give it to them. They
shot the ball incredibly. We know we could have played a little better defense
and made them rather contested threes rather than open threes. So I was a
little disappointed in that fact.  
  
Q. Have you guys ever experienced a guy going 9 for 10 from three in a half
against you?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Not in my life or with any team, honestly. He felt confident, I
guess. The goal got bigger every time he hit, and he kept hitting. We tried to
get to his body and make him drive, but that didn't work. They kept setting
screens for him and he'd find a way to get open. He's good at that. He's good
at finding a lane and using screens to get open and knock it down once he gets
it.  
  
Q. Coach, Lee's been playing significantly less minutes than he has last
season. What is the mentality of him going into the rest of the season?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Well, I don't know what his mentality is, but my mentality is
that the minute I think that we don't have a chance to come back and win, I'm
going to arrest him because we've got a long, hard season ahead and he's going
to be a very, very valuable player. His freshman and sophomore year he got
worn down toward the end of the season. I mean, last year I played him a lot
of times. We played 40 minutes a game. And we may do that before the season's
out.  
But anytime we play, if I feel that we're either ahead enough that they can't
come back or we're behind, then I'm going to rest him as much as possible.  
  
Q. Kiran, you were at 3 for 10 from the three ‑point land. Did you take
anytime to go inside rather than take some outside shots from NBA range?   
KIRAN SHASTRI: Not really. Coach gives me the confidence to take them, so if I
see any open shots I'm going to take them. But they did a good job of guarding
us, hand in face, so it was just a tough night for us.  
  
Q. Kiran, how much was rebounding on your mind today?  
KIRAN SHASTRI: Yesterday's game was really tough rebounding‑wise. We knew that
going into the game. But going into today's game we felt like we matched up
well against them as far as the size. But I thought we just did a good job on
the inside forcing them to take threes. But they were incredible shooters and
they did their job and they hit them. They live and die by the three and they
won it.

III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26668)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Purdue  82  
Missouri  61

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Coach Kim Anderson, Johnathan Williams, III, and Wes
Clark to the press room this morning. Coach, an opening statement?  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, it wasn't very good. The first half was embarrassing. We
didn't play very well. I thought Purdue did a great job. They had us back on
our heels. We didn't execute very well, obviously. We challenged our guys in
the second half, and I thought we did come back and play better. We made some
shots. Thought we executed better.  
But overall you've got to give Purdue a lot of credit. They took it at us from
the git‑go. They played an inspired brand of basketball. We didn't to start
with. We did once we got behind, but we weren't aggressive. We weren't in
attack mode. We were back on our heels.  
  
Q. Why do you think you guys were so timid early?  
JOHNATHAN WILLIAMS: I just think we weren't all the way prepared? We're going
to have to bring as much effort as we should have, underestimated them. Purdue
executed very well and played great defense.  
  
Q. Johnathan, the two seven ‑footers, how did those guys kind of impact the
way you guys wanted to play on both ends?   
JOHNATHAN WILLIAMS: They were extremely big, but it was kind of hard to guard.
They kind of like stayed in the paint and kind of clogged things up a little
bit for us. But I think overall Purdue played a great game.  
  
Q. You guys struggled with turnovers yesterday, and they were ready to take
advantage of some of those today. Why were they so tough to keep out of
transition?  
JOHNATHAN WILLIAMS: They probably just pushed the ball and put it on us. We
should have gotten back, but in some plays we didn't, especially on turnovers.
When you take bad shots it's kind of hard to get back on defense because
everybody's out of position.  
So we just had to take better shots and stop turning the ball over in order to
get that inside out in transition.  
  
Q. For both players, how important do you think it will be tomorrow to get a
win and leave Hawaii with at least something in the good column?  
JOHNATHAN WILLIAMS: It's actually very big for us. We are down on ourselves a
little bit at this time and a little uncomfortable, so it will be good to get
back on track and kind of find ourselves and be a little bit more confident
about our team while pushing forward.  
  
Q. Wes, I noticed you were in the sleeve on your knee today. How much was
that bothering you from yesterday and what you did exactly?  
WES CLARK: Not a lot. Just a little sore, but we're still in good shape.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You were pretty encouraged by the way your guys played Arizona yesterday.
What was the difference in the first half especially?  
COACH ANDERSON: I thought Purdue just did a great job. I thought they were
much, much more aggressive than we were. I don't think we came out with the
same intensity level that we had yesterday, which is disappointing, because
Purdue is a great basketball program, and it's a good team. Matt Painter does
a great job. I think they came out more inspired than we did, and that
shouldn't happen, especially when you're playing in this type of situation and
in a tournament situation. I do think we got turned around a little bit in the
second half.  
But come on, guys, let's be honest. They were up 34. So everybody was just
hooping, and we did better. We did some things better, but certainly
disappointing overall performance.  
  
Q. What did you think of the two seven ‑footers and how they impacted the
game?   
COACH ANDERSON: I think I was looking, and I was curious how many blocked
shots they had, and they had eight. The two of them had five. But I think they
changed your shots and we probably hadn't played anybody like that this year.
We encouraged our guys to attack the basket, and we did to a certain extent.  
But I heard you asked the question. I thought they really did a great job in
transition, they did. The reason they did a great job is because we were
taking so many lousy shots in the first half. I mean, we were just chucking
things up from three and that's not our game. We're a good shooting team, but
we're not a great shooting team when we don't take good shots.  
The game was decided at fast breakpoints. They had second chance points. They
had turnovers. I mean, there's a 26‑point advantage right there, so got to do
a better job.  
  
Q. That was a less ‑confident performance by Montaque than you've seen. Just
how different were things for him today and how eye opening was the way they
played?   
COACH ANDERSON: He's a freshman, you know? The further along you go the harder
it's going to get because they're going to guard you. I mean, he just gave me
the score sheet, and when you look on the score sheet it says Montaque
Gill‑Ceasar is a leading scorer. So they're going to guard you. When you're
young, you've got to learn how to overcome that. You have to learn how to move
harder, how to come off screens better, how to guard better. It's not just
him, it's everybody.  
I think when you're young it's been easier for you at the level you were at
before. Not that it was easy, but it's been a little bit easier. Here, I mean,
we're playing Purdue. It's a Big Ten school. They're coming after you. They
got beat yesterday too. So we're going to have these growing pains. I mean,
it's going to happen. On a positive side, I thought Deuce Bello came in, Namon
Wright came in, Keanau Post came in. I thought they gave us some energy along
with Keith there in the second half that enabled us to at least shrink the
lead, to at least get the game back to where it was a 20‑point game.  
Our goal was to win the second half. I think we probably did but, again, when
you're down as much as we were, you've got to find little victories.  
  
Q. You ditched the ESPN mic at halftime. Did you want to keep things private
in that locker room?  
COACH ANDERSON: No, I told the guys at halftime there is nothing that I'm
going to say that would be television worthy. Not that it was bad or anything,
it's just I think it was a situation where I needed to coach my team and I
didn't need to be on ESPN. They were seeing it live. They didn't need to hear
any commentary from me because it probably wouldn't have been any better than
the play.

Kansas State  88  
Purdue  79

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening question from Coach Painter. Coach,
if you want to start with an opening statement about this morning's game?  
COACH PAINTER: I thought there were a couple things, kind of the difference in
the game, obviously. Their ability to rebound in the first half and our
inability to take care of the basketball. I thought once we settled down and
competed better in the second half we did a better job on the glass and
obviously took care of the basketball. That's why you saw a better offensive
performance from us in the second half. I thought the split of the game was
kind of some of those big baskets.  
Once we got up to two or three possessions, Marcus Foster hits the bank in
three, a tough 7 footer at the end of the shot clock. And I thought Gipson,
right there, even though we played good defense, he knocked that shot down
right there. We were getting it to two possessions and we needed to get a
stop, and we weren't able to do that. That's part of digging too big of a
hole. When you have to fight like that and scrap like that, everything has to
go your way down the stretch. Give them credit. I thought they were quicker to
the basketball. I thought they were tougher than us in the first half. We
weren't ready to handle that.  
  
Q. Jon, what was it in the first half you kind of sensed that sort of led to
all the turnovers? Were guys getting a little rattled?  
JON OCTEUS: I'm not sure exactly what it was. We just didn't come prepared to
play. We always say first five minutes we've got to go out there with the most
focus that we can, and we didn't do that in the first half. Second half we
came out. First five minutes we did a really good job. So we've just got to
focus in when it comes to things like that. We can't be rattled by that
environment.  
  
Q. Kendall, this is the first time you guys have faced a situation like that
where the other team is sort of take things over. I guess just talk about how
you did or didn't respond to that problem in the first half when all the
momentum was going the other way?  
KENDALL STEPHENS: I thought we came out in the second half and we changed our
intensity. I think we put more focus in on what we needed to do. I think the
game is over with now. I think we showed that we can play with intensity like
we should have, and we're about to see for our next game if we can bounce
back. If we're going to get hit and knocked down or if we're going to stand
up. So I think our next game is going to be really big for us.  
  
Q. Isaac, just how physical was it inside? It seemed like Kansas State sent
three different guys at you. What was it like to go against all three of
them?  
ISAAC HAAS: They were pretty physical. But I think it was more about angles
and being physical and not fouling. We really, me and A.J. tried our best to
post up, keep our hands high, and not try to push back whenever they were
pushing. It didn't work out, but I think that the next game that we should be
able to post up and do very well.  
  
Q. Kendall, you were part of the Oklahoma State game last year. Was this
kind of the same?  
KENDALL STEPHENS: Yeah, I was actually just talking about that with Coach
Painter. Yeah, it's a very similar scenario that we went through with being
down 20 points and having to battle back and just digging ourselves into a
hole was too much. The best thing about this is we're in a same situation, and
we're going to see how we respond.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Painter.  
  
Q. What kind of things were they finding on the baseline with their offense?
Was that a breakdown in your zone or a function of A.J. being out?  
COACH PAINTER: Little bit of both. I thought they did a good job of getting
the ball in the short corner and then were really working that base line. They
were posting up our center in the zone and we have to get in front of that guy
so we can rotate and cover that, and they were doing a good job of posting
those guys up.  
Then they got into foul trouble and those guys tried to slide behind at that
time and that just made it worse. But we weren't handling that outside screen
against the zone well. We were supposed to go under it with Marcus Foster.
Stay into it, and if you go under and pick up the basketball, the guy can push
back and cover the short corner. I don't know if I lost you or not, but that
was kind of the breakdown.  
We made some adjustments with it and did a better job. Then when we subbed,
they exposed us again. We really wanted to switch up our defenses and not
stick with the zone as much as we did. But once we got into that foul trouble,
it was hard to do.  
  
Q. You guys had talked about the turnover issues through those first three
games. Even though it was obscured by the lopsided victory. What went wrong
from an offensive standpoint today as far as taking care of the ball?  
COACH PAINTER: When you turn the ball over 11 times and you try to generalize
and you have 11 particular different scenarios that led to them‑‑ the ones
that were difficult were the pick sixes, threw it right to them and they score
the lay‑up. So we had a couple of those, and missed two front end one and
ones. We had an eight‑point swing in a short amount of time and it really hurt
us.  
But we just‑‑ we panicked. We had a couple bad shots that don't go in the
turnover column that are light turnovers or worse than turnovers at times. So
we just got into a rush and didn't show patience, and we just have to do a
better job at taking care of the basketball and being sure of ourselves.  
  
Q. Coach, they used a new starting lineup and threw a lot of subs at you in
the first half, even broke out a full court press. How much of that was
surprising to you?  
COACH PAINTER: None of it. They pressed the other night against Long Beach
State. I actually wrote their starting lineup on the board before they gave
it. It's not a hard one when you've been with somebody for a while and
something goes wrong what they're going to do. So I wrote their starting
lineup, they brought it to me, and I already had it up on the board. So
they're going to be better playing small in my opinion. I love Nino Williams.
I think Malek Harris is only going to get better and better.  
With those two big guys, rotating them because you get into foul trouble, and
I just thought they would attack us that way. We'd have liked to play more man
against them if we could have. But they were very physical, and they were very
quick to the ball. I just thought they played so hard in the first half. I
thought that was the difference in the game. We turned it over, but you have
to give their pressure a little bit of credit there in my opinion.  
  
Q. Like you said, very physical games. What did you think of how Isaac did
down low?  
COACH PAINTER: I thought Isaac was great. You know, they went and they pressed
us and did some different things. We saw a press earlier and sometimes against
Samford we did some good things that will take a big guy out of the equation.
But I thought once we got into the half court and were able to get him the
basketball.  
He's going to have to learn little things about the game. He's going to have
to learn to get rebounds and not swing his elbows. He's going to have to be
physical with fouling. He's so big, I think it's also difficult for people to
rep, to be quite frank with you. But he's got to learn some basic things to
really help himself.  
But I thought he played hard. I thought he competed. Getting good, low post
position against Thomas Gipson is not easy. Thomas Gipson is a load. He's a
good player, man, he's a good, physical player. I thought Isaac was great
tonight.  
  
Q. Understanding that obviously every team is different, every season is
different, this was very similar to Oklahoma State last year. After Oklahoma
State last year, the Washington State game happened. Just generally speaking,
are there any pitfalls your team has to watch out for tomorrow?  
COACH PAINTER: No, I think we have to examine some of our shortcomings that
happened in this game and get them corrected. But we have to play hard. You've
got to remember the past but not focus on it. I think it's important for us to
just take care of the basketball, and be able to handle somebody's pressure
whether they're trapping or pressing or man‑to‑man heat and take care of the
basketball. I don't think it's anything different. You are going to play a
different team tomorrow and a different style, whoever that might be. So just
get prepared for them, but you also have to focus on yourself.

### [Thomas Gipson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26659)

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Kansas State  88  
Purdue  79

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Coach Weber to the media room this morning for
today's press conference. We'll start the press conference with an opening
statement from Coach, followed by questions for the player, and then we'll
dismiss the player and take questions for the coach. Coach Weber, if you would
like to give us an opening statement on this morning's game?  
COACH WEBER: Well, it was a good hard‑fought win for us. I thought when you
make shots, we didn't make shots last Friday at Long Beach. When you make
shots you look better as a team, there is no doubt about that. Marcus jumped
up and made some big shots. When they made a run at us, Marcus's three, Thomas
Gipson back‑to‑back in the paint, scored buckets. We give up 55 in the second
half.  
I thought the game was dictated right from the beginning we had a great sense
of urgency. We guard the heck out of him, our Wayne McClain play hard chart.
We were 36‑18\. We had doubled them at halftime. Loose balls diving on the
floor. Marcus still on the floor, gets the timeout. Just all those little
things that we kind of set for the game. We knew Coach Painter would get after
them. They came back, and Stephens obviously made a lot of improvement. I
recruited his dad and I know Kendall very well since he was a little kid. He's
playing at a high level. And then Haas, you know, we saw him make some plays
in some of the other games, but no way did we think he could do some of the
things he did tonight. He's big time. He's going to be a handful. I thought
when we stopped their initial action, we guarded them pretty well.  
Obviously, in the second half we didn't get many stops on the initial action,
but we fought through it. Made plays when it counted, and got enough rebounds
down the stretch to get a win and move on.  
  
Q. How important was it to do those little things coming off the way you
guys did?  
MARCUS FOSTER: It was definitely important. I felt in Long Beach we didn't
play as hard as we did tonight. That's what our games are based off of. We
played hard, and everybody knocked down shots. So we've just got to do the
little things every day and make it hard for teams to score on us.  
  
Q. Marcus, you had quite a string of shots there when they cut it to about
11. What was your mentality going into that when you saw them making things
interesting?  
MARCUS FOSTER: We knew they were going to make a run, so it was all about just
keeping our composure and keep battling. We didn't want the lead to cut down
too much where it would be a game where they can come back and take it away.
But they made a run and we just stuck in it and played hard and we ended up
getting the W.  
  
Q. Marcus, you were called for a technical foul in the second half. Just
talk about what happened on that play there?  
MARCUS FOSTER: It was really me losing my composure. As one of the leaders on
this team, I can't let that happen again.  
  
Q. What was working for you guys on the baseline? You had a lot of success
attacking Purdue. Your offense attacking the baseline, was that a product of
Hammons being out or something you saw in their defense?  
MARCUS FOSTER: It's just something we've got to do. In any zone, you've got to
move, work the baseline, either a big or a guard. Our bigs were moving to the
baseline, open spot, being able to hit shots. Our guards were flashing to the
corner and getting wide open shots. So it's just something you've got to do
against the zone.  
  
Q. Marcus, you hit the long three ‑pointer, NBA three. I guess you saw the
shot clock was running down. I was wondering about that. Also the one you
banked in, how did you feel on that one?   
MARCUS FOSTER: It was kind of exciting to hit that shot. It was a big shot for
us. Sometimes you've just got to have some guts and just take that big shot.  
  
Q. Marcus, after the way you played at Long Beach, did you put a lot of
pressure on yourself to come in and do more today?  
MARCUS FOSTER: I wouldn't say pressure. It was just about bouncing back,
honestly. I felt I let my team down how I played. And I had to bounce back.
You know, I've got to play like this every game. I've got to bring energy for
my team. I can't be walking around. But it's something we've got to do every
game.  
  
Q. Marcus, you forced Purdue to turn the ball over 11 times in the first
half and led directly to 17 points. That obviously makes a big difference at
the end of the game. What do you feel you did well defensively today?  
MARCUS FOSTER: Really, it started with our point guards Nigel and Jevon. It
got after their point guards. People just fed off their energy, and we just
turned up our intensity. We've got to play like that every game, honestly. We
just can't pick and choose when we want to play.  
  
Q. Thomas, you played two minutes in the first half, describe how it was to
get those two early fouls and making those back ‑to‑back baskets in the second
half?   
THOMAS GIPSON: It was frustrating. But I didn't let it get to me. Just wanted
to be there for my teammates in the first half. But Stephen Hurt and Brandon
Bolden and Nino Williams, they did a great job helping us out in the first
half. Then in the second half, I just wanted to contribute. Those are tough
plays. I feel like I just stepped up as a leader. But, I mean, it wasn't just
only me. It was everybody else.  
  
Q. Thomas, I guess just how satisfying was it to see the team play with the
energy they did in the first half and then to make the plays needed when they
made the run in the second half?  
THOMAS GIPSON: I mean, it's very satisfying. We felt really good about
ourselves. We know what we can do now. We know what we're capable of. We've
just got to watch it, and take it to the next game. It's always been just a
play like that, especially on the defensive end. It just took, I guess, a big
(indiscernible).  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Marcus, and Thomas. We'll now take questions for
Coach Weber.  
  
Q. Do you think the changes to the starting lineup did what you wanted to
early? And do you think this was Marcus's best game of the year?  
COACH WEBER: Oh, there is no doubt, especially for Marcus there is no doubt
that it was his best game, not only shooting the ball well, but his energy. I
thought he did a great job. He let his emotions on the technical. I'm happy
they played with emotions, but you've got to be smart about it.  
It got a little physical there as we got the lead and there were some plays in
there that our kids reacted to, but they reacted in a positive way and let
them lose their poise, not us. He made big shots. You need your best players
to play well, you know, and with Thomas not playing much, he came through and
made big plays in the second half. Obviously, Marcus did. I thought Wesley was
really good. Just really versatile. 10 points, three assists, two blocks, a
steal, you know, just very good all around numbers. Then the starting lineup,
we need a sense of urgency, and I thought defensively we weren't very good
early, and we did a better job with that, you know, as far as that goes.  
Yet, Stephen heard still comes in and plays 16 minutes, 11 points, five
rebounds. A good team win, four or five guys, double figures, couple with
nine, so good balance.  
  
Q. You guys did so well on the baseline especially in the first half with
the back door cuts or jumpers. How much of that was you liked that match ‑up
coming in? How much was getting Hammons out of the game and sort of opening
things up?   
COACH WEBER: I don't know. We didn't have Gipson, Hammons out, Gipson's out,
and Haas played better probably. It was all about their zone. They were really
shading their shooters. They came up high on it, and we missed them a couple
times. We run little baseline action, short corner, we call it.  
If you've got Gipson posting up, it freezes the big guy, and then we were able
to get some little touches inside Williams, Malek Harris, and then we even got
some guard action on the baseline.  
So you've got, I thought we still got to get better attacking the zone, but I
thought for the most part when we were patient, we got pretty good looks.  
  
Q. Bruce, what kind of influence do you use that press in the first half?
How effective was it? Did it get you guys going?  
COACH WEBER: Well, we have practice. It's the 2‑2‑1\. We used it. I think one
or two possessions against Long Beach in the second half, but we had hoped to
save it until this game to see if it would be a difference maker, and I think
it was a difference maker. Nigel, they almost just threw it to him twice in a
row.  
So those were big plays for him and our team. And got us energized. I think we
fed off of that and got them a little shook until obviously up until halftime,
and then they turned the tables on us.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 24, 2014

  

### [Steve Fisher](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13806)

### [Aqeel Quinn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26759)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

San Diego State  92  
BYU  87

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, some comments about the game?  
COACH FISHER: This is the kind of game we've had for a lot of years with BYU.
Dave Rose and I and our wives are very good friends, and it's hard to be
friends with other teams that you know are good who have beaten you. Got great
respect for him. He runs a terrific program. And they are really, really a
good basketball team. They're a hard team to guard. I think the start for us
was important.  
Winston had back‑to‑back baskets off balls he picked up off the floor and put
in. People have been saying they can't make a basket. We shot 20‑some‑odd
percent in two games, and we think we can make shots. But until you do, that
doubt might linger.  
But we played good basketball. We had opportunities. We missed a few free
throws, and we're saying this game should not be in overtime, and it shouldn't
have. They're saying it shouldn't have gone to two overtimes, and they're
right there too. So basketball is a nutty game, but you have to play every
possession, and we've got a good team. We're long. We're athletic. We can
guard. I'm proud of our guys. This is what we wanted the chance to move in on
the winner's bracket, and we'll have that opportunity against a really good
Pittsburgh team tomorrow.  
  
Q. Aqeel, could you tell us about the three ‑pointer you made and how you
felt confident? You just missed one right before, but how you felt confident
and making that shot was a big one?   
AQEEL QUINN: Yeah, the first one I saw the ball screen come off and it hit me
in the corner, and I saw the big man come out and he blocked my shot. Then I
just really didn't want the ball to go down the other way, so I had to make
another play. I tipped the ball. Sky got it, and gave it right back to me. I
looked down to see if I was behind the three and I just let it fly.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Fisher.  
COACH FISHER: I know it's not going to make any deadline anywhere in the
country except New Zealand. So I don't blame you for not having any questions.
I'd like to go home. So any questions?  
  
Q. I don't know what the number is now, but it's somewhere in the 120s. You
guys have won games in a row with a lead at the five ‑minute mark. Can you
just respond to how your players react down the stretch of close games so that
you can keep that streak alive?   
COACH FISHER: We compete, compete hard, try to make the thought next play,
next play, next play, and we've gotten a little lucky. We got lucky tonight in
that first overtime. I thought we got unlucky in regulation. We missed some
free throws, and JJ's ball was in, and it looked like Winston or somebody was
going to tip dunk it in, and neither of them went. Then at the end of the
first overtime probably a lot of people thought, well, that streak's over. We
found a way to make a play. AQ is such a delight to have on our team. I know
you know his history. Transferred from Northridge with no scholarship, walk‑on
one year. We put him on scholarship, and he's become such an inspirational
leader of our team.  
He's determined. He appreciates what he's got and it shows. He appreciates
everything that he's got, and it shows. So I think that's rubbed off on a lot
of us. We've got three fifth‑year seniors which definitely helps. So we don't
panic. We didn't panic, even though we made some crazy plays at times, I don't
think it was from panicking, and found a way to get a win. That's the name of
the game. We'll have a lot of close games this year, and we're hopeful that
we'll win most of them.  
  
Q. Just wanted to get a reaction from you about picking up your 500th win,
and also I guess you tied the school record. Just a reaction on that?  
COACH FISHER: We're in the semifinals of the Maui Classic. That is what's most
important. That's what I'm most proud of. I think I represent‑‑ I've been here
more than all the rest of these guys put together. My fifth year. I sat
shotgun as first lieutenant with all the answers to Bill Frieder when we won
two. Two other times I think we came in third for a fifth try. So we want a
chance to put a San Diego State banner up where we've got some of those other
banners. So we're so excited to be playing in the semis of this event.  
I've said this before, this is where we all want to come to. I begged Dave
Odom who is a long-time friend. I said, Dave, get us in. Get us in. Get us in.
And he finally got us in. So we're privileged to be here, and we're more proud
of the fact that we're playing in the winners bracket.  
  
Q. This is the most we've seen Kyle Collinsworth play this year because he's
coming off that injury. What did you think of his performance tonight, playing
45 minutes?  
COACH FISHER: I watched the three games prior to this one, and I didn't think
he felt comfortable with his play. I thought that the knee was having an
impact on his maneuverability, ability to get where he wanted to go. Tonight
he was pretty close to what I saw as all‑conference in the WCC last year. He's
a very good player. Knows how to play. Can get where he wants to go with the
ball. He's big in post-up. I'm hopeful for him and their team that he'll
progress from here physically. That is the key for him, if he's okay with his
health. It looked like he took a big step tonight probably mentally with his
game, so he's good. He's good. We knew he was good.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 24, 2014

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [James Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24440)

### [Michael Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27919)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Pittsburgh  81  
Chaminade  68

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement?  
COACH DIXON: We had a lot of great performances. So excited for our guys and
how hard they executed and competed and got after it. Did a good job attacking
the zone. I thought we defended well too for long periods of time. But they're
a very hard team to guard, Chaminade. And they really spaced the floor and
they're dangerous offensively as everybody knows. They made some tough threes,
some deep threes.  
But we did what we wanted to. We wanted to be a good, defensive team. We
wanted to be a good, defensive rebounding team, and we did that for the
majority of the game.  
  
Q. Talk about the effort where the way you guys came out tonight compared to
the last game and how much of that was playing on your mind?  
MICHAEL YOUNG: The loss hurt a lot from me and James down to the 16 that play
on the team, through the coaching staff. It hurt really bad. You never want to
lose a game that you're supposed to win. It just hurt. So coming out in this
game, we just wanted to come out with a lot of energy and enthusiasm. I don't
think we had a lot of energy and enthusiasm in the Hawaii game. That is the
reason I think we lost.  
They had energy and confidence and enthusiasm through the whole game and ours
was kind of up and down if we had any. In this game we wanted to come out and
play as hard as we can for as long as we can, and make the simple plays on
defense and not have any defensive mistakes.  
JAMES ROBINSON: Like Mike said, we didn't come out and perform as well as we
could have on Friday, and we learned a lot from it. So we just try to take
what we learned from it and implement it in the game today, and I think we did
a pretty good job.  
  
Q. Mike, you obviously had a big game offensively, but most of it was just
down in the post. Is that what you're going to continue to try to build on
that kind of performance every single night now?  
MICHAEL YOUNG: Yes, my field goal percentage is way up from last year, and
shots, I'm getting great shots and I'm going to continue to get great shots.
Just playing around the rim is what I'm most comfortable doing. I worked on it
a lot over the summer and all the way through is the summer and the spring and
fall. Like I said, that's what I'm most comfortable doing, and that's what I'm
going to continue to do.  
  
Q. Mike, how did it feel personally to break out the way you did, not just
scoring but on the boards and the way your whole team did, a career high
rebounding and your first double ‑double?   
MICHAEL YOUNG: Still felt good. Coach just recently made me one of the
captains of the team next to James. I just want to come out and lead by
example. I do a lot of talking and try to echo what the coaches want to get
across to us. It's the first time being a leader and captain of a team. I just
want to try to be my best. This game I want to lead by example and come out
and be the hardest playing guy. Whatever Coach wanted on defense or offense, I
wanted to make sure it got executed. It's my first double‑double, but I'm just
worried about the win.  
  
Q. What did you guys think of the rebounding effort by Derrick off the
bench. He rebounded Chaminade by himself.  
JAMES ROBINSON: It was really impressive, and good to see Derrick rebound like
that. In practice, he's one of the louder guys. He always gives it his all. It
was really good to see and hopefully he can continue that and we can help him
out a little bit going into tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. James, you talked a lot this off ‑season about being more aggressive
offensively, and it looked like in the second half you kind of really started
taking the ball to the basket and trying to score with authority. Is that
something now like Mike, is that something we're going to see more and more of
from you?   
JAMES ROBINSON: I think there were a lot of driving lanes that were open, and
we just really worked on getting into the gaps of the defense and making the
play from there and making the play low and making the right pass or taking a
shot if it's there. So I think as a team that's what we've been focusing on
and we were able to do that tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Dixon.  
  
Q. The rebounding numbers speak for themselves and it's something you guys
wanted to do. But when you had Josh and James in there together, you've talked
a lot about how they change your team offensively. It seems like you guys are
faster and do a lot more things. Could you just talk about why you like having
those two in there together?  
COACH DIXON: Well, they're going to be in there a lot together. They did it a
lot last year as Josh got more experienced and improved. But Chris got into
foul trouble early, so it just made us put us in a situation where he was
going to play more. So we've obviously got to do some things a little
differently than we had planned, but we're getting there. We're figuring
things out and getting better for it.  
But the play was good. We did what we wanted to do offensively. We attacked
the zone. We got in the lane. We wanted to penetrate, and we did more of that
tonight. I thought we took great shots. We didn't shoot it great, even though
the percentage‑‑ all our shots were good. We missed a lot of shots around the
basket, so you know we haven't shot it well yet here. But we're going to get
better, and we're going to improve.  
But Derrick really was unbelievable tonight for us. It's been a frustrating
time for me, the ankle injury. He was playing really well, had the ankle
injury in the blue‑gold game. It's about a month that he's been half speed and
sat out for two or three weeks. It's finally getting back. We've just got to
get guys healthy and get them right. And he's one of them as well.  
Obviously Ryan was out for a week. Now he's back, so we're playing him and
he's giving us some minutes. We're finding different guys and trying to get
them back to a hundred percent.  
  
Q. You didn't waste much time putting him?  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, he's played better in practice in the last week. I think it
was important. We really didn't‑‑ as disappointed as we were on Friday in our
performance, we really wanted to get our legs back, and I knew how dangerous
this team was and how they earned the hard match‑up for us how they play and
how they shoot the ball.  
So we wanted to get our legs under us, and I think that was important. We've
been working so hard as we tried to change around what we're doing and adjust
and get better with all these young guys that I just felt like we were tired
when we got here. Hopefully now we're getting our legs under us a little bit.
Obviously we've got to play again tomorrow.  
But Derrick is just getting healthier now. He was practicing really well. It's
good to see him go like that. Obviously you just let him play and do what he
was doing.  
  
Q. How crucial is that rebounding edge? How much more crucial is it when a
team's shooting the ball the way they did at times in the second half?  
COACH DIXON: It felt like at times we still had some breakdowns. But they made
some shots. Watching them play, that's how they play and they're going to make
some shots. What did they have? Six different guys hit threes. You know,
that's what they do, put shooters on the floor and they spread you out. You've
got to hurt them on the glass when they've got five guards out there really.
And that's what we did. We didn't shoot it great, but we took great shots, and
that's why we were able to get the inside position and the angles we wanted to
get. Knew it was going up, so that was key.  
But defensively I think we cut down some of our mistakes, but still there are
too many and we understand that. That's why we're going to try to get better
at it.  
  
Q. The players talked about the intensity on their part after the Hawaii
game. Did you guys as coaches feel like you had to talk to them very much or
do they kind of do that on their own?  
COACH DIXON: I thought we were tense. I think we hit a team that played well
the other day, and we're not where we need to be defensively to be the team
that plays well and win games with our defense as we have in the past. We've
got to get better at it. If you look at our roster and you sit down, you would
probably say, well, there is a reason.  
So we've got to get it figured out. We made some improvements today, and we're
going to make some improvements before we play tomorrow.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 24, 2014

  

### [Kyle Collinsworth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21957)

### [Tyler Haws](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25306)

### [Dave Rose](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13817)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

San Diego State  92  
BYU  87

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, some opening comments?  
COACH ROSE: Well, I thought it was a really hard‑fought game. Probably a great
basketball game to watch back and forth. We had a hard time getting the lead
and got the lead late and had a hard time protecting the lead.  
So I give Coach Fisher and his team, congratulate them for a hard‑fought win,
and wish them the best in the rest of the tournament and throughout the
season. For us, we'll have to bounce back from a disappointing loss and
hopefully be ready to play tomorrow morning.  
  
Q. You guys started slow, what was the key to getting back in the game?  
TYLER HAWS: I think just our effort. It took a few minutes to adjust to
everything. We started rebounding better, and started sharing the ball and
getting our shots. Got ourselves back in the game.  
  
Q. Tyler, they seemed to have a handle on you in the first half. But on the
second half you seemed to get back on track. Did you change some things or did
you look for things?  
TYLER HAWS: No, the coaches told us to shoot our shots. I think we were trying
to do too much sometimes, so we just started playing our game and shooting the
shots that they were giving us and started making shots.  
  
Q. Kyle, tonight you played 45 minutes and were on the floor an awful lot.
How did that feel with your knee and how did you feel you acquitted yourself
taking on those extra minutes tonight?  
KYLE COLLINSWORTH: My knee feels really good. So I'm really blessed and
fortunate about that. There's no swelling, so it's great, and it's the best
it's felt through the process. I was just grateful I had no problems through
those 45 minutes. There was a reason we worked our way up and stayed under 20
to get to this point so my body could do that. Tonight I just tried to be a
leader for my team and make the necessary plays.  
  
Q. I think you both played against San Diego State when you were in Mountain
West in your careers. Do you miss playing them and is there a certain energy
about those games?  
TYLER HAWS: The games are always fun to play in. They're always really
well‑coached and they have talented guys and we love competing against each
other. This one just hurts. We had our chances to win the game, but we've got
to bounce back.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, questions for Coach Rose.  
  
Q. Coach, I know it's a tough loss, but is there any solace in the way you
guys hung in there and forced overtime and took the lead in that first
overtime?  
COACH ROSE: I'm extremely proud of our guys. I think one of the most important
things that we wanted to do in this game was to make sure that we would never
fault our effort, that our guys would leave everything out there. We didn't go
really deep in our bench tonight, and I felt like we were chasing them the
whole time. That was something where I felt like the experienced guys could
really help us get to that point. But we got some great play off the bench
from Isaac and from Corbin, and Dalton gave us some good minutes. Jake Toolson
gave us a few minutes early in the first half. I think we got better.  
As a result of this game, you'd love to have a win against a nationally ranked
team early in the season. What we need to do is make sure our guys learned
from what happened here. I mean, we made some big plays. Then they made some
big plays against us, and plays we're capable of. We got the block late in the
game with the three‑point lead, I think, and didn't secure the ball. Got it
taken from us, and the guy steps back hits the three and tied the game. I
think those are all things we can learn from.  
I think it's a lot more enjoyable to learn from those kind of things when you
actually win the game, so hopefully we can bounce back tomorrow.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 24, 2014

  

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

### [Frankie Eteuati](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26126)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Pittsburgh  81  
Chaminade  68

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Coach Bovaird, Lee Bailey, and Frankie Eteuati to
the media room today. We'll begin the press conference with an opening
statement from Coach Bovaird, and then we'll take questions for the players.
Following that, we'll dismiss the players and take questions for the coach.
Coach, an opening statement on this afternoon's game?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Sure, our guys played hard. We've been talking about it for a
week that one of the main keys to the game is going to be boxing these guys
out and preventing them from getting offensive rebounds. It's a lot harder to
do than it looks on film.  
But we knew that coming in, and they were still able to take advantage. They
had 19 offensive rebounds in the first half. And the one guy set a rebounding
record tonight. So other than that I feel like our guys can play with it, but
that's one area we definitely struggled in.  
  
Q. Frankie, just what was it like going up against No. 2, Young, and also
No. 11, Randall?  
FRANKIE ETEUATI: It was fun. You don't often get a chance to play against
strong guys like that and bang as much as you want. As a team we kind of
allowed ourselves to get out of position, and that kind of allowed them to get
inside position. So it was fun, but I should have done better.  
  
Q. Was it tough to rebound the zone? Normally when you're playing man it's
easier to box out. Was it harder to box out being in the zone?  
FRANKIE ETEUATI: Not necessarily. In the zone I kind of allowed myself to move
into a bad position for the box out, so in a sense it was a little harder
today to rebound in the zone. However, ifs and buts, you know. Who knows?  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Despite the December parity in rebounds, were you kind of happy with the
way your team hung in there and hung around and kept it to 10, 12 points
midway through the second half?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, I knew they'd never give up and they'd never quit. Coming
into this tournament we've got things we want to accomplish and work on and
get better at. Even though, no matter what the score is, we're going to keep
focusing on trying to reach our goals of a Division II National Championship.
These are three great games in order to help prepare us to get to where our
ultimate goal is. But I knew our guys wouldn't quit. No matter what the score
is, they look forward to this challenge every year.  
  
Q. You got a lot of penetration and kick off of threes that were open. You
didn't make as many in the first half, but it seemed like in the second half
you started to hit them and that kept you in the game. Was that your game or
something you're doing specifically against Pitt?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, a lot of our offensive sets are very simple combination
that I came up with last year. We have a couple of great penetrators like Lee
and Kuany, and we have a couple of great shooters, so we give them the ability
to come off the screens and read the screen.  
It doesn't take a basketball genius to figure out that our offensive system,
but it's still very difficult to guard. We're usually pretty successful. But
you have to knock down outside shots without a doubt. We went through a
stretch in the first half there where we were missing them. But I told the
guys we're going to start making them. Keep sticking with our game plan and
we're going to start making them, and they did.  
  
Q. You kind of talked at the coaches' press conference, when I spoke to you
about coming out with a little more edge after the Hawaii game. Did you see
that from them and their physical aggressiveness?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Oh, without a doubt. Without a doubt. I think the university of
Hawaii game was kind of a wake‑up call for them. They went back and I'm sure
the coaches were on them hard about not playing inspired, not playing with
intensity, because I was at the game, and I know Pitt's a heck of a lot better
team than what they showed versus the university of Hawaii. We knew that. That
wasn't the result that I was hoping for. I wanted them to come in relaxed and
confident.  
But, no, they came out tonight and gave us their best effort which is good for
us because it helps us figure out what we need to work on and so forth. But
they came out and fired aggressively. They were in the passing lane. They were
scrambling. They were crashing the boards, which is pretty obvious.

## November 24, 2014

  

### [Brandon Ashley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25066)

### [Rondae Hollis-
Jefferson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26943)

### [Sean Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18211)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Arizona  72  
Missouri  53

  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, Coach. We'll start this press conference with
an opening statement then questions for the players.  
COACH MILLER: Well, I thought Missouri really played extremely hard tonight,
and for a large portion of the game really to me challenged us in a variety of
ways, one of which is on the glass. I think if we leave this game disappointed
in anything, it's that they outrebounded us 34‑32, and I only say that because
that's something we take a lot of pride in, and I think we have on our side,
on our team a lot of talent in that area.  
But when you come to this tournament there is so much building towards the
first game. I think it's a tournament that is the biggest and the best. With
that, that first game is always the most difficult. I think we feel good about
the fact that we've won. There are a number of things that I know and I think
we know we can do better. Rebounding is one of them.  
But just getting that first game out of our system, it gives us now a chance
to take a deep breath, and obviously move on to a very, very good Kansas State
team where we know we have to play even better than we did today, and
hopefully we'll be up to that task.  
  
Q. It was a pretty close game early, and you guys pulled away. Do you feel
the confidence of this team growing as you guys are going along?  
RONDAE HOLLIS‑JEFFERSON: Well, I see as the season goes along, teams build
more chemistry, and would say as the year goes on we have great leadership
with T.J., Brandon and Kaleb. They bring a lot out of us. We work hard in
practice and that's where it starts, in practice. We've got a great coach who
practices what he preaches, and it just follows in the game and transitions.
You'll see it more and more as we go along.  
BRANDON ASHLEY: Yeah, I have to agree with what Rondae said. As the season
goes along, you get more comfortable with the guys you're on the floor with,
and with that comes a higher confidence level as well.  
  
Q. Brandon, it seemed like you helped get them going early. I was wondering
if you could talk about that. Is it even a question any more about you playing
three games in three days as far as rest and all? How do you feel?  
BRANDON ASHLEY: Are you talking about in terms of my foot? In terms of that,
I'm a hundred percent now. In terms of the injury, it no longer bothers me. In
terms of early on in the game, my teammates did a great job of finding me in
some good positions. Our coach drew up some wonderful plays that ended up
working really well. So, yeah, that's pretty much all that was?  
  
Q. Rondae, coming off the bench in the second half you started, does that
make a difference to you? You came out and punched right away offensively at
least.  
RONDAE HOLLIS‑JEFFERSON: No, not really. Coming into the game with the energy
I always have is a great feeling for our team. We need that spark sometimes
off the bench or sometimes we may need it to start with, and Coach knows that.
When we're out there together, it's a great team chemistry, and we get the job
done.  
  
Q. Rondae and Brandon, I'm just looking at the assist ‑to‑turnover ratio you
guys were 14‑6 on the positive side. You forced 17 turnovers, and they only
had 7 assists. Is that a big part of your game plan and is that a key to
success for you guys?   
RONDAE HOLLIS‑JEFFERSON: Yeah, definitely. Our coach always tells us we have
to take care of the ball. We have to feed the inside. When we feed the inside,
good things happen. That's what we do on defense. We pressure the ball, try to
get turnovers, get stops. Being in the gap helps us a lot, and that's what we
take pride in.  
BRANDON ASHLEY: I'm going to take something that my coach said in the past.
That a good defensive team or a great defensive team is never selfish. So what
that means basically, if somebody gets beat, you're going to be there to help
him out. You're going to be there for your teammate on defense, and that kind
of translates into offense, and we always want to make sure we're sharing the
ball and everything.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Miller.  
  
Q. Does it seem like this is a familiar script for you guys or maybe you're
not where you want to be in the first half or even at halftime and then
eventually you kind of just pull away?  
COACH MILLER: Yeah, I guess now that you brought it up you're probably right.
I talked a couple weeks ago about when you have a group of guys that have been
in a lot of big games like we have, many times we should be like a fast
starting team where you kind of see that confidence early on. Man, I haven't
seen it yet. That first four minutes there's been some times this season in
our first four games we've been excellent on defense. There are times when I
think we've executed really well and had some great shots that we haven't
made.  
But that initial surge out of the gate, playing really well on both ends, I
don't know if we've really done that yet, which I can also flip it and make
that a positive. Because like every team at this time of year, you're in
search of getting better and improving. Today is another step for our team,
playing on a neutral court in a big, big tournament, one that we're excited to
be at. There is a little bit, I think, of a sense on our end that it's good to
get that first one out of your system and be a winner, because there are a
number of things that I know we can do better that we didn't do in this game.
Like I said in my initial statement, we're going to have to do those things
better tomorrow to beat an excellent Kansas State team.  
  
Q. Can you talk about T.J. tonight? He struggled shooting, but nine of those
assists were his, and only two turnovers.  
COACH MILLER: T.J. is our heart and soul in many ways, one of our leaders and
somebody that does it on both ends. He doesn't necessarily have to shoot the
ball well to play well. He impacted today's game in a big way. But he's really
become mental at this point shooting the basketball, and he's making too much
of it. He just has to relax, take the shots that present themselves, and, like
I've said statistically, I have more confidence in him than maybe any single
player on our team from three. It's just a matter of him not making it bigger
than it needs to be. We've all been there before as shooters where it just
doesn't feel right. He just needs one to go down. Hopefully that will be
tomorrow.  
But he can play an excellent game and not be a bigger scorer for us.  
  
Q. With Rondae coming and starting in the second half, was that a function
of just another kind of slow start in the first half or something else?  
COACH MILLER: Well, it was a reward for Rondae. It's not as if we're not
starting Rondae because he's not one of our five best players. I think what
we've decided on a chemistry perspective and maybe getting more balance on
offense, that not starting him gives us that energy that everyone loves to
have off the bench, and maybe balances out, complements the starting group a
little bit better.  
But every once in a while you could certainly see that we'd want to start him
in the second half. He had some foul problems as well, and it's important that
we give him enough minutes because right now no one on our team is playing
better than Rondae. He's been the most consistent player from start to finish
in all four games. I would say Brandon Ashley and him, those two guys have
been the most consistent on our end.  
  
Q. (No Microphone).  
COACH MILLER: You can ask me the same question every game and you can ask me
at halftime and after the game, tomorrow you can ask me it again, I'm going to
give you the same answer. If you want to make a huge deal of who starts, you
can keep doing it. But it's more about who plays well. I've already gone on
record once, five, ten, fifteen times that the reason we're not starting
Rondae Hollis‑Jefferson has nothing to do with anything he does. He's clearly
a very, very talented player. We just feel that him entering the game at the
17‑minute mark helps us be the best team we can be.  
Now having answered that, I'll answer it again tomorrow, if you want. But I
would say that we'll probably start the same lineup tomorrow that we started
today.

# [EA SPORTS MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=EA+SPORTS+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 24, 2014

  

### [Kim Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27913)

### [Montaque Gill-Ceasar](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27914)

### [Keith Shamburger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27915)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Arizona  72  
Missouri  53

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Anderson, your thoughts?  
COACH ANDERSON: Sure. I was really proud of our guys. We came out and I
thought we played really hard. We got some buckets early. We played some
different defenses to see if we could slow them down a little bit. They're a
great team, so it doesn't work forever, but it worked for a while.  
I thought we kind of had the game speed where we wanted it. We didn't feel
like we could run up and down, and we wanted to try to shorten the game a
little bit, but then we obviously turned the ball over way too much and made a
bunch of points off that.  
But I'm really proud of our guys. We're a young team. We're a new team. Came
over here and we battled. We battled all the way to the end. So looking
forward to getting back and getting a few hours rest and put this one away and
play again tomorrow early.  
  
Q. Montaque, just how tough was the last three minutes of the first half in
terms of the momentum? You guys were tied and they made a little spurt
there?  
MONTAQUE GILL‑CEASAR: I just think we gave them a little bit too easy buckets.
I think we played a little soft on defense, so that was something we talked
about when we went into the locker room. That's just something that we as
players need to take a mental note of. We can't leave a half like that.  
  
Q. Keith, the turnovers tonight, how much did you feel like that was
Arizona's defense, and how much was it you guys just not being able to set?  
KEITH SHAMBURGER: I think it's just a little bit of both. We didn't make the
correct passes and the pressure. So I mean, we can't really blame one thing. I
think it was both.  
  
Q. Keith, can you just talk about your first game back here on the islands
and how it felt being over here, man?  
KEITH SHAMBURGER: Yeah, it felt good to be back and just go out there and
compete with my team. We found a lot of things that we need to find out today.
I'm glad we found out this is a hard‑nosed team and we're going to give it our
all every minute of the game. That is going to get us a long way. As long as
we keep playing like that, we're going to keep getting better and better. I
mean, that was the number two team in the nation, and we really did our thing
out there. I think we're just going to keep getting better and better every
day.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Anderson.  
  
Q. Coach, Arizona's noted for their defense. How much was that pressure? How
much trouble did it give you tonight?  
COACH ANDERSON: I thought as the game wore on I thought it was really good. We
did a good job early of trying to keep the game shorter, trying to make the
court smaller. They're a very athletic group. We have good athletes. They have
great athletes, and they have a bunch of them, so we were going to try to
force them to make jump shots. It worked for a while. But like any good team,
they came back and did a great job.  
Their defense was good. It put pressure on us. It forced us to be
uncomfortable. You look at the stats, they had, what? 24 points off turnovers,
and basically that was the difference in the game.  
  
Q. As much as you want to come here and win the game, how curious were you
to have your team compete against a number two team in the country?  
COACH ANDERSON: I was really‑‑ like I said, I was really proud of them.
Arizona is better than us. I'm not going to sit here and say, hey, we're
better than Arizona. We're not. I knew coming into this game that we'd have to
play perfect to win, and I think we had a good game plan. But when it got down
to it they exposed us a little bit. We were zoning some, and we don't zone a
lot. They were getting over ball screen, making shots, and making plays. I
think their big guys are really good too. There were times I thought we had
them guarded, and they jumped up and shot over us. So I congratulate them.  
Again, I'm proud of the way our guys played. We have competed in every game.
If we keep doing that, then we'll have some success.  
  
Q. What kind of challenges does Purdue present from what you saw today?  
COACH ANDERSON: Big time. Play really, really hard. I didn't get to see the
whole game, but the part of the game I saw I thought was really a physical
game. So we're going to have to match that physicality on a short turnaround.
They've got the same deal. They've got two and a half hours more rest than we
did, so good team. Got a couple of good shooters. Strong inside game. It will
be a tough game for us. I think it will be a great game. I'm excited about
playing them. I think they're a good team. They're well‑coached. That's why
we're here to find out about our team and find out what we need to do to get
better. I think we're still young, we're still new, we're still trying to find
each other.

_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: I'd like to introduce Jon Sciambi, our Moderator for this
morning's press conference. Jon has been a play‑by‑play announcer for college
basketball on ESPN since 2005. He'll be calling his second EA Sports Maui
Invitational this year. Jon is a graduate of Boston College and has served as
the play‑by‑play voice for Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio since 2010.
Please welcome, Jon Sciambi.  
JON SCIAMBI: Megan, thank you very much. It is amazing to be back here in
Maui. Before we do anything, I did want to acknowledge Bro. Bernard Ploeger,
the president of Chaminade University and to say thanks to Chaminade for being
the host. It's awesome to be back here. It's funny, the greeting every time
you engage someone who is involved in the tournament is pretty good gig, huh?
And I've gotten a chance to do a number of the different tournaments. This is
the one. This is the one that we've been watching forever, and it's amazing to
be back here, and I'm very thankful.  
As far as our field, we've put together another amazing field here at the EA
Sports Maui Invitational. 11 final fours combined with all of these programs.
In terms of last year, six of the eight teams made the NCAA Tournament. A
combined 137 conference championships, and then one, in case you guys are
wondering, four times a team has won the Maui Invitational and then won the
National Championship. By the way, there is somebody up here that did that. I
don't know whether he knows it, but we'll get to him. All right. Without
further adieu, we'll introduce the coaches, and we'll start with the head
coach of the University of Arizona, Sean Miller. Sixth year as head coach,
Sean, Elite 8 a couple of times, 2011, 2014 last year. 33 wins, second most in
school history. Pac‑12 "Coach of the Year" a couple of times. Ranked number
two, and then really for me, the kid that dribbled on The Tonight Show is the
thing that I think of for you. So, Sean, take it away.  
SEAN MILLER: Thanks for that last part. I appreciate it. Well, we're very
excited to be here, like I'm sure all of the coaches and teams are. We're
fortunate at Arizona in that we've been one of the originals of this
tournament. I think we've come here every four or this latest time, five years
since the beginning, and hopefully we can continue that for the future. I
think for our players, everybody knows this is one of those tournaments that
they grew up watching as a young kid, and I think many of them wondered what
it would be like to play in this tournament.  
I know from our perspective, our team is very excited to be here. It's the
beginning of a long season, and I think just from our team's perspective, we
combine almost two elements. One, a group of returners that have played a lot
of basketball and been in some big games, especially a year ago. Then we also
welcome five new faces. I think we're at a point right now where we're trying
to combine the guys that have been here before with the new faces and continue
to develop as a team.  
JON SCIAMBI: All right. Up next, we want to introduce you to Dave Rose, head
coach at BYU since 2005. Seven times you guys have been to the NCAA Tournament
in nine years. That's pretty good stuff. 20 or more wins each year, and you
return the nation's second leading scorer in Mr.Haas. It should be exciting to
watch you guys play in this year's tournament, so take it away.  
DAVE ROSE: Thanks. We're very excited to be here. I think when you think of
our team, we have five seniors on our team that have been through quite a bit
in the last few years. But I don't think anything has been looked forward to
or anticipated more than them being able to come to this event.  
We're very similar to Sean's team. We have a group of seniors, and then we
have five or six freshmen that I think in the process of recruiting them, the
EA Maui Invitational was mentioned quite a few times in that process.  
So I thank the tournament for allowing us to participate in it, and then
helping us with our program and being able to establish more credibility and
consistency with our group. We had an opportunity to get here a little bit
early, so we took our guys snorkeling one day on Friday. We had quite a few of
our players who had never been through that experience, so that was, I think
that will last all season long, a couple of those guys coming up choking the
first two or three times they went in. I'm sure our players will have fun with
that the rest of the year.  
The party last night was terrific. I'm really proud of my guys for winning
some type of championship. We won the bag throw championship, so we got off to
a good start. But we look forward to the competition. I think that's the most
exciting thing about this tournament. The quality of players and the quality
of coaches that are here will give us a really good starting point on
Wednesday night when we fly home we'll know a lot about our team, and we're
excited about that.  
JON SCIAMBI: I think speaking for everybody, getting here early, that's good
coaching right there.  
Now on to the man that everybody looks at one another and says this is a
pretty good gig, huh? Well, you've got this gig every day. Head coach of
Chaminade, Eric Bovaird, fourth season as Chaminade. 2014 NCAA West Regional
in Division II. 2012, you guys beat Texas. The famous win in program history
back in 1982 over Ralph Sampson in Virginia.  
But Chaminade has been to consecutive NCAA Regionals. Last year the 2014 Pac
West Tournament Championship, and here you are in another EA Sports Maui
Invitational. Take it away, Coach.  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Yeah, for one, when I took this job four years ago I didn't
realize that every day of my life the 1982 win versus Virginia will be brought
up in one aspect or the other, whether I'm walking down Waikiki or just
talking to anybody. But I think we'd have to win this Maui Invitational for it
to even come close to topping that.  
So hopefully you guys can accommodate us, so I wish people would stop asking
me about the 1982 win. We're really excited. This is a big deal for Chaminade.
It's part of the reason why our players come to Chaminade. It's part of the
reason why I took the job here at Chaminade. This tournament helps fund a lot
of our athletics. A lot of opportunities for so many student‑athletes at
Chaminade because of this tournament. So it's a huge deal.  
Yeah, we're coming off a championship season last year with a lot of
experienced guys, but we're lucky to be 2‑0 right now. But I know these teams
have the ability to expose weaknesses that no other teams in Division II can
do. So we're anxious to see where we're at.  
JON SCIAMBI: Coach, good luck. Thanks. We move on now to the representative
from the Big 12. Bruce Weber, Southern Illinois, Illinois is well getting to a
Final Four, and obviously the connection with Matt Painter and Gene Keady, but
one of the things you look at a Big 12 and everybody talks about Kansas,
pretty impressive a couple seasons ago when you guys won a conference
championship. And that is the first conference title since 1977. You got
"Coach of the Year." Again, more expectations on your team this season, which
is a good thing. Take it away.  
BRUCE WEBER: We're excited to be here. It's a great opportunity for K‑State.
After I took the job at K‑State, Coach Odom, Dave Odom called and said we have
an opening in the tournament, and I went to our administration and they were
very excited. I think it's 20‑something years since K‑State had been here.  
So people in our administration, our community were excited that we have this
opportunity. Obviously, it's one of the prestigious tournaments to be a part
of. So now you find out a lot about your team here. I felt pretty good about
us until Friday night. We stopped at Long Beach on the way. Didn't have a very
good outing. Didn't shoot the ball well. But that is part of growing as a
team. We have a little bit. We have some older guys, some new guys, we had
some guys that sat out last year that are trying to figure it out, and we're
trying to figure it out as a coaching staff. So, great field, great coaches,
great opportunity. Hopefully we can find out some good things about our team
over the next few days.  
JON SCIAMBI: Ken Anderson, Missouri. Getting a chance to coach at your alma
mater, which is pretty cool. You won the Big 8 Player of the Year in 1977
there. But you won a Division II national title last season, and I talked with
Eric Bovaird, and he was mentioning that his mentor, West Liberty, that is who
you guys ended upbeating in the national title. But now you take over a
program that's got a lot of history, and you're a quote unquote new face as a
first year head coach. But your team has a lot of newcomers as well.  
KEN ANDERSON: Well, thank you. It's great to be here. I echo what everyone
else says. Great field and great group of coaches. Exciting for the University
of Missouri to be here. I was here with coach Norm Stewart, I think it was 17
years ago in this tournament. It's always been one of my favorites. A year ago
I was sitting in Orangeburg, Missouri, I don't know how many of you know where
that is. But it's where the University of central Missouri is, and I had the
opportunity to obviously watch Jon and everybody do this tournament.  
So it's a tremendous thrill for us. I'm the oldest rookie in this field. I've
had the chance to coach Division II basketball for the last 12 years, and I'm
very fortunate to have this opportunity to be the head coach of my alma mater.
We are a young team. We have seven players who have never played at Missouri
before. We have five freshmen. Seven of our 11 players are freshmen or
sophomores. So a great challenge for us. I think the great thing about this
tournament, even as I watched it from afar, is you really get to learn about
your team. I think that's what we're trying to do. We had a chance to spend
some time together. Dave, I was really excited our guys finished second last
night in the corn hole toss or whatever it is, and I was pretty fired up. So
great to be here. Appreciate the opportunity. Appreciate Coach Odom reaching
out to the University of Missouri, and looking forward to a great three days.  
JON SCIAMBI: Jaime Dixon of Pitt. This is the first time that you've taken
your team to Maui, but you have some connections to Hawaii. You were an
assistant at Hawaii with Pitt all those years at the Big East now, the ACC,
ten NCAA Tournament berths. Been to the Sweet 16 three times, a regional
final, but a chance to get back to a connection for you here in Hawaii.  
JAMIE DIXON: Yes, no question. It is the first time for University of
Pittsburgh to be in this event. Usually we're heading east and staying in
tournaments out there. But this time it worked out well for us. It was a great
opportunity. Our fans were excited about it. Our players are excited about it.
As Dave said, it's something we told our recruits, and they were excited about
it as well. It's truly an honor to be here. It's great to see a lot of
friends, two for me personally.  
But the most important thing is our guys are excited to be here. It's been
great so far. The event last night I thought is what makes this event probably
different than any other. I mean, the involvement with the teams, the
interaction getting involved with the community in different ways, this is
what makes this so special. We're looking forward to it. We've got a young
group that is finding their way, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this
tough competition against these great coaches helps us get better, and I'm
sure it will.  
JON SCIAMBI: As we turn our attention to Matt Painter, the head coach at
Purdue. I'm sitting next to the guy that recruited you. You've got a pretty
good connection to Coach Weber, as far as now your tenth season at Purdue,
been there a while now and, obviously, as a player there. But you're third now
in the all-time in the win's list. Six NCAA Tournament berths, and three times
the Big 10 "Coach of the Year". Tell me about your team.  
MATT PAINTER: Very similar. Kind of continuing the trend of a lot of people up
here. Six of our guys are new and five of them are freshmen, so we have a very
young team, but I like our team. I think our guys have been unselfish. They've
worked the ball, they've moved the basketball, and it's been a joy to come
every day and work with them. We came here eight years ago in a very similar
situation with a lot of young guys. Had a couple veterans that were really
good in this tournament. Able to get out of here with two wins, so it was just
a great experience. We're just looking forward to the challenge. We've played
only home games so far. Just trying to get our guys to understand the
different level of competition. The different level of getting on a neutral
court and playing. But hopefully we can be successful in this tournament.  
JON SCIAMBI: Thank you very much. Now Steve Fisher, head coach at San Diego
State. 16th year at San Diego State, 24th season overall, five straight NCAA
appearances. Ten 20‑win seasons, but I started at the beginning here and said
four times a team has won the Maui Invitational and then gone on to win the
national title, and you were part of the first, the '88‑89 Michigan team that
won, and then eventually you guys went on to win it all. So I'm sure you're
hoping history repeats itself there.  
STEVE FISHER: I would say don't put an asterisk by it, but I was the
assistant. I was running shotgun to Bill Frieder who was the head coach in
1989, and the asterisk would go at the end of the season in '89. I'm glad Ken
qualified that when he said oldest rookie coaching here. So I think I take the
lead dog on the oldest. We played BYU a long time competitors in the Mountain
West when it was originated. I got to know Dave. His wife Cheryl, and my wife
Angie are good friends. I don't know if we were the fodder for them in the
corn hole toss, but we had one three‑pointer. We were 21‑3, and we had our big
center, Skylar Spencer who is left‑handed, and he was throwing right‑handed.
When you see him shoot tonight you'll say maybe he should shoot right‑handed.  
We're very excited to be here. I probably had the opportunity to come and be
on the bench either as an assistant or as a head coach more than any of the
coaches who are here. I think this is at least my fifth try, my fifth
opportunity here. My first, Glen Rice as a rookie, his first shot against
Mitch Richmond from Kansas State was an 18‑footer that went 12 feet. We went
on to win the tournament that year.  
So we came with the San Diego State team. I think it was 2004 or '05, had a
phenomenal experience. This is the tournament. This is the tournament we all
pine to be a part of for a whole host of reasons, starting with the
competition, but with the ambience, and where you are, and the hospitality,
the professionalism that it's run with. All eyeballs in America will be on
this tournament. We know that, you know that, our players know that, and
they're very excited to be here. It's a great, great field, and I said this to
our local media and I'll say it again. I think this tournament will produce
multiple NCAA Tournament participants, and it has a chance to produce some
folks to not only get in, but make deep advances.  
So we're excited to be here and be part of this tremendous event. We look
forward to it. And I think that we'll play hard. We haven't shot the ball well
in the last couple games, but we'll play hard. This will be a great time for
us to evaluate three games, three days, a lot of different players in
different circumstances. So it will be good for us as we move forward down the
road also.  
JON SCIAMBI: Coach, thank you very much. Guys, just want to say look good luck
to all of you, and looking forward to seeing you in the gym and on TV.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Wichita State  83  
Indiana State  69

  
THE MODERATOR: Victorious Shockers are here, the champions of the tournament.
We're going to open up the proceedings as usual with a statement from Head
Coach Gregg Marshall, and then we'll go with questions for the four
student‑athletes.  
COACH MARSHALL: Just very pleased our guys were able to make the plays down
the stretch to beat a very talented and very determined Indiana State team.
Knew they were going to come out like that. I knew it was going to be a long
day and we were going to have to play well.  
They made the run to cut it to five two times, and we continued to make big
play after big play, get a stop, make a jump shot, or get it inside and get
fouled. Just want to thank these guys for an incredible run thus far.  
  
Q. Are you excited to get to this stage of the season where nobody's going
to be able to knock the level of competition you're playing starting in ten
days?  
FRED VAN VLEET: We don't really care about that. We understand. In the Valley,
you're going on the road and all that. That stuff's not easy for the outside
world looking in. They can take that stuff for granted, but we don't.  
It is exciting coming to tournament time. The big dance for all the marbles.
As competitors, you look forward to that. We're just happy to get this done
first. Our goal was to go 3‑0, and that's what we did.  
RON BAKER: I think the exciting point for us is finally to get to play against
someone other than Evansville or Indiana State or someone in our conference.
It's been a long conference season, and it's going to get some new competition
on our plate. We'll see how we handle it then.  
  
Q. Ron, could you take us through the play when you landed on Odum. What
happened in that instance?  
RON BAKER: I thought he was trying to take a charge, and I just landed on him.
We had a short conversation where I asked him if he's all right and he asked
me if I'm all right, and I helped him up.  
  
Q. Looked like he hurt his hand.  
RON BAKER: No, he didn't say anything about his hand.  
  
Q. This is for Ron. Ron, after ‑‑ when Indiana State took Odum out of the
game, you gestured to the Wichita State crowd to give Odum a hand. Can you
talk about what it was like to play against him this year and what it was like
to play against Indiana State in general.   
RON BAKER: That kid right there is a very special kid. He's had a really
strong four years at his university. He's put up very special numbers. He's
made history there.  
I'm just sad for his fans to see him not accomplish what he was trying to
accomplish, but right there, I was just trying to give him some love because
he deserved it. He played a hard game, and his career will always be looked
at.  
  
Q. Fred, take us through kind of your mindset when you see the shot clock
down six, five, four. What are you thinking and why are you so calm at that
moment?  
FRED VAN VLEET: Honestly, I'm just trying to get the ball on the rim and get a
shot up. For a while there, we had four or five bad possessions in a row, and
nobody was taking shots, and we were taking bad shots and turning the ball
over.  
So coming down the stretch‑‑ I had opportunities all game that I was passing
up because I didn't want to be overly aggressive and force the issue. But
coming down the stretch, I just was a little bit more aggressive and took
advantage of some opportunities I had, and the ball dropped for me.  
  
Q. Fred, when they switch and you get that big man on you, is that one of
your goals? You like that situation?  
FRED VAN VLEET: Well, there's a counter for everything. Their game plan was to
switch, obviously, and putting the five man on me, I'm taking chances, reading
him, and if he comes up on me, I'm going to try to drive by him. If he backs
up, I'm going to pull up, and that's what I was doing late.  
But the way they were guarding and ball screening, they were switching a lot
and changing their schemes a lot throughout the game, and I just finally got a
good rhythm late.  
  
Q. This question is for Tekele. Can you talk about the evolution of your
shot becoming more reliable from the perimeter and what you've worked on to
become pretty dependable from the outside?  
TEKELE COTTON: Over the years that I've been here, when people like sag off of
me, it's not a good feeling to have when people are sagging off of you. So
you've got to work on your shot and be comfortable shooting your shot.  
When you hear your coaches and your teammates telling you to shoot the ball,
encouraging you to shoot the ball, it makes life a lot better.  
  
Q. This question is for anybody. Now that you guys have completed the
regular season, you're 34 ‑0\. Is it more of a celebration that you got here,
or is it a relief that you're undefeated, and you can stop worrying about that
and go into the tournament?   
CLEANTHONY EARLY: I wouldn't say it's a relief, but we understand what we
accomplished is something special. We've just got to prepare this week.  
  
Q. Cleanthony and Fred, what's this wait going to be like this week? What do
you kind of do this week? How do you get refreshed and get ready to go?  
CLEANTHONY EARLY: We definitely have to take care of our bodies and just go to
treatment, ice up, and stretch, and stay loose and keep our minds prepared for
the game. I'm pretty sure Coach will find a way to do that with practices and
weight rooms and stuff like that. Just keep doing what we've been doing.  
FRED VAN VLEET: I think you're asking the wrong guys. Probably should ask
Coach that question. We don't have any control on that. We trust him, and he
trusts us to be honest about how we're feeling.  
He's been doing this long enough to know what it takes to be ready going into
the tournament. So we'll go back to class, and I'm sure we'll find out what's
the plan tomorrow.  
RON BAKER: We just want an off day tomorrow. We need it.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll stay here with Coach Marshall.  
  
Q. Gregg, I asked you before the tournament if you liked St. Louis. I don't
know if you have an answer for that now. Would you like to come back to St.
Louis in two weeks? Would that be the best destination?  
COACH MARSHALL: Yeah, it's certainly growing on me. Again, it's been a good
couple of months here. I thought that St. Louis win at St. Louis was really
big for us.  
I really did enjoy‑‑ I've never been to the World Series. I really did enjoy
both the hospitality, the city and the atmosphere. It's two of the greatest
programs in major league baseball history.  
And then culminated with this three straight wins to get to 34‑0\. It would be
something that we're comfortable with. There would not be any "ooh, aah"
moments. I think we'd actually be staying, if we get the right seed, in the
same hotel, which we're very comfortable with. We know the routine there. The
breakfasts are very good.  
So from that standpoint, it would be good, and I think Shocker Nation travels
pretty well. I think there would be quite a number of yellow and black clad
fans in the stands. So it be would fun.  
  
Q. Gregg, what is the state of the health of your team? How healthy is your
team?  
COACH MARSHALL: I think very healthy. I think nicks and dings and bruises, but
nothing that is‑‑ Ron's ankle is better. That was our most significant injury
of the year, I think.  
So relative to a lot of other teams‑‑ and this has a way of evening out over
the course of my career. Last year we were banged up the whole year, except
for the first nine games. But then this year we stay relatively injury free.
That's how you're able to do some things like 34‑0\. You have to stay healthy
and have very, very good players.  
  
Q. Fred, late in the shot clock, what do you attribute his mastery of that
situation to?  
COACH MARSHALL: Just being very talented, being very self‑assured. He's got a
lot of confidence in his ability, as he should. He gave me one of those looks
again. He hits that shot to put us up either 12 or 15 late in the clock from
out top, maybe just a little off to the left of the key, and he just gave me
that look, and I said, "Okay."  
Just like the one he gave me when we hit the shot against Gonzaga to put us up
five with 40 seconds to go, I said, "Okay, we're going to win the game."  
So it's pretty nice, pretty comforting to have him make those type plays.  
  
Q. Coach, this is your first championship of the MVC since 1987. What can
you say a little bit about that?  
COACH MARSHALL: I think it's just something that, since I've been the coach,
the amount of time, energy, money that Shocker Nation has spent making the
trek from, not just Wichita, Kansas City area. I met a gentleman on this trip
from Colwich, which is 30 miles outside of Wichita, and he owns a feedlot, has
a small feedlot, 1,000 head of cattle, and he and his family come as much as
they can, just about every year. He was ecstatic to be here.  
I think, as the season went on and the way we were playing, I think 4,500
became 6,000, and today probably in excess of 7,000 people because they wanted
to see this. It's so important to them, and it's important to me and my
players to be able to give this to them for the first time in 27 years.  
It shouldn't be that long, and I'm to blame for the last six years‑‑ or maybe
the last five. I'm not sure John Wooden could have won that first year. We've
been close, but we just haven't gotten over the top.  
I'm very pleased and honored to be the one to bring the trophy back to
Wichita. I told my players, short of the Final Four last year, I think this is
going to be one of the biggest celebrations back in Wichita than we've had in
a long time. We've won regular seasons. We've been to Sweet 16s. We've been to
the Final Four. Short of that Final Four, I think this is going to be really
appreciated and honored.  
So we got the monkey off our back, so to speak.  
  
Q. Coach, do you have a message for any skeptics that may still be out there
after the win today?  
COACH MARSHALL: No. No, Bernie, I don't.  
  
Q. Just a quick yes or no question first, and then I'll follow up. Did they
fix the nail up there?  
COACH MARSHALL: They fixed the nail, thank you very much. They fixed the nail.
It must have been karma. As we corrected Tekele's name, he's now the MVP,
probably going to be on the cover of Sports Illustrated again for the second
time in four weeks. What a wonderful performance he had.  
Got two tough calls. He got the one foul on the play where Ron was hit in the
head and was kind of dazed, and he got a foul in transition there, which
should have never happened. They should have gotten the foul the first time.
But even the best miss an occasional call. And then he got other one when
Odum, I thought, fell down, just fell down. So he had to sit for about eight
minutes at the end of the first half, and he still gets MVP.  
So they fixed the nail, Tekele was MVP, and it's all good.  
Bernie, I want to get back to you. I might have an answer. I'm going to go
with the Chadrack Lufile's tweet about two weeks ago. Wolves do not fret over
the opinions of sheep.  
  
Q. Gregg, what will you do during this time off? Do you change anything now
that you're not going to be probably a 1 seed as opposed to last year coming
into a different situation?  
COACH MARSHALL: Do I change anything?  
  
Q. As far as getting ready, looking to selection Sunday.  
COACH MARSHALL: No. That worked pretty well last year. We were two possessions
away from playing for a National Championship. So if I do get off my‑‑ that
same path a little bit, Paul, I'm sure you'll be around to let me know, and I
want to make sure you get me back on that path because that was a good one.  
  
Q. Not many teams have been able to tighten the gap in the second half. How
reassuring is it that your team stay calm down the stretch?  
COACH MARSHALL: There were some anxious moments. Again, I said this many
times, it's very comforting to have this group of young men on our bench, on
the court, representing us in the locker room, in the community. They're
quality individuals. They're quality players. They have tremendous swagger and
confidence in their own abilities. They play extremely hard on both ends.  
And they did it again. We were challenged by a very well‑coached team that was
playing‑‑ I'll say this. This is not a slam on them. They wanted to be part of
that NCAA Tournament, and I wish our league had been good enough this year
that they would get an at large, honestly, because I think they can do some
damage.  
They're hard to guard when Odum's stirring that drink and Gant's picking and
popping and Arop. Dawon Cummings didn't play particularly well, but he's a
talented player. Khristian Smith is a talented player, and Greg does a
wonderful job. So I knew they were going to do it like that.  
To cut it to five, to do basically a 10‑0 run because we were up 15, and have
us on the ropes. When the guy said yesterday, "Do you want a one possession,
two possession game?" I said, "No, I'd rather have the 40‑point blowout." I
did not anticipate that in any form. The game was somewhere in between there,
but when they cut it to five, it was a ball game, and we made the plays to get
over the hump.  
I hope they get to the NIT at least and do extremely well and win the whole
thing.  
  
Q. You said in this room last year that you thought your team was going to
be pretty good this year, and that was before your Final Four run last year.
How do you capsulize the level of your program over the course of the last
year?  
COACH MARSHALL: Just unbelievable, special, extraordinary. It's just awesome
to coach these guys. I mean, if you've put your life's work into coaching,
which I have, and to be able to coach the quality of individuals that I'm
coaching, to be as easily coached as these young men are, to do it the right
way, as Dr. Bardo always refers to, not just the fact that they win, but how
they go about their daily work on the campus, in the community. They're just
fine young gentlemen.  
They also happen to be extraordinarily talented, and they're taking us on some
crazy magic carpet ride. So it's really cool.  
THE MODERATOR: Gregg, on behalf of the Missouri Valley Conference, go get 'em.
Thank you, everyone.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Wichita State  83  
Indiana State  69

  
THE MODERATOR: Indiana State Sycamores are here with us, including
All‑Tournament selection Jake Odum. Manny Arop and Justin Gant are the other
student‑athletes. We're going to have Head Coach Greg Lansing start off with a
statement on this game and then go to questions.  
COACH LANSING: Just want to congratulate Wichita State. Obviously, we have
tons of respect for them and what they've accomplished. Tremendous
representative of our conference, and the things they accomplished this year
have never been done, and we wish them nothing but the very best. We enjoy
competing against those guys.  
When you put your guts into something and it means so much, to see the
disappointment on the guys' faces in our locker room, it's tough. You want it
so bad for them, and they deserve it, the Sycamores deserve it. They deserved
a championship, and they deserved to play in the NCAA Tournament. We're not
going to get to do it, but we're going to lick our wounds and roll out of here
with our heads high because we competed awfully hard against three good teams.  
Hopefully, we'll get invited to another tournament. I'm just really proud of
my team. We didn't play well. Obviously, would like to play better, but the
guys at the other end of the court had a lot to do with it.  
  
Q. Jake, talk about the second half, the comeback you guys made, and how
much your hand was bothering you after you were hit early in the half.  
JAKE ODUM: I'm proud of my team for competing. Injuring the hand, that's the
way it goes. You have injuries in sports. I might have let it affect me a
little bit too much out there. But it is what it is.  
  
Q. This is for Justin and Manny. Can you guys talk about what the inner
feeling was when you had trimmed the deficit down to four, and it really felt
like you had some momentum. What were you guys feeling like at that point?  
MANNY AROP: We fought hard to just get back in the game. It was kind of, okay,
we're about to put a run together. But then they were just hitting some shots
and make the lead bigger. So it was just like an uphill fight the whole game.  
JUSTIN GANT: Throughout the game, we weren't playing as well as we'd like to,
but when we made a couple shots and took the lead down and started getting
close to them, it's a confidence builder and lets you know, we got in the
huddle and kept talking about how we're still in the game and we've still got
plenty of time to get back into it and take the lead. But they just kept
hitting tough shots. So you got to give them credit for that.  
  
Q. Jake, can you describe the play where you picked up your fourth foul? How
did you see that?  
JAKE ODUM: No comment.  
  
Q. For the players, all three of you, the last two times you played Wichita,
you've proven you can play with them, and you've earned the respect. How
frustrating is it not being able to finish against them?  
JUSTIN GANT: I mean, it's very frustrating. We got to know each other and know
their tendencies and what they like to do. The last two times we battled them
down to the end. It's always disappointing to know that you came so close but
never got it.  
MANNY AROP: Very frustrating.  
JAKE ODUM: You know, I was kind of disappointed when the game ended,
obviously. Now I'm sitting up here, I'm proud of the fight, though, you know.
They earned it. 34‑0, nobody's beat them all year. They're the best team in
the country.  
But we fought with them. We were right there hand in hand with them for 30
minutes of the game. We just couldn't finish out. They were the better team
today. They were the better team this season. So you got to give credit to
them.  
We fought out there, and I'm proud of our team for doing that.  
  
Q. Jake, you talk about that. How difficult is it to beat that team when
they get an inch to get a shot off and they're popping threes. Like you said,
it's very difficult because they don't beat themselves and they just don't
need much room to get things going.  
JAKE ODUM: Yeah, I mean‑‑ I don't even know where to begin with that. They're
just tough, you know. We had nine turnovers, and they had 21 points off of
those nine turnovers. So they basically converted every single one. That's
what they do.  
They're a well‑rounded team. Someone like Baker doesn't hit a three, but
Cotton and Van Vleet both have four. So they're deep. They've got players.
They've got some potential pros on their team.  
Like I said earlier, it is what it is. I'm happy that we competed, though. We
didn't fold. We could have gave in. We could have let them beat us by 30. It
ended up being 14. We cut it to 5, 6 a couple times. I'm proud of our team for
doing that.  
  
Q. Justin, can you talk about your eye and kind of the night you had last
night in the lead ‑up to this game and if it affected you at all today.   
JUSTIN GANT: In the game yesterday, I got hit with a finger. Initially, it was
all right, just had a little vision problem. But after the game, I had some
bleeding and a little pressure on the eye. I went to the hospital and got it
checked out and ended up being all right.  
It didn't affect me today. I knew it was going to be a big day and a big game.
I got plenty of rest. We went over the game plan, and we were prepared. The
coaches did an amazing job of getting us ready for the game. Just got to give
them props.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you. You're dismissed. Stay here with the
Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, you're down five when Jake picks up his fourth with just over ten
to go. Wichita answers on a 13 ‑0 run. Just how much did that change momentum
in the game?   
COACH LANSING: That's what it was, 13‑0? It's a big change. I thought Jake,
that's as good a defense as you could have played. It was a tough call. There
were a couple of those, I felt, in that stretch. We were a little out of
sorts, even in the first half. Guys were worrying too much about the
officiating. You know, I just tried to tell them we had some negative body
language, and we let that affect us too much.  
Any time you've got kids that care about each other and winning as much as
they do, sometimes that happens. You don't want it to. Tried not to do it that
way. You want something so bad. You feel like you're not getting a fair shake
sometimes. I guess that's the way you react. But that was tough.  
I didn't have enough time‑outs to stop the runs, but that's what they do. If
you turn it over, have any quick shot or lose it at one end, they put it in
the basket at the other end and quick like, if you're not sprinting back and
communicating. That's why they're undefeated. That's why they're hoisting the
trophy.  
  
Q. Greg, you touched on it just a moment ago their ability to score quickly.
You had nine turnovers the entire game, and they scored 21 points off those
turnovers. Does that speak to their efficiency to take advantage of
mistakes?  
COACH LANSING: Yeah. They're probably the best team in the country at that.
It's because you've got guards like they have, and you have bigs that run like
sprinters, and you have a Cleanthony Early that runs like a 100‑meter dash
guy, and he's dunking at the other end, and they get three‑pointer plays on
the other end. That's what you don't want.  
It's a huge key coming into the game, not giving it to them. If you only turn
it over nine times, they quick threes and do it too. They take quick threes
and make you pay for it, and basketball is a game of runs. Everybody knows
that. We talk about it all the time. They're good from not getting a 5‑0 run,
they make it a 13‑0 run like they did today. As an opposing team, you want to
shrink that stuff, but today just didn't have enough time‑outs during that
stretch to really stop it.  
  
Q. Greg, at the point where Jake did pick up his fourth foul, you have to
take him off for a couple of quick shots after that. Just talk about how that
affects your fight and kind of ‑‑ he's kind of a safe harbor, obviously, for
your team. That seems to be what was really going.   
COACH LANSING: It's guys trying, guys trying because their leader's over on
the sideline with four fouls, and you've got to rest them a little bit. During
the game, what we talked about is we're either scoring in transition in the
first five, ten seconds of the possession, or you really need to work and
score the last ten seconds of the possession.  
Then we got quick. That's us. That's why we are what we are. These guys try to
make plays, and we cast up some quick threes. It's not just one guy. It's
several guys. All of a sudden, it's a 13‑0 run. Going into it, that's what we
talked about.  
Also talk about, when they score, you got to come down and make sure the ball
touches the paint. During that stretch, we just didn't do it.  
  
Q. As good as some of the defense was, I think they started 3 of 14 from the
field in the second half, Wichita did. And you've seen it before, all's they
need is a sliver. Cotton comes off a bump cut, and, boom, he's got a three
‑pointer. Same thing with Van Vleet.   
How difficult is it to defend that team when they just don't need any room at
all to get on a run?  
COACH LANSING: I mean, that's what the championship teams do really. They've
got tremendous leadership. You have to guard them a while. They have a purpose
at that end. They don't try to make a play off without a‑‑ no passes or one
pass. They make you guard them throughout a possession and wait until you make
a mistake or catch you at a break or at a mismatch, and then they're really
good getting it off the offensive glass.  
So they don't have weaknesses. They do not have weaknesses. If anybody could
see one, I'd like to hear it because we couldn't find anybody in it. We felt
we were good enough to beat them. We just didn't to that.  
They don't beat themselves. They don't beat themselves, and they have
tremendous leadership.  
  
Q. Greg, I know the timing is never easy for this. A year ago, when you had
lost to Creighton, I know you were frustrated with the limping to the finish
line, and you said in here you wanted to use the postseason to kind of see who
was really dedicated to try to win a championship next year. Seeing that you
didn't limp this year, you fought hard this year ‑‑  
COACH LANSING: We didn't limp last year.  
  
Q. I know. The disappointing performance.  
COACH LANSING: Yeah, I know. It's disappointing, but it's not limping.  
  
Q. Forgive that. How important is it to you you've got guys who don't want
to take their uniform, wherever it is you do go, how important is it that you
want to see them finish successfully?  
COACH LANSING: It is. We talked about it before. The best feeling we ever had
was when we won it and seeing those guys' faces and how happy they were. Some
disappointment in that locker room‑‑ like I said, you put your guts in it. You
want great things for them.  
Last year we weren't ready. We faded, we got tired at the end of the year.
It's not like they weren't trying and playing hard. We had good teams in this
league and got beat, we came here, and we won a game. We were without Manny,
our second best player, in the last two games. This team has never limped
anywhere. Never limped one time, never collapsed, never anything.  
This team has been a tremendous group of guys. They represented Indiana State
as good as any team anywhere that I've ever been around, represent the
community and our university.  
And a good thing I'd say about it, Jason, is how much it means to them. The
seniors, we're going to keep playing, and they're going to keep fighting
because they won't give in. You've got a lot of guys that are going to come
back next year that have tremendous experience. They get to learn from one of
the best teams in the country, and it hurts them. I know they're going to be
motivated to get better.  
  
Q. What did Jake tell you when he came back from the locker room after he
hurt his hand? Was there any kind of discussion as far as his status at that
point?  
COACH LANSING: Well, yeah, you guys all know how tough he is. He throws his
body all over the place. When he first came over, he said he thought he broke
his hand. Then he went back in there, and he's loose, throwing them into the
game and checking back in. I just asked him, when he got his fourth foul and
came out of there, he thought it was in the knuckle.  
Whether it's dislocated or broken, we'll have to get X‑rays, I'm not sure.
Jake's not one to complain about much, and obviously, it really bothered him.  
THE MODERATOR: Greg, congratulations and good luck in the postseason.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Christian Kirk](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26558)

### [Paul Lusk](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23227)

### [Austin Ruder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26522)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Wichita State  67  
Missouri State  42

  
THE MODERATOR: Austin Ruder and Christian Kirk are here for the Bears and Head
Coach Paul Lusk.  
COACH LUSK: They handled us. I thought we did some really good things in the
first half defensively. Thought played as well as we could from a defensive
standpoint, took away the interior, but they were 8 for 10 from three, just
hit some unbelievable shots. When they're rolling like that, they're going to
be tough to deal with.  
It was 14 at half. We came out and got the first basket of the second half,
cut it to 12, but they just‑‑ they wore us down. They're terrific defensively.
We couldn't score it.  
Obviously, we had some guys go down. Give them credit. It wasn't a whole lot
to sit through, but I think it will be a good learning experience for our
guys, and we've got to move forward.  
  
Q. Austin, can you just talk about Wichita State's defense and what stands
out the most about it.  
AUSTIN RUDER: They're just real physical. It causes problems getting open,
running stuff, making cuts. I think that's probably the biggest force they
have on defense.  
  
Q. Austin, you guys were behind 13 ‑12 with 8:49 left in the half. They hit
five three‑pointers in a row. Talk about how devastating that was and then how
tough they are offensively when they get into that groove.   
AUSTIN RUDER: Yeah, it definitely was a big blow to us. Me and Dorrian had a
miscommunication, and that kind of started it all off. I think Cleanthony hit
a couple in a row. It was a very devastating blow to us, and it's tough to
stop. They keep just hitting three after three. I think that open one just
kind of started it all off.  
  
Q. Christian, when you lose Keith and Jarmar both in the same game, what's
that do to your team?  
CHRISTIAN KIRK: They're two of our best guys. When you see them go down,
they're two of our toughest guys, but we just try to stay together. Sometimes
in the second half, we played pretty good. At the beginning of the second
half, we tried to cut it down a little bit, but then they just opened it right
back open. That's pretty tough.  
We never want to see any guys go down, much less Keith or Jarmar.  
  
Q. Christian, I'm curious, from your guys' perspective, how do you view this
run that Wichita State is on, the attention that they've garnered, the
national brand that they've now achieved? Can you just give us a sense from
inside the family of the Valley of how that looks.  
CHRISTIAN KIRK: It's just a whole other level. We've been trying to get there
with our program the past two or three years, and I think it just sets a
standard for the whole Valley‑‑ for someone to look up to.  
They've played great. They've gotten better every year. The run they've been
on this year is great. It's just kind of something we hope to get to one day
and just kind of improve our program and kind of compare it to.  
  
Q. Just your thoughts about possibly playing some more basketball in one of
the tournaments in a couple of weeks.  
AUSTIN RUDER: It's always a great opportunity to play in the postseason.
Really looking forward to the opportunity and getting a few more wins this
season. That's how I think we're going to approach it and just go out and try
to win every game.  
CHRISTIAN KIRK: I mean, we're looking forward to it. The past two years I've
been here, we haven't played postseason. I know, when they won the CIT a
couple of years ago, they ended up having a really good year next year. So I
think it will help improve our program, and we're all looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Christian, you've played against Wichita State three times now. How would
you kind of describe them to maybe people who haven't seen them a whole lot?
What's kind of their essence or what makes them what they are?  
CHRISTIAN KIRK: They're just physical, and they stay together. They don't have
many breakdowns. You know every game they're going to bring their best, play
physical, get every rebound, get on the floor every time.  
It's hard to catch them off their guard because they're always on their guard.
They're just really physical, and they really stay together and play well
defensively.  
  
Q. Will this game be harder to bounce back from than other games, or do you
just chalk it up to Wichita State being that good that you just move on to the
next challenge?  
CHRISTIAN KIRK: I mean, it's tough because it's the Valley tournament
semifinal game, and this is my first time being here in the semifinals, and
it's tough, but I think we're going to be able to move past it when we start
looking forward to what we're going to go into in the postseason.  
It's tough. It's tough sitting through, like Coach said, but as Nate said in
the locker room, if we can remember that feeling and kind of feed off it for
the rest of the year and into next year.  
AUSTIN RUDER: Yeah, we definitely have to bounce back. I don't think we just
chalk it up to being Wichita State because we competed with them at our place,
and we feel like we can compete with anybody in the nation. We just didn't
play our best basketball today, but definitely going to use it as motivation
for next year.  
THE MODERATOR: You two can leave. We'll stay here with Paul Lusk.  
  
Q. Coach, would you comment on their ability to hit you so quickly. It ended
up being two sustained runs today, but you can hang with them, and then all of
a sudden, they hit you quickly, and it's tough to recover. It's been kind of
an MO of theirs all year long. What makes it so difficult to answer that
punch?  
COACH LUSK: Well, they've got really good players. They're well coached, but
that's what we told our guys. You're hanging with them, you're hanging with
them, you're hanging with them, and then all of a sudden, it could be a
two‑minute stretch, and they rattle off threes like that or they pound you
inside, or they get some steals defensively.  
You have to have personnel that can really go at them. I thought for us, I
thought we were really good early in the game, and we got some good looks. You
have to make those shots. You just‑‑ you have to make them to stay in the
game. We weren't making them, but we stayed in the game. Well, that's only
going to last for so long.  
And then they just‑‑ they shot it so well from three. We wanted to try keeping
the ball out of the paint. When Jarmar got hurt with his jaw, we were right
there with the loose ball and couldn't come up with it. Cleanthony Early
picked it up from his shoe laces, from his shoe lace in the dead corner and
drilled the three.  
They're really good. They really guard you. They can hurt you a lot of
different ways. You have to have the physicality to match up with them. We
weren't able to score on the blocks against them. So then you've got to try
scoring on the perimeter or getting some in transition, and we just weren't
able to do that.  
  
Q. Just your thoughts about playing some more ball and the opportunity.  
COACH LUSK: It's good. We need it. Our season was over last year at this time.
It's good moving forward. Our young guys, I thought that was really good. I
left Devon and Tyler, not so much Austin, but they got exposed today by one of
the best programs in the country.  
We got to get better, and I think those guys will get better. It's good for
the young guys. It's good for the seniors. I think the seniors will want to
play. It's important that they come with the right mindset. So we're excited
about it.  
  
Q. Coach, Gavin came in there late in the first half and did some good
things to at least temporarily get you back into the game.  
COACH LUSK: Yeah, when Jarmar went down, he opened it up. I think sometimes
that can be deceiving. You say, well, Ron did some good things. He's 2 for 9,
and Gavin's 2 for 8. But Gavin does open it up for you from an offensive
standpoint and gives you some breathing room.  
If we're going to win or we're going to be more competitive with them, Ron
can't be 2 for 9, Gavin can't be 2 for 8. You've got to make those shots. But
I thought Gavin did do some good things. He's got to continue to work and
improve, but I was pleased with his effort. He got three rebounds. He was 4
for 4 from the line. Cleanthony got away from him a couple times, but he was
shooting the ball at a high level, Early was.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Indiana State  62  
Southern Illinois  59

  
THE MODERATOR: Sycamores are here. Jake Odum, Justin Gant, and Khristian Smith
represent the student‑athletes.  
COACH LANSING: My question is how does Khristian Smith with one basket get
asked to come to a press conference. That's got to be an all‑time record. It
was a big one.  
I'm just awfully happy for these guys and the guys in the locker room. We
didn't play well, and I didn't set them up offensively very good. I was a
little bit out of it today. I just wanted to win so bad. I was probably
worrying more about the officiating than coaching my guys.  
We have some fierce competitors on this team. Obviously, Jake willing his team
down the stretch here, but I give Southern nothing but tremendous credit. I
told Coach they started out 6‑15\. We got them well when we went to their
place, and they kicked our tail pretty good. They just play like crazy, and
they have some dynamic guards there, and they're difficult to guard.  
We stretched it out a little bit, and they weren't going to let us get away
from them. Very fortunate to come out with a win, but these guys competed
hard, and we did just enough. We have a chance. We have a one‑game season
right now.  
  
Q. Jake, I know you said yesterday the first one went in, and you had a good
day. The second half, when you scored seven in a row right away, just talk
about what transpired during that time period.  
JAKE ODUM: I just wanted to be aggressive. It was a close game coming out of
halftime. I wanted to look for it and get going to the rim. My teammates were
doing a nice job moving on offense, which was allowing me gaps to get in
there. Like I said, I got it going yesterday, shots were flowing, and it was a
great feeling out there.  
  
Q. Khristian, talk about what you saw on your bucket. Obviously, you were
trying to make a play. Just kind of describe it from your point of view.  
KHRISTIAN SMITH: It was lucky. Coach Belcher told me right before we got out
of the huddle to make sure I crash the boards. Coach Lansing always preaches
to break the other team's back by getting offensive rebounds.  
I got one of them, and that was the one that counted. I tipped it, but until
it did, I wasn't sure it went through that net. I'm glad it did.  
  
Q. Jake, can you talk about, in that situation, what you anticipate Southern
is going to do defensively and how you counter that, and kind of knowing that,
how you let that play out.  
JAKE ODUM: They're a really good man‑to‑man defensive team. We knew they were
going to be tough out there. We ran kind of like a pick/slip thing with Gant,
and he was open. So I kind of pitched back. Give credit to Khristian getting
there in the paint and tipping it in. That's a game‑winning play.  
Like Coach said, he didn't have a bucket all game, but he went in there and
fought and got down there dirty and got the game‑winning bucket for us.  
  
Q. Justin, second game in a row, big numbers from you. You've been very
aggressive in the MVC tournament. What's been the difference for you?  
JUSTIN GANT: It's tournament time, so you lose and go home. That's been really
heavy on my mind. We have a great group of guys and great leadership coming
from our seniors. I just wanted to go out and play my hardest for them and
just give it my all, and it's been working out.  
  
Q. For any three of you guys, how difficult was it to adjust to the shot
clock being up on the facade of the arena and all the distraction at the
beginning of the game with the clocks being out?  
JAKE ODUM: The slow start, I don't think it was too much of a distraction. I
think we got going after that. But the shot clock not being on there plays a
factor because it's down to three or four seconds, and you look up, you kind
of got to look away from the rim. So that was taking some adjustment too. I
don't really think it hurt either team too much.  
JUSTIN GANT: I mean, it just took us a couple of possessions to get used to
it, but after that, I felt we got into the flow of the game. We get quick
shots, so it didn't really matter anyways.  
  
Q. Jake, I know you guys have been outspoken about coming here, hoping to
win three games in three days. Your confidence level tomorrow that you can get
a win against an amazing team.  
JAKE ODUM: I mean, you've got to have confidence. This is what you play the
game for. I don't know about the rest of these guys, but I'm sure they're
thinking the same thing. I want a piece of Wichita State ever since they got
us at our place. We felt like we competed with them there. They're a really
good team. In my opinion, the best team in the nation.  
We feel like we can compete with them. We know we're right there. We know
we've got to make some adjustments from the first two times we played them.
We're looking forward to it. Our goal when we got here was to meet up with
them in a championship and play out there and give it all we've got, and
that's what we're going to do tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jake, given what you just said, what do you do to try to get your team
ready to have that same mindset that you do?  
JAKE ODUM: Just stay in their ear here throughout the night, make sure
everybody's locked in, focused. Make sure everybody knows the plays we might
be running tomorrow, some of their plays that they might be running tomorrow.  
Lucas and I and Jake Kitchell are the only ones left in this tournament that
have ever won a championship. We do kind of know what to do. We do have to
stay in their ear tonight and make sure they're locked in.  
Can't get too up on this win tonight, but it's a nice one. After we leave the
gym, we've got to get locked in and focus on Wichita State.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, we'll dismiss you. We'll stay with Coach Lansing for
questions.  
  
Q. Greg, you knew it was going to be difficult today. It always is when you
play Southern. If you had to point to one difference, what do you think it
was?  
COACH LANSING: I just think the will to win by this group. They came here
pretty single‑mindedly and wanted to get a chance to win a championship. We
talked enough about it, that losing three games before you come in there. But
we did just enough.  
It was two teams absolutely fighting their guts out. It was very ugly at
times, and I know that wasn't because of the coach on the other end. I take a
lot of responsibility for that.  
But these guys, they're such a good group, and I think the will to win the
game, we got in that last huddle, I think, with 3:46 left, and that's just
what we talked about. We're the experienced team. Coming down the stretch,
we've got to make more plays than them. Even if we didn't score, we had to
shut them out.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys were able to take Desmar Jackson almost completely out of
the picture. What were you guys able to do defensively that limited his
production?  
COACH LANSING: Manny Arop. Manny Arop should be sitting in one of these seats
up here. He was unbelievable on defense. He said, "Coach, I don't care what
I'm doing on offense. I'm just going to guard that way." He did. He made it
tough.  
Didn't play very well offensively. He was 0 for 6 for three in the first half.
He was just getting those, and we wanted him to get to the paint a little bit
and get to the free‑throw line.  
He had help. Justin does a great job when we switch four days. Other guys had
a hand in it, but Manny Arop deserves a lot of credit for that.  
  
Q. Coach, I remember it stuck in my mind after the Northern Iowa game, you
sat there, and we come off three losses in a row. What impressed me, you had
this fire in your eyes, and you weren't worried. You were very calm,
collected. How does that translate now that you're into the championship game
of the MVC after those three losses? How did you do that?  
COACH LANSING: I think a lot of people would say you've got nothing to lose.
I'm not here just to make it to the championship game. We came here to win it.
We just started the year, and we wanted to win the conference. We didn't get
that done.  
As I said, we lost two tough games on the road to two good teams that we're
playing for the third seed, and I knew we'd compete against Northern Iowa, I
knew we would, we just didn't do enough to win it. We were kind of back with
our competitive side. Practices were terrific after that, so I felt good.  
Every game I've gone into with this group, it's easy to relax because you know
they're going to compete.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about the will to win. That's certainly led by Jake Odum.
He's gone on these personal runs in this tournament. Is it almost to the point
you're shocked if he doesn't do that now?  
COACH LANSING: Yeah. Get the ball in his hands and basically clearing out and
say, "Jake, go make all the plays, win every game for us." I've gotten a
little bit spoiled on that. Certainly, more often than not, he does that.  
There's nobody more competitive than this guy. It's unbelievable, the things
that he says and the things that he does and the will to win.  
At any level, this guy, his competitiveness is as high as any guy I've been
around. I'm so darn happy for him. I want it so‑‑ not just for him, but for
all of these guys, for him to get that championship tomorrow. I've got no
concerns with how hard this one's going to compete.  
  
Q. Greg, can you talk about the clock situation, especially at the beginning
of the game, where it delayed the start, and then how the team had to adjust
to playing a different way.  
COACH LANSING: Other than putting off the post‑game meal and all this stuff,
that really had no effect. We got off to a good start. We really did. It was
after the start we had a little trouble. That kind of stuff happens. You just
go on. Both teams were fine. I don't think it affected anything.  
You've got Jack Watkins coming in and apologizing about it, but this is the
best run tournament in the country by the best staff in the Valley. Like I
said, we got off to a good start.  
The only thing I think it might have affected is, like Jake said, the end of
that. Like Manny at the end of the first half, he's looking for it. He didn't
see it, I know that. So he settled for that three. But both teams had to deal
with it.  
  
Q. When you hear the kind of what I guess you could call bravado coming out
of Jake up here at the dais against a 33 ‑0 team‑‑  
COACH LANSING: Don't make that the headlines. They're going to be calling the
Wichita Eagle and telling them he wanted to play them.  
  
Q. What's your reaction as the coach when you hear that out of your
leader?  
COACH LANSING: You know me, I wish he wouldn't‑‑ all that's going to come out
of that is the first part of that. He also said how he thinks they're the best
team in the country. I do. We all do. There's not enough adjectives to
describe what I think about Wichita and their team.  
He's competitive. And he did‑‑ the disappointing loss that we had, our whole
community is building up for that one game, and we lose it. You put all your
guts into it, and you want to win that and contend for a championship and you
lose it, that's only natural. Anybody that plays this game goes, "I want to
play them again when we get to St. Louis." And we've done just enough to do
that.  
Be careful what you ask for, though.  
  
Q. Greg, same thing I asked Jake. What's your confidence level? I know you
believe in your team, and I know you believe you'll compete really well
tomorrow. What's your confidence level that you can win the game?  
COACH LANSING: Staff is‑‑ my staff is the best staff in the country. They're
the ones that prepare those guys. That's why we're so good defensively. Got a
group of guys that are going to fight like crazy, and I hope it's good enough.
We're going to give it everything we have, and if it's not good enough, they
go into the tournament undefeated with a great chance to win the whole thing.
If it's good enough, we're going to get in there and do something too.  
Thank you.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Wichita State  67  
Missouri State  42

  
THE MODERATOR: Number 1 Shockers are here. They have a date in the
championship game tomorrow. We're going to ask Gregg Marshall, per custom, to
open up with a statement on this game. And then we'll go to questions for just
the three student‑athletes for an eight‑minute spot. Gregg, please.  
COACH MARSHALL: We're pleased to be moving into the championship game. I
thought we shared the ball very, very well. We were slow getting started
offensively, but we loosened that up and finally hit a couple shots. Cle was
tremendous tonight. Tekele is really shooting the ball well, and we're sharing
it. We had 14 assists on 25 baskets. The defense was certainly there as well.  
We knew this team could give us fits if we didn't play well, and we played
well enough. So we're pleased. Thanks.  
  
Q. For Tekele and Cleanthony and Fred if you want to chip in too. How much
did the three ‑point shooting kind of loosen their defense a little bit? You
guys really went on a barrage in the first half.   
TEKELE COTTON: I think it loosened it up a lot. Of course, Cle had a very hot
hand. I felt like every time he rolls up, it's just going to go in. And you've
got to go out there and guard that, so it just loosens everything up.  
CLEANTHONY EARLY: Pretty much exactly what he said. If you make a lot of
three‑point shots, that forces the defense out to guard you. Kind of gave us a
little more room to work inside, and they were physical inside. So luckily we
got some shots to drop.  
  
Q. Cleanthony, last year you were sick or off games or whatever, but it
wasn't a great experience for you either way. How much has this ‑‑ I mean, is
this making things settle down a little bit for your stomach and your mindset?
  
CLEANTHONY EARLY: I think I use everything as motivation, and the fact that I
didn't do too good last year just gives me a little bit more energy and a
little more motivation to come out and do things the right way.  
  
Q. I know the coach's slogan is "Play Angry," but you guys didn't look like
you were angry at all today. You looked like you were having a good time.   
CLEANTHONY EARLY: I think it's mixed emotions. We got there, and we were a
little bit angry because that's our motto. At the same time, we've just got to
enjoy ourselves and have fun, and I think that's what we do.  
  
Q. Fred, you guys played with an extremely high tempo from the opening tip
‑off. Why was that critical against Missouri State today?   
FRED VAN VLEET: Well, they're a team that wants to pack it in and play in the
gaps and be very help conscious. They're very solid in the half‑court when
it's five‑on‑five. We wanted to take advantage of transition, and they crashed
the offensive glass really hard. When we did get the defensive rebounds, we
wanted to push the tempo and speed the game up.  
I think we're at our best when we're in the open court, playing, sharing the
ball, and knocking down shots. So that was key for us today.  
  
Q. There's a lot of goals and aspirations in play for you all, but the fact
that you haven't won a conference tournament and the school hasn't won one in
a long time, how motivating is that this weekend?  
TEKELE COTTON: We just take it one game at a time, and this is just another
box we've got to check. We're all competitive on this team. So that's a box
that we‑‑ that's a goal, to take that box.  
  
Q. Was this your best game of the season? Is there any pressure about being
undefeated?  
FRED VAN VLEET: I don't know about best game. I think we had a really good
defensive effort. I remember coming out at the under 12 media, and they only
had 23 points. So we were clicking on defense, and we were knocking down
shots.  
But playing 30 games, I can't remember which one was our best game, but if you
think so, then okay. I just was impressed with our defensive effort and our
focus from the tip‑off. When these guys are hot like that and knocking down
shots, it makes the whole game easier.  
  
Q. Cleanthony, best game?  
CLEANTHONY EARLY: I don't remember our best game, and I don't really look back
on trying to remember our best game, but I guess we were pretty good. I guess
that's on you guys, you know.  
  
Q. For all three of you, have you been able to really thoroughly enjoy what
it is you've been able to accomplish to this point? Or because the goals are
still out there in some ways, where are you in terms of how much fun you've
been able to have this entire stretch?  
TEKELE COTTON: I think, when you see us out there on the court, you can see
how much fun we have every game. Like he said, our motto is to "Play Angry,"
but at the same time, we're out there on the court smiling, and we're having
fun with each other because we treat each other so well. That's it.  
FRED VAN VLEET: I don't know about exactly celebrating what we've
accomplished, so to speak, as opposed to thinking about how great we are. We
don't really blow our heads up like that. We have fun throughout the process.
If you watched the game today, you saw that. Everybody's happy. Everybody's
enjoying other guys doing that, and that just speaks to the chemistry and the
group and the program that we have.  
So we're definitely having fun throughout the process. It's not stressful or
anything like that, but as far as celebrating and thinking about how great we
could be or how great we are, we don't really focus on that.  
  
Q. Fred, Cleanthony's really ‑‑ I think particularly on the road‑‑ he's
pretty much balanced, but he seems to score on the road. Does he just increase
his game when he's away or when circumstances get a little tougher? Does
Cleanthony's game pick up when he gets away from home?   
FRED VAN VLEET: I think he's always focused anyway, but definitely when
opposing teams are talking trash or getting him hyped up, he gets an extra
chip on his shoulder. He takes the onus on himself and responsibility to get
us going.  
So maybe that's different on the road. Obviously, we're playing in front of
our home crowd. Whatever he's doing, if that's the case, I want him to keep
doing it.  
  
Q. You all were talking about checking off boxes. What does it mean now to
realize that you're 33 ‑0? Only Larry Bird's Indiana State and UNLV have done
that. What does that mean for you guys?   
TEKELE COTTON: Like Fred always says, when we get older, we'll be able to look
at the 33‑0 part, but right now we're 2‑0, and we're just trying to focus on
this tournament and this championship that we have.  
CLEANTHONY EARLY: Like Tekele said, I'm pretty sure one day we'll be able to
look back at it. For right now, we enjoy it, but I'm pretty sure we'll be able
to celebrate a little bit later. We're not trying to celebrate right now.
We're trying to handle business.  
  
Q. Cleanthony, has it become sort of a mental grind for you guys when you
get to this point where you're playing consecutive games in consecutive days,
three in a row, when you also think about what you guys are trying to
accomplish as well?  
CLEANTHONY EARLY: I think the whole process is a mental grind, you know, just
trying to stay focused on the task at hand. I think these guys do a great job
of coming out and trying to get it done one day at a time and one game at a
time.  
That's just been our motto and our philosophy, and that's how we go about our
business.  
  
Q. Cleanthony, obviously, it's all about the wins, but what does it mean to
you to be a John Wooden Award finalist to you and this team?  
CLEANTHONY EARLY: It feels really good. At the same time, I know I wouldn't be
in this position without my coaches and my teammates. So the only thing I can
go out and do is play my hardest for the rest of the time I'm here.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Questions for Coach Gregg
Marshall.  
  
Q. At times this season, three ‑point shootings have been perceived as, not
a weakness, but something that maybe this team wasn't as good at as other
aspects. When you shoot like this, how gratifying is that, and how much more
difficult do you become to beat?  
COACH MARSHALL: You know, I think‑‑ just 8 for 10, and the two misses were
late shot clock heaves in the first half. We were really 8 for 8, and the
other two were desperation, and we didn't execute, and we don't want to turn
the ball over. So we tried a long shot. I think Ron did it once and Tekele did
it once.  
Obviously, we didn't shoot it well at the very end. We're 1 for 10 in the
second half. There's going to be a game at some point where you don't shoot it
well. That's where you've got to have your defense and rebounding in your back
pocket. We always talk about it. When we shoot it well, we're hard to beat.  
If we can shoot it like this for as long as we can continue playing, we'll be
a very, very tough out.  
  
Q. Gregg, when's the last time you've called a time ‑out? Is that a good
indication of just how well you guys are playing?   
COACH MARSHALL: That's a good question, Brian. You ask good questions. There
haven't been any time‑outs this year. I'm not sure we've called more than two
all season. Bob, you would have to do some research on that.  
I think time‑outs are a sign of weakness. I like to do my coaching before the
game and in practice. I like to help them during the game, just give them a
little structure, tell them what defense ran, what out of bounds play we're
running, and I like for my players to work out their problems, generally, on
their own.  
When I call a time‑out, I don't have very much positive to say to them. So I
bet we played 33 games, I bet we haven't called two time‑outs where we weren't
just‑‑ I almost called a time‑out today to sub and do one of those deals where
you turn it over and sub and keep playing because I thought the guys at the
end were getting tired. But I'm not a big proponent.  
Now, there are times when you need them, but thank goodness this year, we
haven't needed them that often.  
  
Q. On Cleanthony, his game seems to pick up when it gets the toughest, if
you start counting tough road games and this tournament after last year's
tournament. I guess kind of there's other circumstances, I realize, but he
does seem to pick it up at the toughest moments. Is that what you observed?  
COACH MARSHALL: He did last year, played well in the Final Four, on the way to
the Final Four, he was all whatever they call it, all Final Four team, he made
that. Did not play well here last year, but generally he plays well on the
road, and away from home he plays a little better statistically.  
Maybe it's just focus. Maybe it's just he needs that internal stimuli to get
him going, fans calling his name and his girlfriend's name and all those
things that they do on the road. So maybe that's a good thing.  
  
Q. Missouri State was really trying to milk clock, slow the tempo. The run
you had in the first half by hitting those threes, how important was that to
maybe go make Missouri State change the game a little bit and quicken the
pace?  
COACH MARSHALL: It sure loosens them up when they're hitting shots. They do a
good job, as many teams in our league do, they make you play from the outside.
There's many good coaches in this league, and they collapse the defense around
the post. They don't let you throw it in. They don't let you drive it in.  
Once you start making some shots, it kind of loosens them up. Then they kind
of extend their defense a little bit, and then you get close‑outs that you can
penetrate, and maybe passing lanes that weren't there previously are there. So
I think it's monumentally important.  
  
Q. Gregg, when you're rolling like you were in the first half, but even more
in the second half when the game is ‑‑ you're putting the game pretty much out
of reach and your team is playing at such a high level, Missouri State has
absolutely no answer for it. Do you find yourself, even in that moment, just
every now and then saying, "Wow, this team can really get it going and can
really be a fun group to watch"?   
COACH MARSHALL: Yeah, it's really a fun‑‑ you nailed it. It's a fun team to
watch. It's a fun team to coach. It's a fun team to be around. Who can find
fault with 33‑0? No, take that back. I know people find fault with 33‑0\. I
don't. I don't. I enjoy it. I've enjoyed it the whole year. I've enjoyed
recruiting these guys, getting to know their families, being around them.  
It's just amazing that we're one game away from being done with the conference
tournament. So it seems like this season has just flashed by in an instant,
maybe four weeks instead of three and a half months.  
  
Q. Same question, I guess, for you that I asked the players about wanting to
win a tournament that you all haven't won and maybe the importance of that for
you all.  
COACH MARSHALL: I want to win very badly, but I would want to beat you in
cards if we dealt them tonight. That's just the way I'm wired. I want to win
this tournament. I want to win when I tee it up in a charity golf tournament
this summer. But there's special meaning to winning this tournament because
chances are we could be back here in about 11 days. So may as well get used to
it.  
As I said yesterday, I've had some good experiences in St. Louis lately. We
went to the Billikens and won against a very tough team on their home court,
which at that point they were rarely losing at all there. And then I came to
game four in the World Series and had a beautiful afternoon, had a great
steak, went over and watched the game, and then Johnny Gomes hit a three‑run
homer for my team. It was nice. We enjoyed St. Louis immensely.  
  
Q. I know, Coach, you don't know who you're going to play yet. Could you
just talk about the challenge Jake Odum and the Sycamores would give you if
you faced them tomorrow.  
COACH MARSHALL: Jake's a tremendous player. He's one of the greatest players,
probably in the top five in Indiana State history. I mean, we know who number
one is. So being number two or three or four, whatever he is, is wonderful.  
He does a great job of doing exactly what Fred Van Vleet does now. He
orchestrates the game. When he's in control, he's in control, and everybody
else is just watching him orchestrate the game. He did it as a freshman, and
he's continued that throughout his career.  
  
Q. When you played St. Louis earlier and Tennessee and some of them and won
some key road games, I started telling people that you were better than a year
ago, and I know you lost some key components, Armstead, Hall, whoever. Why or
what makes you better this year than a year ago?  
COACH MARSHALL: It's amazing, guys like you who obviously know the game very,
very well, and Coach Knight, who was at our practice and at our games, they
say the same thing. There's those skeptics and naysayers that are out there
that don't know a hill of beans about college basketball that are saying, oh,
their schedule and who they played and this and that.  
I think you just have to watch and know what you're talking about. But I think
it's‑‑ the fact that we defend every possession, we play both ends, we really
commit to defense and rebounding, and then we score it much better than we did
with last year's group. This group can score. This group has‑‑ I mean, people
at the beginning of the year were playing off Tekele Cotton. They were trying
to pick their poison, and they wouldn't guard them.  
Well, in the last couple of games, I think he was 3 for 4 or 2 for 4, 3 for 5
yesterday from three and 3 for 4 today. So I hope they continue to not guard
him.  
We've got a lot of weapons. Cleanthony is obviously special. Fred orchestrates
the game and can get to the rim and generally makes the right decision. And
Ron Baker. I mean, he's kind of an X factor. He's not even up here. I think he
will one day play in the NBA. So it's a pretty special group.  
  
Q. How did you get to be a Red Sox fan?  
COACH MARSHALL: My dad, living in South Carolina, Walter Marshall‑‑ when
you're growing up in the '30s and '40s in South Carolina, there were no
Orioles or Marlins or Braves. You had to pick a team on the East Coast, and
you either picked the Yankees or the Phillies, I guess, or the Red Sox, and he
went with the Red Sox for whatever reason.  
I remember him talking about Johnny Pesky and Dom DiMaggio and Ted Williams
when I was a kid. And he liked the Celtics, and his team on the football side
was the Redskins. Contrary to what my son did, he went the opposite. He picked
my rival teams. I went with my dad's teams.  
A couple things. Number one, house cleaning, there's a nail right here that
ripped my coat yesterday that we need to fix. I hope I'm here tomorrow.
Secondly, it's Tekele. He's going to be on the cover of Sports Illustrated for
the second time in three weeks. It's not Tekeel, it's Tekale, like the
vegetable, Cotton. Thank you.

### [Tyler Smithpeters](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26559)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Indiana State  62  
Southern Illinois  59

  
THE MODERATOR: Tyler Smithpeters and Anthony Beane are the Salukis with us.  
COACH HINSON: I'll make this brief. Congratulations to Indiana State and to
Wichita State. Couldn't have two finer teams representing our conference in a
conference championship. The semifinals is exactly what I thought it would be.
I knew this game would go down to the wire, no question in my mind, and it
certainly didn't leave me any surprises here. I'll let these guys answer your
questions.  
  
Q. Anthony, Barry called a time ‑out about 11 minutes to go and was pretty
ticked off that‑‑ about the putback with Gant, and you guys seemed to play
them even the rest of the way. How much did that get your attention?   
ANTHONY BEANE: It definitely got our attention. Earlier before that, I felt we
were just out there. We weren't playing defense like we were earlier in the
game. He definitely got our attention after that. I thought we came back out
and answered what he was talking about.  
  
Q. For both the student ‑athletes, can you just talk about their defense. It
seemed like nothing came easy for you guys on the offensive end today.   
TYLER SMITHPETERS: Yeah, you've just got to give Indiana State credit for
that. They prepared well for it, and it was tough.  
ANTHONY BEANE: Yeah, their defense was‑‑ it was great. They were definitely
prepared. But I felt that it was just‑‑ we had just as much to do with it. We
took quick shots. It wasn't a reflection of yesterday when we were out and
sharing the ball and things like that. It showed later on in the game.  
  
Q. Anthony, if you could just talk about your tournament overall and trying
to get a spark tonight when it was so hard, for one or the other team, to get
some momentum today.  
ANTHONY BEANE: Can you repeat that for me?  
  
Q. Can you talk about your tournament overall and then today trying to get
some momentum in a game that was really kind of ragged today for both teams?  
ANTHONY BEANE: I felt as a team, we did a good job as a team. Still we
expected more out of ourselves.  
As far as the momentum part, it was hard, but like I was saying, I felt that
we were all just taking quick shots. Me especially, I had some quick shots I
took where I could have ran the offense, things like that. It was definitely
hard to get momentum going as the game went on.  
  
Q. Can you guys both just talk about ‑‑ you're disappointed you didn't make
the finals tomorrow, and that's sure a long way from where you guys were in
January. Just talk about how that's kind of changed your expectations.   
TYLER SMITHPETERS: Yeah, we turned a lot of heads starting in February. So our
goal was to get to nine games and play on the Friday night. I mean, we did
that, but for us, we had more‑‑ farther expectations than what we did. I mean,
it just‑‑ it's tough.  
ANTHONY BEANE: Just like Ty said, our goal was to get to nine, but as a team,
we started feeling‑‑ we started getting better each and every day, and
everybody was just motivated and things like that. When we got here and we got
the first win, you could just tell everybody was ready to go. Unfortunately,
Indiana State, they played great and got the win today.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much for your time. Congratulations
on your season. We're going to stay here with Coach Hinson just a while
longer.  
  
Q. Coach, just talk about the time ‑out with 11 minutes to go. What did you
say to them, and how did you get their attention then?   
COACH HINSON: I'll have to paraphrase what I said. We just got our tails
whooped on an offensive rebound. We had just come out of a time‑out where we
challenged our guys for effort and energy, and we didn't have it. I just felt
like we needed to do something different, something drastic.  
I was really, really upset, and I portrayed it, and I told them about it, and
I challenged them, and I felt like for the most part we had better energy and
better effort from that point on, but we didn't play any smarter than what we
had earlier.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the offensive struggles? How much of it was you? How
much of it was their defense?  
COACH HINSON: You know, Les, that's kind of a tough question because you end
up sounding like an ass if you answer it any way but to give Indiana State
credit. I do think they had a lot to do with it.  
I heard Greg yelling, "Cushion, cushion, cushion," the entire game, but we
took bad shots today, and we reverted back to how we played in the
nonconference and really, really wasn't happy about that.  
Hopefully, we can use this as a teaching point in how to get better, and I
think we have to. That's one of the things we talked about in the locker room.
We never stop teaching, and that's one of the things we felt like we needed to
continue to do when we got off the floor.  
We told them at halftime, "You are fighting us. You are fighting us. Will you
just give in and do what we're asking to you do," and we just‑‑ I kept asking
my coaches, "What do we do? Suggestions?" They said, "Just fight them back,
Coach. Fight them back." That's why I called the time‑out at the 11‑minute
mark.  
The encouraging thing is 83 percent of the rebounds today were by our
underclassmen and 80 percent of points came from our underclassmen. So I do
like‑‑ we got a little bit of a glimpse of our future, and I do like that.  
  
Q. Coach, on the last play of the game, was it the plan to get Jackson the
ball?  
COACH HINSON: We had three options, and he's the final option. Got to give‑‑
now, I will tell you this. Indiana State did a great job. They switched five,
did a good job, and they even switched a switch switch, which they were pretty
good at it. Greg had them ready to go, and they really did a good job on it.  
I thought we were going to get a better look. We turned down a better look for
a worse look, but the play worked. I mean, it worked. We were going to get a
decent shot and just kind of made a bad decision.  
  
Q. Barry, can you just talk about the evolution of Anthony Beane's game and
how much he kind of carried you today when Des just was not into it today.  
COACH HINSON: I think everybody wants to talk about Anthony scoring, but I
think the thing that we're most proud of him is, when we lost our starting
point guard, it took us a while, but we finally got him to talk and to lead
and to be that guy out on the floor, to challenge guys on and off the floor. I
think he's done that.  
Certainly, his offensive game has improved. He's right. Even Anthony today
made some bad decisions, but Anthony‑‑ Whitey Herzog used to say this all the
time. You've got to play small ball, and you've got to hit singles. Most of
our guys today tried to hit home runs all day long, and you can't‑‑ you just
can't do that in the Valley, and you certainly can't do it against any of
Greg's teams because they're so well coached. You've got to play small ball,
and we did not do that at all.  
  
Q. Barry, can you talk about the clock delay at the beginning and how much
of an influence, if it did at all, the clock did?  
COACH HINSON: No, it's fine. Jack came by and apologized. It's amazing to me
that you're playing in a game that hosts the National Hockey League, and you
can't have a shot clock that works. That's not the Missouri Valley
Conference's fault, it's not. It's the building's fault.  
It didn't have an effect on the game, but the professionalism of that at this
level, there's no excuse for that, none. So, sorry. I've had my ass eat out
this year. You know what? Shot clock guys, you get your ass eat out today
because that's not right and it's not the Valley's fault. Who runs this
building? Got to take care of that stuff.  
Hopefully, it will work tomorrow when we're on national television on CBS. I
think I'd fly a frickin' part in tonight. Good gosh, you guys just got me
going.  
  
Q. You talked about small ball. Can you talk about you didn't do some of the
little things, you missed a bunch of layups, a couple right at crunch time and
also struggled again at the free ‑throw line.   
COACH HINSON: Yeah, that's been a problem for us this year, and really today,
in all honesty, it was everything. Anthony, I think, went 1 for 4. Yeah, he
went 1 for 4, and Desmar missed two. You know, Jalen has struggled from the
free‑throw line all year long. We had to make a decision there at the end of
the game because we knew Greg would foul him. We did miss the bunny. I think
it would have tied the game, is that right? We missed a wide open layup, and
that's where we tied the game.  
That's where we learn, young guys learn. Use them as teaching moments, and we
try to do that.  
  
Q. Coach, what can you say about Des's performance today? He had a decent
game yesterday but wasn't really a factor today?  
COACH HINSON: In Des's defense, he tried to help us today. He forced a lot of
shots, took a lot of bad shots. Give credit to Indiana State. When you go get
a double double, there's a good chance you're going to have a target on your
back the next day. That target jersey's pretty heavy.  
The one thing we kept talking about on the time‑out was trust your teammates.
We didn't do that today.  
  
Q. Barry, certainly, your future's got to look pretty good with four
potential starters and how well your freshmen have played. What makes you
excited for next season?  
COACH HINSON: I'll tell you why I'm excited. I'm excited to be a Saluki.
That's what makes me excited. We're about to have a team come out of here‑‑
regardless of whether they win tomorrow, they're going to be a Number 1 seed.
Put that on national media, all right? That's how strong I feel about it.  
We're going to have the Number 1 seed come out of our conference, and I get to
coach in this league, and I get to coach at a school that has tradition‑rich
basketball, and we've got a bunch of young little stinkers coming back, and I
like it. I'm excited about that.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about your team as far as the disappointment level
that you didn't make the championship game after where you were in early
January.  
COACH HINSON: Well, Darren, college basketball is highs and lows. Needless to
say, I'm one of those guys. I'm a high guy, and I'm a low guy. That's just
part of it. You've got to get used to it.  
If you would have told us in January we were going to have a chance to play in
the conference championship game, I'd have probably said, "You need to go get
drug tested." You know what, we played well down the stretch. We did. Proud of
our guys. Pretty good for a group of mama boys, wasn't it?  
  
Q. Coach, to go back to the game real quick, you were able to keep Odum
relatively silent the entire first half. What do you think the difference
between the halves was where he came out?  
COACH HINSON: You guys saw it. They blew the whistle every time he had the
ball in his hands. They shot 15 free throws.  
THE MODERATOR: And that will do it.  
COACH HINSON: This is a moment when you say I've learned my lesson.  
Hey, I appreciate it. Have fun tomorrow.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

LOYOLA  62  
INDIANA STATE - 75

  
COACH PORTER MOSER: We didn't play well enough to win, that's for sure. I give
Indiana state a lot of credit, defensively I thought they were very physical,
they did a great job on our guards. Just didn't play well enough to win.
Shooting the ball, I thought Odom made a ton of big plays. I felt at the
halftime, being down four, shooting the way we shot it, to had for 22, we had
one assist, six turnovers.  
With those stats, you would think we were down 20 and we were within striking
distance and Milt was on the bench. I think they came out and they hit us
right in the mouth proverbially right out of the gate and got the lead to ten
and then never looked back.  
We had a stretch where we missed I think four layups in a row and couldn't get
anything going offensively. It's a credit to them. I thought they played very
physical defense.  
  
Q. Do you feel like during that stretch where you guys missed a bunch of
layups in a row, do you think that maybe just ‑‑ the second half, maybe the
legs, you guys got tired maybe after playing last night and have the
advantage?   
COACH PORTER MOSER: No, I don't think fatigue was part of that. I don't. And I
don't ‑‑ I'm not going to let them say it's a part of that, either.  
You know, tournament settings, it's only game day two, so no, I thought they
were well rested. And they just didn't go down. I thought we got‑‑ I think
there was definitely a stretch that it was like four in a row and Kiki had one
and Milt had one and it was like four right there in a row. I don't think it
was fatigue; I think we just missed them.  
  
Q. As well in the first half, particular, yesterday, it seemed like
everything was falling and then today nothing falls. Is that just one of those
things, or were there things specifically that you guys were to the doing?  
COACH PORTER MOSER: Like I said, I told our guys at halftime, there's times
where you're not going to make shots. And I thought for the most part, we hung
in there. You know, rebounded the ball well, we had a distinct rebound
advantage after the first half.  
Literally, for Milton to be on the bench for about 14, 15 minutes, for us to
shoot 4‑for‑22, have 1‑of‑6, six turnovers, to be within four, I thought we
survived‑‑ we survived the first half.  
You know, I don't think their attitude sometimes throughout this year, our
offense has dictated our defense; if we weren't making shots, we would hang
our lip. Milt wasn't making shots in the second half, still had six assist, no
turnovers, and I thought he was playing hard D.  
So I like that part of it that our offense didn't dictate our defense tonight.
We just didn't‑‑ we didn't hit shots. We missed a number of shots.  
  
Q. Could you evaluate, assess the first year, going through the Missouri
Valley and what you do from here on out to get ready for next year, where you
take the program?  
COACH PORTER MOSER: Well, I told the guys just in the locker room, there was
points this year where they just haven't been on this kind of stage before,
and within league and then I think coming to a tournament like this‑‑ and this
has to motivate us in the off‑season.  
You know, we‑‑ our goal is not to be playing on Thursday night, win one game.
We want to be playing on Sunday. And this has got a huge‑‑ now we went through
it, and now they got a feel; they got a visualization of what this league is
about, what this road is about.  
It's a great league. I told you, I've played in it, coached in it, and now the
guys, you can never say they haven't been through it. And that's going to
motivate them in the off‑season. They have got to come together. We've got to
have a great off‑season. We've got to get better in all areas and I think
we've got a lot of things; the Valley motivated us this year.  
I think it's nothing but optimism. It's nothing but‑‑ I really believe this
league gives Loyola a chance to have a higher ceiling and its our opportunity
in the summertime and the spring to get after it and get better, because this
league is a league of development. It's always been a league of fifth‑year
seniors, four‑year guys, guys that get better and that's what we've got to be.  
  
Q. Now that you have a taste of this league, what's the vibe like? Do you
feel optimistic about what's going to come this year?  
CHRISTIAN THOMAS: Definitely feeling optimistic. This is our first time in
this type of event, like Coach said so now that we see what it's all about,
what it's going to take to ultimately be playing on Sunday.  
MATT O'LEARY: Like he said got a little taste of it last night, got the win,
and hope to build on that in the off‑season.  
  
Q. What were your impressions the first run through the value see and where
do you need to get better in the off ‑season?   
MATT O'LEARY: Obviously it's a tough league. Everyone plays great defense is
what it's known for I guess. But just got to get stronger, especially I guess
personally, I've got to get stronger and just ‑‑  
COACH PORTER MOSER: That's why he's an academic all‑star. He recognizes things
like that (laughter).  
MATT O'LEARY: Yeah.  
CHRISTIAN THOMAS: Similar to what Matt said, we definitely need to get
stronger in the off‑season. Wasn't as physical as Missouri Valley was. And
just because this was our first year, we had no way of really gauging that
ourselves, and I think that now we have a firsthand experience of what it's
like but we also see what we need to do.

# [MISSOURI VALLEY CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Greg Lansing](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21764)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

LOYOLA  62  
INDIANA STATE - 75

  
COACH GREG LANSING: He had about a week of practice, and so really like he‑‑
he knows he wasn't playing good and he wants to play better and not let his
teammates down. Those three are really picking us up, so that's nice.  
  
Q. You want this team to have a defensive personality, it's one thing to
say, it's another thing to do it. Team did it today. Just talk about that and
just talk specifically about the defense of Milton Doyle who never really got
his scoring going today.  
COACH GREG LANSING: Yeah, you just have to fight‑‑ Manny was terrific. Manny
does not get credit for how well he defends. He was really good defensively.  
And with Milt, you just try to make it hard for him to goat it and really try
to keep him in front of you and hope he misses. He's so good. Look at what he
did last night, and just a heroic effort and he's going to be something to
deal with for the next three years.  
We've always been like that. We want that, because to win championships, a lot
comes at the defensive end. I like the ball going in. I like great offense as
much as anybody, but in this conference, as well as everybody is prepared,
you're going to have to guard and make it tough on other people.  
And we've done it a lot, but you know, we've given up too many easy ones, even
when we were pretty good, so we were kind of focused today and the last couple
days, and tonight was nothing easy. Let's not give them an easy one; if they
are going to score, they are going to have to score against a good defense.  
  
Q. You ended practice early yesterday because you felt so good about your
team. What was it that you saw in your bunch that just kind of to yourselves,
just said, I know we're ready?  
COACH GREG LANSING: Sometimes by kicking them out of there, because you're not
very happy with them, I've never done that to this team; I probably should
have a few times throughout this year.  
The practices before we got down here were really good and spirited and going
after each other, and then we came over here and had a half hour fear and it
was as harp as a half hour‑‑ we just did shooting but all the individual stuff
we did, the guys were locked in; in high energy. We went over across the way
to 15, 20 minutes; for one, the floor was a little slick, so the head coach
was a little worried about it, but they were going after each other so hard. I
just said, we're done, we're ready. I knew they were. I knew they would be.  
  
Q. As part of that, this team does seem to be embracing its No.2 seed and
all that comes with that? In general they seem to be embracing this
opportunity.  
COACH GREG LANSING: Even though we lost three coming in here, this group
throughout has been a hard working group.  
They have been a good group to be around and a pretty hard‑working practice
group and for a lot of reasons, maybe they get tired of hearing me, we did get
secured at that two seed so we might just not have been competing as hard as
we needed to, and when you do that, you're going to lose.  
Towards the end of the year, you've got a veteran group, you've got a guy like
Jake Odum, Manny Arop, Lucas Eitel; you've got four seniors like that that are
unselfish and work and compete and want to keep playing and tell you the
truth, they feel they are as good as anyone.  
We beat a good team tonight and we know we are going to face a really good one
tomorrow and hopefully if we play like that, if we compete like that, we'll
have a chance tomorrow.  
  
Q. You make a habit out of beingon the floor 45 minutes before a game?  
COACH GREG LANSING: No comment. No comment.  
Yeah, that's true. Now we can probably do it. I was lived before the game
because the miscommunication, and we thought we couldn't get on there until 30
minutes before, the floor, and as we walked in there, I was so mad and Lou
said, "Don't let the team see you mad."  
So I walked out of there a little bit and just told them to get ready. Yeah
we'd like to have been‑‑ Odom, because I know how Odom is, he's got to have
his routine before a game and he looked at me when we walked in, like they are
out there shooting and I can't be out there shooting?  
Thank God we won, let's just put it that way.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Southern Illinois  63  
UNI  58

  
THE MODERATOR: Northern Iowa Panthers are here. Seth Tuttle, Wes Washpun,
Jeremy Morgan. We're going to go right into questions with them and wait for
Coach Jake to finish his radio and come up here. If there are questions for
the three student‑athletes, start now.  
  
Q. Jeremy, what are you ‑‑ not just you, team‑wise, were you guys a little
bit tight there to start the game?   
JEREMY MORGAN: I think, yeah, we obviously came out a little bit slow in the
first half, and then we got behind so far, it wasn't enough in the second
half.  
  
Q. Seth, talk a little, once you guys had tied it up, did you ‑‑ I know you
know a game's never over, but did you feel like maybe you'd gotten over the
hump and were poised kind of to win the thing?   
SETH TUTTLE: Yeah, after the first half, they had all the momentum. Halftime,
we made a little adjustment‑‑ a little after halftime, I guess. We got on a
little roll there where we dug ourselves out of the hole that we got ourselves
in, obviously.  
We got the ball game tied. We got a stop even when it was tied. I think it was
an offensive rebound by Bola, putback and one. We had the play, we got the
stop. We didn't get the rebound to get us over that hump.  
But I felt like we had all the momentum there going. We were on a roll. I feel
like we might have got them back on their heels a little bit, like they had us
in the first half. They made the big plays to win the ball game.  
  
Q. Wes, just talk about when you guys were kind of backed into the corner
there in the second half, just the attack mode that you went into to get back
in the game.  
WES WASHPUN: Yeah, we just kind of got‑‑ picked up the intensity and tried to
be the first to the floor every time and the first to get loose balls and pick
up our rebound and our defensive intensity to try to get ourselves back into
the game, and I feel like we did that.  
  
Q. Seth, what does this do for motivation in the off ‑season to get you
prepared, motivated, returning the majority of the team?   
SETH TUTTLE: Yeah, I mean, obviously, we could use this year or the two
previous to motivate us. Hopefully, we can use it to motivate us. I know I
sure will. I mean, I have one more crack at it. So we're going to be going
hard again this summer‑‑ this upcoming summer, like we did this summer.
Hopefully, we find a way.  
  
Q. Seth, what do you think the biggest struggle for you guys was in the
first half?  
SETH TUTTLE: I think that they just played really, really good defense. They
pressured the ball handler. I feel like what really hurt us might have been
them denying the wings. It hurt us getting into our sets, getting into what we
wanted to run. They slowed things down.  
For me, personally, they did a great job of fronting the post. It seemed like
even in transition there, they run into my high side. They executed what their
coach's game plan was perfectly, and then obviously it showed in the first
half.  
  
Q. With what you just said, how much did that cause the frustration level?
How much did that feed into that?  
SETH TUTTLE: I mean, we might have been a little frustrated. We obviously‑‑
we've been down numbers like that before. We were down 20 at Drake, and we
fought our way back. I think we tied the game then too.  
So I don't think‑‑ there was obviously no quitting in any player or any coach.
There never would be. So I don't know if it's‑‑ I don't know if it was
necessarily frustration. We needed that time‑out, or that halftime, to
regroup, and we did that, and we came out in the second half with a lot
different attitude.  
  
Q. Jeremy, can you just talk a little bit about the defensive adjustment on
Desmar in that second half.  
JERERMY MORGAN: Yeah, that first half, he really got going. He was knocking
down his threes, and we weren't pressuring him enough. That second half, we
tried to get on him a little bit harder and make those shots tougher than they
were in the first half.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much for your time. We're going to
stay here with Coach Ben Jacobson.  
  
Q. Jake, what are you going to look to most, the last three minutes of the
first half when they extended it or the last three minutes of the second half
where you had it tied and they kind of had a little more?  
COACH JACOBSON: I think, as big as those two times, I think bigger was the
first probably eight to ten minutes of the game. Barry did a better job of
getting his guys ready than I did, and that obviously cost us an opportunity
to be close at halftime.  
They came out‑‑ at their place, they did a little bit of that, where they came
out and pressured and tried to deny some passes. So we'd seen it from them
before. But they played a lot of zone, gone back and forth with their man in
their zone, and at our place when we beat them, they denied some passes as
well, but they were more aggressive in this game defensively.  
Something that I talked about with my assistants, that I thought about, they
have a couple of options as to how they can play. I did not do a good enough
job of having those guys ready for them fronting the post and denying passes.
Obviously, the change we made with our offense in the second half gave us a
lot of opportunities against what they were doing, one that should have been
made in the first half.  
  
Q. Ben, your team shot the three pretty well the last couple of weeks. How
hard was it to generate some momentum and take the lead without making one all
game?  
COACH JACOBSON: As well as they played offensively and as poorly as we handled
it, we still had some pretty good opportunities. We still had a couple around
the rim, and we still had‑‑ Bo had a couple of good looks from the three‑point
line, and there was a couple other open threes. Wes has been a pretty high
percentage shooter, and he was open, and Jeremy had one. So we didn't lack for
other opportunities to score in the first half.  
If some of those go, and it stays at five or six or seven, then it's maybe a
little different game. We've been‑‑ we shot the three‑point shot very well.
The entire league season, we shot the ball well from there.  
Our team has grown into a team that Seth is going to touch the ball, and then
we're going to play out of that. Tonight in the first half we weren't able to
get him some of those same touches, and that slowed us down a bit. Again,
there were some good looks from the three‑point line.  
  
Q. Jake, can you talk about, when you guys were struggling to get anything
going early, what Seth gave you, he nearly had a double double at half, even
though you were down, he kind of single ‑handedly kept you in it for
stretches.   
COACH JACOBSON: The play, I don't know if it was the 10‑minute mark or the
11‑minute mark, when he and Marvin went back and forth with the offensive
rebounds, that sequence, I believe, cut it to two at 15 to 13, or somewhere in
that area, I thought that was the sequence in the play that was going to get
us playing right, going to get us defending a little bit better and doing a
little bit better job on Jackson and get us going a little bit more
offensively in transition and just moving a little bit better.  
I felt like that play was going to be the one, and obviously, he was a huge
part of that play. But to get 17 rebounds in this game just shows he's
continued‑‑ he continued what he's done for quite a while now, and he came out
here tonight and played extremely well. I just wish I would have helped him a
little bit more.  
  
Q. Coach, despite that first half, team battles back just like in that Drake
game. What do you think it says about the team, their willingness to battle
back, and how similar were the two halftimes between this game and the Drake
game?  
COACH JACOBSON: They were different. Yeah, they were different. And I don't‑‑
I think Seth maybe commented on it. I would have been extremely surprised had
we not fought back.  
The kind of guys that we're dealing with and the guys that we've got in our
program and the leadership we have from the players in our program, that's not
something that‑‑ again, I'd have been extremely surprised had we not stood in
there and fought.  
Obviously, proud of the guys for doing that but not surprised.  
  
Q. I heard all week that the rebounding battle was going to be key. You guys
won it by ten. It wasn't that much of a difference?  
COACH JACOBSON: It goes to what I talked about, in terms of them coming out
and pressuring the ball a little more and then denying passes a little more
than what they had and getting in front of Seth and making it tough for him to
get touches left us standing around a little bit.  
Had we had‑‑ had I had a little better plan for some of that, I think we could
have had a better offensive half, and then the rebounding comes into play. I
think the rebounding then gets us over the hump. But that just‑‑ that had us
standing still for too long in that first half.  
Again, there were some‑‑ there were some opportunities and some open shots and
some ones that we missed, but that kind of set the tempo for the game in that
first half, and I thought that that was‑‑ that ended up being a bigger key
than the rebounding. I didn't think that anything would be bigger than
rebounding in tonight's game.  
  
Q. Coach, heading into the tournament, you had said you felt like your team
was playing the best basketball of the year. High hopes for the championship
this weekend. I guess, how disappointing or deflating is it to be heading
home?  
COACH JACOBSON: Very disappointing. To come in here with a young group that
had gotten better and a lot better in the last three weeks and had some
important things, namely, our defense and our rebounding. So the way that we
had played, we certainly felt like we had an opportunity to not only win
tonight but give Indiana‑‑ now beating Indiana State, play well in that game,
and give ourselves a chance on Sunday.  
There was no doubt our guys felt they could play on Sunday and they could win
on Sunday. So to get knocked out tonight is disappointing.  
  
Q. How much thought have you given to specifically next year, 2014/'15, just
finding some consistency as far as this program is concerned?  
COACH JACOBSON: As far as?  
  
Q. Maybe getting back to the tournament and how big it would be to keep this
momentum going that you have.  
COACH JACOBSON: Yeah, I haven't given any thought to that. I know we've got
some conversations to have now about whether we're going to continue to play
this year. So I guess I haven't given thought to next year's team yet. So I
don't have an answer for you in terms of that.  
The only thing I would say is that playing for a championship in our league
and playing in the NCAA Tournament will continue to be at the top of our list.
That's not going to change. Playing a really tough, hard nonconference
schedule and doing everything we can to put our players and our program in a
position to play in the NCAA Tournament, that won't change.  
Now it's a matter, when we get to that point and we get past this season, of
sitting down and figuring out what exactly it is we have to do to give
ourselves a better chance next year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Best of luck.

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Bobby Hunter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26457)

### [Zach Lofton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26524)

### [Dan Muller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24792)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Missouri State  53  
Illinois State  48

  
THE MODERATOR: Illinois State Redbirds are with us. Bobby Hunter, Zach Lofton
are the student‑athletes. Coach Dan Muller is here.  
COACH MULLER: First of all, congratulations to Paul Lusk and his team to
moving on. We picked a bad night to have our worst offensive night of the
year, clearly in the first half. It would be an understatement to say we
played poorly offensively, other than Zach. He was terrific all game.  
But other than him, missing free throws, missing shots, guys
uncharacteristically turning the ball over really hurt us. We came back. We
took the lead, but Ruder made just a couple too many threes for us.  
  
Q. Zach, could you just kind of talk about, especially in the first half,
your mindset. Could you see your teammates were struggling? Did you kind of
feel like you guys needed something to kind of pick it up, come in and kind of
make some shots actually?  
ZACH LOFTON: Yeah, a little bit. But as we have this season, we started off a
little slow and then picked it up. I just‑‑ my mindset was coming in to help
my team to win anyway.  
  
Q. Bobby, would it be fair to say you guys were nervous, tight in that first
half?  
BOBBY HUNTER: Yeah, that's fair to say. This is pretty much all of our guys',
besides two players, first MVC tournament game. We were tight and a little
nervous, and once we kind of got out of it, we started playing well. Zach was
making some shots. We were attacking, got some stills, and we fought ourselves
back into the game.  
Like Coach said, Ruder hit too many threes, and it's hard to bounce back once
he hit those two from 25, 28 feet.  
  
Q. Bobby, we talk about 50 ‑50 balls a lot. It seemed like they got more
50‑50 balls tonight. What was the reasoning behind that‑‑ what happened there?
Did they just not fight you for a lot of those?   
BOBBY HUNTER: Some of them, yeah, they out fought us. Some of them, we were
just lackadaisical going towards the ball. Some we had right in our hands, let
it slip, and they were the first to dive on it. So we just have to work on
that and be more aggressive going towards the ball when it comes to 50‑50
balls.  
  
Q. Zach, this is the end of the regular season and tournament season, but
did you guys get a chance to play, is that something you want to keep doing
this season?  
ZACH LOFTON: Yeah, we're for whatever Coach Muller wants.  
  
Q. Bobby, same thing?  
BOBBY HUNTER: Yeah, all the team, they still want to play. So whatever
tournament we get chosen to play in, we'll take that.  
  
Q. Was it confusing for you at the start of the second half when the shot
clock was going off and they kept stopping the game?  
BOBBY HUNTER: No, it wasn't confusing. It was just kind of‑‑ I don't know how
to‑‑ I don't know how to put it. They just kept stopping it, and it's kind of
hard for a team to get in the groove because every five seconds they're
stopping play, and then they say ball in, and then they tell us to go back.  
So it was just kind of a weird situation. That can happen on any day. It just
happened on us.  
ZACH LOFTON: I was on the bench at the time when they were having that happen
with the clock. It felt kind of weird. I guess you could say long breaks that
we don't usually have. Other than that, it didn't do anything.  
  
Q. Zach, you've really gotten on an offensive roll here in the last four
games. What's the difference?  
ZACH LOFTON: Playing more free, I guess. Having a little bit more confidence
in myself. I think that's the biggest thing is confidence. Getting a little
confidence, practice hard, made a couple shots in practice, and it carried
over.  
  
Q. Bobby, you talk about playing some more games. What kind of things could
you benefit from if you do get a chance to play some more games this season,
do you think?  
BOBBY HUNTER: We can learn from everything. Coach has done a great job of
getting us prepared. Whenever we have practice next, you know, all 10 of us or
11 of us will be ready to go and learn from our mistakes and move on from
there.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you for your time. We're going to dismiss you
and stay with Coach Muller.  
  
Q. Dan, when you guys were able to take the lead, you had a couple of
possessions where you probably didn't really kind of run what you really
wanted to run. Did the guys just get a little too nervous, even at that point
maybe?  
COACH MULLER: We may have. We got some good looks, but the truth is, when we
came back, Zach made those shots. If he makes them, wow, great shot. If he
misses them, why did you take it? So he was playing terrific.  
We had a couple of turnovers, I thought, that really cost us in that stretch.
I don't know if they were‑‑ I know one was after we took the lead.  
But we were uncharacteristically, I thought‑‑ and I'm not‑‑ really nervous at
different times. So no one got in a groove really. If you look at our players,
other than Zach Lofton, they made seven field goals and shot it poorly from
the foul line. It was a learning experience. Certainly would like to learn
more after a win. But like I said, Ruder was terrific.  
  
Q. Defensively, you guys had trouble with Gulley the first two games and
kind of really took him away. Was that almost pick your poison and did that
leave Ruder open a little more?  
COACH MULLER: I don't think it did. Ruder made some incredibly deep, difficult
shots. He actually made his first three in transition, which our defense
allowed those transition shots. We had a couple breakdowns, but in general, he
made very difficult deeper‑‑ he just extended his range.  
We did a great job on Gulley. We didn't do a very good job on the boards,
again, unfortunately. But our defense was not the issue, other than Ruder. But
he made‑‑ that last three he made was really, really a good shot.  
  
Q. Like you said, the guys were just tight really the whole game. Did you
have that feeling coming into the game maybe that there were some nerves?  
COACH MULLER: You just never know for sure, to be honest, especially when you
have a new situation. We looked like we did at VCU, which was a long time ago.  
I mean‑‑ I said this to the team, and I mean it, if they wanted to play well,
they really did. They may have wanted it too badly. I wish I could have‑‑ I
probably could have done something differently, I don't know what, with the
preparation, to get them loose and free, which is what I've been talking
about.  
Then we got hit. We got hit in the mouth a little bit, and that shocked us
even more. We missed some shots, we missed some free throws in that stretch,
we got a three‑point shooter, they made a couple of transition baskets. We
just couldn't get it going offensively. We never settled in other than Zach.  
  
Q. Dan, if it does become an opportunity to play some more, how much will it
go into the thinking of you don't want them to go out like this? You want to
have an opportunity to go into the off ‑season whenever that comes?   
COACH MULLER: Yeah, put our guys in a situation to play again, and the
practice time is always nice although, with the extended practice time, we've
been practicing a long time now, and we don't have a lot of numbers.  
I think the biggest value for playing more right now is being in a tournament
situation. So we'll see. We'll talk to our administration. We'll see what
options we have and make a decision.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Dan.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Missouri State  53  
Illinois State  48

  
THE MODERATOR: The victorious Bears are here. They have a date tomorrow with
the Number 1 seed Wichita State Shockers. We're going to ask Paul Lusk, the
head coach, to start off with a statement on the game.  
COACH LUSK: Both teams struggled offensively, but we found a way to win the
game. Shot 32 percent from the field, 35 from three, and 52 from the line. We
were really poor from the line. But our guys didn't cave in, even when they
took the lead, and we found a way to win the game. That's all that matters.  
I thought our guys really battled. We were good on the glass. Obviously,
Austin made some big shots. I thought Devon did some really good things. Pick
and Jarmar weren't great offensively, but they were unbelievable on the glass.
So it was a great team effort. We're excited to come back tomorrow.  
  
Q. Austin, you're a guy who doesn't get too excited about situations, but
talk about the atmosphere today and the way you're shooting it with confidence
when the game was on the line.  
AUSTIN RUDER: It was a great atmosphere definitely, being my first time here.
Hitting shots felt good. I shot the second one that I made, it felt really
good, and I thought it was going to be a pretty good night. I kept putting
them up. My teammates kept telling me to put them up. So it was a good
feeling.  
  
Q. Austin, if you could specifically talk about that last three ‑pointer,
the one with 2:04 left that gave your team the lead. And also for Pickens, if
you could talk about the tip‑in.   
AUSTIN RUDER: It was just I got a good pass. The man over helped a little bit.
He had a pretty good close‑out on me. I had to put a little more arch than I
usually do on it, and I just got it to go.  
KEITH PICKENS: When you tip‑in, I was scratching the boards the whole game. I
missed a few close layups, and Kirk told me to just keep attacking the class.
The last one rolled off, and I got my fingertips on it and got it up to the
backboard, and it rolled in for me. So it was a good feeling.  
  
Q. Keith, you almost didn't come back this year, and then I know you had
some injuries along the way this year. Can you just talk about what the year
was like battling through. And then is it all worth it on a day like this?  
KEITH PICKENS: Oh, yeah, definitely a tough year, obviously, when you have to
go through injuries and you can't play every game or practice like you want
to. When you get into a situation like this, it's all worth it. You just live
to fight another day. It's a good feeling to be out here and competing with my
teammates in one of the highest levels of the college tournament. You can't
have a better feeling.  
  
Q. Jarmar, did they take away the inside on you a little bit that you were
able to exploit on them earlier? Do you think that maybe opened it up a little
bit for Austin on the outside?  
JARMAR GULLEY: They were leaving a man in the middle where we usually flash
in. So the corners were open. Me and Pick, we got together, and we just
started screening the outside of the zone. Rudy was lucky enough to hit the
big shots.  
  
Q. Keith, I know you've seen Austin do this before. For a young guy on this
sort of a stage, how impressed are you to describe his play today?  
KEITH PICKENS: It was big time. Any time you can get Rudy going, you just want
to find ways to keep feeding him. I think that's what we did. We got him in
good situations to make shots, and he did what he does best, and he knocked
them down. His confidence continues to rise. He'll continue to do it. So it
was a good feeling.  
  
Q. For any of you three, thoughts on getting another shot at Wichita State
and what you remember maybe about the first two meetings.  
AUSTIN RUDER: We played them at home, and we competed really hard, just didn't
get the job done. And then we went up to their place and just kind of
crumbled.  
Looking to come out tomorrow, play hard, and give our best effort.  
JARMAR GULLEY: I think we just need to go out tomorrow and just play Missouri
State basketball and play our hardest, and things will be great for us.  
KEITH PICKENS: Definitely exciting. Obviously, I didn't get to play in the
first contest. We went down to Wichita last weekend, I believe, and we didn't
do the things we needed to do to execute to be in the game. So any time you
can play a team like this at that caliber, second in the country, you just
have to be excited and give your best effort.  
  
Q. Keith and Jarmar, this is win number 20. Talk about a year ago, 11 ‑22
until now. What kind of accomplishment is that for the team?  
AUSTIN RUDER: It's a great feeling. You can look around the country and not
many teams have 20 minutes. Any time you can get to that level, it's big time,
and it's great for the team. Hasn't gone the way we wanted to with injuries.
20 wins is big time, it's a good feeling.  
JARMAR GULLEY: I think getting more than 20 wins or getting to 20 wins is one
of the team goals. I think we reached it. We've just got to get better and be
ready to come out tomorrow and play.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, gentlemen, thank you for your time. Congratulations
on the victory. We'll stay here with Coach Lusk.  
  
Q. Paul, the way they couldn't put them away and kept coming back. I think
you called that time ‑out to settle things down before Austin made that shot.
What's your thoughts there?   
COACH LUSK: I thought we did a nice job of guarding them, and they clearly did
a nice job of guarding us. We guarded a little bit better. Zach Lofton is a
guy that sometimes it's feast or famine, and I think Dan would tell you the
same thing. When he gets it going, you can't do a whole lot with him. Some of
those shots, if they don't go in, it changes.  
Well, we got the ten‑point lead, and he went on a really big run. Then I think
we got it up to ten again, and he did the same thing. So give him credit.  
But proud of our guys. When they stole the ball from Dorrian there with about
four minutes left, it reminded me of the two plays over in Bloomington a
couple of weeks ago, but we kept it together, and we found a way to win it.
It's good to win here and still be alive.  
We'll have to get our guys rested up because we'll have a huge challenge
tomorrow. They've had a perfect season. 32 times the opponent has tried to
beat them, and they've been very unsuccessful. So we'll see what we can do
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Paul, talk about Devon's play today and then also how you've seen him
mature this year.  
COACH LUSK: Really, he's going to be a very good player for us. I thought
about starting him, but if I were to start him, I would have had four guys out
there in Devon Thomas, Dorrian Williams, Tyler McCullough, and Austin Ruder
that never played in a conference tournament. And I just didn't do it. Wanted
to go with Pick and Gulley because they've been here before.  
Devon is going to be a really good player for us. I thought he changed the
game and did some really good things. He has that breakdown ability. He's not
afraid of the moment, even at Wichita last week, and they absolutely handled
us. He was the one guy out there that was trying to lead and be a point guard.
So I think he's got a very bright future.  
  
Q. Just kind of a brief overview of what you need to do tomorrow against
Wichita State.  
COACH LUSK: Well, what we needed to do was win today to get the opportunity.
Now it's just another opportunity.  
They've handled us. They could have named the score a week ago. So we're going
to have to try to guard them. You've got to be smart when you drive the
basketball. They're so good at the rim. I watched a little bit of the
Evansville game today. They had a million blocked shots.  
They're just really good. They don't beat themselves either. If you're going
to have a chance, you've got to‑‑ you've got to match their toughness, and
then you also got to match their wits because they're a smart basketball team.  
It will be a monumental challenge, but it's one that we're looking forward to.  
  
Q. Paul, you talked a little bit about Austin. A lot of times, especially
the first time on this big stage, guys get a little nervous. Why was he able
to just kind of put all that out of his mind?  
COACH LUSK: Just when I recruited him, I just‑‑ he's got that "it." He
doesn't‑‑ he's not afraid of the moment. He's done it all year for us. And I
think he'll continue to get better and work on areas in his game, there's no
doubt about it.  
But he just never seems to be afraid of the big stage, and he's had some very
big moments for us this year. And then especially when Marcus went down
because I think he complements Marcus well, and I think Marcus will make his
job easier as well to have another perimeter guy out there.  
But really an unbelievable effort for a freshman. It's a heck of an effort
from a freshman on that stage.  
And then like I said, I thought Devon Thomas was really good for a freshman.
The guy that's not getting talked about a lot was Christian Kirk. I thought he
had a very good day. He had six points and five rebounds, three blocked shots.  
Ron came in and did some good things. Ron really rebounded, but he struggled
to make a shot. We're going to need all those parts if we're going to continue
to play in March. Everybody's got to step up at different times.  
  
Q. Coach, what's the importance of this win for your program?  
COACH LUSK: Well, I mean, we're‑‑ we've come a long way. And it's been a slow
process. We're certainly not where we need to be.  
But I'll go back to talking about those first two high school classes we've
taken. Obviously, Marcus is out of the mix, but this next high school class
with Tyler, Devon, and Austin, those guys are going to be the core of what
we're trying to do moving forward.  
Pleased with our guys. They could have hung their head all year with some of
the injuries. Pick's been gone a lot. Obviously, Marcus was hurt, came back
and got hurt. I think we're moving forward.  
We're certainly not where we need to be. Guys need to continue to get better,
but very pleased with this season and with where we're at. It's been a big
jump from last year. Felt like last year was going to take some time, there's
no doubt about it, playing all those young guys, and then with Jarmar going
out.  
I think we're headed in the right direction, but we've still got a lot of work
to do.  
THE MODERATOR: Paul, thanks very much.

### [Desmar Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20603)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Southern Illinois  63  
UNI  58

  
THE MODERATOR: As advertised, the victorious Salukis are with us. They have a
date with Indiana State in tomorrow's semifinal. Desmar Jackson and Anthony
Beane represent the student body.  
We're going to ask Coach Barry Hinson to start off with a statement.  
COACH HINSON: Missouri Valley Conference basketball, I mean, that's it. I had
no visions of grandeur at halftime. I just knew it would come down to the
wire. I'm not going to tell our players that, but I've just been in this
tournament, I've been in here a long time. This is my 11th. I knew the guy on
the other bench, I knew they would do something spectacular. They went to the
triangle and two, what a great move by Ben, and they got back into the game.
But one thing they never did is they never took the lead.  
We felt it was important for us to get off to a good start. Guys, I've been in
this tournament a lot. That's the best first half of basketball that I've ever
coached a group of young men, and I told them that. We've just got to find a
way to not make it so interesting.  
But Des kept coming in the time‑out and saying they need ratings for the
Missouri Valley tourney, let's turn it over some more. Isn't that what you
said?  
DESMAR JACKSON: Yeah.  
COACH HINSON: And then Anthony said, "No, Des, I'll turn it over." All right.
I'll let you guys ask questions.  
  
Q. Desmar, how much were you feeling it there right from the opening tip?  
DESMAR JACKSON: I was feeling pretty good in the first half. I hit my first
shot. That's always good. That got me going right there.  
  
Q. Desmar, can you just talk about the save, the ball that was going out of
bounds? You never quit on it and got it back into bounds and just happened to
see Anthony. Did you see Anthony, or were you just trying to keep the ball in
bounds?  
DESMAR JACKSON: I really didn't see Anthony. I was trying to knock the ball
off the guy who was guarding me. It barely missed him, and it was right there,
luckily.  
COACH HINSON: I would agree with that, luckily.  
  
Q. If both of you guys could just talk about ‑‑ you both had great games,
but Bola had some great plays for you and Tyler had some great plays for you
to help seal the win. How happy were you to see them come through in their
first tournament game?   
ANTHONY BEANE: I thought it was good because last time we played Northern
Iowa, Bola didn't have one of his best games. You could tell right before the
game he was focused. He came out, and it was a lot different than at their
place. He was the Bola we were used to. He was getting rebounds, putbacks, and
things like that. That was just Bola being Bola.  
And, of course, I knew Tyler would be good. He's a super freshman, and he
makes plays like that.  
  
Q. Question regarding Bola?  
DESMAR JACKSON: He's a big factor for us because he hit the glass real hard.
If he can get offensive rebounds and putbacks, you know, we definitely need
him to play a good game for us to win, I feel like.  
Tyler, you know, he's got a big heart, man. If he's open, he's not going to
think twice about shooting a three‑pointer, or he's not going to think twice
at all about driving or anything. He's a big‑time player.  
  
Q. Coach says every week he's always asking, "Is this the turning point?"
What do you do players think? Do you think it's the turning point in your
season?   
DESMAR JACKSON: Is this a turning point? Yeah, I definitely feel like we
turned a corner. Last year we played on Thursday. We played on Friday this
year. This year we won a Friday game. So that's big. I don't think that's been
done in like a few years.  
So this definitely could be the turning point. We've just got to keep it up.  
ANTHONY BEANE: Just like Des said, I think it's a turning point with all the
things we've done this year. Of course, being able to play on Friday, that's a
big deal and winning the game. But I still think we could play a little
better, just like come out in the second half and play a little better and
just take it one game at a time.  
  
Q. Anthony, this is for you. Des had a really good first half, and then
started struggling in the second half as they kind of tightened up the
defense. Did you kind of go into the second half trying to be like the second
guy to Des scoring?  
ANTHONY BEANE: No, not really. It was still the same because Des was hot. My
plan was to just keep giving him the ball because he was knocking down shots.  
After that, when they went to the triangle and two, I thought they got to us a
little bit, but we were able to fight through it. And like Coach said, Tyler
and Bola stepped up and got big shots and kept us in the game.  
  
Q. Anthony, talk a little bit ‑‑ it looked defensively like you guys
attacked more on the perimeter than maybe you did a couple weeks ago when you
played Northern Iowa, cutting off the passes, not giving good looks. Is that
correct?   
ANTHONY BEANE: That was part of our game plan. And coming in and guarding
Tuttle. Tuttle is a great player. We wanted to make sure we're clogging up the
lane for Tuttle because he's so good around the basket. I thought we did a
great job on the perimeter and on the post.  
  
Q. Both players, UNI made ten threes, I think, in their last three games.
They're 4 of 22 tonight. How much of that was them? How much of that was you?
Des, you first, please.  
DESMAR JACKSON: We know that they're known for shooting threes. We definitely
talked about them. But we knew they're a big three‑point team. We definitely
had a big focus on that, and we had a big focus on Tuttle to just dig on him
just to make it tough on him because he played great the first two times we
played him.  
He actually played good today. He had 17 rebounds and 15 points.  
  
Q. Des, can you just talk about your 11 rebounds. It seemed like for most of
the first half, you were trying to go for every rebound, it appeared.  
DESMAR JACKSON: I was right by the ball. I just wanted to put the effort in to
go up and get it. We need every rebound, so I was just trying to go get the
rebounds.  
  
Q. Anthony, what was the feeling like for you guys when UNI was eating back
away at that lead you had and finally got it back to a tie game?  
ANTHONY BEANE: I thought that what was great about our team, we just stayed
together when they started going on their runs. When we went into the
time‑out, all the guys‑‑ nobody was down. Everybody was together. We were all
together talking to each other, telling them to keep their heads up and most
importantly just keep getting stops. We felt we got the stops in the game that
kept us in the game, and we came down and delivered on offense.  
  
Q. Des, what was that exchange with you and Davante in the first half when
Tuttle got two or three offensive rebounds and then scored?  
DESMAR JACKSON: That was just teammate talk. Me and Te bump heads a bit, but
it's all love on the court. I just want Te to grab every rebound, so I just
tell him, "Te, I think you should have got that rebound."  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, we thank you for your time. We'll stay with Coach
Hinson for a while longer.  
  
Q. Coach, these two guys went, I think, 15, maybe 16 minutes in the second
half without scoring. Just how difficult is it for you guys when they're not
getting anything? What's your confidence level in the rest of your guys?  
COACH HINSON: Well, I go back what I said earlier, Ben and his staff, we knew
they would make some adjustment. We didn't know it would be the triangle and
two. We've seen it. Guys, if you remember right, we missed some really good
and easy shots, and then we got tight. Certainly, when you get tight, you
don't do very well.  
Tyler Smithpeters is a phenomenal shooter, and he didn't shoot the ball
tonight very well. I anticipate‑‑ we told Tyler all along, "Keep shooting it."  
I do believe this. I think in tournament play you always have one game that
you really don't play as well as what you would like, and you got to get that
out of your system. And I think for us in the second half, hopefully, we got
that out of our system.  
But give them the credit, Stu. They did what two guys are out there, but in
all honesty, when it came right down to it, Tyler made free throws, Michael
made a huge basket, Bola got a huge rebound and a putback and made the free
throw. And the best part of that was two of those guys are ninth graders‑‑ I
mean, they're freshmen. And that just makes it that much better that those
guys got that experience today.  
  
Q. What does this win mean for the time right now? Not just for the team
right now, but for the season as a whole. You've all had a lot of ups and
downs. What does this mean?  
COACH HINSON: I think the question should be what does it mean to our fans?
We've had a big drought. It's 2007 since we've been in the semis. We've had
issues off the court. We've had issues socially. We've had major issues
academically. We've had issues basketball. We've had issues with travel. We've
had issues with a short head coach that ran his mouth at Murray State.  
The question was asked tonight, have we turned the corner? I think Saluki
basketball is trying to turn the corner. I'm not going to get overly
optimistic because, to me, you just got to find a way to continue to get
better. But we've got a young team, and Des certainly played like a senior
today, and I thought Davante played like a senior, and that was big for us.  
I think the question should be asked of our fans, what does this mean to them?
Because they're absolutely, besides our players, they're the most important
thing.  
  
Q. Coach, Des was basically a nonfactor throughout most of the second half.
He only had three points, picked up four fouls. Did you adjust your strategy a
little bit when it looked like he wasn't playing to the level he was playing
in the first half?  
COACH HINSON: Well, I'm going to disagree with the nonfactor because those
guys got wide open shots because they were face guarding Des. If Des isn't on
the floor, we probably don't get the shots we would have gotten. We didn't
make. We had good open looks, and we just didn't make them.  
But did we make an adjustment? You know, we made what we thought were a few
adjustments, and we felt like, if we could ever get into the one and ones,
which it seemed like an eternity, From Here to Eternity‑‑ it's a great movie,
but it's also a lot to deal with when you're a basketball coach waiting to get
in the one and ones.  
My staff, my assistants were just, "Talk to the officials. Talk to the
officials. You need to talk to the officials." I said, "I don't need to talk
to the officials. I know every one of them. I don't need to introduce myself."
I'm trying to have jokes over there with the guys. I've got to get my staff to
relax a little bit. Normally, it's me, but it wasn't. It was those guys
tonight.  
  
Q. Barry, can you talk about the matchup tomorrow with Indiana State and
also your team entering a new stage at this point.  
COACH HINSON: It's a big stage for us. It's not a new stage for Indiana State.
Classic game, great coach, good players, the poster boy for Amish basketball,
Jake Odum, my favorite player in the league. I love that kid. I love him.  
I know‑‑ I've watched him play the last five or six games. They played really
well today. They played great‑‑ the Indiana State that I know of played today,
and it's going to be a heck of a ball game. We're going to really have to play
well. And we've got three guys that played 38, 39, 39, and we've got to make
sure we get them rest.  
  
Q. Rewinding just a little bit, game's close, Panthers are right on you, and
then you see a full court heavy going down the court to Anthony Beane. What's
on your mind there?  
COACH HINSON: What's what like? Oh, when that pass was made?  
  
Q. Yeah. Scared the heck out of me. I had a camera roll right where the ball
was going.  
COACH HINSON: You remember Bill Cosby, "Don't check my underwear." Hey, guys,
I'll tell you what this game was about to us. To me, it summed up real easily.
We had to guard, and we made our minds up, we made our minds up that we were
going to make Tuttle beat us or that's it. We told our players all along
Bohannon and Buss and Morgan cannot beat us from the three, just can't do it.  
I've watched Ben's teams, Gregg's teams over the year, you can't let those
guys‑‑ I knew Tuttle would have a big night coming in, but we harassed him. We
made him work for everything he got. He got seven offensive rebounds right
there in front of our bench one time on one possession because Davante, he was
at the concession stand.  
But it was a game we made our mind up that they had to beat us inside and not
from the arc. Normally, it's the other way around, but that was our whole
intent. We had to guard on the perimeter, and we had to guard those guys,
specifically Bohannon and Buss and Morgan. That was our big deal.  
  
Q. Jeff Early did not have a great game here last season. When did you know
that Jackson was tuned in here tonight?  
COACH HINSON: He made his first shot. The way he made it, it wasn't a great
shot. We talked about coming out of the locker room, we said, "Okay, let's get
it to the third and fourth side first possession." Because we never win the
tip ever. God, we were surprised we won the tip. It's like a lottery bet at
Vegas. Gosh, we're never going to win the tip.  
We won the tip. Let's get and shoot it and Des took two dribbles and he made
it. I looked at Thomas, God, I'm glad I worked all week trying to get that
ball to the third and fourth side. It really worked well for us. And Tom goes,
"Leave him alone." I said, "Okay." That's good coaching. Get out of his way
and let him play.  
Okay, guys. Thanks for coming.

# [MISSOURI VALLEY CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2014

  

### [D.J. Balentine](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26489)

### [Marty Simmons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20513)

### [Adam Wing](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26515)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Wichita State  80  
Evansville  58

  
THE MODERATOR: Evansville Aces are here, D.J. Balentine, Adam Wing, and Marty
Simmons, the head coach. We're going to ask Coach Simmons for a statement on
the game and then have questions for just the two student‑athletes.  
COACH SIMMONS: Proud of our guys. Thought we battled. It's like we talked
about yesterday. I mean, they're a difficult team to play against. You've got
to take care of the basketball. They did a good job of knocking it loose.
They're so physically strong, and they play so, so hard. I mean, they're just
a very difficult team to play against. We certainly wish them good luck.  
  
Q. D.J., cramps, groin, what did you ‑‑  
D.J. BALENTINE: A hip pointer is what they told me.  
  
Q. You didn't get to the free throw as much as you like, but did you ‑‑ you
pretty well got through those. Were they just fighting through those screens
to stay with you, stay guarding?   
D.J. BALENTINE: They do a great job of packing the defense in, and also Tekele
is a terrific defender, and he knows how to let me get easy shots getting
going at the free‑throw line.  
I think they did a really good job of packing the paint so I couldn't get to
the line to get fouled.  
  
Q. Adam, you spent a lot of time in the paint. So did a lot of their
defenders. What were they doing specifically that was making it so difficult
for you guys in the middle?  
ADAM WING: I didn't hear the last part of the question.  
  
Q. What were they doing defensively to make it so difficult for you guys in
the paint?  
ADAM WING: They've got a bunch of big guys. I know their coaches are teaching
them to crash every single time. Part of that is we're a little undersized in
the post there. That's not an excuse. We just didn't get the job done.  
  
Q. D.J., was that an injury you had coming in or just something you hurt?  
D.J. BALENTINE: Just happened when I drove into the lane.  
  
Q. You got knocked down?  
D.J. BALENTINE: Yes.  
  
Q. D.J., obviously, 31 points is a big night for you, but you kind of went
quiet there in the second half. What did they do defensively on you there?  
D.J. BALENTINE: I don't know. It wasn't much different in the first half. I
just should have started aggressively like I'd been doing the first half. They
kind of went to a full court press, which they tried to slow the game down,
and other guys had other opportunities to score.  
So it was just nothing really much different.  
  
Q. Given that you play NCAA basketball and you know how hard it is to win,
just could you comment a little bit on what it is that you've seen Wichita
State accomplish and how difficult that must be, as you see from your
perspective, what it is that they've done.  
ADAM WING: Wichita State, they're a great team. Everybody knows what they do
well. We knew we had our hands full coming into it. I was just trying to play
hard, win each four‑minute segment at a time. Unfortunately, we didn't get it
done.  
D.J. BALENTINE: Fantastic, fantastic to see what they're doing right now.
They're a team of history. They're 32‑0 right now. They're, if not the best
team out there‑‑ if people say they don't deserve the Number 1 seed going into
the NCAA Tournament, I think that's silly. They really deserve it. Very good
team.  
  
Q. D.J., with the shot blockers that they've got back there, does that allow
their perimeter defenders to be more aggressive, knowing they've got a lot of
help behind them?  
D.J. BALENTINE: Definitely. With Coleby, Lufile down there, they're just
extremely talented, great shot blockers. When they pressure up top, that
allows them‑‑ if we do drive by them, they have a second defender down there
just continuing‑‑ it's kind of like what Egidijus does for us, but they have
two or three down there that can do it. So it makes it difficult.  
  
Q. Adam, what do you tell the guys in the locker room after a loss like
this?  
ADAM WING: We know we had a goal set out before the season, of course, to win
an MVC championship. We didn't get that done. There's several areas that each
individual player can improve on, starting with myself.  
So really just trying to take as much positive out of the season as we can. We
ended the season extremely well on a three‑game win streak. That's a positive
to key on.  
But just overall, the level of the physicality play. We were kind of outmanned
in a sense. We just got to continue to get stronger. I feel like over time it
will happen, and then the next year will be‑‑ we'll see what happens.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you for your time. We're going to stay here
with Coach Simmons a while longer.  
  
Q. Coach, can you expound a little bit on Wichita State's ability
offensively, just how physical they are. Not just at the back end, but all
five guys that are very good in front of the ball and just the challenges that
that gives a team just trying to get into your stuff.  
COACH SIMMONS: Yeah, it's difficult. I mean, they're out there. You saw, it's
hard. It's hard to make passes just from A to B. They contest every pass on
the catch. They do a great job of pressuring. They'll play off certain guys to
take things away. I mean, they're very well coached.  
You can get lost with how talented‑‑ I mean, they're very well coached, and
then it forces you to get out of what you're normally doing a little bit and
really being in the attack mode. We drove the ball, I thought, quite a bit,
but then they're so big and athletic at the rim that they challenge shots and
we didn't make the best decisions there as far as extra passes or shot fakes
at the rim.  
I mean, they play as hard as anybody that we've competed against. I mean,
they're as good as anybody we've played defensively.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you mentioned protecting the ball would be a huge key
today. What's your assessment of how the team did today?  
COACH SIMMONS: Not good. I mean, it certainly could have been worse. I think
we had 12 turnovers, and they got 17 points off our turnovers. We just weren't
very sharp.  
Give them credit. They accelerate. We knew it. We scouted it. We watched tape.
They did a lot of that in our home game. We just‑‑ we got to get better. We
got to get stronger. We've got to pass and catch better. Our ball handling has
got to get better.  
Both individually and as a team, we've got to be more aggressive against an
attacking, aggressive defense like Wichita State plays. And I think we will. I
think our guys learned a lot today. I mean, how could you not?  
We didn't get the result that we wanted, but we certainly can move to the
off‑season knowing areas that we have to really focus on to get better.  
  
Q. Coach, is it their length? Is it their depth? Is it their experience? If
you had to go, the essence of why they are 32 ‑0, what is it?   
COACH SIMMONS: They're very talented, number one, but honestly, they play
hard. I mean, they challenge every catch, and they guard the ball‑‑ I mean,
they are‑‑ they play‑‑ I mean, their intensity level is outstanding. And then
you add the length that they have at the rim, I think it was a question to one
of the players, does it make them pressure you? I think they pressure that
much anyway. Those three guards are as good as any three guards, I think. I
haven't seen every team play, but they're that good.  
They just get you out of your comfort zone. But I just think it's probably all
of the above, if you want to know the truth. I mean, I'm probably not
answering your question. They're very good, very good.  
  
Q. Coach, how good are their big men under the boards?  
COACH SIMMONS: How good are their big men? They're good. They're good. They're
very active. They've got three guys they can interchange in there. They're all
big, strong, long athletic guys. They go. They go every time.  
And the thing that makes it even more difficult is the way they run offense. A
lot of times with the ball screens, you got your bigs helping on the
penetration, so now it's a perimeter guy that's got to rotate and block out
one of those big guys. We just didn't do a very good job with that.  
  
Q. Marty, I think the Valley coaches have been gracious all season talking
about how good Wichita State is. But like you've been quick to say, making the
point, it's not just talent, it's how they play. Why are coaches so quick to
bring up that part, that it's not just a physical or a talent thing about how
well they play?  
COACH SIMMONS: They're set up. They're very disciplined in everything they do.
Their presses‑‑ I mean, you watch them. They're fundamentally sound. They're
active with their hands, their rotations. They're well schooled. They're well
taught.  
You look at how they run offense, they don't beat themselves. They don't turn
the basketball over. They're very disciplined on the offense. They share the
basketball. They're very talented, but they share it. They make the extras
passes. They do all the little things that maybe you might see a lesser
talented team do. I think they do all those things.  
I think that's what makes them even more special.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Wichita State  80  
Evansville  58

  
THE MODERATOR: Fred Van Vleet, Ron Baker and Cleanthony Early represent the
Shockers on the floor. Head Coach Gregg Marshall is here. Number 1 seeded
Shockers will play in the semifinals tomorrow.  
Going to ask Coach Marshall to give a statement on the game. Then we'll go to
questions for just the three student‑athletes.  
COACH MARSHALL: I thought, once we got Balentine to miss a couple shots, we
were in much better shape. He was incredible. We started getting some loose
balls and some steals about midway through the first half, which helped us get
the ten‑point lead at halftime and then great lock‑down defense in the second
half. Just proud to be moving on.  
  
Q. Fred, can you talk about the back side defense at the rim and how much
that helps you guys out front when you've got those shot blockers behind you,
11 of them today, new tournament record. How much easier does it make your job
defensively with those guys back there?  
FRED VAN VLEET: It makes it very easy. For the defense, we want to play
against them. They're a rhythm team. So we want to extend our pressure and
disrupt their rhythm a little bit. The counter to that for them is just to
drop the ball and attack us right at the point of attack.  
Having Kadeem back there and C.J. really helped tonight especially, and it's
been that way all season when we want to extend pressure. Got to have some
erasers back there.  
  
Q. Are you born to be an unselfish basketball player, or is that something
that's instilled in you as you ‑‑ over time coached into you?  
RON BAKER: For me, that's kind of just how I was raised, unselfish individual.
When I got here, that's what we're all about. I don't know if it was luck or
destiny or whatever you want to call it. This team is very unselfish. If we
continue to play like that, I like our chances.  
FRED VAN VLEET: I think it has to be in your nature a little bit. Like I said,
he was raised that way. Then when you get a group of guys together that are
all unselfish, it's contagious.  
Maybe if not all 15 are, maybe if you have 10, it will carry over to the rest
of the 5. I'm not saying that's how it is for us, but everybody's that way,
and it's contagious, and it just breeds more unselfishness.  
CLEANTHONY EARLY: I think both my teammates hit the pin on the head when they
said it has to be in your nature a little bit. I think I'm a scorer, but I
love to see my teammates do good. We all feel the same way. We want to watch
each other prosper and do good for the team. So we go out there and make it
happen.  
  
Q. For any of the players, I know that this is the first time I've had a
chance to see you guys and talk to you, the whole streak, the record, is the
focus at all being taken away by all that stuff, or is it still just one game
at a time when you guys go out to play? How's the focus been as each game has
progressed?  
RON BAKER: As far as like our streak, as far as being 32‑0, when we got to St.
Louis, that 31‑0 is out the door. We wanted to focus on this weekend one game
at a time, just like we have all season. Our objective, just like any other
team here, is to win on Sunday. But we've got to go one day at a time.  
FRED VAN VLEET: I think Ron said it perfectly. Our new streak is 1‑0\. One and
done. Now we got one. Can't get to three without getting two, so that's what
our focus is, and we'll try to get that one tomorrow.  
  
Q. Fred, looks like you got banged up, a little bit slow getting up at one
point in time. What transpired there, and how are you feeling?  
FRED VAN VLEET: I think I just tried to get a rebound or a loose ball and just
fell straight on my back, but I'm fine.  
  
Q. For any three of you guys, you guys get so many and ‑ones. Do you guys
practice that in practice or‑‑ I mean, that's a huge key to the game today,
just how many and‑ones you got, Fred, with your three there when you fell
back.   
CLEANTHONY EARLY: We don't get any foul calls in practice. It's like I'm
trying to make the basket regardless because I feel like I might not get the
foul call. Sometimes you get lucky and you get the foul call and the ball goes
in the basket, and we're just happy for that.  
COACH MARSHALL: There's not a line item for referees in our practice in our
budget.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, gentlemen. Thank you very much. We'll dismiss you.
We'll stay here with Coach Marshall.  
  
Q. Coach, starting in the last couple of games of the regular season and
now, do you ‑‑ have you felt a more intense sort of national media glare? And
if you have, has it mattered at all to your players, or are you able to sort
of not think about that?   
COACH MARSHALL: You know, it's been like that for a month or six weeks. It
hasn't just been the last couple of weeks. I think you can tell by these guys
that just left. I mean, they're very stoic. They're very matter of fact.
They're very steadfast in what they want to accomplish. Just I don't think
it's affected them that much at all. I really don't.  
  
Q. With all the success you've had, never a player who's averaged 15 points.
The last guy to shoot 20 shots in a game, that was three years ago. Is that ‑‑
as I asked the players, is that instilled in them by you, or are they just
naturally unselfish like that?   
COACH MARSHALL: I think they're unselfish. I don't tell good players to pass
on good shots. We share the basketball. When it's your turn to shoot and
you're open, I want you to shoot it. In fact, I get upset with them when they
don't.  
I don't‑‑ but I think they've got character for sure, and we've talked about
this before, but maybe they sacrifice a little bit individually for the
overall good, but at this point, who's to argue when everybody's not getting
their just rewards.  
  
Q. Coach, how huge have your fans been backing your team up?  
COACH MARSHALL: We have an unbelievable fan base. You see how many Shocker
fans are out there. Shocker Nation has always traveled well. We went to Maui a
couple years ago. Other than Kentucky, which undoubtedly travels the best, and
perhaps Michigan State‑‑ getting out of Michigan during the winter is somewhat
like getting out of Wichita. These folks really travel well.  
We go to Maui with several hundred, probably 300 or 400. The Cats had a couple
of thousand and Michigan State was the same. After that, everyone else was
less than a hundred. This crowd out here was incredible. They were loud. They
were really loud.  
They were loud last night. It was the play‑in game or whatever you call that
Thursday first‑round game. They were loud then.  
And I'm sure there are people in their cars right now driving to get here for
tomorrow. These fans are unbelievable, and they deserve this type of run that
we've had because they've been there.  
Bob wrote a great article or piece with some of the other Eagle writers about
the decades they've gone through at Wichita State, and the '90s weren't great
at all. In fact, they were bad. And Mark Turgeon got it going back in 2000.  
They've stuck with us through thick and thin. They were there my first year
when we weren't very good.  
  
Q. Gregg, you used the term "lockdown defensive effort" in the second half.
Can you expound on that a little bit? It seemed like all five guys were really
playing extremely well together, but in particular, those guys in the back
were erasing everything.   
COACH MARSHALL: Yeah, Kadeem Coleby was tremendous at the back line. He didn't
even play 20 minutes, and he blocked six shots. He's really getting his timing
down. At one point in the year, he was a little awkward with his timing. He
was fouling. It was cumbersome. He did not look fluid. Now he looks really
good back there as a deterrent.  
I think Cotton was really good. You've got to give D.J. Balentine credit. He
hit some incredible shots. When you can score with the defense he was seeing
tonight, you can score. He's a big‑time scorer. He's only going to get better.
I'm not looking forward to that. But I thought we defended real well all
night.  
  
Q. Partly answered the question about the defense against Balentine. Was
part of the plan to keep Balentine off the line? Cotton was talking, when he
gets in the line, he really gets going.  
COACH MARSHALL: Big point for us to keep Balentine off the line. He goes 14
times last night. He scored 30. He's averaging 30 1/2 points in the
tournament. At least we held him to six free throws, and that's a key, and it
should be a key because he gets so much focus, and he scores a lot of points.  
We didn't want to go for the shot fakes. They're a team that really likes to
use head and shot fakes. I just thought we did a good job on him. Again, he
gets credit for being a great scorer because he scored through and over that
defense.  
  
Q. Gregg, I would imagine, just by your job description, you have to
nitpick, even though you guys are winning all the time. But what satisfies you
from game to game about this team? What is it that they do that you go, "Okay,
I'm happy with that"?   
COACH MARSHALL: It's a great point, Ron. We actually pick our spots to nitpick
and get after them. In the last three weeks, there's been at least one video
session that was not real pleasant.  
But I don't do it every game when they're feeling so good about themselves. We
certainly talk to them during the game. We coach them during the game. My
assistant coaches are getting on them and encourage them when they do well and
telling them what they don't do well. You really don't need a whole lot of
video study because they get coached in the moment.  
But we do that from time to time. I love how this team goes about their
business and their approach, how it's just‑‑ how resolute they are in just
next challenge, let's get the game plan. How do you guys want us to defend
this screen, this cut, and they just do it. They're really, really focused and
locked in with the next challenge, and that's how you win 32 in a row.  
I mean, I don't care what league you're in, it's hard to do, especially when
you go on the road. Those other teams want to win, they want to party, and
they want to get it going. They want to court storm.  
But they've not allowed that thus far.  
  
Q. You mentioned you want to keep D.J. out of the line. Whose task was it to
keep him out of the paint?  
COACH MARSHALL: Mostly Tekele Cotton. Tekele gets the yeoman's majority of
that work. But I thought Ron Baker did it well at times. Evan Wessel did it
well at times. You can't have one guy guard him. He played 39 minutes a game.  
And I don't know what happened to him. I asked him after the game if he was
okay, and he assured me that he was, because I've got a lot of respect for
him. It looked like he was cramping. I hope it wasn't a sprained ankle or a
knee. It looked like he was cramping. To play the way he played for that long,
you'd be super human not to cramp.  
So we ran fresh bodies at him, and maybe that had an effect. He could have
gone for 40.  
  
Q. How is the personality and identity of this team different from last
year's Final Four team?  
COACH MARSHALL: I think just a little more focused, a little more steadfast.
Last year's team was a little more tougher physically. This team scores it
better. But last year's team, especially‑‑ and this could be part of the
problem with the personnel because Ron Baker was out for 21 games. Carl Hall
was out for seven games. When you don't have those guys, you're not quite as
good a coach.  
There were some nights, even against Evansville last year, when we didn't play
well. This year's team has stayed healthy, and we have a great focus and
mindset of the next game, the next challenge.  
  
Q. I know you don't know who you're playing yet tomorrow, but if it's
Illinois State, what's some of the keys against them just based on the first
two times you played them?  
COACH MARSHALL: Illinois State, if we play them, you've got to beat their
pressure, and you've got to play against a zone. You've got to attack the zone
well inside out. You've just got to guard them. They've got a lot of guys that
can score. They're a little more balanced than Evansville.  
So just got to guard them. Got to kind of keep them out of rhythm. Hopefully,
they don't shoot it quite as well as D.J. did tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Gregg, thank you very much.
