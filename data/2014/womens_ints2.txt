_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

LSU  76  
West Virginia  67

  
MIKE CAREY: First of all, congratulations to LSU. I told our players for two
days, the game is going to be won or lost in the paint. You can't give up 24
offensive rebounds. We quit getting the ball inside, and we had it going the
second half, got the lead, and quit going inside. You know, but I'm proud of
our players. They had a heck of a year, won 30 basketball games. We felt like
we gave one away here today. But congratulations to LSU.  
  
Q. I know that obviously 40 minutes is what you guys preached your entire
year, but those four minutes at the end is when Coach Carey said he wanted you
to the in the game. What went wrong in those Final Four minutes that you
allowed the lead to go away and lose the game?  
ASYA BUSSIE: I think we lost our focus. We weren't defending the way we were
and not executing the way that we were to get into the game. I just think down
the stretch we didn't do the things that we were supposed to do.  
  
Q. Obviously the people that you probably scouted to play were absent a
large part of the game, Shanece, Theresa and Jeanne. Did that in any way
affect your preparation?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: I don't think so, regardless of who was on the floor we
should have defended. We've seen different things all year long so I don't
think anything they put at us was anything different, we just stopped
defending and we stopped boxing out on the boards.  
BRIA HOLMES: Like Christal said, I think we just should have stepped up and
playing defense and boxed out and not allowed the offensive rebounds that they
had.  
  
Q. Asya, Ballard had 32 rebounds in the two NCAA tournament games this year.
Have you ever played against a guard her size who was able to rebound like
that?  
ASYA BUSSIE: Not that I can remember, but she did get a lot of rebounds, ones
that we should have had, and I think that might have been the difference in
the game, just having the guards coming in and crashing not only the post,
their guards were coming in, also.  
  
Q. A lot was made of having to play LSU on their home floor as a 2 seed. How
much of a difference do you think it made, especially late in the game as the
crowd was really getting into it?  
ASYA BUSSIE: Regardless of where we play, we just have to play our game and
execute and defend, and down the stretch we didn't do that, and I think that
towards the end the crowd did get into the game and hyped the players up, and
that might have been a factor, also.  
  
Q. Christal, talk about as a senior what was it like to go back into the
locker room as a senior? What is this moment like for you?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: I hate it. Just to know that we lost the game‑‑ you're
going to lose some ballgames, but I know just deep down in my heart that we
did not play our best game and we did not do some of the things I've seen us
do all year long that I know that we can do, and just to go out like that, it
really hurts.  
But at the same time we've done really well this year, and we've had some
great accomplishments, so you can't get down on yourself too much. Right now
it's still fresh, and it hurts.  
ASYA BUSSIE: Same. This game really hurts. We definitely didn't want to lose
like this. We planned on going a lot further than this. But regardless, I'm
really proud of the team and everything we've accomplished this year.  
  
Q. Christal, you were shooting something like 3 of 18 or 19 or something
like that. Is it an off ‑night, or were they doing something to help that out?
  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: I just didn't hit shots, and I feel like I rushed a couple,
probably took some bad shots. But at the end of the day I just didn't make
them.  
  
Q. Coach, they were talking about the defensive effort, but I'm saying the
last three minutes you guys went almost without a score at any point. What
were they doing defensively to stop your offense?  
MIKE CAREY: We took some bad shots. When we took the lead and went up by I
think six or seven, we were getting the ball inside, and then all of a sudden
we turned it over some and we took some bad perimeter shots, and we weren't
hitting them. And then the turnovers. We had turnovers off our foot and stuff
like that, and then I think when it started down there, that one possession,
they were down there for‑‑ I think we had two fouls and they got two offensive
rebounds, and I think they were down there until they finally scored.  
We just quit rebounding. We went to a zone. We just quit rebounding. And then
on the offensive end, we were having success going inside, and it's hard to
tell some of your good players that are wide open on the perimeter not to take
the shot. They've hit them all year, and we just didn't hit shots, but again,
we've got to be smart enough to go inside. Asya was just dominating inside the
second half.  
  
Q. Similarly to what I just asked Asya, those final four minutes, you guys
had talked about that coming into this one. Was it as simple as getting away
from what was working with Asya doing so well on the inside, getting fouls,
getting to the free ‑throw line?   
MIKE CAREY: Well, I think we got away from getting the ball inside on the
offensive end, and on the defensive end we quit boxing out. It was as simple
as that. We started fouling and putting them at the foul line and not boxing
out and giving them second and third shots. They got a couple and‑ones. It
just kept going. We just didn't box out. It's obvious, they had 24 offensive
rebounds. It's hard to beat somebody. And then they had 38 points in the
paint. I mean, I said coming in two days ago, the game was going to be won or
lost in the paint, and that's exactly where it was.  
  
Q. And regarding the seniors, just how difficult it is to see them go out?  
MIKE CAREY: Yeah, it's tough right now because I feel we gave one away there.
And again, give LSU‑‑ nothing against LSU, they deserve a lot of credit. But I
just felt we gave one away. Seniors have done a great job since they've been‑‑
not just this year, since they've been here. So I'm very proud of them, it's
just tough right now for them and myself.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

LSU  76  
West Virginia  67

  
NIKKI CALDWELL: This is one of those moments that as a fan and a coach, a
spectator, that you honestly can say this is one of the hardest fought games
between two very good teams, and a lot of credit to West Virginia for really
pushing the envelope as far as pushing us to our limits, and a lot of credit
to these young ladies for answering that call.  
You know, we give out a game ball and I want to give one to every our of
games, but the game ball obviously went to Jasmine Rhodes. I can't say enough
about when you have a player step up and make huge contributions, and Jasmine
did that for us tonight.  
  
Q. Danielle, would you say you played your two best games of the season here
in the NCAA Tournament? You had 46 points and 32 rebounds combined in the two
games. How much did you feel like you had to carry the team with Jeanne hurt
and Theresa and Shanece in foul trouble?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: Well, I felt like since Jeanne was out, I felt like that we
as a team had to step up, especially me being one of the scorers on the team.
I felt like I needed to get to the hole or just get a wide‑open shot for my
teammates. There was a lot of pressure, a little bit, because I'm used to
having Jeanne talking a lot on the court and just directing us in offense and
defense. It was kind of tough, but we played through it.  
  
Q. Theresa, what was going through your head when you got the fourth foul? I
mean, honestly were you at all worried or upset knowing that this was your
last home game and possibly your last game ever?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: What was going through my head was that if I really wanted
to get a foul, I would actually make them pay for the foul and not have little
ticky‑tack fouls.  
Going in, I haven't really been a player that fouled much and I got into foul
trouble and so did Shanece, but I wasn't really worried. There was a sense of
calmness going through our bench. We just had stability. We weren't the
biggest lineup out there, but those are some of the girls that fight the
hardest, and we had a lot of people step up. Jas did a great job the second
she got in. I get a deflection, Jas grabs it and takes it the full length of
the court for a bucket. That was a very quick turnaround play. We just have a
lot of great team camaraderie. I wasn't worried. I was disappointed in myself
for not being able to contribute more, but my teammates did a great job
tonight, especially Danielle Ballard stepping up to the challenge and being
Danielle Ballard, doing what she does best.  
  
Q. Danielle, seemed like there was a little bit of frustration when West
Virginia took a lead late. How did you overcome that?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: Yes, we were just saying like stay together, don't get
discouraged, just play hard, keep playing hard, keep trying to rebound and do
all the little things. We tried to have energy, talked about energy, because
at first we saw that we didn't have energy on the court because our back was
against the wall. But in the huddle we were saying some positive things.
That's what got us going.  
  
Q. Jas, is this one of the situations where you're just kind of too young to
really know what's at stake? You were really selling out for almost all the
balls. You were really kind of the spark plug there for a while. Is it one of
those situations where the situation didn't overwhelm you?  
JASMINE RHODES: No, not really. I mean, I knew what was at stake, and coach
always said that it's tournament time, so someone is going to have to step up,
so I just answered the call like she said and I played my best and my
teammates definitely encouraged me to keep going even when I messed up. It was
a team win, and I'm proud of what we did out there, so it was great.  
  
Q. Theresa, this was a game of runs. Can you just talk specifically about
the run that ended the game? What was your team doing so efficiently?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: We were just doing the little things. It started really
earlier in the season. We worked with the Marines and we went through their
obstacle course one time and we were all dead tired after that first one and
then they sprung on us that we had to go through the entire obstacle course
all again. Our times the second time through were better than our first time
because we dug deep and we just had that extra effort in us. Coming into this
game, we just have to dig deep and find that extra effort.  
The play from our guards stepped up tremendously. At one point our two biggest
people on the court were Anne Pederson and Sheila Boykin, who may be 6'0" and
going against 6'4", 6'5" guard lineup that's 6' even with them. Just the heart
of our team was so strong tonight and we were all beating as one, and it
really showed in that last run. We just didn't want to give it up, and it was
on our home court, and our home crowd really pulled us through, as well.  
  
Q. Jasmine and Danielle, when you looked over and saw Theresa and Shanece on
the bench, was there a sense to keep our seniors' season alive?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: Absolutely because me personally I didn't want the season to
end for them because they are seniors, but I felt like we have to play hard
and tougher, we have to play hard and think smart at the end of the game. I
give credit to Jasmine. She did her thing. She had‑‑ the reason why it was
like help plays, she come in here rebounding and scoring, doing all the little
things, so that just kind of pumped us up even more.  
JASMINE RHODES: I definitely agree with her. I think that we definitely hit
adversity like in the middle of the game and we kind of started losing a lot,
going down a lot I mean, and I think we came together more after we hit
adversity. We just wanted to play hard for them and for the fans, for the
coaches, everyone.  
  
Q. Theresa, I know you all want this season to continue, but do you see a
little bit of a passing of the torch to some of the younger girls assuming
those roles?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Yes, most definitely. When your upperclassmen go out, there
was a sense of urgency from the underclassmen. They really stepped up to the
challenge. It's nothing that was of any shock to any of us. We knew they could
handle it. They handle it every single day at practice. So you know, at
tournament time, like Jas said, somebody is going to have to step up and face
that challenge, and we hit adversity tonight, and I was very proud of our
underclassmen for really stepping in there and picking up where Shanece and I
and Jeanne really left off. Credit to them, they just did an amazing job
tonight, and we wouldn't be moving on if it weren't for our underclassmen.  
  
Q. Jasmine, I hate to give away a good stat here, but you had as many points
tonight as you had minutes in the last five games. How hard is it to stay
ready when you're not getting as much game action, or is it easy just being
able to go out there and practice every day?  
JASMINE RHODES: I mean, it's neither hard nor easy. You've just got to stay
ready. Coach puts you out there, you've just got to do what you're called to
do. I might not have that scoring role or that fantastic role, but I go out
there and I hustle and I try to do things that other people can't on the floor
at the time, and I try to pump my team up. It's a win‑win situation, I guess.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Can I add to that?  
  
Q. Sure, honestly you can.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Jasmine Rhodes is one of the hardest working players I've
ever seen, and her minutes haven't been as great, but she has greatness in
her. Every single day of practice she comes in and works as hard as possible,
and that's something that's hard to do. I've been in Jas's shoes before. My
freshman year I wasn't seeing the court, and that's where I didn't step up and
I wasn't the big person that Jas is. I stopped working hard. I just thought it
was a hopeless cause. I just found no hope in it, and Jas really sticks to it
and does everything that's expected of her. She always does the little things
for us, rebounding. I've never seen a guard, besides Danielle, that crashes
the board every single time and gets and‑ones like Jas does. She's an amazing
player, and she has a lot of potential. She's growing every day. She did a
great job today.  
  
Q. Danielle, tell me what was maybe going through your mind when you slammed
the ball off the floor at the end? Seemed like kind of a punctuation to two
big performances?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: What was going through my mind was we did it again. I was so
excited. I was like, yes. All my frustration went out on the ball. That's the
reason why I really throwed it down, I was so angry at the referees
(laughter).  
But that was just a happy moment. I did that one time in the year. Playing in
this game, we made it to the Sweet 16 again. It was just a joyful moment and
it was just exciting.  
  
Q. I suppose with five SEC teams moving on, it validates what you said about
a tough schedule and maybe your record not reflecting what kind of team you
were going to be in the tournament?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Right. I feel like the SEC is one of the toughest or the
toughest conference in the country. By showing how many teams are moving on
just is a testament to that. The SEC, really when you're going against team
after team, top‑25 teams, anybody can win on any given night. Even the people
that are at the bottom of the SEC, they would give out tough games every
single night. There wasn't a game that you would go into and you would go,
this is a win like you don't have to worry about it. Every single game is a
battle. Every single game is a fight. Just six teams moving on out of one
conference, I think eight made it out of the SEC. That statistic is
incredible. I'm proud to be a part of the SEC, and it's a tough conference to
play in.  
THE MODERATOR: We have a statement from Jeanne Kenney. "I'm so proud of the
heart, the fight, the determination and courage shown by my teammates tonight.
Forever LSU."  
  
Q. Do you have any information on Jeanne's status? Was it a concussion? Do
y'all have any idea?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, at this moment I don't know, but I will tell you that we
will be very cautious in moving forward with Jeanne Kenney due to the fact of
the history of concussions. So at this moment I don't know exactly what her
status is.  
  
Q. When you lose someone, not just a shooter like Jeanne but an emotional
leader like her, how does that change up the game plan going forward?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: You look at your team and you reassure them that they're still
ready and they can still come away with a win. Your strategy doesn't change,
how hard you want your team to play, do the little things, hustle plays,
making sure that we're pushing tempo. When we have numbers, that doesn't
change.  
I think something that stirs up in them as players, though, when you lose a
leader, and they chose to dig a little deeper and give a little more for
Jeanne because she's been just that for them for a long time, and I think
that's what made the difference. I think that's why you've got Danielle
Ballard able to say, hey, I've got to do more, even though my partner here in
JK is out I've got to do more. You had players step up, and that's a testament
to the relationship and the friendship that Jeanne has developed amongst her
teammates.  
  
Q. This may be wild speculation, but from the outside it would appear that
you had three known commodities in your seniors and you added some talent this
year that was maybe a challenge to mesh throughout the year. It would seem
that you've come together in the postseason. Could you talk about if that's
true and how proud are you that these young girls were able to rise to the
occasion?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, we have a core coming back after losing Adrienne Webb
and Bianca Lutley, and we brought in a class that is by far one of the hardest
working classes that I've been affiliated with in all of my coaching. They
would finish one, two and three, that's Rina, Jas and Ray, in all the sprint
work. Everything that you want from a student‑athlete, they exemplify it, and
they're so mature.  
And so to bring them in with the returning veteran squad, it was just going to
be a matter of time where everybody's role was going to be defined and
everybody would accept that maybe a lot of the limelight will be shifted to
some of these younger players. So we bought in, and we've done so, and I'm
extremely proud of this team for realizing how great they can be, and they've
shown time and time again, although our record did not reflect it, that they
could play and potentially beat some of the best teams in the country.  
This is a great victory for so many reasons, not just for our seniors, but
it's an amazing feeling as a first year, and Jasmine Rhodes is never going to
forget this moment, and she will carry it with her for the rest of her career.
I'm extremely proud of our team for staying the course and not allowing
adversity to just separate us. If anything it brought us closer together.  
  
Q. Was there a time when you reminded the team of last year's team and how
y'all were able to fight the adversity? You were down to one bench player. Did
any doubt ever creep into your mind at any point?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: No. You know, I didn't even talk to them about last year. I
talked to them about taking in the atmosphere right now, feeling the energy
that's in this building with the fans, making sure that they understand that
this game is going to be won, and it's going to be won because it may not show
up in the stat sheet, it's going to be won in a quiet way but in a ferocious
way. We talked about that in timeouts, how we would be able to win this game.  
They played like that. There were little glimpses of it, whether it was a hard
cut or a hustle play back on the defensive end. It was just little things, and
as a competitor, you could see that the momentum was starting to shift in our
way, and the momentum started to change because they started to make it
happen. They did it through their play.  
But our huddles were tighter. After a free throw was made, you could see them
all go up and just touch each other. Our bench energy was unbelievable, and
even when there were calls made against us, our kids still stayed the course.
They didn't go crazy, even though I know they felt they wanted to. They just
stayed the course, so that's a sign of a team that's very mature and a team
that felt as though this is still a game for us to pull out if we just do
these small things.  
  
Q. Talking about Rina, she didn't get a lot of playing time late in the SEC,
17 minutes. Is tonight one of the best games for her?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: You know, Rina has been one of those players that had started
for us early on. She had some great games then. She also had a tremendous game
here at our home against Tennessee. I thought she played with a lot of just
confidence, and as a freshman you've got to have your ups and downs, but when
her number was called tonight she answered it, and she was fearless out there,
and she played with a lot of courage. She did not play‑‑ she nor Jasmine,
neither one of them played like freshmen tonight, so extremely proud to have
Rina a part of our family, and I know there's going to be great things in
store for her.  
  
Q. I know this game just happened, but compared to last year's, the drama of
last year's win over Penn State, can you compare the two at all? This looked
in some ways even more desperate considering the foul trouble and
everything.  
NIKKI CALDWELL: You know, the only thing that's a similarity is you have
players that are in and out due to injury, and this year it's been such an
interesting ride and journey because we started out very strong, we started
SEC play very strong, and then we tapered.  
Last year was the reverse. There was desperation and there was that sense of
urgency at the end, and we kept it going. So regardless, we've got good
momentum right now, and whether we have seven players, eight, nine, 10, at
this time of year you just try to do your best to keep everybody healthy. But
that's something that we can't control, so we try not to focus in on that and
just stay positive and really focus in on what we can control, and that's the
healthy bodies that we are able to put in there and making sure that they
understand that they can do it and reinforcing that empowerment into our team.  
But that starts also in the offseason, and we traveled to Spain and we've had
that small lineup. We've had Theresa and Shanece in foul trouble before, so
they've played that play. They played at Tennessee without those two and
Jeanne. So we've drawn on that, and they've had success when adversity has
hit, and that's what we did tonight.  
  
Q. Can I get your response to my SEC question from before with five teams
advancing?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, Theresa said it best, it's the toughest conference in
the country, and when you have five teams advance to the Sweet 16, that's a
testimony to the players that are in our conference. There's amazing talent.
You can look at South Carolina with Mitchell and Coates, and Tennessee
obviously with Harrison and Simmons, LSU with our players. It's a tough
conference, and you don't really get a full view of it unless you play in it,
and what Theresa is talking about, the bottom of our conference, Ole Miss took
us to the wire, Alabama beat us. So you can't just walk into an SEC game and
say that that's going to be a win. It's so competitive, and obviously it's
helped us prepare for NCAA, and that's a reflection of why we have so many
teams that have moved on.  
  
Q. What are Moncrief's prospects going forward?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Right now she's out with a knee injury, so we wish that we
could have her tonight, and we will not have her the rest of the season.  
  
Q. Obviously emotions are still high from this one, but Louisville comes up
on Sunday, so I guess what is the mentality knowing you have this momentum
throughout this week of practice going into that contest?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, I think the thing that we're going to do, I want our
kids to continue to enjoy tonight and enjoy tomorrow. They have a day off, and
we'll get them ready. But I know they know the brackets, so we'll have some
that will already want to come in and want their scouting report, but I'm not
going to give it to them. I want them to understand that what they just did
and what they accomplished with the challenges that we had was amazing, and I
want them to enjoy the moment. Let the coaching staff get them ready for
Louisville, and we'll be the ones watching the film and staying up late. This
group, they deserve a day, a full day, to just enjoy beating a very good West
Virginia team, beating a very good Georgia Tech team to advance to another
Sweet 16.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, first off, I'm extremely excited to continue our play.
Our team did a very nice job yesterday against a very good team in Georgia
Tech in executing our game plan.  
West Virginia is a team that obviously when you look at their guard play,
Holmes has really done a nice job as far as setting the tone as a go‑to player
for them.  
Caldwell, she's explosive with the basketball. She's very good with her
mid‑range game and playing off the bounce, and then their supporting cast.
They just execute Coach's game plan. They're a very good team in transition,
and so our transition defense has got to be key, so taking care of the
basketball, again, another area that we've got to be very committed to doing,
and also getting on the offensive glass. We've got to make sure that we're
giving ourselves opportunities to rebound the basketball.  
But this group, they are motivated, and our team is very excited to be able to
play another game.  
  
Q. Albany fell behind 17 points in the first half, but they were able to put
together a run and I believe get to at least five points in that game. What
did you see in that run that showed you something that you could do against
the West Virginia defense?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: I saw an Albany team that didn't quit. They played with a lot
of energy. They picked up their pressure defensively and really tried to
disrupt West Virginia. They trapped a little bit more, which I thought that
gave them, gave West Virginia, a challenge at times.  
And then also Albany did a nice job of really establishing their inside play.
They were very determined to get the ball inside, and it worked for them.
Paint points is going to be key.  
And then Albany also started to give themselves opportunities to score the
basketball by taking care of the basketball because West Virginia defensively,
they bring a lot of pressure to the ball handler. They don't make it easy for
you to enter the basketball to the wings or to the high post. So ball security
was key for West Virginia‑‑ I'm sorry, for Albany, to get back into that game.  
  
Q. Theresa, just going up against an all ‑Big 12 player in Asya Bussie, what
have you seen from her so far and what kind of challenges does she present?   
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, I feel like their team is all‑around‑‑ an all‑around
great team, and she's obviously‑‑ they're obviously led by Bussie. She does a
great job of controlling the tempo for them. They go as she goes.  
We just need to do‑‑ we need to have a great defensive effort against this
team and especially her. If we have any shot of pulling this win out.  
  
Q. Jeanne, you've been on both sides of this game where you lost and you
didn't get to move on, and then last year you of course moved on. I know it's
one extreme to the next, but can you summarize the emotions and the
differences in the two?  
JEANNE KENNEY: Well, honestly this is my first second‑round game I've ever
played. I didn't really play last year. I was kind of out. So I'm really
excited to be here and just to put my jersey on one more time at the very
least. I'm glad to be able to do that.  
But I guess just to move on is an experience in itself. I mean, you have 32
teams that are already out. I'm just very honored to be able to wear my LSU
jersey again.  
  
Q. DaShawn, looking at this West Virginia team, I know your coach just
talked about how top to bottom it's a really good group, but in scouting them
I'm sure that you've come across the depth that they have, the players that
they can bring in this case of foul trouble or just to give somebody a
breather. What sort of challenges does that present your team just seeing such
a deep opponent that you're going to be facing?  
DaSHAWN HARDEN: They have a really deep bench, but I think we have a really
deep bench, too. So I'm not really sure if that's really an issue for us.  
  
Q. I guess any of the players can answer this one, whoever feels most
comfortable. But I was curious when you look at your scoring total which shows
an all ‑time tournament high for LSU, how much do you think that was a product
of the style of game, or do you think there was something more to it in the
context of the team's development throughout the season?   
JEANNE KINNEY: I actually believe yesterday we carried out our game plan. It
has to be the first game we've stuck to our game plan for the entire game.  
Sorry, Coach.  
But our game plan was to be aggressive, and we did a very, very good job of
it. It's been difficult for the season in its entirety to put together 40
minutes, but I really do think we played a collective game yesterday, and just
pushing the tempo. We were extremely effective in transition, in our
transition offense, and everyone was committed to running from Theresa to
Shanece to all of our guards. We really were. If you get your bigs running,
you have to reward them. Personal opinion.  
  
Q. Theresa, I think it was last year in the FIU tournament you played West
Virginia. Basically the same West Virginia team, they only lost one player.
What do you remember about that game?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, I don't remember much about that game. I remember
that I was very sick prior to that and I wasn't feeling too well the entire
weekend. It kind of ruined my little Miami trip.  
But what I do remember is that they were extremely aggressive. Offensively
they really pushed tempo, and if their shots weren't falling they had five to
the boards every time and they were just determined to get that offensive
rebound, which I feel like is the same team that they have this year. All five
crashing the boards, and they're really looking for that offensive rebound,
which is a really tough thing to defend.  
Also they do a really great job on defense and pressuring our guard play and
trying to take away the high post, so that's going to be a challenge for us to
work around. You know, they have a lot of similarities from last year to this
year, and I feel like they're very worthy of their seeding and their spot
because they're a very tough team to contend with.  
  
Q. DaShawn, you guys mentioned about the pressure and Georgia Tech pressured
you yesterday and you committed 23 turnovers, but that didn't faze you. Why
not? How were you able to overcome the turnovers and still get the game plan
executed?  
DaSHAWN HARDEN: You just have to keep playing. If you let the turnovers faze
you, then that's when they just keep coming. But I guess they kept coming
anyway.  
I mean, just keep playing, not really worry about if you turn the ball over or
not, just try and get it back on defense.  
  
Q. DaShawn, not to discredit the hard work of your seniors in that first
game because the trail was amazing, but your play, Danielle, what did LSU show
about what's next for the Tigers in that first game of the NCAA Tournament?  
DaSHAWN HARDEN: I think that yesterday was just something that we should have
been doing all year, like how we can play. We haven't been playing our best,
and I think we all just decided to show up yesterday. Basically that's the
team that we are. It didn't surprise us because we know how we can play, and I
think that's just the beginning of what's going to continue throughout the
tournament.  
  
Q. Jeanne, to focus on the play of the seniors and specifically your play,
you had kind of memories of Pistol Pete type flash. You looked like you were
having a lot of fun out there. Is that the case of the senior knowing that
this is the last chance to show up for Tiger Nation? What elevated your play
yesterday? There was no tentative in your game.  
JEANNE KENNEY: Well, that comparison is a bit strong, but thank you for that.
I just think our game plan was to be aggressive, and we carried that out. I
mean, I was having fun, and that's something that you always have to remember,
that it's just a game. I do think that the whole thing of it being my last
game‑‑ that could have happened. But I mean, we were just‑‑ that chemistry
that we had was so great with everybody, like everybody had that chemistry,
and it just‑‑ you couldn't help but smile. You couldn't help but‑‑ those 50/50
balls, those passes, that we probably shouldn't have made them, were
happening, just because we were going hard, we were playing together, and it
just came to us. But we were very fortunate yesterday.  
  
Q. Theresa, to follow up on the finality of playing the final game, what
that was like?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Just the realness of there really is no tomorrow unless you
give it your all today. It really sunk in yesterday that this is really‑‑ they
say play every game like it's your last, but really every game from here on
out could be my last game. LSU means the world to me, and this is a place that
I wish I could stay forever.  
You know, it's pulling at my heart that one day I'm going to have to hang up
my jersey, and I'm going to do whatever I can to prolong that. I know the
seniors feel the same way, that we just‑‑ LSU just has a special place in our
heart. They say you bleed purple and gold when you come here, and that's an
absolute true statement.  
That just had a big part of our competitive spirit, and I know our
underclassmen care a lot about our class, and they want us to go out on a good
note. So we have a good group of underclassmen fighting pretty hard for us,
too.  
  
Q. This one is for Jeanne. On what you said just now with the chemistry of
this team and how you guys played yesterday, is this closer to the team when
you peaked in your best SEC play with anybody can have a big night out
there?  
JEANNE KINNEY: I would say that, but I would also agree with DaShawn on how
everybody just came out to play. We know we've been capable of playing this
way all season, but we haven't been able to put all the pieces together, and I
think a lot of our pieces came together last night. You just saw genuine came
for each other out on the court, and it didn't matter who scored. I mean, we
had 98 points so everybody scored basically, but it didn't matter if you were
the passer or the scorer at that point, and whenever you can get that,
especially when you're in the NCAA Tournament, when it's win or go home,
that's a special moment.  
  
Q. Jeanne, just to clarify, you didn't play in the second round game two
years ago against Penn State?  
JEANNE KENNEY: Oh, yeah, I did. It's a concussion. We lost, so I don't really
equate it. I did play.  
  
Q. West Virginia is seeded where they are for a reason. They won their
conference. You guys have two things: Your home ‑court advantage and the
experience factor. They don't have any players who have been past this round
of the tournament before. How can those things help you in tomorrow night's
game, those two factors?   
JEANNE KINNEY: I think that the energy that our fans bring is just so
electrifying. I've said it so many times, but they really are the sixth man on
the court, and they help us out tremendously.  
But I also think West Virginia is not here by fluke. They're a great team. I
mean, they're a 2 seed, and their record proves that.  
And the personnel that they have, I do think experience comes into play, but I
also think that when it comes to NCAA, everyone is going to play their best,
whether you have the experience or not. You're just going to go out and play,
and I think that's when individually you're at your best, when you just‑‑ when
sometimes you just can't think about everything, you've just got to go out and
play. We're all Division I players, so you should be able to have the skill
set to just go out and play and do your thing.  
But West Virginia is a very good team, and they're going to challenge us, but
we're always up for that challenge.  
  
Q. A lot of teams in your league are very aggressive, in ‑your‑face, man
defense. I wonder what your impressions are of West Virginia in that regard.
  
NIKKI CALDWELL: I'll tell you, their defense can really disrupt you
offensively with your rhythm. We're a rhythm team, and so the flow of the
game, we're going to have to make sure that we're meeting every pass, that
we're‑‑ as a sever you're putting yourself in the position to get open because
they do an extremely great job of denying one pass away. They will play uphill
on our post game, so they're taking away wing entry, post entry, so we've got
to be creative in our offensive attack.  
You know, in the SEC there's so many teams that play that way or have that
style of play. I know Kentucky is that way. We've played A&M, Tennessee can
get after you, and obviously Georgia guard play, they also defensively can
disrupt your guards, and you can keep going down the list. Mississippi State,
there's so many great defensive teams in our league.  
So I hope through our experience that we're going to be prepared to face this
defense. But at this time of year, I think Kenney was trying to allude to it,
it's going to be about your attitude because you can pressure us or you can
pack it in or you can zone us or man‑to‑man; what is your attitude as a
basketball player when you know that you have one game guaranteed, and you
only have 40 more minutes left to play in your career for our seniors? So are
you going to work extremely hard to open up those passing lanes? Are you going
to be that team that plays aggressively against an aggressively defensive team
or are you going to be passive?  
So the attitude of our team I hope will be the attitude of a warrior.  
  
Q. Coach, do you know Moncrief's status? What is she going through today in
terms of evaluation? And what is Derreyal Youngblood's status on the team?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: As of right now, we've got Moncrief, she will go and see the
doctors today around noon, so we'll have more of an update with her situation,
so we're very hopeful with having her back. Derreyal Youngblood is suspended
from the team for team violations, and we will obviously continue to focus in
on the task at hand, and this group has done a great job of coming together
and playing this game still with Derreyal in mind and obviously with or
without Moncrief. We are still going to play this game with those two and
carry them with us.  
  
Q. When you talk about offensive creativity that you're going to require
tomorrow, how do you think Ballard's kind of dynamic on ‑court skills compare
with Kenney's Pistol Pete, fake passes and transition lay‑ups will help in
that regard?   
NIKKI CALDWELL: I think it will be to our advantage because they're playing
the game very relaxed, and they're not fast forwarding the process. They're
enjoying every moment of being an LSU Tiger. And Jeanne is a very emotional
player, and she gambles a lot, and I give her two a game. She gets one a half.
And so she knows she can take those risks, but also know with Jeanne and
Danielle, they're the type of kids who you want to have the ball in their
hands. They've shown that they can not only attack to score for themselves or
Jeanne Kenney spotting up for a three to open up the game, but they also can
pass the basketball, so they're great play‑makers for us, and that's what
we're going to have to have against a very talented West Virginia team.  
I like Ballard being able to attack off the bounce because that's who she is,
so allowing our kids to play to their strength, I think that's going to be key
for us.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the warrior effort that you want. Is that
something that has brought this team together maybe that it hasn't seen prior
to this point, and is that something maybe as a coach you wish would have come
sooner rather than later?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: No, I think it's‑‑ I think the season is what it's supposed to
be, and we're where we're supposed to be. We've had some great 20‑minute,
30‑minute games this season. We just hadn't had 40. And if we were playing 30
minutes, we probably could win a lot more games.  
With that being said, this team has evolved in such a way where they've found
their way, and as a head coach, the only thing that you can do is you can
provide basically‑‑ I tell them, I'll give you a shell, like we'll shell our
offense and we'll shell our defense, but it's really up to the components to
make it work.  
It's not what we run, it's how we run it. It's not what defensive scheme we're
running, it's how hard you're going to play it. We're choosing to play every
possession like it's our last, and when you have your team with that type of
sense of urgency, they've just got to maintain it, and if we can maintain it
for this 40 minutes on Tuesday night, then we have a better shot of winning.
But if we deviate from it and we don't have that warrior mentality, or as we
call it, we label it like the acronym for NBA. We're not talking about the
National Basketball Association, we're talking about no babies are allowed
here. So when you get to the NCAA Tournament, you've got to have that type of
mentality, and that's what we've been really trying to instill in our student
athletes.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked earlier about Bria Holmes in your opening statement,
but for her to go 1 of 12 from three ‑point range, Christal Caldwell with 26
leading the way, that guard combination and their versatility, what kind of
problems does that pose to your team?   
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, that combination, that's a tough combination to defend.
I mean, you've got two kids who are very good in the open court, and their
ability to score the basketball multiple ways, Holmes with the spot‑up three,
although she didn't make a lot of threes. I think she only made one. But she
had some great looks.  
So you can't run the risk of, well, will she be off again against us. But we
just want to make sure that we're aware of where she's at at all times because
she is very explosive.  
And then Caldwell, I'm wondering if she's related to me. I've got to find out
because her game, she's got‑‑ her skills are very good, and mine were okay
back in the day, too, so I'm going to claim her.  
No, I think she's an exceptional mid‑range player, like her ability to play
off the bounce, and she's a great athlete. Those two really do a nice job, and
you go as your guard play goes, and West Virginia, they have two very, very
explosive guards in those two.  
  
Q. You've obviously been a part of a number of great teams and great
programs, and wondering if there's any common denominators there, and kind of
looking at the West Virginia program that's trying to get over the hump into
the Sweet 16, do you get the sense that they're close to getting over that
hump?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Oh, of course. I think West Virginia has shown through their
body of work this year that, one, they are worthy of a No.2 seed, and that
they've shown that they can not only play with the best teams in the country
but beat them. You have potential all‑American type players on your roster.
That gives you an advantage there when you can go to multiple players.  
But their team is, they're playing extremely hard on the defensive end, and
they believe in their defensive scheme and their defensive system, so you see
how they can disrupt you and turn you over and execute on the offensive end.  
And players are playing together. No one is‑‑ the body language of the team is
very positive. No one is‑‑ even when you look at Holmes, not making a lot of
those threes. They were still trying to find her, so that says a lot about
their cohesion as a team.  
  
Q. One of the interesting things about the first half of that Albany ‑West
Virginia game is Albany shot 55 percent but they were still up 17 because they
had 11 turnovers and they shot 3 for 11 from the free‑throw line. You've been
practicing the fundamentals throughout these past few weeks. Do you think
that's going to really benefit you, because this seems like an opportunity you
can have if you just make your free throws, take care of the ball?   
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, the free throws, I was very proud of our group for
making free throws and really doing a nice job of‑‑ I think Ballard really did
a nice job of knocking down hers, and as a team we shot a very high
percentage.  
The taking care of the basketball, that's been something that has‑‑ what's the
identity of the LSU team? Well, we're going to turn it over 20 times. We joke
about it with our kids because I feel as though they don't intentionally go
into games wanting to turn it over. It's just that they have the freedom, they
have the play action that allows multiple people to touch the basketball. I
mean, if we wanted to limit our turnovers, all we needed to do was just keep
the ball in one person's hand and just say milk the clock, milk the clock,
then go. But because we want to develop our kids, and it's not just about our
seniors, it's about allowing our underclassmen to have that freedom and to
make those mistakes because through those mistakes you will grow as a
basketball player.  
We had 23, 24 turnovers in our last game, and I tell them, I said, but if
you're going to turn it over that many times, then you need to force that many
turnovers, as well, because we need to cancel that out. If we can balance or
tip the scales a little bit in our favor, then that stat line doesn't really
affect us as much.  
We also talk about having good turnovers versus bad turnovers, and so I said
let's try to at least have half of our turnovers be good turnovers, and they
know what that means. They know what that means.  
We definitely have addressed it, and we have done everything from two‑ball
passing to medicine ball passing to just goggles and what have you. We're
going to get better as an LSU basketball program in that area. We're still
young when I look at our team. We've got three seniors, but we're very young
at the guard play, and so we're going to have those challenges. But it won't
be a matter of us not trying to get it back on the other end. So that's what
I'm looking for, because to me that builds their character.  
  
Q. Do you remember the last two second ‑round games here?   
NIKKI CALDWELL: Yes, I do.  
  
Q. Would you just summarize the emotions between the two, staying here at
home and not moving on, and do you feel like those experiences have helped
you, and now even though you're the lower seed do you feel like you have a
good shot?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: I think this time of year it's anybody's game to take. I think
when you look at us having a veteran squad, we've got four players who played
really valuable minutes last year from that team, and they have a taste of it,
they know what they can accomplish and that feeling. So it's in there, that
feeling of advancing and winning that second‑round game and knowing the next
step.  
Are we going to be starving for that again, or are we just going to be hungry
because I think there's a big difference when you're hungry versus starving. I
hope we're starving for it and that the team that wants it the most will come
up with the victory tomorrow.  
  
Q. Also, have you given any thought if you move on will Derreyal Youngblood
be back or do you know how long that suspension will be?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Right now the suspension is not a suspension where she's going
to be back immediately.  
  
Q. I wanted your take on my question about scoring, how much of it was
specific and how much of it was a bigger picture thing, the high scoring, and
second, did you notice that there was actually a lot of relatively high
scoring across the women's tournament first round and what might have caused
that?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: I think the one thing about the scoring for us and our game
was we did not want to set up our offense versus their defense, and so that
was very scout specific that we wanted to be aggressive and attack as many
times as we can against their pressure in the full court and in the half
court.  
Playing against a 2‑1‑2 defense, which you call the buzz defense, where they
trap, trap, trap, there's not really an offense that you run where you say,
okay, I'm going to come out, ball is on the wings, set a ball screen,
whatever; it's more a mentality of player placement to get a score, so some of
our action was one, two passes, score it. So we had been practicing against
that type of pressure. But again, the players have to go out and execute it,
and I thought that they played and executed our game plan to perfection on the
offensive end.  
High scores around the country? You've got great players, and players that can
make plays, and then when they get on a roll this time of year, you're not
seeing a lot of people lose those leads. And then I think when you're down 10,
20, it's hard to come back from that because you're maybe putting a little bit
more pressure on yourself this time of year knowing it's your last go‑around,
so that may have something to do with it. I just hope that we're not down.  
  
Q. You might be a couple players down tomorrow and you have a propensity to
turn the ball over. Last year you beat Penn State with seven healthy players.
You guys have a little drama that goes along with you sometimes ‑‑  
NIKKI CALDWELL: We're women.  
  
Q. I wasn't going to say that. Y'all seem to deal with it somehow, winning
most of the time. How are you able to do that?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: We're women.  
No, I think the one thing about women is we adapt, and we have to. We have to
adapt to you and men and everybody else. But no, these young ladies, they've
been through so many different things and challenges, and this is just one
more thing that they're going to add to their college experience.  
As long as they understand that every day, okay, regardless of what happens
tomorrow, and I tell them this all the time, the sun is still going to come
up, so it's just our mentality and our approach to postseason. I think we're a
team that we're considered the underdog, and I told them, I said, that's fine.
No one really thinks about that when you go on and you're cutting down nets,
who was the underdog. They just look at you, and you've gained that respect
and that momentum as you continue to advance. And it is about gaining that
respect, and we're trying to establish that respect here at LSU, or
reestablish it, because obviously this program has been rich in tradition and
winning and going to five consecutive Final Fours. That's what we're trying to
get this team back to, this program back to, because I thought when you look
at Sue Gunter and what she's meant to the women's game, I just hope that we're
getting a smile down from her and we're trying to do things the way that she
would approve.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
MIKE CAREY: First of all, I'd like to just say that I'm very proud of our team
and where we're at right now. We're getting ready for a tough game tomorrow
night against LSU, and we know it's going to be a tough game. It's going to be
a tough atmosphere, but we've played in tough atmospheres this year.  
It's a great challenge for us, but we're looking forward to the challenge, and
there's no doubt in my mind we'll come out and play extremely hard.  
  
Q. Christal, this is a bit of a silly question, but Coach Caldwell said she
was going to check out and see if you were related. She said she was ready to
claim you since you played so well yesterday against Albany. Do you have any
idea if you guys are related?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: I don't think we're related, but I'll just go ahead and
take that as a compliment.  
  
Q. Christal, what does it say to you about an LSU team that can turn it over
23 times, yet still score 98 points and beat a good Georgia Tech team by 20?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: Well, I think it's mostly because they get out in
transition and they try to score early. If you give them a lay‑up, they'll
take it. But still, our defense if we play the way we can, I think we can turn
them over a lot.  
BROOKE HAMPTON: I just agree with Christal. I think they get out in transition
like us, and if we do a good job defensively on their guards, they penetrate a
lot, I think we'll have a pretty good shot, and we also have to guard their
bigs.  
ASYA BUSSIE: I think it's because they get out in transition and they look to
drive and get into the paint so they take those chances of getting a turnover
or get the basket. It's just something that we have to deal with, and we just
have to defend dribble penetration.  
  
Q. Asia, just being a 2 seed and being rewarded with a high seed like that
and having to come down here and play on the road in a hostile environment, do
you think about that, and how do you feel that could be different in the
future?  
ASYA BUSSIE: I think it's great being a 2 seed, but it is difficult coming
into someone else's arena and trying to score and get the win, but I think
we've done that in the past. We've proven that we can go into other people's
gyms and come out with a win.  
  
Q. Christal, yesterday Bria gets 20 points but she does it while missing 11
three ‑pointers. You guys kept feeding the ball to her, though. How important
is it if things aren't going well you continue to sort of feed the players?
Obviously you have the depth you could bring somebody else in, but what was
the importance of making sure that you didn't give up on Bria yesterday
despite the struggles she had?   
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: Because we've seen her make those shots all year long, so
just because she wasn't making them yesterday doesn't mean that she can't. We
have that confidence in her just to know that you're a shooter, you miss a
couple, you just continue to shoot. We know she's a great player, so continue
to give her the ball and she'll make some.  
  
Q. We were talking to the LSU players and they said you guys have depth but
they feel like they do, too. If you could talk about how deep you feel this
LSU team is and how well you match up because of that.  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: Well, I think they play well but so do we, and I don't want
to get into too much of talking about that. I just want to get ready to play
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Asia, going up against their center, pretty good, around the same height
you are, a little different than yesterday. What challenges is she going to
bring, guarding her?  
ASYA BUSSIE: Well, I think she's a familiar body compared to the Big 12, so I
don't think that's something new. Just still playing the same way I've played
all year, attacking, rebounding, playing defense and helping the team out as
much as possible. I don't think it'll be a big difference from what I've been
playing against in the Big 12.  
  
Q. For the players, LSU obviously didn't end their season, the regular
season the way they wanted to. They've had a couple wins here and seem to have
found something. How dangerous is it to play a team that's just getting it
together in the postseason?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: Well, with them not ending the way that they wanted to,
that lets you know that they're going to have a chip on their shoulder. It's
tournament time, they're coming off a good win yesterday, and we're on their
home floor, so they're going to come out hungry and ready to play. You can't
really talk about what they didn't do at the end of the season because they're
still a great team.  
ASYA BUSSIE: Yeah, I think they're going to come out really hungry. Like we've
been saying, it's one‑and‑done, so they're going to give their all and play
their best. I don't expect them to do anything less than that.  
BROOKE HAMPTON: I think they're going to come out hot from the jump. I think
that they have a chip on their shoulder like Christal said, and I feel like
they have nothing to lose. Playing on their home court will give them more
confidence.  
  
Q. Asia, we've talked so much about potentially playing a team on their home
court, and now it's here. How important is it that if they are coming out hot
right from the opening tip ‑off and the crowd is behind them and all that,
that you weather that, that you're able to with stand any momentum that they
do get early in the game and realize that there are 40 minutes to be played?
  
ASYA BUSSIE: Yeah, we expect them to come out hot and try to get the crowd
involved, but we just have to play our defense, the defense we've been playing
all season long, and we expect it to be a roller coaster, and play until the
end, and I think it's going to be a full 40‑minute game and it's going to come
down to the stretch.  
  
Q. Asia, they've asked you about playing on LSU's home court. Even though
you're the No.2 seed in this game, do you feel like you guys have kind of an
underdog mindset going into this game?  
ASYA BUSSIE: Not really, but I do feel like we have a target on our back, and
it's been like that all season long. We don't get the respect that we should
get, and we just have to go out there and prove it every game, and I think
this whole season we have had to prove people wrong and just show that we are
a good team, we deserve to be a 2 seed, and I think that's what we continue to
do even throughout this tournament.  
  
Q. Brooke, I assume y'all have had goals of getting to the first Sweet 16 in
program history and getting to the Final Four. How do you set that aside and
get through the one game, not to let the emotions or thoughts of those goals
get in the way of what you have to do?  
BROOKE HAMPTON: I think the most important thing in tournament play is just
take one game at a time and focus on the present and not the future, because
you don't know exactly who you're going to play in the next round anyway. I
think just one game at a time and advancing into next round is the most
important thing.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, this would be your first Sweet 16 under you but the
second for West Virginia, right? They had one in '92 or '93?  
MIKE CAREY: Yeah.  
  
Q. Christal, you played a lot of the same players a year ago in a tournament
in Miami. What are some of your recollections of that game?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: Well, they took us off a lot of ball screens and they
dribble penetrated a lot, so we are going to take that into consideration and
go over scout and some of the things that they do and just try to play our
defense and just sit down and try to stop their guards from getting too deep
into the paint and setting up other people because they do have some
three‑point shooters.  
  
Q. Starting with Christal, I think every team feels like they're dissed or
underrated or whatever. But I've heard that a lot from you, that you guys at
least in the last week since the brackets came out and the people at ESPN
seemed to kind of dis you there. Can you give me some examples of what you
mean when you say that people don't give you any kind of respect and the
things that have gone on this year that give you that idea?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: Well, we've done so much this year. We are co‑champs in the
Big 12. We've only lost four games this year. We set so many records. We have
a 30‑win season. We've just done so much, but I think a lot of people don't
take that into consideration. Maybe it's because they think that you can't
live off of that. But I think we've done so much and people just don't really
give us that credit.  
But at the same time it doesn't really matter, we just have to come out and
play basketball.  
ASYA BUSSIE: Just thinking back to the beginning of the season, we weren't
even preseason ranked and just to be in the top five and the top 10 now, I
think that shows you right now how great our team is and people didn't think
we were that good from the beginning of the season.  
Maybe like the media coverage we get or like how much we get talked about I
feel like we deserve a lot more as a team.  
BROOKE HAMPTON: I think in the beginning of the season our team was
underrated, but I think we proved a lot of people wrong and proved ourselves
right in the postseason and everything. But I think now we're considered
unrespected, being a 2 seed and playing on the No.7 seed's home court and then
the No.3 seed's home court. But I think that we do a good job of playing away
better anyway, so I think we'll have a good shot.  
  
Q. Coach, they made some pretty solid points. Do you think it's a legitimate
argument?  
MIKE CAREY: You know, we want to have a chip on our shoulder. I think we play
better when we have a chip on our shoulder, so you know, I'm going to bring up
everything to them because I want them to have a chip on their shoulder. I
want to have a chip on my shoulder. I feel like I coach a little bit better, a
little bit harder when I have a chip on my shoulder. So anything we can find,
we're going to try to find it and use it.  
  
Q. We were just talking to Nikki Caldwell. She said there's a difference
between being hungry and being starving. She feels like her team needs to be
starving for this opportunity to go to the Sweet 16. You are a team that has
had so much success this year but still clearly has something to strive for.
Do you feel like they are starving for that next step to continue on in this
tournament?  
MIKE CAREY: Well, I think so because this group hasn't done that, has not went
that far. I guarantee you that they're hungry to move on.  
It's going to be a tough game. You go to the NCAA Tournament, you're going to
play tough games, and you're not going to play them at your home arena. If you
want to move on to the next level, you have to play against good teams, and
sometimes you have to play them on their home floor.  
  
Q. You've talked a lot from the beginning of the season, internally you all
knew what you had coming back and knew what this team was capable of, but I
think one thing that we haven't discussed is you did have to bring in two new
assistant coaches, and that dynamic of getting used to the way you want to
scout, I know Coach Reeves has some familiarity, but knowing what you had
personnel wise, did that factor into the hiring, and how did that mesh over
the course of the season for y'all?  
MIKE CAREY: Well, I think the assistant coaches meshed in well. You know, I've
been in coaching for a lot of years. I'm not going to change my way, so
really, they've got to adjust to me, and they've done a great job of that.
Like you said, Coach Reeves was with me before, and I think all the coaches
have adjusted well and are doing great job for us.  
  
Q. Not being able to get to the Sweet 16 at this point except for the one
time in the early '90s, how much of that is a reflection for having to travel
for the first and second round games, and why have you guys not had the
opportunity to host some games?  
MIKE CAREY: Well, I think‑‑ first of all, there's good teams in the NCAA, and
if you looked at our seedings in the past, usually we were playing a No.1 seed
or a No.2 seed the second round, and it's been tough.  
You know, don't get me wrong, we should have probably won a couple of those,
and we didn't, and we have an opportunity here.  
My philosophy is if you can get to that point, eventually hopefully you win
one. If you keep knocking on the door, hopefully it's going to open up for you
a little bit. Our teams have done a great job to get to this point, and we
need to take the next step. I said that before the year started, we need to
take the next step in the NCAA Tournament, and we have another opportunity.
Now, hopefully we can take advantage of that.  
  
Q. Players were asked about this, but Bria Holmes coming off yesterday, do
you say anything to her? Obviously you know what she's capable of, and how do
you handle that going into tomorrow?  
MIKE CAREY: You know, shooters like Bria and Christal and some other shooters,
I don't say a word. I heard Bria saying to a couple of teammates, I'm not
taking a three the next game, and I said, well, you will or you'll come out of
the game. I'm more, if that's your shot, shoot it. If you miss it, you miss
it. I don't get caught up in that stuff. The only thing I'll do, because
sometimes shooters when they're not hitting their shot will get a little tight
and then the next shot is tougher. Sometimes I'll say just kiddingly, it's
okay, it's not against the rules to hit one once in a while. It's okay to hit
one.  
But I don't say a word to shooters. I really just let that go. If they're
open, that's their shot. If it's a bad shot, that's different, but if it's a
good shot and that's their role on this basketball team, then shoot it.
Shooters are like anything else, they may miss five in a row, but you're
liable to hit five in a row, too, the next five, so you can't take that
confidence away.  
  
Q. You've said a few times that this team hasn't done too well in the NCAA
Tournament in the time you've been here and you continue to put that on
yourself. You say that's my fault. Are there things philosophically that
you've said I have to approach the NCAA Tournament a different way? Are there
changes that you make when it comes tournament time now?  
MIKE CAREY: No, not really. Not really. You know, I don't think you can
reinvent yourself tournament time. I mean, you are what you are. You play
20‑some games and you either won or lost those games in 20‑some games. Now,
you may make some adjustments and you may play your starters a little bit
longer or you may do certain things during the course of the game, but you're
really not going to reinvent what you've done all year long. I just believe
you go with what you've been successful with.  
I try to stay‑‑ even though I don't look like it on the sideline, I try to
stay calm. I really try to stay calm. I'm the type of person, I'll go
da‑da‑da‑da‑da, and then I'm calm and I'm over it, then we can really discuss
what we need to do. I think the biggest thing is keeping your players focused,
keeping them calm and don't get excited. We already talked about this: It's
going to be a 40‑minute game, and we need to be in the game going into the
last four minutes, and we've been very successful if we've been in the game
going into the last four minutes because these players have done a great job
of executing under four minutes. So that's where we want to be tomorrow night.
Just be close, be right there and have an opportunity to win the game the last
four minutes.  
  
Q. I asked the players about a hot LSU team. What did you see in that
Georgia Tech game that maybe differed from their last 10 games in the regular
season?  
MIKE CAREY: Well, I mean, they played with a lot of confidence. They were
hitting their shots. You know, when I looked at points in the paint, they
scored a lot of points in the paint, but then when I watched some film, a lot
of it was Georgia Tech was pressing, and they were getting a lot of two on
ones, lay‑ups, that type of stuff. They're very talented. They have all the
pieces. They have size. They have a 4 that can step out and hit the three but
also go inside and post you at 6'5". They have shooters on the perimeter and
they have people that can penetrate. So they have everything to be very
successful.  
We understand that, but our style is not Georgia Tech's style. We're not going
to stand out there and press and give you lay‑ups all day. We're not going to
do that. We're going to try to put a body on you, don't give you as many
offensive rebounds and that type of stuff.  
  
Q. When you played LSU in Austin in '07, can you talk about what you
remember about that game?  
MIKE CAREY: Yeah, the shot clock was running down and they were out past the
three‑point line. It was under five, the shot clock, and instead of us closing
up on the shooter because they couldn't put it on the floor, they had to throw
it up, they hit that three. From that point on they kind of took the lead and
was able to beat us. That was a good game.  
I also remember playing LSU last year. You all asked what stuck out in my
mind. What stuck out in my mind, they shot 40‑shot foul shots last year in
Miami, and I think they made 30‑some, whatever. That's pretty much what‑‑
because they penetrated and we didn't do a good job and we put them at the
foul line a lot. We can't do that tomorrow night. We've got to contest, make
them shoot over the top and then box out.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

LSU  98  
Georgia Tech  78

  
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: Well, first of all, I think we saw out there today why LSU
was ranked top 12 in the country early in the season. I really felt like today
they were clicking on all cylinders. When you have a guard like Danielle
Ballard step up and get 17 rebounds, 5'6", 5'7", that's a physical effort. I
just thought she was really difficult to guard on both ends of the floor
today. She did a tremendous job being disruptive. She had 10 defensive
rebounds, and so she showed a lot toughness and poise for a sophomore, I
thought. It was ‑‑ I think the experience those players have had in the Sweet
16 a year ago have paid off for them. On the other side we only had four
players who had played in an NCAA Tournament, and I think we figured out today
what it takes not only to play at this level but compete at this level in the
NCAA Tournament, especially on someone's home floor. I think that's a really
tall order and task, and I really feel like it will help our team and a
program grow as the years go on.  
  
Q. Tyaunna, I think you only had one shot attempt through the first eight
minutes when you guys fell behind there and really got back from the lead.
Looking back do you wish you had tried to establish yourself more offensively
to started the game?  
TYAUNNA MARSHALL: Yes, definitely. I mean, just being a leader, somebody who's
played in the NCAA Tournament before, I definitely needed to come out for my
team. Yes, of course I wanted to get more shots, but when shots aren't falling
you have to try to do more than just play offense. I like to play defense and
rebound, too, but I wish I could have been more of a threat for my team in the
opening minutes.  
  
Q. Sydney, just talk about how you felt today, your first game in several
games, and you really seemed like your shot was there. I know you're
disappointed with the loss, but talk about how you felt and how you were able
to help your team.  
SYDNEY WALLACE: I felt good a lot. I spent a few weeks just watching games and
just trying to come back mentally prepared and just tried to come back strong
for my team. I just wanted to come out with confidence and just try to do
everything I could, what my team needed me to do.  
  
Q. They have one person who handled the ball all the time. Does that make it
difficult to deal with their transition game?  
SYDNEY WALLACE: Yes, in a way. We couldn't get our press set, and I felt like
that's really why they got out in transition and they would quickly get it up,
so it was kind of hard for us to match up with them.  
  
Q. Coach, curious if you can comment on some of the foul trouble and if that
affected the rebounding spread in the game.  
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: Well, I think what affected the rebounding was a little bit
we were standing watching the shots go up instead of pursuing the ball. And
one of the things I thought was a weakness of LSU was their offensive
rebounding. It's obvious they spent a lot of time on that the last couple
weeks because I thought the games they lost down the stretch were games they
lost on offensive rebounding, and teams just dominated them on the boards and
they were able to stay in the game, but they weren't able to finish out games
because of getting killed on the offensive glass. I thought that was obviously
one of the things they spent a lot of time working on because they did a
tremendous job today getting to the ball on the offensive end and the
defensive end. I don't know if it's so much I think our foul trouble‑‑ that
caused our foul trouble because‑‑ you foul on offensive rebounds. That's
usually where you foul. I thought today was no exception. When they were
getting offensive rebounds we were fouling them.  
  
Q. Were you surprised that they went to run with you like they did? They
haven't scored that many points, and it didn't seem like they were that great
in the half court.  
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: It was a totally different team today than I saw the last 10
games on film. Against the presses, anybody that pressed them when they played
in their SEC games, they were really slow in getting the ball up the floor and
seemed to struggle against presses and traps, and today it looked like their
game plan was just to throw it long and attack it and see what happens, and
they played a lot faster than I've seen them play in the 10 games I watched.  
  
Q. They also just made a lot of shots at a high rate. How much of that is
defensive effort and how much of that is sometimes just ‑‑ they made some
pretty crazy shots there along the way, too?   
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: Well, when you get hit with a team that's clicking on all
cylinders, sometimes that's tough to defend, no matter what defense you're in.
Today they had players making shots that I didn't see them making shots on the
film, so I think that they had several experienced veteran players step up and
make plays for them.  
I think when you're playing at home and you played at home last year in the
NCAA Tournament, went to the Sweet 16, you get a lot of experience and you get
a lot of confidence from that, and I felt like they just made plays, and you
have to give a team credit. It feels like for us the last two games we played,
Duke and LSU have given us two of the best games all year, but that's
something we've come to expect. I think people know we play extremely hard and
you have to play that hard if you play against us, and I think they gave us
their best shot.  
  
Q. This game you guys played the tough schedule, this game compared to any
other this season? How tough was LSU compared to what you've seen this year?  
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: Well, I think LSU is as good as any of the top teams in the
ACC, top‑five teams in the ACC. I thought today was a little bit more physical
than what we had seen throughout the course of our ACC season, but I think
that's postseason play. I think when you get to this time of the year it's
going to be a lot more physical, and I think veteran players, that's where
seniors and upperclassmen are so valuable because they've been here, done
that, and now I have a team full of underclassmen that have been here, done
that. That's what the experience gives you is an opportunity to see what it's
going to be like when you get on this stage, and I thought today that our
players learned a very valuable lesson that every level, regular season and
ACC Tournament and then now the NCAA Tournament is a different level of
intensity. I thought that LSU really came out and jumped on us, and I thought
it rocked us back on our heels a little bit.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

West Virginia  76  
Albany  61

  
MIKE CAREY: First of all, congratulations to Albany. They had a great season,
didn't quit, played extremely hard. So give them all the congratulations you
can.  
I thought the first half we moved the ball extremely well, attacked, moved the
ball, swung the ball, found the open man, hit shots. In the second half we
kind of just stood around. We didn't attack anymore, and they started
attacking us, and we put them at the foul line.  
But in this type ‑‑ I always tell the players in all tournament settings that
we normally don't play well the first game. There's no doubt we'll play better
the next game and play harder for 40 minutes. We're looking forward to next
game. We know LSU, great basketball team, and we're playing on their home
court, so we know it's going to be a tough game.  
  
Q. Bria, talk about the run when their big girl goes out, you go on a 16 ‑2
run and you held them scoreless for almost six minutes. Was it more the
defense or was it more just the attacking with the middle opening up?   
BRIA HOLMES: I felt like it was more of our defense, and us just getting out
running and everybody looking for each other, just attacking the basket and
just scoring.  
  
Q. Bria, just when they rolled the press out in the second half, what about
just the nature of their press got you guys flustered? It seemed like they did
a good job forcing you guys to make some mistakes.  
BRIA HOLMES: Well, I think it was mostly us just not focused or just letting
them get us under pressure because we had worked on it in our scout. I think
it was more of us and just not attacking it as much.  
  
Q. What was the key to neutralizing Richards? You got her in foul trouble
pretty early and she could never get going.  
AVEREE FIELDS: We knew that she ran the floor well and I think that was kind
of our focus just to get back into playing our defense, so I think when we
play our defense we're a pretty good team, and that was our game plan for her,
as well.  
  
Q. You guys talked about different elements that were involved in guarding,
putting pressure on the guards and fronting and weak side help and all of
that. Where do you think that the biggest problem was in her getting the ball
and being able to be effective?  
AVEREE FIELDS: I think we did a pretty good job having ball pressure and even
getting weak side but she had high over us, so sometimes the passes just got
there whether we were in position or not. Overall I think we had a good game
plan, but if the weak side wasn't there or if there was pressure on the ball,
sometimes we would get there, but I think we did pretty well.  
  
Q. For any of the players, just talk about what you have to go through
Tuesday and what you're up against playing the host team and playing ‑‑ you're
the 2 seed, they're the 7 seed. Just talk about that and having to play on the
road.   
BRIA HOLMES: Well, I think this team is used to playing away in front of big
crowds on someone else's home floor, and we usually tend to focus a lot more.
Coach Carey tells us that when we're away or playing in front of a big crowd,
we focus more than we do at home. If we just keep that pattern, I think we'll
be fine on Tuesday.  
  
Q. Christal, I know you guys have talked throughout the season about maybe
you enjoy the pressure of a closer game and certainly you let them back into
it in this one, but what was the discussion in team huddles and timeouts that
you made sure you came back and didn't let this get completely the other way
around?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: Well, enjoying close games and this game I think is like
completely different, but we just stuck it out and we came together in huddles
and just said, listen, we can't let this one get away and they're not going to
give up, which they didn't, so we just had to come together as a team and come
out with a victory.  
  
Q. Christal and Averee, what was the mood like in the locker room afterward?
Coach carry mentioned he's confident you guys will play better Tuesday
night.  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: I think that we were excited we got the win and we took
care of business, but we definitely were like we won this game we've got to
move on to the next one, so we're focused and we have a goal ahead of us and
we can't let these teams stop us from getting there (that was Averee, all the
unidentified players were).  
  
Q. Christal, how much is this a confidence builder for you shooting wise?
You struggled a little bit in Oklahoma City with your shot.  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: Well, I just tried not to think about it as much and just‑‑
if I hit the shot, okay, if I don't, then help my team in other ways. But it
always feels good to make shots and just to be able to help your team.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the run, their big girl goes to the bench. What were
you able to take advantage of when you thought the game was going to be out of
reach? What were the keys to that big run in the first half?  
MIKE CAREY: I thought we passed the ball extremely well, and we attacked. The
question was asked here of the players, their press, was it that much better
the second half than the first half, and absolutely it wasn't. We just started
passing back and forth instead of attacking it. We got the lead, and we
normally don't do that when we get a lead. We try to build on a lead. But we
just started getting a little bit lazy with our passes, instead of attacking,
throwing over the top and getting two on ones and that type of stuff. So I
thought that was the thing.  
And then I thought we were passing well, we were hitting in the middle and we
were passing the ball and we were hitting some shots. Defensively the second
half I thought the adjustment we made, instead of fronting and stuff, we just
tried to push their big girl off the block a little bit and stay in behind
her.  
  
Q. You talked about the respect factor and all that coming into this one.
Clearly any team can beat any team in the tournament. How do you use this one
and say you can't overlook anybody, there won't be any 15 seeds from this
point on?  
MIKE CAREY: Yeah, nothing against Albany, but we play like that, LSU will beat
us. Let's just face it. We're going to have to play for 40 minutes. It's going
to have to be a 40‑minute game and play hard for 40 minutes and concentrate
and attack for 40 minutes and play defense for 40 minutes. It's going to be a
tough game. We knew it was going to be. Give Albany, again, a lot of respect.
They didn't give. They come out the second half and took it right to us. We
can't let LSU do that to us. They have some big bodies, also, and have some
people that can score and drive it and that type of stuff. We're going to have
to play a lot better.  
  
Q. That said, do you think this team is okay playing ugly at times, if you
will? You will get the final numbers with Asya and her numbers and Bria
struggling like she normally does from outside shooting and you still found a
way to win.  
MIKE CAREY: Yeah, for you that followed us throughout the year, we played a
lot of ugly games and still was able to win. You know, we really don't get
caught up in pretty. I'd rather win ugly than lose pretty. You know, I think
our team understands that. When we're not playing well, we still have to play
defense. We still have to rebound, and we've got to shut‑‑ if we're not
scoring, we can't let them score, so those things are big for us when we're
not playing well.  
  
Q. You got Lanay in early today and it seemed like she battled pretty well.
What did you think of her performance?  
MIKE CAREY: Well, she just felt she was our next best match‑up when Asya got
in foul trouble because of her height and long arms and that. She was the next
best match‑up. I thought until she got tired‑‑ when she was fresh in there, I
thought she did a pretty good job.  
  
Q. Are you disappointed with the way you played today, or would you have
been surprised if you had come out here and won by ‑‑ gotten up by 22 in the
first half and won by 44?   
MIKE CAREY: I mean, I think you all know me, I'm never satisfied. Am I happy
with the way we played the second half? Absolutely not, because if we play
that way against LSU we're going to get beat. You know, again, we have not
played for two weeks. We got up by 20, 21, 22 points, and it just seems like
we got in a little bit of foul trouble, and then I told them after the game,
people coming off the bench, you've got to come in and give us a spark. We
can't come in and lose a lead because we have somebody in foul trouble. That's
something we've done a pretty good job of all year. We'll be fine. I'm not
worried about it. Did we play well, no, but Albany probably had a lot to do
with that. Do we have to play better against LSU, absolutely.

### [Nikki Caldwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21947)

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

LSU  98  
Georgia Tech  78

  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Today this team showed a lot of toughness, and they showed
that they can play this game for 40 minutes, and a lot of credit to Georgia
Tech. With their defensive pressure and their defensive scheme, I felt our
team handled that pressure very well, and again, this group has shown that
they cannot only score the basketball when they need to but they also can
defend it when they need to, and we did a nice job of getting on the boards.
We did a nice job of sharing the basketball and just playing together as a
team.  
  
Q. For Theresa and Danielle, based on how you guys finished the season,
struggling down the stretch, how important was it for you to come in here and
establish yourself how you guys played early in the year, dominance on both
ends, pushing the both, playing with a lot of confidence?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, coming off of that streak that we weren't very proud
of, they came into practice with the mindset that we had a lot of things we
had to work on, and at practice we really put an emphasis on the fundamentals
and a lot of things we really got away from, partner passing and as simple as
that, boxing out dribbles, things that we really took for granted and cost us
in the end. Just worried about those things in our off week really helped us
out, especially in this game going against a Georgia Tech team who averaging
about 20 offensive rebounds a game. They do a great job of getting on the
boards, and that was one of our things that we had to really buckle down on.  
But coming into a first‑round game we really wanted to put our all into it and
let people know that this isn't the same team you saw two weeks ago. We've
completely transformed ourselves into‑‑ I feel like we're a more mature team
now. We're just going to build off of this win and just let the momentum take
us.  
DANIELLE BALLARD: In the past we wasn't really getting rebounds, so every day
we come to practice working on our defense, trying to get our defense down
pat, especially getting rebounds so we do defensive drills, and each and every
day we improve, and it showed today on the court that we went hard and we was
aggressive on and off, offense and defense, and it just showed all the hard
work we had in practice. It showed in this game.  
  
Q. Danielle, it looked like you all were really pushing the pace early,
trying to set the tone. Is that something you've wanted to do before the game,
and how did that really set the tone and help you get off to that early
start?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: We were just sticking to the game plan. On film we saw that
we could push down, push down, and after seeing in the game we kept going,
kept doing it, and they kept getting exhausted and we just kept trying to
doing what was best for us, and that was to push down on offense and keep
getting them tired because we was running each and every day of practice so we
was in better shape than they was. I felt like we had the upper hand on that.  
  
Q. Danielle, just how comfortable do you feel in transition, creating
offense, you were scoring both ways. How much does that play into the way you
like to play basketball, the way you played today?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: Well, like I said before, if I get stops, I pass it back to
a shooter. If I don't get a stop, I just continue laying it up. This is my
job, just penetrating and getting my players open and getting them open shots,
being unselfish with the ball.  
  
Q. This question is for Shanece. I'm just wondering, are you surprised at
this effort today, what you guys did today?  
SHANECE McKINNEY: Absolutely not. We went into this game thinking that it
wouldn't be (inaudible), so we had it in our heads that we'll be playing on
Tuesday, so the effort was definitely there today.  
  
Q. Theresa, there was that three ‑minute stretch in the first half after you
had that big lead that they started coming back and y'all couldn't find a
bucket and then DeShawn came in and got three quick baskets for you. How big
was that to get y'all back in the game and back really with your foot on the
pedal?   
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, first of all, I want to say that coming into this
game our guards really set the tone for us. Danielle was doing a great job of
creating for herself, and after she started creating for herself, everyone
else started opening up, and that's when DaShawn started getting her shots.
Early on DaShawn was hitting, and Danielle and Day had the hot hands so we
knew we needed to get the ball to them. In that little segment where we really
couldn't get a stop, I saw a team that wasn't a team that you would normally
see. When stuff like that happens we used to crumble when adversity hit, and
today we pushed through it. Coming in, going back down on offense, DaShawn
hitting that three, that was a very momentum‑changing shot. That really got
our bench on their feet, and everybody else like springing back on defense
trying to get back into a stance, trying to get a stop so we could go on a
little run.  
But that really started with the push the tempo of Danielle Ballard. She did a
great job of pushing the tempo, and they really didn't have an answer for her.
She did a great job today.  
  
Q. Talk about this being a big goal for you to make sure you got that second
game.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, you know, coming into the P‑MAC it's always nice to
play in front of our crowd. I love these people here. They're a big part of
the reason why I came here, just the fan support and the support of everyone.
You can walk into a store and they'll be like, oh, you play on Sunday, good
luck, thanks. Just little things like that that really makes this place
special. Being able to have that second opportunity to play in our home is
unbelievable to us. It's something that we don't take for granted, and we
really look forward to playing in front of these people that care so much
about it, and in return we want to do the best we can so we keep them on their
feet and keep them excited but we're just a tumbleweed, and when they go, we
go, and it really helps us out.  
  
Q. Shanece or Theresa, can you talk about a point guard leading the
rebounds?  
SHANECE McKINNEY: Well, I just feel like we can do the dirty work and let the
guards come in and get the rebounds. It's okay with me as long as we get the
rebound.  
I know that usually people think the bigs are the ones that should get the
rebounds, but we actually wanted to clear out the other big people so Danielle
could get 25.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Danielle just did a great job on boards like she always
does. That's another weapon of Danielle Ballard, the fact that she's such a
great rebounder. Danielle comes in out of absolutely nowhere and tries to tip
in. She's not scared of big bodies in the paint, she's not scared of contact.
Danielle is really fearless when it comes to rebounding. She did a great job
for us on the offensive end and the defensive end. 17 rebounds is outstanding
for anybody, much less a guard, but it was really not shocking coming from
Danielle. She's just a great athlete, and rebounding is one of her strengths.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask Danielle, Georgia Tech is such a guard ‑oriented team,
was it a challenge for yourself and the other guards to one‑up them a little
bit because there was so much of a focus on stopping their guards?   
DANIELLE BALLARD: Yeah, Georgia Tech has some awesome guards. They can defend.
It was very hard going against them. We had to be really focused on what we
wanted to do, either take or pass out, but it was very difficult going against
these girls. There are some good players on their team. Again, my props to
them because they're good, too.  
  
Q. Danielle, the other coach said that the team that LSU was tonight was not
the team she saw on film the last 10 or 12 games. Would you agree with her?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: Absolutely. This team is a different team. We had a
different mindset. We're going to come every game with a different mindset,
but it's just going to go‑‑ we're just going to look better each‑‑ we're just
going to go harder and harder. We just want to win. Going to take each game at
a time, just going to go hard and we're going to give our all. People are
going to continue seeing a different team. They're not going to see the same
team as they did today on Tuesday. We're going to be a different team every
day, and we'll continue going hard and staying together and just being one
family.  
  
Q. Coach, who was that LSU team out there today, and where has that team
been over the last 10 or 12 games?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: The team that you saw tonight has been there. We have been
there for 20 minutes here, 30 minutes. They just put together a 40‑minute
effort as a team.  
Georgia Tech really did a nice job of attacking offensively with their
different weapons with their guard play, and we did, we challenged our guards
from the time we left the SEC Tournament to try to be the best guard play,
because you go as far as your guards go, and I thought that was evident. I
thought Ballard set the tone for us, but she's been setting it in practice.
Jeanne Kenney, being able to play her off the ball allowed us to do a lot of
different things in that regard. I like the play of Shanece McKinney night
how. She's really being aggressive, not only offensively, but defensively
she's become that stopper for us.  
Players are becoming who they have always been. They're just realizing it now,
and better late than never. That's what I tell them. I'm proud of this group
for playing this game with high intensity for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Coach, were you curious on how this team was going to respond to how they
finished the season? And also, all the players talked about how things were
different in practice. It was more intense, a lot of running. What changed
about practice that kind of turned the light on this team?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, we had 11 days to practice, and we didn't have to worry
about a game the next day or have to taper or things like that. We were able
to stay with certain action, and the two things that we really stressed was
our defense and our board play. We wanted to control the boards, and tonight
we did that. If you can control the boards, you can control the tempo of the
game. We did a nice job of keeping a very offensive team off the glass and not
allowing them to score as much as we've done in the past.  
We've had a tough schedule. I think the one thing that I told this group is
having coached, played, won SEC championships, our last several games, that's
a tough stretch, and if you add the SEC Tournament play, a lot of teams would
have struggled with that schedule, too. When you look at playing at Kentucky,
at Texas A&M, at Georgia, Alabama, who's really come along with Coach Curry,
and then having to play two No.1 seeds, Tennessee twice and South Carolina.  
So I told our team, our record should not reflect who we are as competitors,
and I wanted to make sure that they understood that, that they are one of the
best teams in the country, and when they play for 40 minutes and they put
their mind to it and their heart that they can beat anybody in the country.  
  
Q. Did you feel like you could outrun them today? Was that the case?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: We felt as though we conditioned and have been conditioned to
keep that pace. We talked about that at halftime, and I knew Ballard had
logged a lot of minutes, but she's playing at a different level of
competitiveness, so she was going to push through. And we pushed them these
last 11 days, and I think that is something that they were able to draw on,
and we talked about it and said, some of you guys ran track, and it's going to
be a track meet out there.  
The team that really pushes through that point of exhaustion can come up with
those easy baskets, make those lay‑ups, get some run‑outs, and we were able to
do that. Our strength and conditioning coach has done a great job of training
our team mentally and physically, and we continue to weight train through the
season, we try to go two, sometimes three times a week to maintain, but we
also have a little bit more depth this year than we did last year around this
time.  
When you've got 10, 11 bodies that can get out there, you're not as afraid, if
you will, as a coach to say, hey, let's run.  
  
Q. You've said all year this team is still looking for a complete 40 ‑minute
game. Was this either the closest you've seen to that or was this a complete
40‑minute game?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: I felt it was the closest that I've seen, although they made
some runs in the game. It's a game of runs, and Georgia Tech is a very good
basketball team. Watching them on film, their ability to score the basketball
with three go‑tos on the perimeter, that's a tough task for any team to
defend.  
Again, we talked about the board play. We said if we can just control the
boards, we'll have a shot. So our team did a very nice job of executing that
aspect of the game, and then this time of year you've got to make lay‑ups and
free throws. Our game plan wasn't to just settle and shoot jump shots. We
wanted to get to the basket and go score, and they did just that.  
  
Q. Two things: First, Moncrief, what's the best update you can give us on
her, and second, just your take on the all ‑cart game of Danielle today?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, Moncrief, we're going to have her‑‑ obviously we didn't
want to do anything because we don't know what's going on exactly right now,
but we're going to have her looked at tomorrow, so we'll know more about that
tomorrow. We're just going to stay hopeful, and obviously she's somebody who
is just a tremendous asset to our team. She's a player that is explosive to
watch. She's such a great athlete. But she's also a great teammate, and I know
that whatever the outcome, we're going to be behind her 100 percent, and she's
going to be that player that's going to be‑‑ if she's missing or if we don't
have her, she's going to be that player that's going to be jumping up,
cheering her teammates on.  
Ballard just played like a woman possessed. She played like somebody that
said, I can't be denied. And when you have your point guard playing with that
type of attitude, that mentality, it filters throughout our team, and so she
did set the tone for us that we can be aggressive against their pressure,
against their press, against their buzz defense, that she took it upon herself
to be that player that I'm going to get‑‑ go to the glass as hard as I can,
and obviously 17 rebounds, that's tremendous. She's just that player that is a
very special player.  
  
Q. When a point guard rebounds like that, does it ever worry you about
getting back on defense?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: That's where Jeanne Kenney comes in to play. We've made Jeanne
Kenney our safety, and we send her back. It's a game of numbers. If you're
going to crash and force the boards, you hope that you're going to come up
with it. Our goal was to come up with 50 percent of our missed shots. But if
you do crash the boards and they get the rebound, it is going to put a little
bit more pressure on our transition defense, but we were coming up with it,
and it worked.  
  
Q. Georgia Tech's coach said that over the last 10 games she's watched of
you guys, this was a totally different LSU team than what she saw on video.
How much is winning in this kind of environment as much about an element of
surprise as it is about fundamental basketball?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, I'll tell you, you look at our last game before Georgia
Tech, and we were playing Tennessee in the second round of play at the
tournament, and the first 20 minutes of that game was similar to what we did
today. We were able to extend ourselves early, were able to set the tone. We
were attacking their pressure. We just didn't sustain it. That's what we did
today. We sustained it.  
So yes, she's right. She probably hadn't seen a team, our team, at its very
best for 40. But there's always been that turning point where we know, okay,
if we can get from 20 to 30 to 40‑minute game that we can pretty much play
with anybody.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

West Virginia  76  
Albany  62

  
KATIE ABRAHAM‑HENDERSON: Well, obviously I'm very proud of them. I thought
they competed completely until the end. They came out fighters, and finished
as fighters, and I thought they represented the America East very proudly,
which I know all the coaches in the America East were very proud of us, and I
know our commissioner Amy is very proud of us, so we came out and we competed
and represented our team very well and the America East very well.  
I think that‑‑ and I told our team this, I think that we were a 15 seed
because we lost some games that we shouldn't have lost, and we should have
been a 15 seed. But talent‑wise and competitive‑wise, we weren't really a 15
seed. It really showed out there.  
I think West Virginia is a great team, but what it did for our team was prove
to each and every one of them that they can play against anybody at any time,
as long as you just fight and you play hard and stick to our system. I think
we did a great job. I mean, we out‑scored them in the second half 36‑34, and
that started with defense and obviously finished with offense. It hurt having
la Reese out. It hurt not having her out there, because that's 23 points a
game, but I thought everybody else stepped out and had each other's backs and
did a lot of great things out there for our team, so I'm very proud of them. I
know our athletic director Lee McElroy is very proud of them and his wife,
Karen, and just all the families that were there, and we're truly grateful for
all the support we had when we were here. There were some purple fans out
there cheering for us from LSU, too. I'm very proud of them, and they're
wonderful, empowered young women.  
  
Q. Megan, you get the second foul and you have to go to the bench and you
see them go on that run. What's going through your head when you're not out on
the court?  
MEGAN CRAIG: Obviously it sucks not being out there because I need to be out
there for my team. But what's going through my head is as soon as I get out
there I need to just play smart, stay poised, play smart and keep my hands up
because I knew if I got in foul trouble I could hurt my team. Knowing I could
be in as soon as I could, I was just waiting for that and waiting for that
moment to come.  
  
Q. Shereesha, you were playing with foul trouble all night and even before
that you couldn't get in an offensive rhythm. What was going through your
head?  
SHEREESHA RICHARDS: I just knew that I needed to play smarter, and I think I
just‑‑ I'm too aggressive sometimes. That's kind of my downfall, I think. I'm
so aggressive, I just want to make everything happen.  
Being in foul trouble was bad on my part because it was kind of selfish for my
teammates because I know they needed me out there. But at the same time it's
already done. All I had to do was go out wherever I'm in and do whatever I
could.  
  
Q. You look across the stat box and free ‑throw shooting tonight (inaudible)
how much do you think that affected the ballgame, not being able to hit free
throws to stop that run?   
SHEREESHA RICHARDS: Free throws tonight, man, our free throws just wouldn't
fall tonight, and we worked on it. We did free throw, free throw, and we know
that that's where it was going to be, at the free‑throw line, but we just
couldn't make it. We just couldn't make our free throws tonight.  
SARAH ROYALS: We didn't step up and make the shots. I mean, me too, myself
included. But West Virginia is a very aggressive team, and we knew they were
going to foul a lot. All we did all week was work on free throws, and
sometimes when the moment comes, got to knock it down, and we didn't, but yes,
I think if we had made all our free throws we could have won the game, and we
missed almost 50 percent of them. So making those definitely would have had a
big impact.  
  
Q. What was the message in the huddles when you went down by so much in the
first half and at halftime? What was the message? Was it come out and keep
fighting the second half?  
MEGAN CRAIG: Obviously it was just to stay poised. We didn't play our game and
stay in control and not let anything affect us. Especially coming out at
halftime the score was 0‑0 for us. We had to stay poised, stay in control for
the pressure that was going to be coming our way, but we knew we had to be in
control of ourselves. We were trying to take the correct shots, play the great
defense that we could and just play the game that we could pull off.  
  
Q. Sarah and Shereesha, how much different was it when Megan was on the
bench defensively there?  
SARAH ROYALS: When Megan is not in the game it makes a world of difference,
even for scouting. Not many people can simulate the presence that Megan has.
You can pretend that, well, I can shoot over her or anything, but the reality
is when you're in the paint and you see someone that's 6'9", you're trying to
pass it out. I think we did a great job on No.20. She is their leading scorer,
and we held her to three points, and that's due in part a lot to Megan.
Everyone second‑guesses themselves every time they go in the point, and with
her in the paint that's how Reese and Imani and Tammy, that's how they go and
get those steals because they know that Megan has their back. If they get
beat, then Megan is there to clean it up and get the rebound, and when she's
not in there we are much smaller. We're very aggressive, we are still great
rebounders, but we are a lot smaller, and I think that changes the mentality
of the offense playing against us.  
  
Q. When they went on that long run did you consider putting Megan back in
earlier?  
KATIE ABRAHAM‑HENDERSON: Yeah, I mean, it's a Catch 22 because I put Shereesha
back in and she got her third foul and she was diving for loose balls.
Obviously if coaches knew the magic answer, then we'd be millionaires and
everybody would want to do this.  
But yeah, I mean, I go back and forth. You go back and forth. I thought Tammy
really stepped up. Tammy is a 3 guard, she's 6 foot and she's playing the 4
and she's getting rebounds. What did she have, nine rebounds for us, so she
really stepped up. It's just you just never know how the game is going to go.
Shereesha is super aggressive, but she's right, that is her downfall, which is
a great downfall, but I knew once I put Megan back in, he's a great coach,
he's going to go at her and try to get her in foul trouble. I put Reese back
in, she got a foul, and I put Megan back in. Obviously they're the anchor of
our team, so a lot of games that we struggled they were out there on the
floor, so we've really had to teach them to try to not be so aggressive and
play straight up and try to‑‑ Megan is more moving your feet correctly and
getting in the right spots. Reese is just like calm down, calm down, because
she wants to win the game in five minutes. But I thought we adjusted well.
They weren't even out there and we were pressing great. It was great watching
our guards up there just pressing and getting steals. It makes the game
exciting to watch like that.  
  
Q. You get it to 56 ‑51, seven minutes left, but then they get it back to
double digits and it was basically almost done after that. How much of it was
just so much energy to get to that point? Was the team out of energy or was it
something that you saw or was it just all the energy getting it to that point?
  
KATIE ABRAHAM‑HENDERSON: Shereesha was on the bench, so the score was
different. But we were up and they were breaking it a little bit, you know
what I mean, but all of our plays we were having to go to Megan or to Sarah.
Most of our plays go to Reese, that's our No.1 option, and then it goes to
Megan and then it goes to Sarah. And so obviously down the stretch you saw I
was trying to get Sarah and Megan the ball as much as we could. You know, it
was tough having her out of there, but she's just super aggressive, and I
thought that our team did a great job, and their team did a great job. Their
go‑to player had 26 points and their second go‑to player had 20. So they did a
great job offensively.  
  
Q. Did you feel anything in particular was working well for you in the
second half when you were coming back, anything that you were doing to them
that was affecting them?  
KATIE ABRAHAM‑HENDERSON: Our press. I didn't really think that we could press
them like that to be honest, but we were in a dog fight. We had to do
something different. We had to change the momentum of the game. We had to get
up and press them a little bit more. And obviously some of their players
played for 34, 35 minutes. Obviously their bench is a little bit deeper than
ours, but I was proud that we could get up and press like that. I actually
told my assistant coach, ha ha, I told you we could do that, but she was like,
I don't know if we're going to do that. But I thought we could get up and
press them a little bit. A lot of you haven't seen us play a lot, but that's
kind of our mojo. That's kind of what we do. We get up and we put a lot of
pressure because we really need to keep Megan out of foul trouble. A lot of
people try to go at her, so we try to play up and press and it's a lot of fun.
Our players like it. They get a lot of energy. Gosh, Megs and Margarita and
Sarah played 40 minutes of that, so they're tough. That's tough to do against
a Big 12 team. I'm so proud of them. And Tammy played 40 minutes. 40 minutes
of pressing like that is way different than sitting back and just playing zone
defense or sitting back and playing man. We were up pressing for 20 minutes
the second half, 20 minutes straight. They didn't fit, they were playing as
hard as they could, they were diving for loose balls. I told them I wanted
even more purple on the floor, get those loose balls. That's what we did in
halftime, I said get after it. We have nothing to lose, so let's go for it.  
  
Q. Last year you lost by five, right, to North Carolina?  
KATIE ABRAHAM‑HENDERSON: Yeah.  
  
Q. Do you feel after this game that you are closer maybe to breaking through
and getting the win even though the point differential was a little bit more?
Especially with the experience that you guys have now, like you said, you have
a lot of returning players next year.  
KATIE ABRAHAM‑HENDERSON: I feel like it's exactly the same to be honest, like
our free throws, again, and we were shooting free throws and free throws and
free throws. I said, maybe we shouldn't shoot this many free throws this week.
You've got to make 10 in a row before you leave, you've got to make 10 in a
row. I think it's kind of the same. It was a lot of the same, but we were
going into‑‑ we went into the post. Last year we could shoot some threes a
little bit more with Lindsey Lowrie and Ebony and Julie, but I thought we
could run our sets a little bit more this year. Last year it wasn't easy to
run our sets against North Carolina, so we learned from that. It had nothing
to do with West Virginia. I think they did great, but we were able to run our
normal sets this year, where last year it wasn't as good.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: First of all, we're just very excited to be back in the NCAA
Tournament after six straight trips and sitting out last year, to be back for
the seventh time in eight years is just very exciting for our program. We felt
like that year we had off made us more hungry, and I really give my players a
lot of credit because they did a lot of work in the off season to turn things
around and get us back in the NCAA Tournament. We've obviously had some very
good play down the stretch against Florida State. We lost our starting point
guard in Sydney Wallace and she wasn't able to play the last three games. I
think it showed a lot of poise and composure and strength of our team to go
ahead and win two games without her. Obviously we lost a game that was
disappointing to us against Duke in the ACC Tournament, but I think that loss
really turned things around for us the last couple weeks. We've had some very
good practices and feel like we're playing our best basketball at the right
time.  
  
Q. Sydney, can you just talk about how you feel now at this point coming
into the tournament?  
SYDNEY WALLACE: Well, I feel good. I've taken the right steps and everything
in getting back to where I need to be, just resting and making sure I'm doing
what I need to do and just gradually getting back to where I was before,
getting up shots, kind of just sitting down and learning and watching, also. I
feel like I'm ready, and I'm ready to play. I'm good.  
  
Q. MaChelle, talk about having to play on someone else's home court. It
usually happens every year in the women's tournament and it's something you
have to deal with. What do you tell your players?  
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: It's interesting, we've had a lot of experience at this in
our seven trips. We've probably played on a home court five of the seven
times. But we understand where women's basketball is at this point. We
understand it's not something that's ideal but it's something that's
necessary. We're trying to grow our game. We've got to do what's best for our
game at this point. And it's one of things where you would like to be on a
neutral floor, but you're not so you have to embrace the opportunity you've
been given. We've had success at this, so it's one of those things we don't
really talk about. It's just like for us it's another ACC game on the road.
It's a very good match‑up for us, and we're excited to be here and have a
great opportunity to play in front of some great fans. LSU does a great job
drawing attendance give and we're going to embrace this opportunity and go out
tomorrow and give them the best effort we have.  
  
Q. How do you feel about next year going back to the old format? Do you feel
like that's a positive move or do you think eventually ‑‑ do you see this
tournament being on all neutral sites at some point?   
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: Well, to answer your first question, as far as going to the
top seeds hosting, I think I like that better because I do think that they've
earned those seeds. They've earned those rights to host if you're a top seed,
then you've earned that right.  
As far as the second, I would like to believe that long‑term that the women's
game will grow to the point where we won't have to be on home courts and we
can have neutral sites. That's what we're doing right now, is trying to grow
our game and get to that point where we can copy what the men have done and
draw enough fans that we can play on neutral floors.  
  
Q. Obviously they have experienced guards, they've got post play and then
you've got someone who can step outside and shoot from the perimeter. Just
talk about what you see and the challenges they present.  
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: Well, LSU is a veteran team. They play a lot of seniors. They
have a lot of upperclassmen. Their go‑to players are both seniors that have
played together a long time. Obviously we have a lot of respect for the SEC
and the teams in that conference, so we understand that they're a very
competitive team with a lot of different weapons. It's just‑‑ I've watched
probably 10 games that they've played this year, and I feel that it's a very
good match‑up for us. I think that the strength of their team is their guard
play, and obviously they have the inside presence, but she is more of a
face‑up post player. I consider it a perimeter game mostly for LSU and for us.  
So we like that. I feel like in postseason, you get to postseason with inside
play, but you win in the postseason with guards, and I think I'd put our
guards up against anybody in the country at this point.  
  
Q. Ms.Marshall or Ms.Wallace, talking about guard play, there seems to be a
lot of intrigue in the match ‑up with LSU guards, and I wonder how you think
about how that's going to dictate what happens in the game?   
TYAUNNA MARSHALL: I think when you play anybody, you have to have respect for
whoever you're playing, but me and Syd being experienced, and we've been here
before, and then Kaela who's a hard‑working player that she is, we're going to
come in and play our game regardless of who we are going up against. We have
respect and we're going to give 100 percent regardless.  
  
Q. This question is for Ty. If you had a word or a phrase that you would use
to describe this year's Rambling Wreck, Georgia Tech, what would that be,
please?  
TYAUNNA MARSHALL: I think if I had a word, I guess I would choose resilient.
The things that we've been through over the past year, you think about this
year and the games that we played, just being resilient, getting back to where
we want to be, getting back to the postseason, that was our focus from the
jump to getting back to playing in the NCAA Tournament. So we were resilient
enough, to play games that we lost and we battled back from it. Coach always
said, it's not what happens, it's how you respond and we've responded well
over the past year.  
  
Q. This question is for Kaela. If you had to describe to someone who hadn't
seen your teammate Ty play yet, what would you say about what we are prepared
to see from her this weekend?  
KAELA DAVIS: I mean, Ty is amazing. She's just an amazingly hard worker. She's
just an example of how the game should be played at any level. Obviously
within our program specifically, but she plays hard, and she's all over the
place, and it's a show. It's an exciting show for sure. I'd be excited to see
it.  
  
Q. MaChelle, you've scored 90 points at least seven times this year,
averaged about 80 points a game, and this is an LSU team that's struggled with
rebounding, struggled with turnovers. Is that fast pace something you're going
to want to establish in a game like this?  
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: Well, it's been an interesting year for us because we built
this program on defense and rebounding and we never really won games
outscoring people. Well, with Ty Marshall coming back being our all‑time
leading scorer in the history of our program and Kaela Davis coming in as a
freshman and being a prolific scorer for a freshman, she's scored the most
points of any freshman to ever play at Georgia Tech, and Ty is our all‑time
leading scorer and then Sydney Wallace, who is a prolific scorer as well,
we've been able to win games on the offensive end, and that's been exciting
for me, because obviously I love offense, but back when we started this
program we didn't have those types of players. So this year has been exciting
down the stretch like you mentioned, before Sydney had her injury, we were
scoring pretty well, amazingly well, and it's one of those things where we
feel very confident now on the offensive end. We've seen a lot of zones, a lot
of junk defense, a lot of the things we know that LSU are going to throw at
us. It won't be the first time we've seen them. That's what the ACC does for
us. It prepares us for games like this. There's nothing really at this point
in the season that somebody can do to us that we haven't seen all year long.
We're excited about the match‑up. We have tremendous respect for what LSU has
been able to accomplish this season, but we feel like we're playing our best
basketball, and we're ready for the match‑up.  
  
Q. Ty, if you could, I know we talked a little bit about LSU's guards, talk
about your impressions of Danielle Ballard?  
TYAUNNA MARSHALL: She's a very strong point guard, somebody we watched tape
on. We know we have to box out and she's a great rebounding guard. Like I say,
we're coming in strong. We're just going to play our game, regardless of who
we're going up against.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
MIKE CAREY: Well, we're excited to be here. We know it's going to be a great
tournament. Our players did a great job this year, and hopefully we can come
in here and play well. But we're excited, and Albany, we know they're a great
team. They won their league, won their tournament. We give them a lot of
respect, and we know it's going to be a tough game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Mike and for any of the players, this Albany team doesn't seem like a
typical 15 seed. They've got the No.2 scorer in Division 1. What do you have
to do to stop Richards?  
MIKE CAREY: Well, she's very athletic, runs the floor extremely well, posts.
They're always looking to lob to her and the other post players. They do a
good job. I think they all know their roles and they know where the ball needs
to go and that type of stuff.  
We played against a lot of good athletes during the course of the season, so
we've seen players like her, and it's a tough match‑up, and we know‑‑ you're
exactly right, they have some very good basketball players.  
  
Q. Mike, I'm sure you've been asked variations of this question before, but
just given where the program is now, how much is this month about opening eyes
nationally? I know within the sport itself what you guys have done is pretty
well known.  
MIKE CAREY: Well, we really don't want to be like a Louisville‑‑ no, I'm just
kidding (laughter). That's not our goal, believe me.  
We feel like we've still got a lot to prove. We still don't get a lot of
respect throughout the country and that type of stuff. We are in our second
year in the Big 12, so you know, we had to go prove ourselves in that league,
coming from the Big East. Our girls are hungry. They understand that we have a
lot to prove, and we haven't proved anything yet. This tournament is very
important, but everybody starting out is going to play their best basketball
and play extremely hard, so we realize that.  
  
Q. Each of the players, do you guys feel the pressure for the most part is
something that's more self ‑inflicted than anything? How do you view that?   
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: I would think so, coming in as a higher seed, you
automatically think that people think you're supposed to win that game, but
you can't look at it that way. Like Coach Carey said they're a great team, and
it's tournament time now, so everyone is going to give you their best shot and
you can't put too much pressure on yourself thinking about it.  
  
Q. I'm sure you saw a lot of the upsets yesterday on the men's side. Does it
kind of drive home the point if you don't play your best basketball each time
‑out that you're going to be going home?   
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: Yeah, definitely. I mean, like coach was saying, this is
a fresh start. Everybody is going to play their best basketball right now. It
doesn't really matter what you did the rest of the season. This is important.
It's a one‑and‑done now, so everybody wants to be a national champion, so
they're going to go and play like it.  
  
Q. This is for each of the players. If you could give me a word or a phrase
that you would use to describe this year's team and a little bit on why you
picked that. It could all be the same word, but I just like to throw it out,
especially to senior leaders.  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: I'll go ahead and say fighters. I think there was so many
times where we could have given up but we didn't and came back and won the
game. Definitely this team knows how to fight and just stick it out for 40
minutes.  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: I would say fearless. You put us up against some of the
top teams in our conference and in the country and we don't back down. It's
going to be, like Christal said, a fight the whole game, and we give our all,
and we're going to play until the end, so we're definitely fearless. We don't
really care about who we're playing. We're going to go out there and get it.  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: I would just say heart. I think we play with a lot of
heart, and this season we came in and we just knew that we had a great team
and we were just going to go out there and have goals that we just needed to
accomplish.  
  
Q. Asya, what have you seen from Richards on film? What have you seen that
gets her going and what can you do defensively to neutralize her?  
ASYA BUSSIE: I think it'll just be a team effort. Our guards have to get their
hands up and we have to play West Virginia defense. That's what we pride
ourselves on, so just helping each other out and just defending as a team.  
  
Q. For each of the players and also Asya, last year you obviously had to sit
and watch the transition to the Big 12 and that probably wasn't what you all
wanted in Year 1. What did you take away from last year's .500 start in the
Big 12 and carry forward to this year?  
ASYA BUSSIE: Just learning from last season. We knew what we did wrong, and
like some of the things that we needed to change and we had to play for
ourselves. The coaches, they can only do but so much. They're on the sideline
coaching. We have to play for ourselves and we have to be motivated. So I
think we realized how important each game was and just it's upon ourselves how
far we want to go.  
  
Q. Asya, I know you go against the 6'7 " girl from Texas, you go against a
6'9" girl tomorrow. Talk a little bit about the challenges that presents and
how maybe you have to hold to your game a little bit when you're playing
against somebody who's that much taller than you.   
ASYA BUSSIE: The challenge is definitely just the height challenge, but like I
said, the biggest thing will just be the guards helping, trying to get them to
have their hands up so they can't throw too many lobs. Just try to stay out of
foul trouble. That would be my biggest goal, and just being straight up and
make the shot difficult for her.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you get tired of hearing the question comparing the Big 12
to the Big East, but how did that change the program and what sort of an
opportunity did it give you?  
MIKE CAREY: Yeah, I really don't comment on Big East was a great league, Big
12 is a great league. Both of them are great leagues. We're more in the
Midwest now and that type of stuff. I think the first year, too, of the Big 12
you had all new scouts, new styles, new coaches, just going and picking
hotels. Some of them were‑‑ we thought was close to the arenas and they really
weren't. I think some people told us on that purpose to be honest (laughing),
but you never know your first year when you go around. I just think it was an
adjustment period for the whole team, the staff and administration.  
  
Q. For all the seniors, we talked before the season started about the goals
you have this year and knowing that you don't get another shot. Christal, can
we start with you, how much do you feel like the fact that you have five
seniors who all play a big role on this team has gotten you to where you are
can be the reason why you go further than you have in the past?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: I was actually talking about this earlier with Brooke in
the room. We were talking about how experience can play a big role, and we
were looking at some of the NCAA guides and they were talking about big names
and stuff like that, but it just seems like experience plays a big role.
You've been in certain situations before, so you kind of know what to expect.
I think that's helped us a lot this year, and it's going to help us in the
tournament, as well.  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: Yeah, I agree. Experience is huge. Not only the
experience but the leadership out of the seniors, as well. You know, the
younger players, they listen, they're attentive, and like they understand what
we really want as a team. You know, it's more important, I guess, for the
seniors just because it's our last go around, but the whole team feels the
same way. We want this opportunity, and like you said, like Christal was
saying, we've been in these positions before, and it's going to be up to us to
lead the team and help them to get over some little humps that we see going
down the line.  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: I think having five seniors is good for the leadership
and experience. We're able to lead by example. But just as a team, I feel like
our team came together, not just the five seniors. For example, Averee has hit
a couple big shots for us to win tight games. She's vocal, and I think
everybody knows their role, not just the seniors, and I think that's what
makes our team so special.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about I think how they're sort of similar to TCU
in some ways. TCU had that zone disguised as a man that gave you some trouble
throughout the year. Can you speak to what Albany does?  
MIKE CAREY: Yeah, they're going to do a 2‑2‑1, different pressures out of a
2‑2‑1 back into their two‑three. They bring their forwards extremely high.
They get a lot of steals out of their zone because they come up high in their
zone, try to steal the reverse pass, skip passes and that type of stuff. We're
going to have to do a good job of taking care of the basketball, and you're
right, TCU, thanks for bringing that up, but TCU gave us a hard time the three
times we played them. There's no doubt that we'll have to adjust to their zone
and style and stuff.  
  
Q. Christal and Taylor, you guys have rallied back in those games this year.
Which one of those sticks out to you and speaks to the identity you're talking
about? Which game where you had to fight back?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: For me definitely Oklahoma. It could have been so easy for
us to just stop and just give up. We got down by so much. A lot of people were
in foul trouble. Just somehow we found a way to move on through the entire
game and pulled out a win.  
TAYLOR PALMER: I would say Texas. That was a close game, and we went into
overtime, and it was on our home court, too. It was a tough game the whole
game. Our shots weren't really falling, but we stuck it out and went into
overtime and pulled out a huge win, so I'd say Texas.  
MIKE CAREY: What we're laughing about, we played Oklahoma at Oklahoma and they
got 1.2 seconds, whatever, and so we just decided, okay, we're going to switch
everything. Well, Taylor tackled the girl, and she went to the foul line and
ended up missing the second one, so we turned around and we're playing Baylor
at Baylor, and there's like 1.3 seconds, and so I look at Taylor, and I said,
now I'm telling you, don't tackle that girl with this last 1.3 seconds, so
that's what they're laughing about.  
  
Q. Coach, if this was next year, I know it's not, but hypothetically you'd
be playing at home. Your thoughts on that move, and how do you feel about the
fact that potentially you could play on someone's home court like a lot of the
higher seeds?  
MIKE CAREY: You know, I think maybe since I've been at West Virginia, I think
we've played on somebody's home court every year but once, so I mean, it's
something that we've done.  
We've had opportunities where we could have hosted and that, but I was
always‑‑ until we become very, very consistent, I didn't want to look at the
athletic director knowing that we didn't make it and we owe all these
thousands of dollars. So that was pretty much my fault.  
But I felt it's tough. Any time you go play on somebody's home court it's
tough. But I will give this group‑‑ I've said this for two years. This group
is for some reason more focused on the road than they are at home. Next year
that may not be the case, so that may be a little bit different. But this
group for some reason the last two years has been more focused on the road
than they have been at home.  
  
Q. Asya, I understand you have a brother who's in Louisiana right now?  
ASYA BUSSIE: Yes.  
  
Q. They've been coming to a lot more of your games this year than we've seen
in the past. What's that meant to you your last season, to have them in the
stands?  
ASYA BUSSIE: It means a lot just because these are like the first games he's
been to since I've been at West Virginia, and he's been to quite a lot this
year. I appreciate him coming to these games, especially my senior year, and
just having him to give me feedback after games and him like motivating me
during the game.  
  
Q. Where is he right now?  
ASYA BUSSIE: New Orleans.  
  
Q. What's he do?  
ASYA BUSSIE: He's at GA at Xavier, in Louisiana.  
  
Q. Men's team?  
ASYA BUSSIE: Yes.  
  
Q. Coach Carey, obviously you're at LSU now. Did you ever have any thoughts
about, hey, you might see her when you came down here?  
MIKE CAREY: We wish her the best. It's probably good she had to sit out this
year, so we're not going to be playing against her. I wish her all the best. I
hope she has great success down here at LSU.  
  
Q. Did that cross your mind?  
MIKE CAREY: Not really. Not really. I'm usually out of sight, out of mind to
be honest with you. But no, I wish her‑‑ she's a great young lady. She'll do a
good job down here at LSU, so I wish her only the best.  
  
Q. It was nine years ago when you played Southwest Missouri State there for
the WNIT title. What do you remember about that ‑‑  
MIKE CAREY: They beat us, didn't they? Do you have any good news?  
  
Q. Any type of stuff you may remember that she was doing then?  
MIKE CAREY: She does a great job. They're very organized. Like I said,
everybody knows their role on the team. They take good shots. They play
extremely hard. They put people in the right position. They're well coached.  
I understand that, and we're going to have to play extremely well. You know,
at times we're going to have to hit some shots from the perimeter. I just
think we've got to be in attack mode against it. We always tell the players
when we're playing against a zone for 40 minutes, we'll make some misses,
let's push, let's try to push it up and make things happen before the zone can
set up. That'll be something that will be very important. And then we've got
to take care of the basketball against their 2‑2‑1\.  
  
Q. For Coach, your program seems to sort of adopt the mantra of us against
the world, having to fight. You're kind of on the cusp of flipping that. How
does that change the mentality in terms of coming to play? When do you make
that switch?  
MIKE CAREY: Well, we still have a lot to prove. We haven't done anything in
the NCAAs, and that's been under me. We've got a lot to prove. Our young
ladies, they've played extremely well and hard and the whole thing, but we
have some goals going forward here. We've just got to come out and play. We've
got to come out and do what we've done all year, and they mentioned about
heart and all that. This team probably has more heart, and there's times we
were down during the game, and I'm just there, and they'll come out of there,
Coach, we've got this. I'm like, well, could you do it before long? People are
going to battle and that.  
I want to mention about Asya. Even though she's going to be fronted and we
front, there's got to be weak side and there's got to be ball pressure. If
they're getting a lot of lobs inside, it's because of three things: We're not
putting ball pressure, we're not fronting well or we're not getting weak side
well. There's a lot of things. That's what Asya was talking about is a team
thing.  
  
Q. We're in the Maravich Center. Mike, did you follow Pete Maravich at
all?  
MIKE CAREY: Absolutely. His dad, he used to coach at D & E and West Virginia
there, so yeah, absolutely.  
You know, it's amazing, we'll bring recruits and players to West Virginia and
we'll say do you know who the NBA logo is, and they have no idea, and then you
say Jerry West, and they still have no idea. That's at our place.  
But I can remember being down here working camps at LSU when Craig Carse was
the assistant coach here under Dale Brown, so I've been down here a few times.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Extremely excited to be a participant in the NCAA Tournament.
This team has done a great job of positioning ourselves to compete. Very happy
for the other teams that are here in Baton Rouge, obviously West Virginia,
Albany and Georgia Tech. We wish them luck, as well. Again, when you think
about our team and you look at what this team has accomplished this year, for
the better part of the year, having the toughest schedule in the country,
playing in a very competitive conference in the SEC with the highest RPI
rating, it takes a tremendous athlete to be in this position, and we have a
tremendous team this year.  
  
Q. Theresa, they're such a good offensive rebounding team, and obviously
that's been a point of emphasis for you guys and a challenge for you this
season. Talk about what you tried to do in preparing for this game to be
better at that, and what do you think in terms of what makes them good at
being a rebounding team?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, our two points of emphasis for the past week have
been taking care of the ball and offensive rebounding especially. Coming from
their guard position, their guards do a great job of getting to the rim and
grabbing a lot of open boards for them. In practice we've been doing a lot of
drills that involved boxing out and also matching up out of the box‑out. Ty
does a great job of getting to the rim and so does 'Kilah, and we need to do a
better job of crashing defensively and snagging rebounds and finishing our
defense with a rebound because that ultimately will help us on the offensive
end.  
  
Q. Jeanne, can you draw on the experience of last year being at home and
going two for two and getting to the Sweet 16?  
JEANNE KENNEY: I love when people ask me that because I don't really remember
most of it. I do remember especially in the first game just the energy that
the crowd brought. It's like we have a sixth man on the court with us. I mean,
our fans have been with us for four years now for Theresa and I, and it's an
amazing feeling when you have that type of energy that they can bring, and it
gets me pumped up. I'm an emotional player, so I feed off that very easily?  
The second game Theresa might want to touch on that, but it was just an
amazing experience, and I'm really very honored that we got to leave here on
our home court.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, that second‑round match‑up against Penn State was a
tough one. We went in, one player less of the less players that we had, and
that game was all about determination and heart. We've been together, for our
seniors, and we just didn't want our seniors to go out on that note, and with
that crowd, with the fans, with the boosters, the people that stuck around
with us through our four years here, they really want the best for us, and
they really pulled us through that game. I honestly can't tell you how we won
that game. It was just a big blur. But I know we just scrapped until the
finish, and we definitely couldn't have done it without that crowd there. I
had the chills for like 20 minutes after that game just because I just
couldn't‑‑ that experience was just so unreal to me.  
But being able to come back and play on our home court is definitely a
blessing. We were unsure that we were going to be able to get this home court
in the tournament, and I was a little upset after hearing that last year
because it was such a great experience for our seniors to go out like that
last year. It was a blessing when we found out that we got the bid and we
could play on our home court again.  
  
Q. Jeanne, maybe for those who weren't here last year, remind them why you
may not remember much of the second game last year.  
JEANNE KENNEY: Well, not to dwell in the past but I had a bit of a concussion.
That's the reason I don't really remember.  
  
Q. Danielle, obviously defense is important, but you're going to have to
score some points to win this game. They're a very good offensive team. You
stepped up your game in the SEC Tournament. How do you take it upon yourself
to produce offensively like you did in the SEC Tournament?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: Well, you know, I'm going to come in ready to play. I know
that our post players are going to have some good shots, so I'm going to be a
play maker and I'm going to be a scorer, too. That's what my mindset is coming
into the game, giving my teammates different options. If I get a stop I kick
it out to the shooter, if not I lay‑up it up and/or I feed to the post players
because we try to get to the paint.  
  
Q. Knowing the injuries and everything that y'all went into the tournament
with last season and comparing it to this year, the health of this team,
obviously you've been fairly healthy throughout the season, does that give you
more confidence going into the tournament for you guys?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Going into the tournament this year with a full roster of
healthy bodies is a huge step in the right direction when it comes to where we
were last year. I just feel like with our roster we just have so many weapons,
and with everyone completely healthy, everyone is capable of playing to their
fullest potential. That's going to be hard for our opponents to guard because
we just have so many different things that are tough to guard. We have
shooters that can knock down shots, contested shots. We have guards that can
get to the basket by themselves. They don't really need any screens to get
them open. We have post players down low that clean up those shots and can put
those buckets in two feet in the paint real easy.  
Coming in I just feel like it's definitely a confidence booster that we're all
healthy, and it's definitely going to help us continue out the tournament.  
  
Q. Danielle, Tyaunna Marshall, she has a playing style that's similar to
yours. How exciting is it to go against a player like that who's a two ‑
first‑team All‑ACC and leading scorer in Georgia Tech history?   
DANIELLE BALLARD: Yeah, she's a great player. I know it's going to be tough
defending her. In my mind I'm going to say I'm better than her, you know. I'm
just going to try my best to stop her and my teammates stop her. I know she is
a great player. She can score. She can get offensive rebounds, defensive
rebounds, and that's it.  
  
Q. Danielle, Jeanne and Theresa, they're seniors, you're a sophomore. What
have you learned going into the SEC season, now you're going into your second
NCAA Tournament. What do you take with you into that tournament, like how to
prepare and how you get ready? Is it different than the SEC season in your
mind or how do you approach the NCAA Tournament?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: Well, I know the NCAA is like the end, like win or go home.
But I learned a lot just from the upperclassmen, like leadership and about
having heart and just fighting. I'd say, yeah, the NCAA is different than SEC,
but SEC is important, too.  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Talk about the SEC.  
DANIELLE BALLARD: I learned a lot, though. I improved on leadership and my
game, my shots and my team.  
  
Q. Coach, you played the tough schedule to get you ready for this moment,
this part of the year. Shah niece said last week that there's no offensive
action you haven't seen, you play lots of different styles and lots of tough
teams. Elaborate what you will deal with with Georgia Tech.  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, we've had a tough schedule, and we had a tough
non‑conference schedule, as well, playing teams like Rutgers and obviously
Louisville and NC State. We schedule that to help prepare for the SEC, and
then obviously when you get into your SEC Conference play, playing two No.1
seeds with Tennessee three s and South Carolina, you can keep going with Texas
A&M and what Kentucky has been able to do, obviously Georgia has always been
solid, Vanderbilt. You look at the NIT play now with Auburn continuing
post‑season play as well as Mississippi State. There's a lot of great teams in
the SEC, and the teams that typically play that type of schedule, you hope
that it helps you for the NCAAs, and that's the rationale behind it.  
I think the one thing about this group is that they have stayed the course,
although our record may not reflect that, every game that we have competed in,
we've been in the game, and we know that there's some areas that have
challenged us, and we know there's areas that we can be better in. And
Plaisance touched on those areas earlier with us taking care of the basketball
is one, and if we can eliminate teams from getting those second and third
opportunities.  
So if we can focus in on that going into the tournament, which has been our
primary focus, then we're going to have a better shot, a better chance at
winning basketball games. Georgia Tech is a very relentless rebounding team.
We understand that their full‑court pressure, they will try to turn you over.
They want you to make the mistake, and they do a nice job out of their buzz
defense, as well. They've got phenomenal players that can create scoring
opportunities not only for themselves but for their teammates, so we're going
to have to really be cohesive in our defensive attack and making sure that we
don't enable teams like Georgia Tech to have those clear looks at the basket.
We want to make sure that we're guarding the basketball at all s with all five
people.  
This is a team sport, so it's going to require a tremendous amount of team
effort. We're going to win‑‑ if you're going to win this of the year, I do
believe and am a firm believer that you have to control the boards. If you
control the boards, you control the tempo of the game, and if we can master
that area, that will give us a lot better shot at coming away with a win.  
  
Q. Jeanne, you guys have had to earn it this year, a lot of ups, a lot of
downs. I guess people are wondering what kind of team is LSU at this point?
What kind of team do you think you guys can be leading into the NCAA
Tournament?  
JEANNE KENNEY: Well, it's a great slogan, and I feel that that phrase has just
been our motto for the past four years, really, if you really think about it.
I mean, we've had to earn everything that we've gotten. We had to dig deep
last year to get that in, and this year was kind of how I've seen it, last
year in reverse. But still, we earned the right to be here, and that's
something to be noted for. We earned the right to get that bid, and so did 63
other teams.  
So just coming away with that is a great accomplishment and a testament to
everyone involved in the LSU program. This program is so special to me
personally, and I just want to give everything I can to keep the name and keep
the program alive, and that's kind of how I've taken it this year. I think our
identity is that it's going to be a fight. Even if we're down, we're going to
come back, and we proved that and again. And if we're up, we have to maintain
that lead.  
But any you're going to play as if it's going to be a fight, and I firmly
believe that.  
  
Q. For both of the seniors, if you could give me a word or a phrase that you
think really appropriately describes this year's version of LSU basketball,
and whoever has got it first just go ahead and start.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: A phrase that could just put this year into one word?  
  
Q. It can be a couple.  
JEANNE KENNEY: I've got you. We got this quote, coach Tony Perotti found this
quote, and it was basically you have two types of players: One that's going to
try hard and practice and try hard and do what they can do, and then there's
the other one that said, over my dead body. And that's the mentality that we
have right now. Like it's all business right now. There's‑‑ I mean, it's March
Madness. Anything can happen, and we've seen that and again. But I mean, it's
literally win or go home, and it's that over my dead body mentality that I'm
sticking to.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: I would say something like‑‑ maybe like a unified roller
coaster ride, okay. We've had our ups and our downs, and we've beaten a top 10
team and then we've had losses that we don't even really know how it happened,
but they ended up in the L column. Through it all, the team, the people on the
team, really stuck together as a family. We never bickered. We never
splintered. At the end of the day we all stuck together and we all love each
other and we all care about each other and we all want what's best for the
girl sitting next to us. That's what it all came down to. We care a lot about
every single person in that locker room, and we wouldn't want to see the
person next to us hurt in any way. So I think that's what keeps us fighting is
that we don't want to see the disappointment or like the upset on people's
faces after a loss.  
You know, that's really kept us in a lot of games, and just the will and the
determination from everybody is just going to raise in this tournament. I just
feel like we have great team camaraderie, and that's really going to help us
pull ourselves through this tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, this is kind of an early start for you Sunday 11:30 in the
morning. What message could you send to your fans saying, hey, we need you out
here?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, you know, there's 8:00, 9:00 services, so after services
you can rush over here to the P‑MAC. We've got an 11:50 tip. So we're excited
about the fact that we have such a tremendous community here, and obviously
our student‑athletes have done a nice job of just being in the community and
giving back. We would appreciate our fans coming out and supporting all the
games that are here because the West Virginia game will follow against Albany,
and the other thing that they will see, they're going to see four teams that
have different styles of play, but it's going to be competitive, it's going
to‑‑ you're going to see a lot of what we call positive‑energy plays. You're
going to see teams diving on the floor. You're going to see great shooting.
You're going to see tremendous athletes. So it's going to be a great
environment to bring your family and friends out to, and then obviously I want
to say ticket prices are $27 for the entire tournament, so it's very
affordable, and obviously we would love for our community to come out and
support women's basketball.  
  
Q. You've proven before against Penn State last year and you've proven
before against Tennessee in January that you can beat strong teams. Does that
give you confidence coming into this tournament?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, I have it. My playing career is over, been over, but
they have. No, this group has proven that they have a sense of urgency about
them late in the season, and obviously we caught fire last year, but this is a
new team, and this is a team that I think Theresa touched on, there's a lot of
different weapons, but more importantly this team has grown a lot. Since the
SEC Tournament, they have been in what I call boot camp, and it's been tough,
and we're in better shape, much better shape. But this group has‑‑ they have
what it takes. It's just a matter of can we put it out there for 40 minutes,
and they're very capable. When they put their mind to accomplishing a task,
they can do it, but they've got to be in sync with one another. So that's the
beauty of having so many different personalities on our team.  
But with that being said, the leadership is a major component of why we are
here and sitting here today, because we've had great leaders step up and take
the reins of this team, and we've had eager followers, so if you can have that
combination then you can pretty much accomplish anything.

### [Sarah Royals](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26938)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
KATIE ABRAHAMSON‑HENDERSON: We're excited to be here. We're excited to be in
Louisiana, excited to be at LSU. It's a great place, and we're really anxious
to get playing. We haven't played for two weeks because our conference
championship was a while back, so we're really hungry and humble right now. So
we're excited to be here.  
  
Q. Sarah and Megan, you've been to two of them, Shereesha, you went last
year. How valuable is NCAA Tournament experience where you take the long
flight and it's not foreign to you.  
MEGAN CRAIG: I think it's very important. Obviously many of us were here last
year so we have great experience on our side. We've provided some great advice
to our freshmen so they know what to expect, they know what they're coming
into. I believe it's very beneficial, as well. We know coming into a space
where we're not confused, we're not nervous, but we're excited, and we're
ready to work hard. I'm excited to get back on the court again. It's been a
long time coming.  
I think I can speak for everyone else here and all the veterans that we've
provided some great advice for our younger ones.  
SHEREESHA RICHARDS: Like Megan said, it's very important for our school that
we are here. A lot of teams don't get this opportunity to be here, so it's
very exciting for us to be here. Having this experience last year and coming
back, we know what to expect. We know what to go out and do and we've informed
our freshmen what to expect, as well. So they'll be prepared and be on the
same page with us, and just ready to go.  
SARAH ROYALS: Well, for me and Megan, this is actually our third NCAA trip,
which is a blessing. We've played these kind of games before. Our coaching
staff puts our schedule in the preseason, we play teams like Duke, we've
played Michigan State, we've played Iowa, a bunch of those teams just to
prepare us for these moments so when we do get to the NCAA Tournament that we
are prepared and we're not nervous and we don't feel the same pressure.
Obviously our team is led by our upperclassmen, and when we get in this
situation I think we're going to be fine.  
KATIE ABRAHAMSON‑HENDERSON: Yeah, I just‑‑ just with these three and the
upperclassmen, I always say to them just so they understand it, that there's
recall in their bodies, in their brains, and so they've been here before, and
that's huge. I mean, experience, it speaks for itself, but once you get out on
the floor, it happened in our conference tournament, their recall of
experience of winning a championship, a conference championship and now coming
back to the NCAA, I just think their recall is incredible, especially with
these three.  
  
Q. I know West Virginia or this coach has always been known for its defense
and playing pressure. What's stood out to you as you've looked at some tapes
of West Virginia as far as their defense?  
MEGAN CRAIG: Personally we watched a lot of film. We know they're a very
athletic team, very defensive team. But I truly believe that we can keep up
with them. We're a great team, as well. We have a lot of talent, and we can
use that to our advantage, and I truly believe that this will be a great game
tomorrow, great fight, and whoever comes out on top comes out on top.  
SHEREESHA RICHARDS: We're a great defensive team, as well, so we're ready to
handle their pressure. It's not pressure we haven't been used to, so whoever
they bring we're ready for, and we will bring our pressure, as well.  
  
Q. Coach Carey earlier said that they have to adjust to you guys' 2 ‑2‑1
zone. What do you think you have to do to take away some of their
opportunities?   
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: I mean, West Virginia plays‑‑ obviously they're a very
high‑caliber team, but they have some of the same playing styles and some of
the techniques that we use against teams in our own league. Obviously, again,
it's more high caliber, but they're obviously all very athletic, very
aggressive, strong, physical. But if we can make them take outside shots or we
just need to make sure that we keep them on the paint and play the kind of
defense that we're capable of, we have very unique zone and hopefully it'll
give them a lot of trouble.  
  
Q. This is actually for the players, please. If you could just give me a
word or a phrase that you think really well described this year's team, I'd
appreciate it.  
MEGAN CRAIG: I truly believe it's talent. We're very talented.  
SHEREESHA RICHARDS: I would say a chip, playing with a chip.  
SARAH ROYALS: I think coach Abe said it best: Hungry and humble I think
describes us best.  
  
Q. Shereesha, can you elaborate on the chip, the chip that you play with on
your shoulders?  
SHEREESHA RICHARDS: Well, coming into this, a lot of people won't expect us to
win. Hopefully a lot of people are rooting for us to win, but you know, we're
the underdog, so we really don't have anything to lose and we're just coming
out ready to just play hard and fight to the last minute. As I said, like
playing with a chip, that's what we want to do. We want to show West Virginia
that we're not just another team who's not going to come out and fight. We're
going to come out and fight for the win out there, play our game and play
hard.  
  
Q. This is for all three players: You guys have talked about the experience
or mentioned it. Where do you feel the cumulative effect of that shows up in a
game like tomorrow? Is it the ability to stay focused for 40 minutes or where
do you feel like that shows up the most in a game like this one?  
SARAH ROYALS: To be honest, I feel like it shows‑‑ you always look at the
first five minutes of a game, and it's very hectic, it's very aggressive, and
I always say that that's like the hurricane at the beginning of the game. But
once we settle down and we adjust to the game and we all know what to expect,
then I think that's where that experience comes in. It's just another game. We
can easily play with them and we can handle the pressure, as long as we play
our style and go and play our game plan and stick to it, then we'll be able to
execute and hopefully come out with a win.  
SHEREESHA RICHARDS: Sarah said it best.  
MEGAN CRAIG: Just piggybacking off Sarah, I think the experience we have on
our hands, us upperclassmen have the ability to stay poised, especially in
high‑intensity situations, and that poise and control will help with the game
plan that Coach Abe provides us and the other coaches. As long as we keep in
control, stay poised, stay calm but play our game, play hard, I truly believe
it will be a great game.  
  
Q. Katie, you've coached against Mike Carey before in the WNIT Finals. Has
anything really changed?  
KATIE ABRAHAMSON‑HENDERSON: Well, I remember us winning a national
championship in the WNIT, and he does, too, because he made a little comment
to me today about it.  
But he's a great coach, and he's been there for quite a while, so he's got a
lot of staying power, so obviously he's a great coach and they love him there.
It's the same style. We don't change much as coaches. We're kind of stubborn
in that sense.  
I just think that his team is a little bit more athletic. They've got a little
bit more height on them than they did back then, and the funny thing about
their team is they've got a lot of kids from New Jersey and New York on their
team and Connecticut, so it's kind of like a New York‑Connecticut final game
again, but great coach, great coaching staff. I know them all well and respect
them totally.  
  
Q. Coach, when people talk about West Virginia they talk about the balance
they have. You might be able to shut down one player but they can do it with
somebody else. What kind of challenges does that bring in trying to prepare
for a team like this that goes nine deep?  
KATIE ABRAHAMSON‑HENDERSON: Right. Well, I think that because we play a
match‑up zone that we don't have to necessarily worry so much about individual
style of play. We're just going to play the way we play in our zone, and we
don't have to worry about this one goes left, this one goes right, this one
shoots a three, this one does this, this one does that. They have one unique
player in No.20 that is their big, best post player and their biggest size
they have, and the rest, I always say they're all like Shereesha: Very
athletic, six foot and up. We all know they're deep, but we don't have to
match up with them man‑to‑man. That's kind of a blessing on our part.  
  
Q. I noticed half your roster is international players. Is that something by
design or just something that came to be that way?  
KATIE ABRAHAMSON‑HENDERSON: I couldn't find any more Sarah Royals up in
Connecticut. It's really just my coaching connections. I played professionally
in New Zealand. That's how I found Megan. I have a little bit of a Jamaican
connection because my husband is Jamaican, and a lot of people that the
international connection that we have, the only one that really came from a
different country is Megan. Everybody else was in the United States. But now
Shereesha is from Jamaica, and she is, and Tammy Phillip went to junior
college in Arizona. But it's just my connections of a lot of places I've been.  
I really want to recruit high‑caliber players, and sometimes when you come to
a new program and it's in a different league, some kids are like, I want to go
bigger time, and so I kind of steer away from those kind of kids. I want kids
that want to come to a family situation, are great academic students and are
great basketball players. So if I can't get them right away in any of the
States, I'm going to go look elsewhere because I want high‑caliber players on
our team.  
So we've been really fortunate, and I'm old so I have a lot of great
connections out there. It wasn't really by design, it was just kind of who I
knew, and I kind of went after those type of kids that want to be involved in
family, academics and basketball.  
  
Q. Shereesha, what do you remember about last year's NCAA Tournament, and
how is it different this year?  
SHEREESHA RICHARDS: Last year everything was definitely new because that's my
first time being in the NCAA Tournament, but it was a lot of excitement. I
wasn't nervous, I was ready to play, ready to go. At the same time I'm taking
what's going on around me and enjoying the moment while I'm there.  
And this year there's no nervous, no nothing, just ready to go from the start,
from the get‑go. It should be a lot of fun this year being this my second time
around. I'm just ready to go play hard, have fun, get my team ready to go.
That's about it.  
  
Q. Shereesha and Megan, talk a little bit about the net ball that you played
growing up and how that did or didn't help you going into basketball?  
MEGAN CRAIG: Well, obviously net ball is a sport played in our countries, and
it's a very disciplined style. I compare it to basketball a little bit. It
makes you be more accurate with your shooting, you hold your space with your
defenders to create space and get away from them. Your passing is more
accurate. It's a more accurate version of basketball. I played for over 10
years, 15 years, and so it was a big sport in my life. Pretty sure Shereesha
can say it was in hers, too.  
SHEREESHA RICHARDS: Yeah, I pretty much played net ball all my life until I
was 16. It's a lot of fun, definitely a lot different from basketball. But in
my opinion it helped me with my vertical jump. I have a great vertical jump I
like to say because we actually did a lot of jumping stuff and running, so for
me it helped on that part.  
But transition, mostly for me was learning to juggle because net ball you
pass, you move. Basketball you're dribbling and running and doing so much
stuff, so many different stuff. Yeah, it's just a whole different sport from
basketball, but at the same time it's like fun.  
  
Q. The height of the goal is different?  
MEGAN CRAIG: There's no backboard, you can't shoot with a backboard. It's just
straight in the hole. It makes you really think more about your shot and more
about accuracy and discipline. That's what I learned.  
  
Q. Were you guys inspired by the play of your men's team, and do you have
those exotic ‑looking uniforms that they had?   
KATIE ABRAHAMSON‑HENDERSON: No, obviously we're proud of them. They went out
there and they fought like‑‑ I love it because it's always the underdog, and
the whole time it was like what's wrong with the other team and not how good
our team was doing. We watched the game.  
No, we don't have those uniforms. We get to choose our style of uniforms and
stuff, but those are a little unique. But obviously you noticed them, so
that's a good thing. I see that as a positive thing. They went out there and
they played their hearts out. It was really neat to watch, and I know it
inspired our players a lot.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

Louisville  83  
Iowa  53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Louisville. We'll start with an opening
statement from coach.  
COACH WALZ: First, again, we'd just like to congratulate Iowa on a great
season. We definitely did not come into this game and expect this score to be
what it was. They're a very, very good offensive team. We knew we were going
to have to play extremely well at the defensive end. That's something that we
did tonight.  
I'm really proud of every single one of our players. Defensively that's one of
the best performances we've had this entire season. We followed a scouting
report. We did not help off of shooters. We forced them to finish shots. Just
really, really pleased with how we defended tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Shoni, it's kind of ironic you were up by 30 points, laughing and smiling
on the court. What went right early in the second half that allowed you to
make that big push?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: We went into the halftime feeling good because we hit that
shot. All the momentum was in our favor. For us to continue that, keep going
with it, we did a great job of it.  
They had a turnover at the first possession they got. So we just took
advantage, you know, of what we could do.  
  
Q. Shoni, you guys hit some tough shots in the first half. It seemed like
you broke down their defense a little bit. Talk about how well you did that.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Our coaches do a great job of getting us what we need‑‑
prepared for what we need to do on the court. We just took advantage of it.  
There's a couple shots were contested and whatnot. At the same time we're
focused on shooting those shots. We do them every day in practice.  
For us to have that flow, it helped us out there on the court.  
  
Q. Shoni, do you feel like you played better than that at any time this
season?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I think this was a great game for us. For us to come together
at the right time, for us to peak, keep peaking, especially in the NCAA
tournament, I think this is a great group of people that understand what our
coaches want us to do.  
This was a great game for us. Hopefully it only goes up from here.  
  
Q. What did coach say to you when you came off the court? A little chest
pump.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: He just said, Good job. We all did a great job. He just said,
Good job.  
  
Q. Antonita, you've been through a lot this year. Tough things you've been
through physically, emotionally. Put into perspective, here you are, headed
back to the Sweet 16 and able to play.  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: It's a blessing to be here, just to be able to be on the
court with my teammates. Our goal is to get to Nashville. We never lost sight
of that.  
Kudos to my teammates, the staff, my family for never letting me get down on
myself, fighting adversity and making the best of it.  
  
Q. Tia, can you talk about the intensity and focus that you seemed to have.
Didn't seem to ever let up at any time in the game. What do you think led to
that?  
TIA GIBBS: I think, like Shoni said, we're trying to peak at the right times.
We take every possession seriously. We don't really try to pay attention to
the score. It's the game. We're trying to prepare for Nashville, not
necessarily just this game.  
We stay focused no matter what. We've had a good weekend of preparation, a lot
of film. The team was focused, dialed in 100%. I think we're all just excited
to be playing right now, excited to get back home to our fans, do our job.  
We taught them to do theirs and get tickets early, so we had to do ours.  
  
Q. Tia, talk about what it was like to play so well on the road. Was that a
surprise at all?  
TIA GIBBS: We actually like big crowds, no matter if it's for us or against
us. The excitement, it kind of trickles over to us. The intensity was there.
We knew we had to not only play well on offense but defense we had to lock up.
I think that was our main focus. That's what we did.  
  
Q. Shoni, coach talked about playing with a chip on your shoulder, earning
respect. How much has that played into your intensity these past two games?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: We're just excited to be here. For us to go each gameone at a
time, take it one at a time, that's what works for us. Whoever it may be,
we'll dial in and focus on whoever it is.  
We're excited to be here and keep playing. We're definitely excited to get
back and go home and play in front of our fans.  
  
Q. Antonita, talk about the two threes you hit back ‑to‑back putting you up
36 at that point. Did you feel like that was a culmination of everything? Talk
about that moment a little bit.  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: My teammates were definitely looking for me, hitting
shots. We're not a selfish team. We were making extra passes out there,
getting the ball to the open person.  
  
Q. Shoni, last year you were considered an underdog. You knocked off the
overall No.1 seed. West Virginia is upset. You're going to be facing LSU. Do
you consider yourselves an underdog?  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: We are a three seed.  
  
Q. You're playing a six seed. Is that energy you use as an underdog?  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: To some degree, yes. But at the same time we're excited to
be here and we're excited to play. We're ready to get back on our home court
and take on whoever it may be.  
I think we're just ready and we're excited.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. You shot 54% from the field, forced 19 turnovers, beat a team that almost
won the Big Ten tournament at home by 30. Is this exactly how you want to be
playing heading home?  
COACH WALZ: Yeah. We're really excited about things. Offensively, you know, we
felt that we could get shots that we wanted to get, it was just a matter of
being able to make them.  
I thought we passed the ball extremely well. We only ended up with 14 assists,
but we made the extra pass a lot tonight which led to some pull‑up jump shots
by Shoni that don't count as an assist because it's not directly off the pass.  
I thought our kids did a fantastic job on the offensive end. And defensively
our whole game plan was to try to keep the ball out of Logic's hands as much
as we possibly could. She ends up going 6‑11 from the field. I thought she
shot it well, but I thought we made her work the entire night. I'm not sure
there's been a game all year where she's had nine turnovers.  
We always had somebody there. I thought Jude Schimmel and Bria Smith did a
fantastic job of trying to harass her. I thought our four players did a great
job of not allowing her to get to the basket. She's as good as I've seen. I
was fortunate enough to coach Lindsay Whalen for one year, and that's exactly
who she reminds me of. I hope she'll take it as a compliment.  
Samantha I thought was the key to their team and I thought we did a great job
of making things hard for her.  
  
Q. What did you think about the 40 minutes of intensity that you had, focus?
Was that as happy as you've been?  
COACH WALZ: We competed. We played hard. That's exactly what we have to do. I
kept challenging them. I knew they weren't going to quit. Iowa's too well of a
coached team to think that they were just going to quit.  
Those kids play hard. So we could not let up. I told them that at halftime. I
said, We have to come out and execute perfect what we're trying to do at the
start of the second half, and we did. We executed back‑to‑back plays to
perfection, a 10‑2 run to start the second half. I think that was a dagger.  
I know they're coming out going, Hey, we have to chip it away, get it down to
15, to 10, then go from there. We didn't allow that to happen. I was really,
really pleased with our mental and physical effort the entire ballgame.  
  
Q. What did you think about Shoni setting the tone with her focus, whipping
passes around?  
COACH WALZ: She played well. She played exactly what we expect. In my opinion
the kid's an All‑American. She's performed that well all season long. I'd be
shocked if she's not.  
She made some big shots today. She made some tough shots. Then she made some
big‑time passes. The pass she makes to Tia when she draws two there at the end
of the half was a big‑time pass. You're up 15. We got a lot of momentum. Then
all of a sudden she makes that, Tia hits it, and now we're going into the half
with all of it. We're excited, plus it's our ball to start the second half.  
I thought she played extremely well.  
Bria and Jude played well. Bria and Jude defensively were fantastic for us.
I'm not sure Jude called bank on that 1‑3 in the second half, which was a big
shot, too. Shot clock is running out, you bank it in, that's when you know
things are going well for you.  
  
Q. What did you think about how well they responded, on the road, in front
of a pretty good crowd?  
COACH WALZ: We played well. Is there some room for improvement? Of course.
Honestly, if you were to tell me that we'd at one point be up 38, and Sara
Hammond does not score, she plays 16 minutes with four fouls, Asia Taylor
plays 12 minutes with four fouls, I never thought that would be possible.  
I still am a big believer that Sara and Asia are the two for us, that we're
going to go as far as they take us because that's our mismatch. That is our
big mismatch that we have 'cause we've got two four players. Sara goes to the
five at times. They can step out and shoot the basketball from 15 to 18 feet.
All of a sudden, how do you guard it?  
Asia started the game with a nice shot fake. They got Doolittle up in the air,
drives, finishes. She's knocking down the free‑throw line jump shot. When
she's doing things like that, it's really, really hard for teams to defend us.  
Sara got called for some early fouls that I'm looking forward to having the
chance to watch the film. She was just trying to post up on the one, setting
the screen on the other, which I'm not sure they're actually good fouls.  
Those are things that we'll talk with her about 'cause we're going to need her
from here on out.  
  
Q. You mentioned on Sunday how it blows your mind that you get to play at
home. What is it going to be like for your fans to be able to play on your
home floor in the regionals?  
COACH WALZ: It's a big advantage. Is it going to guarantee you a win? No. But
we're going to get the chance to go home. We'll get back tomorrow around
10:00, 11:00 or so. Our kids will be back in class on Thursday and Friday.  
It's going to be normal days. They'll sit there, they'll sleep in their own
beds. The familiarity that you get from being able to play at home, it's
great. Your fans are there. Your locker room. All of that.  
I hope we can take advantage of it and use it to our advantage. But you've got
four great teams that are going to be playing, and we know that we're going to
have to come prepared to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

Louisville  83  
Iowa  53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa. We'll start with an opening statement
from Coach Bluder.  
COACH BLUDER: First of all, I congratulate Louisville. They came out and
played very, very well, especially defensively. They made us struggle
offensively.  
They only scored four points over their average, but it was their defense that
just took us out of our game.  
Thank the crowd for coming out here this late of a night on a weeknight. I
want to thank our administration for hosting this event. They did just a great
job again like they always do in hosting national events. They make Iowa
proud. Unfortunately our team didn't make Iowa proud tonight. That's something
we're probably going to think about for a long time.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Samantha, tell us what the Louisville defense did that stopped you guys
from doing the things you wanted to do tonight.  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: We knew they were going to have pressure. We knew they were
going to have some traps, different defenses. It wasn't anything we weren't
expecting. We just really didn't execute.  
We know how to break a team who do things like that. We've played teams like
that in the Big Ten, in our non‑conference. Our coaches prepared us for that.  
We just got out of our offense. We didn't execute. We did in the first four
minutes and after that we didn't score enough. We didn't shoot the ball very
well, I didn't think. I thought we had a lot of open threes that we just
didn't put down today.  
A lot of good shots. If you're turning the ball over and not shooting the ball
well, it's not going to be easy to win a game.  
  
Q. Sam, going into this game, what was the game plan defensively with
Schimmel?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: With a player like Schimmel, you're not going to stop her,
you're not going to hold her to zero points. You just got to try to limit her
touches, limit her shot attempts, make her take tough ones.  
I thought in the first half we did a little better job of that. Her team made
a couple tough shots. Had a three‑bank in at the end of the shot clock. Some
of those things you can't control. When they're tough shots, she's going to
make some tough shots.  
Second half she got to the line a lot, got her points there, but also again
hit some open threes.  
You have to try to contain, you're not going to control a player like that.
You just have to try to limit everything they do because she's a flat‑out
scorer and that's what she did for her team.  
  
Q. Theairra, how would you summarize this season?  
THEAIRRA TAYLOR: Awesome. I played with a great group of girls, great coaching
staff. We didn't go out the way we wanted to. But coach said we can't remember
the season off of just this game.  
This is one of my favorite seasons being here as a Hawk‑Eye. It's something I
want to remember as a wonderful journey.  
  
Q. Theairra, what are you going to remember most about your career? Is it
overcoming adversity?  
THEAIRRA TAYLOR: No. It will be the connections with my teammates. It's a
great group of girls in that locker room. I've played with so many players.
They still contact me now. Just building those relationships that last longer
than those basketball memories, so...  
That's what I'll remember most.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Congratulations on a great season.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Bluder.  
  
Q. It started well enough for you. It was 11 ‑11\. Things kind of dried up.
What kind of turned there?  
COACH BLUDER: We scored about one point in the seven minutes at that point. I
felt like for some reason we went away from things that were working for us in
the first few minutes of the game. I thought we had some great drives to the
basket. We got in a little bit of foul trouble, unfortunately. That hurts us.  
I thought they did a nice job of really, you know, keeping the ball out of
Sam's hands. They did a tremendous job with that.  
Louisville, they did a great job. They did a great job defensively. They hit
tough shots. Defensively, I don't think our defense was that bad the first
half. I think they hit some tough shots. Offensively, that's what is
disheartening.  
  
Q. Talk about Theairra, what she's meant to you and this program.  
COACH BLUDER: I really couldn't do that when she was in here but (tearing up).  
Team loves her. Just wanted this for her really badly.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Louisville. We'll take an opening statement
from coach.  
COACH WALZ: Just, again, honored to still be playing. We know we're going to
have a battle on our hands tomorrow night. Iowa's a fantastic basketball club.
Very well‑coached. They play extremely hard.  
Any time you can put five players in double figures, you're doing something
right. Just really, really impressed with watching them on film, and even more
impressed when I've had the opportunity to watch them in person.  
The crowd I thought was fantastic last night, very loud, knowledgeable fans.
They know when to cheer. They're not just here enjoying a ballgame.  
The one thing I did hear over and over, hopefully I'll get a chance to see it,
I was told the ice cream cones were fantastic here. I was told they were about
that big. Is that true out there (laughter)? I'm looking forward to hopefully
getting a chance to get one.  
But it's been a first‑class event. It's been run extremely well. Everybody has
been very professional. We're just excited to have the opportunity to play
tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Sara, what did you think about the fact you are very highly ranked but
you have to come and play a road game essentially? What is y'all's mentality
going into that?  
SARA HAMMOND: It's NCAA tournament. It's win or go home. No matter where we're
placed, no matter who we're playing, we got to bring our A game every night.  
Coming into Iowa, playing on their home court, like coach said, a great
environment. I think it's going to be a great ballgame. They're a very good
ballclub. Their five starters are averaging double figures. They have many
weapons.  
I think our mentality is the same every game. We have to bring our A game.
Defensively we have to rebound, limit our turnovers, get our offense and kind
of do what we did last night, make a lot of shots.  
I think it's going to be a great game between two good teams and hopefully we
come out with a victory.  
  
Q. The way this is set up, do you feel this is the toughest hurdle on the
way back to the Final Four because you're on the road? What concerns you most
about Iowa? Is it their balance? Just the fact you're playing here?  
ASIA TAYLOR: I think they're definitely a great team. Like coach said, in the
tournament everybody's a good team. That's why they made it here.  
We're not taking this lightly at all. We're not looking past this game. We
just want to go out and play our game and we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Sara, how important do you feel like Jude's role is to the team, what she
brings off the bench?  
SARA HAMMOND: Same thing I said last night. Jude is the spark and energy we
need off the bench. When things aren't going our way offensively and
defensively, she sets the tone, kind of gets our run going.  
Obviously she made a big difference when she came out on the floor last night.
We went on a big run. I think you give credit to her defense. She pressured
their point guard, got her a little rattled and got her hands on some balls,
deflections, steals, got our transition going. I think that got everybody's
confidence going.  
Once we see Jude doing her thing, she's leading us on the court at the point
guard spot, tell us where we need to be, what we need to be doing. She's a big
key to this team going down the road. I'm glad she's doing great when we need
her to right now in this tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll entertain questions for coach.  
  
Q. Do you think the challenge of playing what is in essence a true road game
in the NCAA tournament, is it more that there's 7,000 people cheering against
you or because you're playing a team that's comfortable shooting in this
gym?  
COACH WALZ: Well, it's a little bit of both. Again, I mean, it's something we
were fortunate enough to have the opportunity to do last year as a five seed.
Purdue had to come to our place and play.  
It's nothing that you can sit here and worry about. The goals are 10 foot. We
had the opportunity to get a game under our belt last night. I think it's more
of an impact when it's your first game in someone's arena.  
At the same time you get the opportunity to come in here and practice the day
before. So we have a good feel for the arena. I thought we shot the ball well
yesterday. That's not much of a factor, I don't believe.  
The home crowd is always nice. If you're doing well, they're getting loud. If
you need a pick‑me‑up, they get behind you and get things going.  
Sure, I mean, would we like to be playing at home? Of course. But, you know,
you've got to go on the road and win games in your conference. You've got to
go on the road and win games in the NCAA tournament right now. So that's what
we have to do.  
Like I said in last night's press conference, I'm not sure it's ever going to
happen in my time. But our game is continuing to grow, it's continuing to
build fans, to get attendance up. Hopefully one day you'll see women's
basketball being able to go to neutral sites for the entire NCAA tournament.  
You never know what can happen. But until that time comes, there are going to
be some teams that are going to have to play games on home courts in order to
advance.  
  
Q. Correct me if I'm wrong, but next year are they going to a system where
the top four seeds get to host?  
COACH WALZ: That's what we're doing, yeah.  
  
Q. Do you consider that a more fair method?  
COACH WALZ: I'm not a big fan of any of that. I'd like to see us try to go
back to putting eight teams at a site. I sit here and try to fight. See if we
can't give it three or four years to see if we could build that.  
When you get back to the top four seeds hosting, then I think you're going to
see the top 16 teams probably in the Sweet 16 each year. When you're getting a
chance to play on a home court in the first two rounds, it's a big advantage,
especially when you're the higher seed.  
We're trying to do whatever we can in women's basketball to continue to grow
the game, continue to get the fan support.  
I'm glad this is a one‑year test for the regionals. I think you play your
first two games at home or you go to home sites, you have your advantages. I'm
glad it's just a one‑year deal where the regionals are going to be on a home
court.  
If we're fortunate enough to be able to advance after tomorrow night, it's
going to be a tall task in front of us, we're getting the opportunity to go
back home and play on our home court. Stanford, they get to play at home if
they win, Notre Dame. I'm not a fan of being able to play at home to get to a
Final Four. That's where you start getting concerned about, Golly, is this
what we want to do?  
I'm proud of our coaches, our coaching association. When this came out, I
think everybody just expressed their concern if we were to continue to do
this. I give a lot of credit to the NCAA, our women's basketball committee for
saying, Hey, okay, we hear y'all, now we'll go back to neutral sites for the
regionals from here on out.  
  
Q. The game last year against Purdue, do you think y'all would have won that
game had it been at Purdue?  
COACH WALZ: I don't know. That's a really good question. I thought we played
well. Part of it is, is it the fact you're playing at home in front of your
home crowd?  
I think we're 17‑1 at home with our one loss to UConn. We've had success
playing at home. Iowa's played extremely well here.  
Is it a benefit? Of course, it is. If it wasn't, teams wouldn't bid to host
the first and second round. We've been on the positive side of that, too. Now
we have to make sure we come out here and just play basketball and not worry
about where the game's being played.  
  
Q. What do you think about the balance that Iowa has, their starters? Logic
almost had a triple ‑double last night.   
COACH WALZ: They're a great basketball team. Their point guard, Samantha, is
just a very heady basketball player, understands the game, does a fantastic
job of getting her team organized. Very impressed with her at timeouts, free
throws, how she's constantly coaching. She's out there getting everyone
involved. I was really impressed with her.  
Their five player does a great job around the basket. She's able to step out
and shoot the ball from 10 to 15 feet.  
Then you've got the other three guards that are out there shooting the
basketball extremely well. Their freshman is playing with a lot of confidence.
Was really impressed with the fact that she struggled some in the first half
shooting the ball last night, but did not let that affect how she played at
both ends of the floor. Then she comes out and gets an open look to start the
second half and hits it. I watched her. She ran up the court. You could read
her lips, Finally! After that she played with a lot of confidence.  
It's a ballclub that presents a lot of problems for us. We're going to have to
defend extremely well. We're going to have to defend the three‑point line
well. When you shoot close to 50%, I think they were 12 of 25 from the
three‑point line, we definitely don't want to give them wide‑open looks.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what you feel like the importance of Jude has been to
the team, playing as the other Schimmel sister.  
COACH WALZ: Jude has made a name for herself. She's no longer Shoni's sister.
Jude has performed well enough to pass two and a half years for everyone to
know, Hey, it's Jude Schimmel. Jude's basketball IQ is as high as anyone on
our team. She understands where the ball has to go, who needs the ball, who is
shooting it well.  
Defensively she just seems to be in the right spot at the right time. She has
come up with so many big steals for us throughout her career, some
game‑winning baskets, some game‑winning stops, things you can't teach. That's
because the kid loves the game. She's always asking me questions during
practice, what we're trying to get done, where should she be on defense, what
we're looking for.  
So Jude's a very, very vital part of this ballclub. I like having her come off
the bench. I like what she brings us. Just really looking forward to her
continuing to play as well as she has been.  
  
Q. This seems to be more an issue on the men's side of the tournament. You
have coaches publicly frustrated with the travel schedule, tight playing
schedules. Have you had any issues?  
COACH WALZ: No. We had four mini vans. It was a hell of a trip. A family
vacation.  
No, we chartered up here. Things went smooth as can be. They actually asked me
my opinion, Did we want to fly back tomorrow night or on Wednesday morning? So
we had the option of making trips either time.  
You know, I think a lot of it comes down to it, and I could be wrong, but
especially the first two days, when you have the men's tournament going and
the women's tournament going, the NCAA is trying to get a lot of teams a lot
of places.  
I know they don't own planes. They have to go out and find the inventory to
fly these teams back and forth. I think they've done a great job. Our travel
has been fantastic. Our hotel is great. We're very pleased with how our travel
has gone.  
  
Q. Can you think back to what it was like recruiting Jude. Were you looking
for her? When did you realize she was on your level, a player you wanted? Can
you also maybe contrast her with Shoni, Jude's game compared to that.  
COACH WALZ: Shoni's game is more flashy. She's going to make some plays that
you normally don't expect people to make. She's making the no‑look pass.  
Jude gets it done. Jude is not the flashy type of ball player. But at the end
of the day when you look at her stat line, you're like, Hey, that's a solid
ballgame. Last night 2‑4 at the three‑point line, comes up with some rebounds,
steals, four assists I believe. Just a solid game. There was nothing during
like that you were like, Wow! She just gets it done.  
Like I said, Shoni has more of the flair to her game. That's the thing that
separates those two. Shoni is a better scorer, that's what she does. Jude sets
people up. She can knock down shots when she needs to. She's got a nice
pull‑up jump shot. Jude is more of a pure point guard.  
In the recruitment of them, we had the opportunity to see them both play
because they played on the same AAU team. Again, if you just watch Shoni, you
may have missed Jude. But Jude held her own. Jude competes. That's one thing
you can't measure. You can't measure a kid's heart. That's what she did all
the summers I saw her play, the high school games I saw her play. Jude wants
to win.  
Every kid says they want to win, but it's the ones that are willing to go
above and beyond that really attract your eye. That's what Jude does.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
COACH WALZ: Thanks, everybody.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa. Coach, if you could start with some
opening comments.  
COACH BLUDER: Well, last night's game was enjoyable for us. I thought we
played well. I wish we could sit around and enjoy it a lot longer, but
unfortunately we got to enjoy it for about an hour and then all thoughts
shifted quickly to Louisville and being able to play them today.  
Obviously a tremendous team, a team that a lot of people around the country
questioned why they were a three seed. When you only lose four games, three of
them are to the number one team in America, it's pretty crazy to think of them
being a three seed when they've been ranked in the top all year long.  
We know we have a difficult challenge. We have a lot of respect for their
program, what they did last year, being national runner‑up.  
At the same time it's a new year. We have the opportunity to play at home.
We're going to give them our best effort.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Theairra, you've been through this. Do you feel this is your best chance
to get to the Sweet 16?  
THEAIRRA TAYLOR: Yeah, I feel like this is the perfect team to do so. We've
been so close, gotten to this mark so many times. Frankly we're sick of doing
it. We're going to go out and give it our best shot.  
  
Q. Ally, what have you seen of Louisville so far? What do you think the
biggest challenge they present is?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: I mean, obviously having played just yesterday, we didn't
have a lot of time to look at them before yesterday's game. We just watched
scout now.  
They're a very talented team. Pretty balanced in scoring. Great on the boards.
But we're just going to have to focus on playing Iowa basketball, sticking to
our fundamentals, what we know how to do, hopefully coming out and just
execute.  
  
Q. Melissa, what do you think about the advantage or benefit that you get to
play them at home? How much can that help you?  
MELISSA DIXON: It's absolutely a benefit to us. We're used to playing in
Carver. We didn't have to travel anywhere. We've been sleeping in our own
beds. We're used to playing at Carver together, so it's definitely an
advantage to us.  
  
Q. Melissa, does it feel, even at home, like the NCAA?  
MELISSA DIXON: It feels a little different. Carver looks a little different
with all the NCAA stuff. It looks really cool in there.  
It's still Carver to us. We're used to playing here. We practice here every
day.  
  
Q. What kind of challenges do they present offensively?  
THEAIRRA TAYLOR: Well, they're great in transition. They can shoot the ball
really well. Obviously they have Schimmel. She's been playing extremely well
for them. Top player in the country.  
We just have to go out, communicate, do what we did last night. Again, just
play Iowa basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll entertain questions for Coach Bluder.  
  
Q. What kind of matchup does Shoni Schimmel provide for Sam?  
COACH BLUDER: She's a great player. I mean, she's been around. She's played in
the national championship game. She's incredibly experienced. She's physical.
She strong.  
Sometimes Sam can out‑physical or out‑muscle or out‑grit people. But this is a
pretty unbelievable matchup right here between these two guards because they
emulate each other quite a bit.  
  
Q. How much do you enjoy that you're getting to face Louisville at home, and
the benefit of playing the first two rounds at home?  
COACH BLUDER: I mean, everybody would tell you that it's an advantage to play
at home. It's more that you don't have to travel, that you might have a few
more fans cheering for you. It's a comfort level of playing at home.  
So it's important. I wish it was the most important thing in taking on
Louisville tomorrow, but it's not the most important thing.  
  
Q. What is the confidence level after the offensive performance last night
heading into Louisville?  
COACH BLUDER: It's pretty high. I mean, they're feeling good about themselves
right now, and you should when you perform that well in the first round of an
NCAA tournament. Again, this wasn't a 16‑1 type of game. We played against a
good Marist team, a team that's fared very well in past NCAA tournaments, is
very seasoned in the tournament.  
I think it's not even just last night that we feel good about. I think we feel
good about the way we've been playing the last six weeks to two months. I
think we've won seven of our last eight games. We've been playing well down
this entire stretch.  
  
Q. What would it mean to finally get over the hump and get to the Sweet 16,
to you and to the program?  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, it would mean a lot. It's something that has eluded me
personally, and our program has certainly been there. We've been in the Final
Four in 1993. But it's been a while. It's something that our team would
really, really like to have the opportunity to claim that they did.  
They've talked about it. But we know it's a very difficult task. It's a very
difficult thing to get to the final 16 teams in the country.  
But I feel like lots of times we've been up against the Notre Dames and
Connecticuts in this situation, and Louisville is certainly to be talked about
among that group. But at least we have it on our home court.  
  
Q. What is your evaluation of Shoni's sister Jude?  
COACH BLUDER: She had a really nice game, hit some good shots for them. I
think it's something she probably is very, very capable of doing but hasn't
done consistently all year long. But when they have that added dimension of
her coming in and hitting shots, it makes them a lot more difficult to guard
instead of being able to sag off of her.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

Louisville  88  
Idaho  42

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Louisville. Coach, we'll start with an opening
comment.  
COACH WALZ: I'd like to congratulate Idaho on a fantastic season. We did some
very good things defensively that threw them out of rhythm. But the way they
shot the ball from the three‑point line tonight was not indicative of how
they've been shooting the ball the entire year.  
We're very fortunate to be able to do some things defensively to disrupt what
they like to do offensively. I was very proud of our kids. I thought we fought
through the first four or five minutes of the game that we did not play
extremely well, but we played hard, and finally got things under control,
relaxed, and thought we did some really good things offensively and
defensively.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Shoni, can you talk about the play of your sister.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: She did a great job of coming in for us. They were leaving her
open. She's been working on shooting the open shot. For her to kind of do what
she needs to do, play her role, she did a great job of coming in and taking
care of business.  
  
Q. Sara, I felt like you were very efficient in this game. Sometimes we've
seen that teams in their first game after a long layoff haven't been. Talk
about how sharp you were.  
SARA HAMMOND: I think the time off we had preparing for the tournament really
helped us. The coaches told us to get in the gym, get up as many shots as
possible.  
We have great shooters on our team, not just Shoni, Tia, Antonita from the
outside. I think we are pretty confident going into this tournament hitting 15
to 18‑foot jump shots. The coaches are confident in us hitting those, too.  
Once we get everybody moving, that opens up things. I think it's hard for
defenses to narrow down who they're going to pick to shoot because you can't
leave any of us open.  
I'm proud the way we shot the ball and didn't turn it over as much tonight.  
  
Q. Asia, was that as sharp and efficient as you felt like you have played in
a while?  
ASIA TAYLOR: I definitely think it's been a while since we played. I think the
biggest thing was coming out with a lot of energy. Like coach said, in the
first couple minutes, things were a little rough out there. But we were
playing hard. We knew if we kept doing that, defending, it all starts with
defense. That energy we played with on defense carried over to offense.  
We looked for each other, got the ball reversed, we all got good looks.  
  
Q. Shoni, 11 rebounds. Must be proud of that.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Yeah, Coach Walz always tells us you have to rebound,
especially in post‑season play. That's how you survive, rebounding, defending,
taking care of the ball. We did a great job of doing that tonight.  
I took it kind of personal because I want to win. To go out and rebound, I'm
going to continue doing that. If it's going to help our team, I'm going to do
it.  
  
Q. Sara, could you comment on what you thought of Jude's play, the intensity
she brought out there.  
SARA HAMMOND: Well, Jude is our spark coming off the bench. I think everybody
on our team knows that. At the beginning we were kind of a little flustered.
We were a little too excited to get out there and play. Jude came in and set
the tone on defense. I think that's what started our run. She got her hand on
deflections, stealing the ball. I think we trust Jude with hitting open shots.
Like Shoni said, she's been practicing in the gym, getting her confidence up,
knocking down shots.  
We like to keep Jude's confidence up because she's the spark and energy we
need off the bench. I'm glad she's stepping up in the right time, in the
post‑season tournament. She's a big key in us moving forward down the road.  
  
Q. Shoni, any thoughts on Tuesday night?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: We're looking forward to it. We're excited to play every game.
Regardless of who we get, we're going to be prepared mentally and physically.
Today's game, we got it under our belt. We got the flow of everything. We're
ready to continue and keep playing.  
Whoever it is, we'll be ready.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. What do you think was the turning point? Bringing Jude in?  
COACH WALZ: I thought defensively, we defended to start the game. I thought we
did a really good job of switching on ball screens up top. Then at times we
went and doubled the ball screen.  
I thought our kids did a really good job of putting ball pressure. A lot of
that led to turnovers. When you're able to get 32 points off of 18 turnovers,
that's normally going to lead to a good night for you.  
  
Q. Did you feel like the kids were going to play as sharp as they did?  
COACH WALZ: Yeah, I did, to be honest with you. We figured out a way in the
past six or seven years to play well at the right time. Some coaches complain
about the two‑week layoff you have between your conference tournament and the
NCAA tournament.  
But we embrace it. It gives us time to get rested. We work on us for the
entire first week, trying to clean things up offensively, get our timing down.  
You have to be efficient this time of the year. There is no tomorrow if you
don't take care of business today. We take pride in that. So it did not
surprise me.  
Now, the first four minutes I thought offensively we just rushed. We never got
the ball reversed. We were just trying so hard to make things happen. Then we
finally slowed down, we worked the ball around. When you do that, you're going
to get the opportunity to get some open shots.  
As our kids said, anybody on our team taking an open shot I feel pretty
comfortable with 'cause they're all really good shooters.  
  
Q. How much is that a strength of your team, that you do have as many
weapons as you have?  
COACH WALZ: Well, it's really important. You have to figure out a way to
defend, there's no question about it. But you also have to figure out a way to
score points.  
When we go 6‑14 from the three‑point line, and Shoni is 0 for 1, I think it
speaks volumes for our players. I don't think anybody would have thought we'd
go 6‑14 and Shoni isn't making one of them.  
It adds another element of who do you defend, who you guard. I thought Bria
Smith did a really nice job as she got into the flow of things and relaxed.  
If Bria can make that eight to ten‑foot jump shot, it changes everything for
her. She's so explosive off the dribble that teams are going to make her make
that. She looked really comfortable shooting it. Hopefully that will continue
for us.  
  
Q. How important was Shoni's rebounding and kind of starting the break, her
being able to push it?  
COACH WALZ: Well, it's really important 'cause a lot of times Shoni will be
guarding the point guard or someone who's getting back when the opposing team
shoots. You're on your own to try to get in there and clean things up. I
thought she did a great job of that.  
That's one thing that we have talked about, our guards have to rebound the
ball for us to be successful. We don't have 6'4", 6'5", but we do have good
size all the way across the line.  
Shoni is going to have to continue to rebound the ball for us. Bria is going
to have to. Antonita is. If we can get that from our guards, good things can
happen.  
  
Q. If Iowa wins, it's obviously playing on their home court. You have played
in so many tough environments, do you feel that isn't going to be much of a
factor because of the experience you've had?  
COACH WALZ: You know what, we've had it in our favor, too. We played at home
last year in the first two rounds. We're going to have to show up and play,
there's no question about it.  
If it is Iowa on Tuesday night, they're going to have great fans, a loud
environment. But that's what you want. The last thing you want is to play in
front of nobody.  
I hope before I'm finished coaching that our game can grow to the point to
where they can all be on neutral sites. That's what's best for the game. But
unfortunately right now we can't do that. I mean, you can even look at some of
the games that have been played on home courts in our tournament, and the
attendance has not been great. When I'm looking at it on TV, it's sad that we
can't get more fans to come out and watch these young ladies play basketball.  
Anybody that's in this tournament is a talented team. Until we can get our
game to where hopefully we can get to neutral sites to start off and play
throughout, you're going to have games like this.  
If Iowa is fortunate enough to win tonight, we're going to have to play them
here Tuesday night on their home court. Same thing with us. If we're fortunate
enough to win, we're going back home to play in a regional, which blows me
away. I'm glad it's one year and we're only doing it for one year because
that's not what should happen.  
  
Q. On Monday you said with the seeds you would expect them to have a chip on
their shoulder because of having a three. Did you sense that tonight?  
COACH WALZ: What we're trying to do right now is prove that we belong. I think
a lot of that, with our seed, has to do with respect. We have to do our job to
earn respect, get our program to where year in and year out we're competing
for a one, two or three seed in the NCAA tournament.  
I think if we're a program that had been around for 20 years, we may have
gotten a better seed. Who knows. Our kids are playing for respect right now.
We understand that. No matter who we face on Tuesday night, it's going to be a
really good ballclub. So we're going to have to come out prepared to play. We
know we're not going to win by 46 on Tuesday night. I'd like to, but I don't
expect that to happen.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

Iowa  87  
Marist  65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Marist. Coach, if you could make an opening
statement.  
COACH GIORGIS: Thought we played well early. They were just relentless. It's
the nightmare that you are afraid of when they have all five people that can
score, and four of them shoot the three and one of them is a stud inside. What
do you take away?  
Early we did a decent job, they didn't shoot the three well. In the second
half they showed us how they can shoot.  
When we cut it to five, we were feeling pretty good. I don't remember what
play happened after that, but we didn't get stops at that end and we started
settling for threes at our end. We were tired. I didn't sub enough.  
That's why they're a six seed. They're obviously pretty good on their home
court. No complaints, we lost to a better team. I thought we gave great
effort. Tough way for my seniors to go out. But they're still one of the most
decorated group of seniors we've ever had at Marist.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Emma, coach said about the stud in the middle, Doolittle. What kind of
defensive matchup was she?  
EMMA O'CONNOR: She was way bigger than me, kind of the same size as Tori. Once
I started guarding her, I thought we did better guarding her. Then she started
to play a lot better. The guards started to help. That's when they started to
kick out and get open looks.  
  
Q. Emma, the defensive rebounding that Iowa did really seemed to limit you
to one shot on many possessions. What was it like battling down on the
glass?  
EMMA O'CONNOR: They were strong. I don't think I did well personally
rebounding this game. I mean, they battled and we tried to battle. They were
just bigger and stronger in certain positions.  
  
Q. Is there a memory or an accomplishment that stands out for you during
your four fantastic years at Marist?  
LEANNE OCKENDEN: I think getting four rings for the MAC is nice. Other teams
in different conferences can't say they have four rings. To be able to come to
the NCAA tournament and play big BCS schools, incredible teams.  
  
Q. The way they were rebounding the ball defensively, did it really put a
premium on your offensive possessions, making it important to get the best
shot possible?  
CASEY DULIN: I think they scouted our motion pretty well. It was hard for us.
We started going to our sets because of that.  
Once we dribble penetrated, we started getting open looks.  
LEANNE OCKENDEN: Yeah, I mean, it was hard because we couldn't really crash
the boards offensively because they kept pushing in transition. I think a lot
of their points, like 22, she kept pushing the ball up the court, kicked out
to the shooters. I think that's what we struggled on.  
  
Q. For the players who are returning next year, what do you want them to
remember to this run up into the NCAA tournament?  
CASEY DULIN: That they definitely have to bring everything to the table the
first game because if you lose, you're out, just like the MAC tournament,
which I think we do every year for that. They have to know teams are bigger
and stronger and you have to play as capable as you can.  
EMMA O'CONNOR: I think I would kind of want them to remember this game because
we lost by 20, even though it wasn't a 20‑point loss, but just to keep this in
the back of their minds, keep it like a motivational‑type thing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll entertain questions for coach at this time.  
  
Q. You won an awful lot of games with those three players. How will you
specifically remember them?  
COACH GIORGIS: As one of the greatest senior classes I've ever had, both from
a competitive standpoint and a personal standpoint. They were kids who were
extremely competitive, got the most out of their abilities. They weren't
highly recruited by a lot of people.  
If you knew their determination and fight, I mean, we were down 17 a couple
weeks ago, really could have packed it in, and they just refused to allow
anybody to pack it in. They took it on their shoulders, the three of them, did
a great job.  
I could go through different games throughout their four years, where even at
sophomores, Casey and Leanne were captains as juniors. You don't pick junior
captains unless you know that they're leaders that others will listen to. They
were just tremendous leaders. They weren't afraid to speak their piece both to
the players and to the coaching staff.  
I think that's what I'll miss about them most of all.  
I don't know what their four‑year record is, but it's got to be about as good
as anybody. I think they only lost three MAC games in their career, and two
undefeated seasons. That's not bad.  
  
Q. The first half seemed like contrasting styles. You were methodical,
looking for a shot.  
COACH GIORGIS: I mean, people forget they're a little bit more athletic than
we are. Again, the frustrating part is they've got three excellent three‑point
shooters and a first‑team all Big Ten stud in the middle.  
I think our kids got frustrated. Our real big kids just couldn't guard
Doolittle inside. I think that was the frustrating part because sometimes when
you get in those situations, you forget that she likes to go right a lot. We
kept getting beat right. She'd fake left and go right.  
Again, some of our bigs, especially Tori, has hardly played for four years.
She just doesn't have a lot of experience. People say, What about the
defensive rebounding? I think I've been last in the MAC for umpteen teen years
for offensive rebounding. We sacrifice offensive rebounding for the sake of
not getting beat in transition. We got beat in transition way too much.  
In the end when it started to fall apart, the eight or ten‑minute mark, when
the lead went up to 10 or 11, we started settling for threes instead of
attacking. When we started to attack, we got stuff.  
But hats off to Iowa because they shot the hell out of the ball, especially in
the second half. You could tell our kids are pretty frustrated. What do we do?
You tip your hat to them. That's one thing that stinks about playing on a home
court. One of the biggest differences in the tournament in the women's game
and the men's game. In the men's game, you don't have that. We still haven't
beaten anybody on their home court. This is the first time it was a
first‑round game. I don't think it's going to change any time soon.  
It's what you play with. It's what you live with. But I think if we played on
Mars, I think Iowa would have beaten us the way they shot the ball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH GIORGIS: Thank you, guys. Appreciate it all year.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS: IOWA
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+IOWA+CITY)

  

## March 23, 2014

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

Louisville  88  
Idaho  42

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Idaho. Coach, if you could make an opening
statement.  
COACH NEWLEE: It's a tough way to end what for us was a great season. We
talked about our goals of winning the regular season WAC title, winning the
tourney title and getting back‑to‑back in the NCAA tournament. The only goal
we didn't achieve was going further in the NCAA tournament that we wanted to
do.  
Like I said, it's a tough way to end your year on a loss, especially a loss
that's a little lopsided like this one was tonight. We certainly didn't play
our best basketball. Louisville had something to do with that. I think some of
that was our own doing. But they're a great basketball team. I said they
should be a number one seed. They didn't do anything out there to disprove
that. Good luck to them through the rest of the tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. In the very early going you had some things going on. What changed? What
did Louisville do to take control of the game?  
ALI FORDE: They put on a lot of pressure. We handled it really well at the
beginning of the game. Drifted away from that towards the middle.  
ALYSSA CHARLSTON: I think also the fact that they were pushing the ball in
transition really well and we weren't stopping it, weren't getting stops we
needed. We weren't putting the ball in the basket on the offensive end.  
We were getting some good looks, and they just weren't dropping.  
  
Q. Alyssa, I know it's right after the fact, but can you sum up your career
at Idaho.  
ALYSSA CHARLSTON: It's been the best decision I ever made. It's made me so
much stronger. Like coach said, this isn't the way we want to go out. But I've
become who I am through the coaches here, my teammates. They pushed me to
become a good leader.  
I mean, it's emotional. Any last game is going to be emotional. But, wow, what
a ride it's been. It's been incredible. I know that the girls behind me are
going to take this program even higher than when I came here. They've got a
powerful coaching staff to do it.  
I can't say anything bad about this school. Other teams looked away from me in
the recruiting process. These coaches saw the potential in me. Definitely I
surprised myself with the coaching, people believing in me. It's been
incredible and I'm excited to see what they do in the future.  
ALI FORDE: She's been one heck of a leader. We're really going to miss her,
so...  
  
Q. Ali, what are you going to take from being here and this experience into
your next year?  
ALI FORDE: This experience is a great experience to have. Next year hopefully
will be‑‑ like coach was saying earlier in the locker room, hopefully we'll
have a higher seed and be able to come out stronger.  
Playing a team like Louisville, they're obviously a great team. It makes us
better. It allows us to push farther. We know what we need to work on now,
so...  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. You thought Louisville was a one seed. Did it get to the point that they
had so much that it overwhelmed your team?  
COACH NEWLEE: They're extremely talented, obviously. They're pretty deep. I
think they brought some people in. I thought they shot extremely, extremely
well today, too.  
I think if they're making those shots, those midrange shots, we wanted to run
them off the three‑point line if we could, make them take those contested jump
shots, they got on that roll and started making those shots.  
I think our turnovers led to a lot of fast‑break points for them. That was one
thing that we definitely needed to avoid if we were going to get in this game,
pull an upset. We had to play a lot better on the offensive end than we did
tonight.  
I will say ‑ not making excuses for Stacey Barr ‑ but she got hit in the face
with an elbow at the 13‑minute mark in the first half. At one point we thought
she had a concussion. I'm not sure how it's going now. Her symptoms got worse
as the game was going along. At one point I had to take her out because I'm
not sure she was aware where she was.  
Player of the Year in the WAC, you take her out that early in the contest, it
certainly didn't help our cause. Like I said, we don't want to make excuses.
That's basketball. That happens. It wasn't intentional.  
You could see her with the ice bags on every timeout. Sometimes she didn't
want to get up and put her hand in the huddle. I think that certainly was a
factor in the game getting away from us.  
  
Q. Can you give your thoughts on maybe the ball pressure that Louisville
presents, how difficult that is to deal with.  
COACH NEWLEE: The constant pressure in the game, we know that's a part of
their game, what they do. Like I said, we handled it pretty good for the first
six minutes. They just kept it going, kept it going. They're long and
athletic. They do a great job defensively of getting after you, getting after
ball‑handlers.  
It certainly hurt us to not have a backup point guard. She's been out since
December, so... Once Connie got tired, and Stacey was out of it, certainly the
ball pressure was going to be a bigger factor than it should have been I think
going in. It took its toll on us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

Iowa  87  
Marist  65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa. We'll take an opening comment from coach.  
COACH BLUDER: Just a great feeling out on the floor tonight. I thought our
players executed very well. I thought they relaxed and had fun out there.
Enjoyed playing on their home court. Enjoyed executing. Shot the ball well.  
It was one of those games I thought offensively we just had so many weapons,
whether it was Bethany inside, Theairra has a career‑high three‑pointers,
Melissa gets going later in the game, Sam is one rebound short of a
triple‑double. In an NCAA game that doesn't happen very often.  
A lot of really good things for our team out there tonight. And I thought the
crowd was really great. I thought the crowd was loud. I think that was the
most excited I heard a gym for a jump‑ball victory in a long time, so it was
fun.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Theairra, you started 0 ‑5 from three, then hit 12 of your last 18. What
changed for you guys?   
THEAIRRA TAYLOR: Well, the coach just tells us to keep shooting. Beth was
demanding so much attention, we were wide open. We don't want to drive in and
getting charged with fouls. We let it go and kept building our confidence as
we went on.  
  
Q. The center was open for you tonight, wasn't it?  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I think my teammates were doing well at finding me down
low. Trying to get in the best position I was. They found me and I was able to
put some shots down.  
  
Q. One of your best games?  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I'd say as a team it was one of the best games this
season. Everyone did something to help us out.  
I think that gives us a lot of confidence going into the next one.  
  
Q. Theairra, can you tell me about the sense of urgency today knowing this
might be it?  
THEAIRRA TAYLOR: Yeah, I felt like there was a lot of anticipation building up
to the game. But when we got on the floor, we wanted to compete, win, get to
the Sweet 16. We want to cut down those nets.  
That's my motivation. That's all of our motivation. We just went out and
showed what we can do.  
  
Q. Sam, you had two weeks off since you lost in the Big Ten championship.
What was the mood of the team and how did that affect how you came out and
played today?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, I think any time you have two weeks off, you're antsy to
get back on the floor. After a loss like that, we were pretty focused. Last
two weeks we've been focusing on ourselves, especially the first week, week
and a half. Then when you find out who you're playing, you focus on them.  
We had great focus and energy I think for two weeks without having a game,
which is kind of tough to sustain, but we were definitely ready for tonight.  
  
Q. Bethany, you opened both halves with a field goal. Was that kind of the
game plan going in or just something that opened up?  
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: Yeah, I think from the get‑go we had a little bit of a
height advantage down low. I think we were trying to take advantage of that a
little bit. That definitely helped us out later on get the people on the
perimeter open for their shots.  
  
Q. Sam, what do you need to take from tonight and carry over into Tuesday's
game?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: First off, we have to keep our defensive intensity like that.
Louisville is a great team, one of the top teams in the country. Excited to
have them on our home floor. Great opportunity for us.  
To get our offense going, to get our transition going, we have to play great
defense, just really focus on that so we can get our offense going.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll entertain questions for coach.  
  
Q. Claire is getting some more minutes. Talk about her performance.  
COACH BLUDER: I think Claire is playing the best basketball of her career
right now. Claire has found a role as far as we need rebounds, go get the
rebound. She had two beautiful offensive rebounds. One led to a Theairra three
for us. She battles in there. She's physical and she doesn't care. She just
battles in there.  
She had a nice three. She got pretty excited when she got that three. I just
feel like Claire has matured this year and is playing extremely well right
now.  
  
Q. One of the Marist players talked about how you guys were able to shut
down their motion offense so they had to move to more sets. What were you able
to do defensively that enabled that?  
COACH BLUDER: Well, we probably didn't shut it down because they still scored
quite a few points, 65 points.  
But we had four days to get ready for their offense. It is an offensive
juggernaut. It is so hard to get ready for because there are so many screens.
I said this earlier. Marist is one of the best teams I've ever seen at being
able to read screens and make you pay for what you're doing, whether you're
switching, they do a great job of reading it, whether you're chasing over top.  
We worked very hard on that in the last four days and we spent a lot of time
getting ready for those screens.  
  
Q. Sam went down with like 10 minutes left and you huddled the team up on
the court. What did you say to them?  
COACH BLUDER: I really thought at that point we were going to be shooting free
throws. I thought she took the elbow to the face, but they said it was
incidental contact instead of a player bringing it up intentionally.  
Melissa had been sitting on the bench, I was thinking about getting her ready
to get in and shoot the free throws, remembering what defense we were in.  
We also talked about, We've had a little break here, let's not let the
momentum shift. Let's have fun but stay focused.  
  
Q. You haven't been able to get over the hump and get to the Sweet 16 in
recent years. Is that something you've talked about with the players?  
COACH BLUDER: The players know it, definitely. It's something that we would
love to accomplish. I mean, who wouldn't want to be in the Sweet 16? It's
something we definitely would love to have the opportunity to do.  
  
Q. Talk about the improvement in rebounding.  
COACH BLUDER: We worked hard on it the last couple of weeks. I'm probably most
happy with our offensive rebounding. We got over a third of the offensive
rebounds. That's kind of the general norm. For us that's good, really good.
Happy with the rebounding tonight.  
I thought Marist didn't attack the boards that hard because they were trying
to get back in transition so much. But we'll take it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH BLUDER: Thank you.

### [Tia Gibbs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26922)

### [Shoni Schimmel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21814)

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

  
_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined here by Louisville. We have Tia Gibbs and Shoni
Schimmel. We'll have an opening statement from coach.  
COACH WALZ: First, just like to thank the University of Iowa. Everything has
been first class since we've arrived. We're excited to be a part of this group
of four teams that are playing here the next few days, looking forward to the
opportunity to competing again in the NCAA tournament.  
It's a fantastic event and one we're honored to be a part of.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll direct questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Shoni, what does it mean to be starting now in your final tournament? How
determined do you feel you are?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: It feels great to be able to know we're getting ready to play
soon. It has been a while. We've been anxious, but we're excited at the same
time.  
We're looking forward to getting out there and playing a game of basketball.
With it being my last one, you know, kind of the same thing. It's basketball,
so I'm excited to play, ready for anything.  
We're going to be prepared each and every single game to come out there and
win.  
  
Q. Tia, do you feel you're under ‑seeded for this tournament? And playing on
a visiting court?  
TIA GIBBS: I don't think we feel under‑seeded. I think we're just excited to
play. Tournament time is tournament time. At the end of the day, it's six
games to get the trophy, six opponents no matter what the seeding is.  
I think as we all can watch men's basketball, nobody cares about the seeding
but the fans and the media. To players, a game is a game.  
  
Q. Tia, can you talk about what it's like for you to play in your final
tournament, having to miss last year's, what your motivation is this year.  
TIA GIBBS: Well, you know, last year we got a taste of everything. We made it
to the Final Four. I think for all of us, whether it's our last year or not as
seniors, we want it back, we want to get there and actually win it this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Walz.  
  
Q. Could you address a little bit about your seed, if there's frustration
there being fourth in the country but having to be a three and come to a place
that's a pretty tough place to play.  
COACH WALZ: No, we're just honored to be in the tournament. We lost three
times to UConn. When the draw was about to be announced, we were just
concerned if we'd be in it. When you lose four times, it's tough sometimes.  
We're thrilled to be here. I mean, we hosted the first two rounds last year,
so we were a five seed. Purdue was the four. Purdue had to come to us and
play.  
It is what it is. We're not even concerned about our second‑round game yet. We
have to play a very talented Idaho team. They're coming in here tomorrow night
to win also. We don't look past anybody. We give the respect that's due to
each team.  
We'll focus all of our attention on them for tomorrow night. If we're
fortunate enough to advance, then we'll worry about whoever we're playing
next.  
It's what it's about. It's great to have the opportunity to play, if we do
advance, in front of a great crowd. We're expecting a great crowd tomorrow
night for both games from everything we've been told.  
You're going to have to win. It's just a matter of who you're going to have to
play, where you're going to have to play. So, like I said, we're honored to be
a part of it. I'm proud of our kids. We had a very good year at 30‑4\. I
thought we played a very good non‑conference schedule to prepare us for this.  
Even though we only received two bids from our league, you have very talented
teams that did not make it. South Florida is a team that was talented enough
to be in this tournament, for sure. Unfortunately for them, they did not
receive the bid.  
Rutgers is a very talented team, too. You have SMU. So we have enough teams in
our league that have prepared us for this.  
  
Q. Can you give your comments on Idaho, things that have stood out to you.  
COACH WALZ: They're, first off, a group of young ladies that play extremely
hard. They're a very well‑coached, disciplined team. They shoot the three
extremely well. You have two players on their team that have taken over 250
threes. One through four all have the ability to step up and knock it down.
Take 26 threes a game and make nine of them. We're going to have our hands
full. There's no question about it.  
We're going to have to be on our A game at the defensive end of the floor, for
sure. We're going to have to make sure we pick up players in transition and
make sure we're there early, try to do the best job we can to make sure they
take contested shots.  
  
Q. Give your comments on two of the players you did not have last year, Tia
and Asia, that you have for this run. What do you think is their mentality,
that they get to participate in one final tournament?  
COACH WALZ: I'm really excited for both these young ladies. Tia is a player
who missed the past two years with injuries. She was granted a sixth year by
the NCAA. So she's getting her final chance to play in an event like this. She
really does not have the aspiration to play after college. Her body probably
couldn't take it.  
She's just thrilled and excited to be out here. She brings the ability to
score the basketball for us. She shoots the three extremely well. She does
some really nice things on the defensive end of the floor, as well. So she's a
big plus for us.  
Asia Taylor has had a very solid year the entire season. She's really an X
factor for us. She's really a hard matchup for a lot of teams, especially when
she's making a 15‑foot jump shot. You have to guard her to shoot the ball
there. She drives it so well.  
She's been doing a nice job of rebounding for us at the offensive end for us.
We're going to need her to play like she has this entire season in order for
us to try and make a run in this tournament.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what the last six weeks have been like for Bria, how
much pain she's been in and how she's feeling now.  
COACH WALZ: She's feeling fine right now. She had some knee soreness for a
while. We shut her down for about three or four games. She had been playing
extremely well up to that point.  
You go about two weeks without playing, and it's taken her a little bit of
time to get back into the flow of things. I've been very pleased with how
she's been practicing the last two weeks. Looking forward to seeing how she
plays tomorrow. I'm expecting big things from her.  
She brings an element to our team that we need with her athleticism, her
ability to get to the basket, her ability to defend. She rebounds the ball
well.  
So we're going to need her to play at the top of her game if we're going to
get past the first game here tomorrow.  
  
Q. In the days preceding Selection Monday, was there a site you thought you
might be coming to?  
COACH WALZ: This is one we had actually picked out. There were two or three
that we had kind of done our homework on. We thought we'd be very possibly
coming to the state of Iowa. It was just a matter of if it was going to be
Iowa State or here.  
You look at some neutral sites, too, as a possibility. But then once you start
breaking down, you know, the host teams, where their seeding was going to fall
into place, it's not that difficult to kind of get things narrowed down to two
or three sites.  
So this was one that we had anticipated that could be a possibility. We're
excited to be here. I mean, they draw well. Very knowledgeable fans. And
that's what you want. You want the opportunity to come to play at a place
where it's going to be exciting.  
We're fortunate to draw close to 10,000 every night. There's nothing better
than when you go out to play and you have a great crowd in front of you, even
if it's on the road. We'd rather play in front of a loud, hostile crowd than
in front of nobody.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you, everybody.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Marist. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH GIORGIS: It's great to be in Iowa City, great to go up against an
opponent like Iowa who is scary similar to us in many ways. Very talented
team. Extremely well‑coached. What we call like a better version of ourselves.  
Hospitality has been great. But this is a time that we always look forward to.
With the three seniors to my right here, it's a time where we get to take the
target off our back that has been on during the whole conference season and
now we get to go out and try to slay one of the bigger schools or a couple
bigger schools.  
We're looking forward to tomorrow. We know we have a tremendous opponent in
front of us and I don't think we'd want it any other way.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Playing on the opposing team's home floor, is that a special challenge
for you?  
LEANNE OCKENDEN: I think it is. I mean, it's their home court. Usually teams
are better at playing at their home court.  
I can speak for the team. We like playing at away gyms, per se. This year we
played a lot better away. So it's going to be a challenge, but I think we're
ready for that.  
  
Q. Leanne, this game is going to feature 10 players averaging double ‑digit
scoring. What kind of defensive challenge is that going to be for both teams?
  
LEANNE OCKENDEN: It's going to be a challenge. Any person can step up during
the game, especially their five starters earning double‑digit points. The team
has been working on our defense. Hopefully I can step up for the team and they
can follow me.  
  
Q. It's been a few days since you learned you're going to play Iowa.
Scouting them, what are their tendencies you're going to try to stop
tomorrow?  
CASEY DULIN: We've learned they are a lot like us with the double‑digit
starting five. Their post player is a little bigger than ours. They have quick
guards. We have a good scout. So we just have to follow it.  
EMMA O'CONNOR: Yeah, basically what Casey said. They're a better version of
us. We're ranked in similar things in the national stats, or pretty close.  
We just have to keep playing the way we've been playing.  
  
Q. As much success as you've had in the NCAA tournament through the last 10
years, do you find it maybe a little bit of an insult to be considered a mid
‑major?   
CASEY DULIN: Honestly, I don't really think we even think about stuff like
that. We just go out there and play Marist basketball.  
  
Q. Is it easier to prepare for a team that is so similar to you or would it
be harder to prepare for a team that is totally unlike you?  
THE MODERATOR: Emma, would you take that one.  
EMMA O'CONNOR: I mean, I think it's a little better to prepare for them
because they are similar to us so we kind of know the type of tendencies
because we do some of the same things. I think I'd rather do that than playing
against some girls who are way bigger than me and Tori. I like this matchup a
little better.  
  
Q. If you consider Iowa a better version of yourselves, why do you consider
Iowa better?  
CASEY DULIN: Well, they play in a bigger conference than us. They played very
good opponents all year. Our non‑conference schedule is pretty hard. But I
think they just had more experience than us playing better teams, that's why
they can be considered a little better than us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. The offensive potential of both these teams, is this going to be a team
that you think might be in the 80s or 90s, or do you see some of your top
defenders stepping up?  
COACH GIORGIS: That's a good question.  
Again, they're very talented at all five positions. Stopping them is going to
be, you know, a heck of a chore. They're playing on their home court. Chances
are you usually shoot better on your home court.  
I'd like to hope that we can score, you know, up in that level and stuff. Can
we hold them down? I don't know. Again, they're playing in the Big Ten.
They're going up against Penn State and stuff.  
Even though this has been the best year of our conference with four people in
the top 100, it's not the same as the Big Ten.  
  
Q. How do you gauge the success of your program? You've been here nine
straight years. Is that the success level? Do you feel after having been here
so many times that you really need or want to win this first ‑round game for
it to be a successful season?  
COACH GIORGIS: Oh, it's been a successful season. We don't have to win a game
tomorrow to say this year's been successful or not. 27 wins is pretty good.
When you beat a team like Oklahoma, you've done a pretty good job. When you
lose to Ohio State by three at the end, you don't have your two best players
there, on their court, it's been a really, really good year. Like I say, I
think we're dangerous when we have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Our
kids know they've had a great year.  
I know, especially with these seniors, I remember after last year when we lost
to Michigan State by five in the opening round, they were really hurting, and
more than usual, because they had won games in each of the two previous years
against Georgia and against Iowa State.  
They last year felt incomplete because they didn't win one. To win the
national championship, we don't look at things like that. We just try to knock
off, be as big a pain in the rear to everybody as we can, to show we can play
with the big boys. That's what they'll be trying to do tomorrow, and hopefully
we can take one down or two down or whatever.  
I know this group has always wanted to get to a Sweet 16 because it's been a
while. The toughest road to go through is going through somebody on their home
court, which we've never faced in the first round, then a team like
Louisville. I don't know what Idaho will do with them, but if we get our first
round...  
Two extremely tough opponents. But that's not going to determine our success,
how we do against them. We've had a great year.  
  
Q. In essence, what has to go right tomorrow night for you to pull off what
would be considered an upset?  
COACH GIORGIS: I always felt in a game like this if both people bring their A
game and play it, they just have a little bit more talent than we have. That's
what I mean by 'a better version.' A lot of our kids weren't recruited by BCS
schools. They're a little bit more athletic, a little bit bigger, a little bit
more physical. They get a lot better playing in that type of conference.  
But for us, if we can play well, somehow disrupt them in some of the things
that they do...  
With most of these teams, Ohio State in '07, Georgia two years ago, were we
the better team? Not many people would say so. Not always the better team
wins, you know.  
Some things do have to go right for us. We have to do the things we do well
tomorrow. We have to shoot the ball better, or as well as we have.
Defensively, that's a real hard group to guard because they've got so many
weapons. I had to finally stop practice and yell at our kids, You can't worry
that Dixon shoots all these threes and makes them, because if that kid goes by
you, that kid scores two.  
The thing that I like with the matchup is you don't have to do anything
special, per se, because you got to guard 'em all. You can't sit there and
say, You slough off that person, you slough off that person, we'll make this
kid be the hero. They got a lot of people that can step up and be the hero.
That's the tough part with this matchup.  
If they try to slough off somebody else and leave some of our people open,
they'll pay the price there. That's what makes it such an intriguing matchup
when you have five people in double‑digits on each team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH GIORGIS: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS: IOWA
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+IOWA+CITY)

  

## March 22, 2014

  

### [Alyssa Charlston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26924)

### [Jon Newlee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26923)

  
_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening statement from coach.  
COACH NEWLEE: Very excited to be here, second time around, second year in a
row of being in the NCAA tournament. Huge for our program, huge for the
University of Idaho.  
Like I said, we're excited to be here and ready to get after Louisville. The
14th seed going against the 3, we know the challenges ahead of us. We feel
like we're ready to go, ready to play.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions to the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. It's been a month since you have lost. What has gone right for you in
this recent winning streak?  
ALYSSA CHARLSTON: I think the constant competition in practice. Our coaches do
a good job of keeping us focused and ready to go at all times. We expect
ourselves to play at a high level every time we step on the court. I think we
have a lot of good leadership on the team. That gets us ready for each game
and competing every time.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Newlee.  
  
Q. You seem to have found your stride here in the last month. What have you
seen?  
COACH NEWLEE: I think we've done a better job of rebounding the basketball
during our stretch, making better shot selection decisions. That was something
that we struggled with earlier in the year before we got into conference play.
I think our shot selection has been much better. Rebounding has been much
better.  
Defensively, my staff, Jordan and Christa, do the scouts. They got us ready,
prepared defensively. I think our team has done a great job of following the
defensive game plan and really sticking to it.  
As the conference season went along, I think our team got a lot of confidence
from getting win after win. We had the 10‑game winning streak, then we lost,
then got on another streak.  
Last year winning the league and going to the NCAA tournament gave our kids a
lot of confidence. Once we got into conference play, we had the success early,
I think it kind of built on itself. When games got tight, they really trust
each other. I think that really carried us through a couple of the tight games
we had in the league.  
  
Q. Coach, what is your biggest concern with Louisville?  
COACH NEWLEE: Where do I start (laughter)?  
You know, I think obviously they got a bunch of All‑Americans over there led
by Shoni Schimmel who is a fantastic player. They're not a one‑person team.
Their guys inside are big and strong. Hammond. Slaughter can shoot it. Gibbs
can shoot it.  
Defensively we're really going to have to play smart. Again, we're going to
have to rebound the basketball well. I think we're going to have to take care
of the basketball because I know they're going to come with a variety of
defenses and traps, things that Jeff likes to do.  
Taking care of the basketball and rebounding the basketball are going to be
two big keys for us.  
  
Q. At this time of year everybody sees Mercer, North Dakota State Stephen F.
Austin, thinking why hasn't that happened on the women's side yet. Do you
think a 14 or a 15 is getting closer to cracking through and getting that
win?  
COACH NEWLEE: I think so. I've been doing this a long time, I've seen the game
grown a lot, 30 years of doing this. I do believe the parity is coming. It's
not coming as quickly as the men's side did.  
It's getting there. Watching some of the games earlier today, the Florida Gulf
Coast and Oklahoma State going to overtime, seeing the scores of games
throughout the year even, not just in the NCAA tournament.  
I do think the talent gap is closing just because the club teams and the
recruiting is getting so much better. There's so much more talented kids
coming into programs now. They're not all stockpiled at UConn and Tennessee
like in the old days, though UConn is still stockpiled enough. We found that
out last year (laughter).  
I think it is getting closer, I do. I really believe that. I think in another
five years it's going to be like the men's side where anything goes, and
whatever seed you have, it's not going to matter when the ball gets thrown up.  
  
Q. When you are really playing well, what does your team look like? What are
the strengths of your team?  
COACH NEWLEE: I think when we're really playing well, we're doing a great job
of sharing the basketball. Our goal is to get at least 20 assists a game. When
we've cracked that barrier, we've done a great job. Offensively we have a lot
of different people that can score the basketball in different ways.  
We're rebounding the ball well when we're playing well. I think we're keeping
people off the foul line. We're not fouling people. Just doing a good job of
playing good fundamental defense when we're playing well.  
  
Q. There's controversy in Louisville that Louisville was a little bit under
‑seeded. Do you think they're a three or better than that?  
COACH NEWLEE: I would think they're better than that. Looking at their record,
30‑4, they lost three times to UConn. We found out firsthand what UConn is
like ourselves last year.  
For that to happen, I thought all along, if you look from afar, they would be
a number one seed or certainly a number two. I think without a doubt they
didn't get the best end of that deal coming in seeding‑wise, with all the
talent that Jeff has on his basketball team, the couple of years they've had
the last couple seasons. This year was a great year for them.  
Yeah, I think they were deserving of a number one seed in my mind. I was
shocked when I saw that they were a number three seed. Honestly, I couldn't
believe it.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH NEWLEE: Yeah, I thought, man, we just played the number one seed last
year when we made our run through the tournament. It kind of feels like that a
little bit going into it again.  
We kept hearing that we're going to be playing Nebraska in Seattle. All the
ESPN that you see, you read, you think it's gospel, but really it's not. It's
one guy making his own opinion as far as the bracketology goes.  
We found out last year we can't really count on that. Last year we were
supposed to be playing Stanford somewhere else and then we got sent across the
country.  
Not surprised. When the names come up during the selection show, I found that
anything can happen and will happen, so...  
We're just ready to play whoever they tell us we're playing.  
  
Q. Can you compare and contrast last year's team to this season.  
COACH NEWLEE: I think last year was all brand‑new for us. We started three
freshmen last year and a sophomore and a junior. It's nice that everybody was
back and gained from that experience.  
Basically we have the same entire team back. Our freshmen are hurt, so they're
not playing. They're out. So basically with the same exact team coming back,
it's been nice because they had that experience and they could grow from last
year's experience as freshmen playing all those minutes, starting all those
games.  
They're a year older, wiser and better, which is the good news for us coming
into this year and into this tournament.  
  
Q. You mentioned a little bit, because they are such a clear ‑cut favorite
for this tournament, do you think it's possible that anybody can beat UConn
this year? What would be the scenario that would lead to a UConn loss at some
point?  
COACH NEWLEE: I would feel like to beat UConn, who I think would probably be
in the top half if they played in the WNBA as a team, you'd have to play a
perfect game. Reminds me of that Villanova/Georgetown final. You would have to
shoot like 70%. You couldn't turn it over. You have to hope that Stewart is
missing, Dolson, all those guys are having the worst game of their life and
you're having your best. That's the only scenario I see of UConn losing.  
I've never seen a collection of talent in my life like UConn has put together
here in the last couple years.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH NEWLEE: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS: IOWA
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+IOWA+CITY)

  

## March 22, 2014

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Samantha Logic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22973)

### [Theairra Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24379)

  
_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa. Coach, if you'd like to make an opening
statement.  
COACH BLUDER: Just very excited to be here, as everybody is this time of year.
When you're playing this time of the year, it's an unbelievable feeling.
That's the way our locker room has been the last couple of weeks, just very
excited to be able to participate in the national tournament.  
Then it makes it more special to be on our home court. To be here in
Carver‑Hawkeye Arena is extra special for us. We know that Marist is a great
opponent. We're excited about playing them. We know they're kind of eerie
similar to us in statistical categories. There has to be only a handful of
teams in the United States that have five starters averaging double figures.
Two of them going against each other head‑to‑head the first round of the NCAA
tournament is quite unusual.  
A great opponent. They've obviously been seasoned in the NCAA, nine straight
years. This is nothing unusual to them.  
Obviously a mid‑major, I'm very familiar with mid‑major having spent 10 years
at Drake University. I know how special it is to make the NCAA tournament and
take down a BCS‑type school. I know we're going to get their best shot, I
understand that. I guess it's good we're not playing against Idaho first
because corn or potatoes, right? How many times do you get that mixed up. It's
really a good thing we're not playing against them first (laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. What has been the focal point? A couple weeks since you played your last
game.  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, since we had that time off of games, took a lot of time
just to work on ourselves, fix up some things that were hurting us a little
bit before. Just trying to get a little bit better on ourselves before we
found out who our opponent was going to be. That's what we used last week and
early this week before scouting out Marist.  
  
Q. Marist has made their name in this tournament by scoring big upsets
against the bigger schools. Is that a dangerous opponent knowing they've got
nothing to lose tomorrow?  
THEAIRRA TAYLOR: I think any time you're in the tournament, the name nor the
number on the side of the name matters at this time. It's just who comes to
play their best basketball during that day. We know that, and I'm sure they
know that. We'll get up for the game just as much as they will.  
  
Q. Sam, you talked about the benefit of kind of a home ‑court advantage.
With the different court and different sights and everything, what is
different about playing in Carver for the tournament versus a home game?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: I think just knowing it's win or go home. It's win or you're
not going to play anymore. Obviously that has a lot riding on every single
game we could possibly play here.  
You just have to be ready to play for 40 minutes, otherwise you're not going
to get another 40 minutes.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
At this time we'll take questions for Coach Bluder.  
  
Q. Marist prides itself on its motion offense. What have you seen by the way
they run the motion and how do you defend something like that?  
COACH BLUDER: I'm extremely impressed with their motion offense. The way they
read screens, and Brian is able to get them to read screens, is amazing.
That's why I'm sure they're a lot better team in March than they are in
November because it has to take a lot of time and a lot of work in order to
get your players to understand the different reads and counters to how you
handle screens.  
They do as good a job as I've seen anybody do with that situation.  
  
Q. The different court and everything, does this feel like a home venue with
everything so different?  
COACH BLUDER: It still feels like home. I mean, I was just cleaning my kitchen
an hour ago so it definitely feels like home to me.  
Yeah, even though this is a different place than we usually hold our press
conferences, it's still our locker room, our court, our lighting. It's very
familiar.  
I think there's absolutely an advantage to being able to play at home. How
much, I don't know. But we didn't have to travel. We get the comfort of our
own beds. We hopefully will have a few more fans in the stands than the other
opponents.  
More than anything, it's a comfort level.  
  
Q. Going back to Marist having five players in double figures, at this time
in the year when it comes down to who makes tough shots, how difficult is that
challenge to know everybody they put on the floor can score?  
COACH BLUDER: It's very difficult. But I think we have the same threat. It
kind of counters each other or negates each other. They're in the same boat
with us. We have five players that average over 12 points a game. They have
five players that average over 10 points a game.  
I definitely think it's a difficult situation for both coaches, but it
probably negates each other.  
  
Q. Facing a Marist team that's used to upsetting teams or taking bigger
teams down to the wire, what kind of a challenge is that for you as a coach
and players?  
COACH BLUDER: I know my players are really smart and they watch a lot of
basketball. They have utmost respect for Marist, not just from this week or
knowing who they are. They've watched them play the last couple years, they
know about the upsets. Just watch the men's tournament the last couple days,
see all the upsets. If that doesn't get your attention, nothing will.  
They understand Marist is a good team. I have told them, but they don't need
me telling them that over and over again.  
  
Q. It's been quite some time since you've played a game. With this layover,
what are the challenges of having so much time off?  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, it's been two weeks. It will be two weeks since we've
played a game. That's pretty unusual. We haven't waited this long since we
tipped off to begin the year.  
I've always believed the Big Ten tournament should be moved back farther so we
don't have this big gap. We're not going to do anything about that right now.  
We try to give the players a little bit of time off, let them heal up from
playing four games in four days in the Big Ten tournament, and like Sam said,
work on a couple things we need to work on as a team.  
This week has been business as usual, finding out our opponent, getting ready
for our game.  
Once we hit this week, it's pretty normal. Last week is pretty unusual.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

### [Roshunda Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26959)

### [Jim Littell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23326)

### [Brittney Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26550)

  
_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

OKLAHOMA STATE  73  
PURDUE - 66

  
COACH LITTELL: Just very, very proud of this team. I thought their unit and
chemistry on the floor tonight was just unbelievable. Everybody stepped up and
played. We said that we couldn't go into this game and have one or two people
play, and we just had great contributions out of everybody.  
The two young ladies here, my farthest left, Roshunda Johnson, a freshman, to
come into this environment and get 16 and hit big shot after big shot, is just
pretty remarkable. She shouldered the load when Tiffany Bias went down, and I
think that's a sign of an outstanding team when somebody else can step up and
make plays when you've lost your leader.  
The young lady closest to me here, Brittney Martin, 20 and 20, that's a
career. That is a career. Those are huge, huge numbers. She had 15 rebounds
the other night. She had 15 in the semifinals, the Big12 tournament, and 11
against Iowa State. Just been a rebounding machine, and she was a scorer
tonight. Kind of put us on her back and just carried us.  
But four people in double figures, very proud, a very tough environment to
play in and we beat a very good basketball team tonight.  
  
Q. For Brittney, when Coach Versyp came in just a few minutes ago, she
started talking about you and she said you appeared to be on what she called a
mission. Having heard that now, can you just kind of respond, and is that a
pretty accurate assessment from the other coach?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think that's pretty accurate. We want to go to the next
level. We have things to get done. I was just‑‑ I just came in here with the
mind‑set of, we wanted to win, and so I was just trying to do everything I
could to get that win and help my team in any way possible.  
  
Q. If I would have told you this afternoon that you and Jones would have
combined for 36 points and 32 rebounds, would you have told me, our chances
will be pretty good?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think so. That sounds nice to me.  
  
Q. When you guys obviously buy as went down with about 14:03 to play and you
had a nice lead, I think it's easier to protect than it is to play from behind
when the star goes out, but what was the mind ‑set that you had, was it to
protect?   
ROSHUNDA JOHNSON: My mindset was, you know, I'm the point guard now, and for
my team to get to the Sweet16, I had to step up and make big plays for my
team.  
  
Q. And you were shooting well, too. Sometimes it's difficult when you're
playing the point, to shoot well and direct the offense; sometimes one will go
well and one won't but both worked well. What were you doing correctly that
allowed you to score and run the team?  
ROSHUNDA JOHNSON: I was just doing everything I did in practice and just so
happened came good to me, so I helped my team out a lot and I'm thankful for
it.  
  
Q. Brittney, you guys are a good rebounding team, but 20 rebounds, Coach
said that's kind of a career night, 20 and 20. You know, Purdue said you were
great; they could have done a better job boxing out and you were take
advantage of that. Would you agree, you slid into some holes?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think so. I was going as hard as I could tonight, just
running after everything. So I mean, they could have blocked me out, but I was
determined to get the ball. So I was going to get it‑‑ you can't say either
way, but I was going to get it any way I could, let's just say that.  
  
Q. How confident were you, when a star player like Bias goes out, it can be
an emotional roller coaster. What allowed you guys to hold on and especially
on a visitor's court?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I knew she was going to be okay. She's tough. She's
tough‑minded and she was going to be back. We have really good people off the
bench. I can't say I wasn't worried, but I mean, Ro stepped up and I knew she
could. She leads this team as well as tiff does, even being a freshman. I was
all right with that. I was glad Ro came in and stepped up.  
  
Q. Did it help ‑‑ this is a stupid question. Did it help that you were ten,
12, 13 points up when that happened, as opposed to, say, maybe the game being
tied?   
BRITTNEY MARTIN: Maybe. That would have been a little different situation. But
Ro, we really practiced just as much with Ro being the point guard, so I
wasn't really too concerned, but I think if I was in the situation, I'd have
been worried if she would have been out for the rest of the year and things
like that, but I wasn't too worried about it.  
  
Q. Did you talk about, first of all, what happened as you were told, because
it was at the other end but what happened to Tiffany and were you shocked that
she was able to come back? It was kind of like, you know, Bob or whoever ‑‑
walking out of the tunnel‑‑ what happened and were you shocked she was able to
come back?   
COACH LITTELL: Well, I know she was in a lot of pain, and I think she popped a
couple ligaments in her ankle. I don't know which one it was. But she popped‑‑
I think she popped a couple, and she just was bugging me to death at the end
of the bench; "Coach, I can go, I can go."  
I worked with the trainer and I don't want to do anything to hurt our kids and
jeopardize our future. She was like, "Coach, I think we can go, we have her
taped real tight." She came back in and was very helpful in breaking the press
and making some free throws. It was just nice to have your leader on the
board, but what a job Ro did while she was off.  
LaShawn Jones, to get 16 points and 12 rebounds tonight was pretty remarkable,
Liz Donohoe hit some big baskets for us. It took every one of our kids to play
well, and it was one of our better games of the year and we needed that to
escape from a very good team on their home court.  
  
Q. If someone said you were going to get 36 and 32 from those two, would you
have liked your chances of winning?  
COACH LITTELL: Oh, yeah, I would have. I was concerned about rebounding coming
into it. I told our kids that I didn't think that they would beat us off the
first shot but I knew she had the capabilities to give us put backs and second
and third shots.  
I think our coaches schemed very well. We changed defenses all night long. We
played man, we played a 20‑zone. We rolled into a 1‑3‑1, and we played a
triangle‑in‑two for a lot of minutes on Moses and April Wilson, and I thought
we did a great job of keeping them under control and I thought the triangle in
two was a big difference in the ballgame.

### [Whitney Bays](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26934)

### [Courtney Moss](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26876)

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

  
_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

OKLAHOMA STATE  73  
PURDUE - 66

  
COACH VERSYP: Oklahoma State early on, really set the tone on the boards, game
of their life, 20 boards and that obviously hurt us, and then 55 got some real
good offensive boards when we were trying to make a run back.  
So we really struggled there. Even though the numbers look good on paper, the
first half really set the tone, and then they shot 42 percent and we didn't
shoot as well at 37 percent, so that kind of is what happened and they
controlled the tempo.  
  
Q. How difficult were they to keep off the boards, especially early it
seemed like they set the tone there, like Sharon said, for the first ten or 15
minutes.  
WHITNEY BAYS: I think at first it seemed really difficult because everybody,
it seemed like everybody was crashing. Like we would box someone out and they
would get loose and they were getting long rebounds, too. It was difficult at
first.  
  
Q. Courtney, how were they able to limit you guys in transition for most of
the game?  
COURTNEY MOSS: We weren't rebounding their offensive rebounds, so when they
are scoring, they were able to push the ball but were obviously making
rebounds and scoring layups and it's hard to run on that and we weren't
knocking down shots today?  
  
Q. They got some second ‑chance points but you got it down to six points and
that came off the second chance, does that encapsulate a little of your
issues, you get on a run and made a bucket on you?  
COURTNEY MOSS: Every time we would fight back, they would come back with an
answer, and good teams do that at this point in the tournament. That's what
good teams do. So every time we got close, they hit a three or got a steal or
something would happen.  
  
Q. Anything different about the way they played defense or the zone that
they had, that made you guys think a little bit?  
WHITNEY BAYS: I have to watch the game because during the game you don't
really see anything, but basically it was the rebounding, we weren't able to
get on the run that we wanted to and it was really, really clogged up and
sometimes we drove and we weren't getting the looks that we really wanted.  
  
Q. Courtney, could you talk about the performance of Whitney, not only
today, but all weekend and sort of how she rose up during the tournament a
little?  
COURTNEY MOSES: Whitney has been ‑‑ (inaudible) all season. The procedure done
and the rehab and then the two games, the way she has, I'm very proud of her
and I can't wait to see what she can do next year.  
  
Q. How do you feel like you played tonight?  
WHITNEY BAYS: I'm never satisfied. I missed a couple crucial free throws. I
could have blocked out better, played better defense. But I'm not satisfied;
we didn't win.  
  
Q. Courtney, how proud are you of the team this season?  
COURTNEY MOSS: We've been talking in the locker room about all the adversity
we went through, and to hear from people (ph), the adversity to think that the
team, bawling their eyes out, that means more to me than winning tonight is
what we went through as a team.  
  
Q. Sort of what I asked Courtney, too, about the one sequence, you got it
down to six.  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, we just couldn't‑‑ we just couldn't get where we needed to
be. When that happened, that was a dagger and we had two turnovers in a row
and that stretched back to 11.  
Those were keys to the game. They played a great game, and I knew it was going
to be a great game going back and forth, but when you've got that lead, you
know, we just need to make sure that we secured the ball and boxed out better.
You know, they are a very good rebounding team, which they showed tonight.  
  
Q. Did the early rebounding edge for them just kind of take that off the
transition that you wanted to use tonight?  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, you know, very early when they were crashing, they were ‑‑
like 22, it just set the tone. It kind of sets the tone, rebounding, that
carries the bat. And trying, first of all, trying to get back, we've got to be
able to have a post player run the middle, and that's been a weakness of ours
all year.  
Whitney has been getting the rebounds but we don't have the post running down
the floor. So when you don't have that option, it's easier to defend on the
lanes.  
  
Q. How important was the tournament for Whitney?  
COACH VERSYP: I think it's big. I think the whole year has been big. We didn't
know if she would finish the whole season. We didn't know where she would be.
She's above and beyond what everybody, doctors, everyone, didn't think she
could ever play again, and she's gone against the odds. She's just battled.
She's a kid that has so much passion and love for the game, and you know,
she's just been amazing.  
  
Q. How difficult was it to matchupwith Martin?  
COACH VERSYP: I don't know. Everybody is like, where's she coming from. I'm
like, well, if it's man‑to‑man, the person who is contesting should be boxing
her out. Zone is a little different; it could be a guard, it could be post,
and we are boxing out and she would find that just in time. She was on a
mission and she finished it, there's no question about it. She played great.  
  
Q. You stated you wanted to get to the Sweet16 and it was pretty important,
but this falls short of that goal; what is the thought in your mind as the
season comes to an end?  
COACH VERSYP: You know, I normally say this every year, but I think this year
because we've dealt with so many issues, like five, heavy, like‑death
situations, I'm just so proud of them, AK (ph), what she brought us and has
been part of that senior class. So you fall short from the Sweet16 basketball
wise, but when you talk about everything else, they are top in the country, so
that's the best I can sum up.  
  
Q. The couple minutes, end of the first half and couples minutes to start
the second half, swing in their favor ‑‑ put you pretty far behind.   
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, it did. Just tried to come out and execute, and we turned
the ball over, that was never a good way to start your second half or with a
kick out‑of‑bounds or whatever. So it's always the first four minutes and then
the end of the halves and beginning of the half, we didn't do very well.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement from
coach and then take questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH JIM LITTELL: We're very excited to be here. We're very pleased that we
beat a very good team yesterday. I thought Florida Gulf Coast has a unique
style of play. A very difficult team to guard. I was pleased the way our team
responded in the last half of the game, last 10 minutes of the game when we
were down by 10.  
We told our team this morning that our change in attitude is from survive and
advance to thrive and advance. We're going to thrive on the opportunity of
being here, we're excited to be here, it's a big deal. After today we're going
to be in the final 32 and we have an opportunity to play ourselves into the
Sweet 16. So, we're very excited about it. We know we play a great team, on
their home floor, but we're going to thrive on the experience that we get.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. For both players, Tiffany and Brittney, you go from the Florida Gulf
Coast style that they play where they spread you out to Purdue style, which is
more traditional. Are there examples throughout the year where you've had to
go from game to game and change, face styles like that or change styles in a
quick fashion?  
TIFFANY BIAS: Our whole conference, we all use the switch defense and switch
up offenses because each team plays different. So, I think we have a good
scout and I think we have a good feel of how they play.  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: Just the same. We have to deal with different matchups and
things like that throughout our whole conference. So, this is just like we're
used to, just sticking to fundamentals and sticking to the game plans that the
coaches arrange for us.  
  
Q. Brittney, Tiffany had a rough shooting day a little bit yesterday. You
guys ‑‑ you've seen her play for awhile, she's pretty good at bouncing back
from those type of games?   
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think so. She works hard and really hard work gets you
really far. It gets you really far in games. So I think that she will be fine.
I'm not worried about it. I don't think our team's worried about it.  
  
Q. Tiffany, you did a lot of the heavy lifting in the last game, is it safe
to say that you'll be the one on Courtney Moses?  
TIFFANY BIAS: I think so. As of right now. I think that's the game plan. So,
it's just a good matchup between two good guards. So, it will be great to go
head to head with her and I can't wait to get on the floor.  
  
Q. Tiffany, talk about Courtney's game and what you see out of her if you've
watched enough film yet, and is it similar to some other players you faced
this year?  
TIFFANY BIAS: She's a great shooter. She gets it off quick and comes off
screens. I think a lot of plays are designed to get her through the staggered
screens and get her that shot. So, I think I got to be cognizant of that and
be defensively mentally sound and I think it will be fine. I just have to stay
down on defense.  
  
Q. For either of the players, can you talk about how much you talked about
the Sweet 16 this year and where that ranks in terms of goals.  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think that we're just taking it game by game, really. Of
course we want to get to the Sweet 16. We didn't do it last year, we should
have, and I think that's something that's always on our mind. But, I think we
just take it game by game and just really I guess, that's what we're working
towards, so we're just taking it step by step.  
TIFFANY BIAS: Pretty much what Brittany said. I think it's just game by game
and it's always a big goal of ours just to keep advancing, so I think that
we're all excited to play and excited to be here.  
  
Q. What can you make of the Big ‑10, Big‑12 matchup? Do you feel any, I
guess, pride in carrying the Big‑12 banner here?   
TIFFANY BIAS: We take a lot of pride coming from the Big‑12\. I think that the
Big‑12 and Big‑10 are different in a lot of ways, but also the same. I think
we both take pride in our conferences.  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: Good answer. I think we're both here for a reason, so I think
we just got to go play and, yeah, we just got to play, really.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, you are in a similar situation last year where you
were at Duke on its home floor, you guys were up at halftime. What's to learn
out of that that can be applied to Monday night?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: We just got to be patient. We have to relax. We can't play
scared like we did last year. I thought we looked nervous and we looked like
we were in a panic. I think this year we, or last year really, taught us that
we need to be patient. We need to run our offense and when we get in different
situation that we're not familiar with, we need to learn how to come out of
those instead of coming out like we did last year. So I'm just‑‑ I hope we
don't, I hope we learned I guess from that situation. I know I did.  
  
Q. For Tiffany, I know you've probably been down 10 points with 10 minutes
to play in a game before, but maybe not in your last potential game as a
college player. What was going through your mind yesterday when you look up on
the board and you know you've got to rally to stay alive?  
TIFFANY BIAS: I think we have been in that situation a lot this year. I think
that as long as we stay together as a team we're going to pull it out. I think
it's just point by point, you can't get it back all at one time. A lot of
players on our team yesterday stepped up and we just kept pushing away at the
lead and our coaches believed in us they never stopped coaching and we never
stopped playing.  
  
Q. Tiffany, you have a shooter's mentality, you're just going to keep firing
and figure you'll find the zone eventually?  
TIFFANY BIAS: Yeah, I hope one goes in.  
(Laughter.)  
But, no, my coach told me yesterday, you have to have a short‑term memory and
for me to lead, I can't dwell on that. So, as long as my teammates are getting
open and making the right reads and decision making, hopefully a few will fall
tomorrow.  
  
Q. To expand on being down by 10 points, through your season do you feel
that there's no reason to panic because you've been in that situation before,
especially in a league like the Big ‑12?   
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I can't say there's no reason to not panic, because you have
to be really, really fundamentally sound. You have to run your offense, you
can't just give away possessions. So, I think even coming from the Big‑12 we‑‑
I would, in situations like that I do get worried. But I know that our team
can pull together and as long as we do what we're supposed to do, I think
anything can really happen. So, as long as we play hard.  
TIFFANY BIAS: I think momentum changes a lot during a basketball game. So, you
just need that one spark, that one basket for the team just to get all into it
and anything can happen.  
  
Q. Tiffany, how did you end up at Oklahoma State?  
TIFFANY BIAS: I think I committed really early. I loved the coaches, I loved
the facility, I just wanted to be what they were about and about family and
their program building and stepping in at a good time for me to just learn to
be a leader. It was helpful to have someone older than me teaching me along
the way, but I learned from my mistakes and I wouldn't have it any other way.
The coaches have been on my side ever since, so.  
  
Q. Considering everything this program has been through, just can you talk
about not overcoming just things on the court, but also things off the court
and how much a Sweet 16 advance would mean to you guys, considering everything
that this program has been through.  
TIFFANY BIAS: Every year this program has progressed. I think that every year
you can tell that we have gotten better, we have been more successful every
year, we have got better players, better teamwork, and just people that can
just be as one as a family.  
It would mean a lot to this program, I think everyone around it, our fans
believe in us, it really takes us a long way when have you that great support
behind you. So, it would mean great things for this program and just for the
future for Cowgirl basketball.  
  
Q. What did you guys think of the crowd yesterday for Purdue's game?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: Yeah, Iowa State has the biggest fan base I've ever seen. You
can't hear anything in that gym. It's really loud. It scared me the first time
I went in there, to be honest. But, I think it's fun to play with crowds like
that, especially when they're against you. When you make baskets it's silent,
it's fun to be in that atmosphere, I think. But we have played in that
atmosphere. I've played in it at Iowa State, like I said, that's a hard place
to play, so I'm excited to have a crowd like that.  
TIFFANY BIAS: I think we have all played in a lot of gyms like that where I
think we're accustomed to having not hearing plays. I think that we have
gotten better over the year and the season about relating back to each other.
So, I think it will be a test, but I think that we have dealt with it before,
so we'll be okay.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll excuse you to the locker room and take
questions for coach.  
  
Q. How much does Liz, having someone her size that can shoot the three as
well as she has, how does that open things for Tiffany and Brittney and some
of your other players?  
COACH JIM LITTELL: Well, not only for other guards, but it opens up for our
inside game as well. Liz has the ability to stretch the defense both in a half
court setting and in transition, as well. You got to find her. She got off to
a great start and kept us in the game early and then struggled and missed some
shots that she normally hits.  
But, to have somebody with her size that has the ability to stretch the
defense is always been a big asset to us.  
  
Q. Roshunda really hit some big baskets for you that helped you out in the
second half. It's difficult to know who needs to be the unsung hero, but how
important is it to be beyond your big three, for someone else to step up?  
COACH JIM LITTELL: Well this is a game, and we told our team that this
morning. This is a game that everyone has got to play well. We play a very
solid basketball team that has a lot of weapons, they're very physical, they
got great size, so we can't have one person on or two people on, we got to
have everybody at the top of their game. And a cliche, we got to bring our A
game against these people and our big three has been Bias, Donohoe, and
Martin. They didn't shoot the ball very well yesterday, and all three of them
are going to have to shoot better and we're going to have to get contribution
off the bench.  
You alluded to Roshunda Johnson, I thought she was exceptional yesterday,
especially since she is a Freshman. We had the confidence at the end of
regulation to go to her for the last shot. She came off of a high ball pick,
had a 15‑footer, had the courage to shoot it, missed it, but we went into
overtime. I thought Ro was a big difference in the ball game, yesterday. And
for a Freshman to do that is a very positive sign.  
  
Q. The physicality and height was used by Purdue yesterday. From watching
you, it looks like have you a little bit better personnel to deal with that,
but what do you think about the interior matchup tomorrow night?  
COACH JIM LITTELL: They just keep bringing size at you. Their post strength
and the versatility that they have to just run players in at the four, five
position is very impressive.  
The early films, it's going to be crucial that we keep them off the boards. I
think one of the best things that they do is offensive rebound. They're very
good in a high low game, we call it a Miami game, where they try to get the
ball in the high post and drop it down to the low post. Their fours and fives
are very good at dribble handoffs, taking the ball to the guards, and creating
a screen situation.  
So, I think they got a lot of versatility, they got a lot of size, they got
depth at the post position where they can keep coming at you and I was very
impressed with those kids. And 32 coming off the bench is a high, high energy
player that brings a lot to their program. And I don't know why she doesn't
start, but I feel like she's one of their better players.  
  
Q. I think you said after the game yesterday you weren't quite sure how you
won it. 24 hours later, have you figured that out?  
COACH JIM LITTELL: We may have worn them out. They maybe drove by us so much
that at the end of the game that they were physically tired.  
(Laughter.)  
I don't know. You look at the numbers sometimes, and they aren't conducive to
winning. We were 7‑14 from the free throw line. But, we have won that way all
year long. We have told our team it's better to win ugly than lose pretty. And
we have won a lot of games in that fashion.  
After stepping back and reflecting on it, that's a good team. I guarantee you
there's a lot of people in America that didn't want to play that team. And
they're hard to guard, they're not a conventional style of play, and it was a
very good win for us. That's a team that was unique in the way they play and
very, very well coached. I told our team, I don't know if I said it here
yesterday, that Fran Fraschilla says a third of the time you play great, a
third of the time you play average and a third of the time you play poorly.
It's those teams, when they're having a bad night and things that aren't going
their way, finding away to win. Those are the teams that win 20 plus games and
those are the teams that advance. And that's been indicative of us, that when
we have been average to off in our play, we found a way to win. I think that's
a sign of maturity in your players.  
  
Q. I asked the players about going from one style to the next, you mentioned
the other day that Iowa State compared to Florida Gulf Coast, in that regard,
going from that style they play to Purdue's style, is that kind of an easier
transition for you guys based on the schedule you played this year?  
COACH JIM LITTELL: Oh, I'm not going to say going to Purdue's an easier
transition by any stretch of the imagination. I think they're really good.  
Do we match with them better? Probably. Does our personnel fit their personnel
better? Probably. And I heard their assistant coach that did the scout after
the game said the same thing that I'm saying right now, that we probably match
better with Oklahoma State than we would with Florida Gulf Coast. So, in this
game a lot of times it comes down to matchups and I think it's two teams that
matchup pretty well. We have had some common opponents and the outcomes have
been very similar, so I'm not really excited about how, saying that we're
matching with them real well, but we're a better matchup than we were
yesterday. And I think they will feel the same way too.  
  
Q. Along those lines, is there anybody in the Big ‑12 or anybody that you
played in the non‑conference that would remind you of Purdue? Or vice versa?  
COACH JIM LITTELL: We play Michigan State in Puerto Rico. I think they're
similar to a certain extent. Baylor plays more of a traditional lineup with a
four and a five. I think they're that way a little bit.  
They will play a four and five lineup, but we saw a lot of four guard lineups
this year, so this will be a little stretch for us as well, but we have seen
some lineups ‑‑ probably Baylor is the closest to what we faced.  
  
Q. Has Tiffany done a pretty good job of bouncing back from off shooting
nights?  
COACH JIM LITTELL: She's a resilient young lady and she's got a lot of faith
in her own abilities and the abilities of her teammates. And in our league, as
I think the Big‑10 is, you got to be pretty resilient and we stressed to our
team all year long that we're in 18 individual battles. And she didn't play
well in the last battle, we got a new battle. It's a new individual battle
that we're facing here.  
I expect her to be fine. You're not going to play great every game and she's
carried us a lot this year. We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her. And I
anticipate that she will play very well tomorrow night.  
  
Q. You made steady progress over the last couple of years. I'm curious how
you've been able to keep things on track since the plane crash, and if you
think about it yet, as a coach, about the Sweet 16.  
COACH JIM LITTELL: It's not something that I really like talking about. We
lost some people that were very dear to our hearts. We made commitments right
then, and I'm not going to talk a lot about it, to be honest, but we made a
commitment that the best way for us to pay honor was to compete, play hard,
and try to push forward each day. I think that's what this team has done. They
have gone from 7th in the conference to 5th in the conference to 3rd in the
conference. So our kids have overcome a lot, our coaches have overcome a lot,
and I'm proud of what they have done.  
  
Q. What's the one thing you want your players to take out of last year's
second round game at Duke that you can apply tomorrow night?  
COACH JIM LITTELL: You got to be sound for 40 minutes. We led in that game, I
believe, for 35 minutes. But, we made some mistakes at the end of the game. We
made some mistakes with a double digit lead that came back to haunt us.  
So when you get to this level, you can't be really good for 30 minutes and
average to poor for 10 minutes or it will come up and bite you. I watched the
tape from that experience and you got to be solid for the entire 40 minutes.
You got to play with great effort, you got to play with great energy, but you
got to be very solid in how you play, value the basketball, don't take
possessions off defensively, and that pretty well describes our league too.  
You got to do that on every given night, so it's not a whole lot different
than what we have faced within the Big‑12\. But just to be more solid and play
the full 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Your impressions of Courtney Moses?  
COACH JIM LITTELL: Love her. She's a great player, outstanding player. Plays
the game the right way. You can tell she has an outstanding respect for the
game, this is the way the game ought to be played. I would say the kid's
probably a dream to coach. You don't have many of those come along.
Outstanding shooter.  
I told our team that in film this morning that it may be the best shooter that
we have faced all year long. You look at her numbers, 49 percent overall and
almost 47 from the three and 91 from the line. She has the ability to score
the basketball and we're going to have to do a good job on her in their half
court set. They run a lot of things through her. She's very good at finding
the open seams in transition, as well. I just think she's an outstanding
player that really respects the game and knows how to play the game.  
  
Q. How do you keep your team engaged tomorrow with the late tip off at nine
o'clock local time?  
COACH JIM LITTELL: That may be the best time for us. Our kids night maybe
starts at nine o'clock, so that I may be the best time for us, I don't know. I
guarantee you it's probably a better time than 10 o'clock in the morning,
central standard time, for us.  
So, they play under the same ‑‑ I think it's an advantage that they're going
to be in their own apartments or their own rooms or whatever. But, it is what
it is and I'm not going to worry about things I can't control, we can't
control what time we play. We can control how we play and what our effort and
energy level is about. That's what I choose to focus on instead of the late
start. Now, coaches at my age, that's a little bit late to be out at night, so
I hope I'm okay. I'm a little more worried about me than I am our kids.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement from
coach and then take questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Looking at the matchup with Oklahoma State I think both
coaches see that it's similar matchup, fours and fives and shooting guard and
great point guards. So, it's going to be a very, very good matchup Big‑12,
Big‑10, both conferences are exceptionally tough. And we just have to continue
to do the little things and do what we need to do in order to be successful on
both ends of the floor.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Speak to what Dee Dee has meant for you guys this year. Especially since
KK has gone down.  
COURTNEY MOSES: Dee Dee ‑‑ has been four years with Dee Dee, so all the way
back to freshman year until now. We put her on the other team's best defensive
player and she can guard anybody in the country. Just the positive energy that
she brings. She's always talking on the court, she's a great communicator,
always being positive and bringing energy both to the guards and the post. And
she's so versatile and can play any position and she is just a great teammate.  
WHITNEY BAYS: She covered all the bases of ‑‑ she's a great teammate, vocal
leader for us, always positive, can play the inside and outside and defensive
stopper, so she's contributed a lot this year. It's been great playing with
her.  
  
Q. What do you think about the interior matchup with Oklahoma State? You
guys had had your way a little bit with the Zip's but I would imagine that
facing a Big ‑12 opponent like them you expect it to be pretty physical
inside.   
WHITNEY BAYS: Definitely. We went over the scouting report and we're prepared
for them and what they have to offer and bring. But, they have two really good
bigs, so we're just trying to prepare and it will be a great matchup.  
  
Q. Can you talk about their outside game. They didn't shoot a lot of 3's,
they hit some big 3's down the stretch and Donohoe got off to a good start.
How concerned are you about their outside shooting and their ability to hit
big outside shots?  
DEE DEE WILLIAMS: I feel like from watching film we're just going to have to
communicate. Donohoe, she's a great shooter from the three, especially. And
we're just going to have to not help off of her on ball side and everybody
else just has to contain. I feel like the biggest part will be number four,
but I feel like we're going to take care of that and be fine.  
  
Q. For Courtney and Dee Dee. Courtney, your impressions of Bias, the point
guard, remind you of anybody that maybe that you faced this year?  
COURTNEY MOSES: Nobody comes to mind. She's her own player and her own self.
She's a very quick player. She's crafty on offense and she's a very good
defender. She's a great leader for their team and keeps them going.  
WHITNEY BAYS: I agree with Courtney. She's a great leader, they run through
her. She likes to go right a lot but I feel like at the same time she can go
left if she needs to. She's very crafty and we're just going to have to do a
good job of communicating and playing her.  
  
Q. Whitney, you got your offense going a little bit more lately and from
some of the early misses yesterday, what did you feel like you did differently
to be more engaged and be able to take advantage of some of the things that
they were doing?  
WHITNEY BAYS: Yesterday I was like maybe a little anxious. It was a long two
weeks. So, I was ready to get out there and I was really hyped, but I think
that focusing on where I'm trying to score, where I am scoring, if my jumper
is not falling then I can drive. If I can get my layup to go, then shoot some
jumpers. So, I'll look for my other teammates, also. When they give me the
ball, it's in a great position. So, being more smarter when I'm trying to
score, I guess.  
  
Q. Courtney and Dee Dee, you know that tomorrow is your last time down the
tunnel. Other than focusing on Oklahoma State, have you given that any
thought?  
COURTNEY MOSES: It's gone through our mind since yesterday and what better way
to go out than to be playing to go to the Sweet 16.  
DEE DEE WILLIAMS: I agree. I thought about it plenty of times and I'm ready to
go out there and have my last game and just play hard for my teammates, for
the fans. But, it's exciting, but at the same time, it's kind of sad to know
that it could be our last game at home.  
  
Q. Dee Dee, is it Whitney's versatility offensively that makes her a pretty
good player on that end?  
DEE DEE WILLIAMS: Definitely. She's an awesome player. I love playing with
her. You can give her the ball on wing, she can shoot it, you can give it to
her at the three, she can do everything with it. Give it to her down low, she
can score from anywhere. And that's a huge part of Whitney's game. And for her
to be able to come back from her injury and still be able to do all the things
that she does, it's great for us.  
  
Q. Courtney, there's a lot of similarities, where do you see the
similarities between you and Oklahoma State?  
COURTNEY MOSES: I see it in every position. It's a Big‑10, Big‑12 matchup and
it's similar to playing a Big‑10 team where we matchup at every position. So,
every single position, I feel like it's a similarity and matches up.  
  
Q. Courtney, what do you plan on doing all day tomorrow before the nine
o'clock game?  
COURTNEY MOSES: Sleep in, eat some food. We're going to see if we're going to
go work on homework, watch a movie, maybe Frozen, I heard it's pretty good.
And take a nap. Eat some food and go play.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll excuse you to the locker room and take
questions for coach.  
  
Q. Are they similar to you or are you similar to them?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: If you go through the lineup, the versatility at the four
spot when 31 is in, she can shoot the three or take it to the hole. So, they
got versatility there and they got the big down low which is like Camille.  
Number four, she's a great set shooter. So, we got to limit her and they may
compare that to someone else on our team, even though she's smaller. Martin's
very, very good and she's one of the really overall best players if you look
at rebounding, if you look at how she can score the basketball. They really go
to her and isolate her quite a bit.  
Their point guard is ‑‑ how your point guard goes is how you go. And that's
kind of the same with us.  
We just have to do what we do well, and they're going to try to do things that
they do well and we need to try to exploit any weaknesses from each side. But,
I know they mentioned that they're worried about our rebounding, we got to
crash, we got to do that exceptionally well, and we got to be able to run.  
  
Q. What strikes you about Whitney's offensive game? Her versatility, ability
to do it a bunch of different ways?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Yeah, I knew she could really face the basket really well
when I recruited her during high school. She had great one‑on‑one, ball
handling skills, but being able to score down low is something that we have
continued to help develop. But she's better, she's gotten so much better in
that area. So, it is hard to guard her. Next year she will have a 3‑point
shot. She can take that, she just doesn't use it very much this year, but I
think when she adds that to her arsenal then she will be really, really tough.
But she's just very, very hard to defend.  
  
Q. You talked earlier in the season, you had a few rough stretches with like
two games in three days. Do you think that's really going to help you right
now?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: We have had games like this pretty much all year. You
play a game, you're prepared knowing who you're going to play, you have one
day to prepare, and we were very successful there. So, it's when you play
three games back to back, that we obviously didn't have that this year, but
we'll be all right.  
  
Q. Dee Dee has had games when she's been able to score for you and maybe
others that she's had the high assist total or rebound total. Do you think
yesterday was maybe the best game that she's put all of those things together
at one time?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Yeah, I think so. Everything just came natural. Nothing
was forced, nobody was getting excited if you do this or this or people
playing off, she just played. She was open, she shot the three. If shot clock
was going down, two dribble jump shot. She just was really comfortable. And
when she can score, obviously that benefits us. When she can defend and
rebound exceptionally well ‑‑ and when you're defending their top player, you
got to be able to box that person out. So her stats are increasing, but again
she does all the intangibles.  
You got to have a kid that's on the court and in the locker room that's
willing to play that role to a T and be that glued to the team. And that's Dee
Dee.  
  
Q. Yesterday you played nine players and nine players scored at one point.
When you look at matching their depth, they had some players come off the
bench too, Oklahoma State did. Just getting that similar production tomorrow,
how far can that go in pushing you guys forward?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: I think it's real important. If we can keep bringing
bodies in that keeps us fresh, that wears teams down, hopefully. Yesterday I
was just bringing two posts, two posts, two posts. And at the guard spot,
depending upon matchups, that type of thing, being able to get Hayden and
Bridget in quite a bit. That's what we have to do in order to be successful.  
You hope you don't get in foul trouble, but if you do, at least you have that
tournament experience, which is real important.  
  
Q. Do they remind you of anybody you played either in the conference or non
‑conference?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: No, they just have similarities. Each of the players
might be similar to somebody in the Big‑10, but I wouldn't say, boy, this team
is totally like X Y and Z, I wouldn't say that. We just know that one of their
post players can step out and shoot the three, so we have to be aware of that.
Another one is more a 15‑foot shooter. And the other ones are really back to
the basket. But at the guard spot, it's pretty similar in the Big‑10 to the
type of people we have to defend.  
  
Q. Impressions of Bias? She didn't have the greatest game on Saturday, but
you watched film on her. She has performed at a high level.  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Oh, she's a very, very good player. There's no question
about that. Courtney alluded to it, it goes through her. It should go through
your point guard. And if she's ‑‑ because maybe she didn't do as well
yesterday, she's going to be ready to play. So ‑‑ and she was ready yesterday,
she just maybe didn't, things just didn't happen for her.  
She's the one that can come off on ball screens, she can fake to the hole,
does pull up jump shots, she find the role player exceptionally well. So we
just need to slow her down little bit and not allow her to really get going
and get her tempo going.  
  
Q. What do you think about the now nine o'clock tip?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: I think it's great. I think it's great for us at Oklahoma
State. I think that nine p.m. it's prime time. They have talked this game up,
if we got to this, they have done it all on national papers as well as ESPNW,
that's all they talked about, so they moved it for a good reason.  
So we just want to encourage everybody to continue to come out. I think it
will be great. We had a great crowd here yesterday, so we want to continue to
show that people that women's basketball here in the Midwest.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Thank you.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

Oklahoma State - 61  
Florida Gulf Coast - 60

  
THE MODERATOR: Lets ask can Coach Smesko to make an opening statement and then
to questions for Sarah and Jenna. Coach?  
COACH SMESKO: Obviously, this is a very frustrating way to go out. Marchcan be
very cruel sometimes. I'm really proud of our team and the way we played, and,
you know, we just didn't finish regulation, and then we needed to make one
more play in overtime to advance and give Oklahoma State credit they fought
and refused to lose.  
  
Q. To both of you, you guys had all the momentum you're up 55 ‑47 after
Whitney made a 3 and the last 11 or so minutes, 5 points. What happened to the
offense there? It seemed like everybody stood out in the perimeter and hoped
everybody would make shots. Sarah?   
SARAH HANSEN: We were playing a five out offense, we were getting complacent,
we weren't attacking it, we were looking to shoot, we passed up a couple shots
at the end we would have usually shot. We just tried not to lose, as opposed
to trying to win and finish the game off.  
JENNA COBB: I think also they pushed it really well in conversion and we
didn't get back and they were making good shots in conversion the second half
when we started to run they started to push it more so we stopped scoring and
they started corresponding more.  
  
Q. Jenna, you took a shot there, late, a shot that needed to be taken, with
the shot clock running down, take us through that play and what you saw.  
JENNA COBB: We knew there was going to be a shot open in the corner so if we
got it down in the corner you have to take that shot, you can't pass it up so
I was ready to shoot and to knock it down.  
  
Q. Sarah, can you compare this to 2012, it's almost the exact same outcome,
same game?  
SARAH HANSEN: That game we were up too and we let it get away, and we kinda
did the same thing today, give credit to the Oklahoma State they took it from
us in the end there. They made the plays down the stretch that they had to.
They're a great team, obviously and we kind of started to settle down and got
a little back on our heels and that's when they came at us hard and took it
away. Similar to St. Bonaventure, to answer your question.  
  
Q. Jenna, I know a big emphasis on the team late in the year was attack,
attack, attack. You did that at points this year. Do you think ‑‑ what
happened in the last 8 to 10 minutes?   
JENNA COBB: I think we did get a little bit tentative toward the end. But
there were times where we were still attacking, we were just not knocking down
the shots. They took too long. We had a few 30‑second shot clock calls on us,
but you gotta give credit to Oklahoma's defense of taking us out of that and
making us get tough shots at the end.  
  
Q. I know you had a 10 ‑point lead in the second half, but when it comes
down to 1 point I think you probably go back and look at everything. You
missed 12 layups in the second half. Was that nerves or the situation they
were coming down and forcing you to redirect layups? What was the deal there
early?   
SARAH HANSEN: I think that we were a little bit nervous coming into the game.
We missed wide‑open layups that we usually wouldn't miss. We focus on
finishing our layups and we try to shoot as efficient of a field goal
percentage as possible and we just didn't finish our layups. Usually when
we're in a situation like that and we can finish them, we do. Today we were
nervous going into the game and it came back to bite us.  
JENNA COBB: Basically the same as Hansen and when we were going in there we
were all turning our shots too, to the defense and just trying not to get
blocked and I think that has a lot to do with it too, instead of going
straight up.  
  
Q. Earlier in the season when you got down like you did today it would have
usually ended up in a loss. Today you rallied and hung in there. Is that kind
of Aprilsign of the growth of your team? Talk about what you talked about even
when you were having a tough time making shots.  
JENNA COBB: Yeah I think that definitely shows where‑‑ early in the season
when we were playing big teams we kind of struggled, and I think that does
show how much we have grown toward the end of the season and just coming
together, you know, we have been in overtime situations before.  
Obviously with Stephanie two times but when you are going against a strong
team like Oklahoma State you've got to be able to finish, especially in
situations like that because they're going to come at you.  
SARAH HANSEN: I don't remember the question.  
  
Q. Earlier in the season when you would get down like today.  
SARAH HANSEN: Oh, yeah, like Jenna was saying it showed the growth of our team
and we came together. In the beginning of the season we had a lot of people
coming in and we weren't 100% comfortable playing with each other. We liked
each other well enough, we just didn't have it on the court at that point.  
When we would start to‑‑ when they would‑‑ other teams would start to come
around we would crumble and we've come together and become a family now and
you can tell on the court. I think it speaks volumes for our growth over the
past couple of months.  
  
Q. Sarah, when you guys had that 10 ‑point lead and they started chipping
away at it, did 2012 creep into your mind?   
SARAH HANSEN: At that point no. I was kind of like into the game. But now
looking back, yeah. I mean, we have had games where we let teams get back into
it, even games in overtime we started to settle and let them get back into it.
We were up 7 less than a minute to go and it ended up being a 2‑point game and
things like that. I think just looking back, it hurts more because of that,
but in the moment, I mean, no.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. Congratulations on a great season.
Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, how many times there late in the second half were you thinking,
okay, we get one more shot and we can really make it difficult for them?  
COACH SMESKO: Well, I mean, that never crossed my mind. I mean, obviously them
going to the zone late, you know, frustrated us a little bit. We were trying
to move the ball quick, and then penetrate into the middle lane and kick it
out. For whatever reason I think we got tense and everybody stood around and
passed the ball around and we didn't look for the‑‑ we thought we could get it
in the middle and then kick it out and have a shooter in the corner, be either
a shot or one pass for a shot and, you know, nobody actually made the
aggressive move to create the shot.  
When you're playing a team as good as Oklahoma State, you can't just hope the
time runs out. You gotta make a play to win the game and I just thought we got
real tentative, especially the last four or five minutes, maybe being too
afraid to make a mistake or be the one to do something wrong. We weren't as
aggressive and, you know, we probably could have run maybe some different
plays so that they had to be aggressive, like where it calls for their
aggressiveness.  
That's what I will have to think about when we review this game.  
  
Q. Coach, Whitney Knight had 11 rebounds and she really had some big
rebounds for you in the second half. Is that something that you were hopeful
thinking that you would be able to exploit in the game?  
COACH SMESKO: Well, we didn't think we could win rebounds against Oklahoma
State but we thought to win we would have to keep it close and everybody would
have to contribute on the boards and you can see Sarah had 9, Jenna 9, Haas 6
in 21 minutes so it was a team effort on the boards, Whitney blocked shots and
altered shots and second half especially she was all over the boards so that
we limited them to one shot. So defense actively I thought we executed our
game plan pretty well. Just didn't shoot well, we didn't finish layups well,
and then, you know, at the end of the game we got really tentative, and, you
know, that's disappointing. We wished we could have finished this off.  
  
Q. Whitney was assertive defensively and she has talked about how you wanted
her to be more assertive offensively. Would you have liked to have seen her be
more assertive in the last 5 minutes of regulation and overtime?  
COACH SMESKO: They were in a zone, we would have liked to get her the ball
more. We put her in a spot that we thought they were going to have a long
close‑out and they were going to have trouble getting it. But what we put in
there‑‑ we hadn't worked on it very much but we saw what was going to be open
and when we got the ball in that situation, for whatever reason we passed it
away from her when she was open in the corner so we were supposed to pass fake
away from her and get it to her, over to Cobb and we kept throwing it back up
top which was the opposite of what we talked about. The moment got to us and
we kind of froze a little bit and it's disappointing because our kids played
so hard to be in that position. You know, it would have been nice just to be
able to finish the game, but, you know, it definitely would have been nice to
get Whitney the ball more especially along the baseline where it was open. We
didn't do it and it makes for a tough ending.  
  
Q. Coach, you said yesterday Tiffany Bias was priority number one for your
defense, she went 1 of 9 with 8 turnovers but made a shot in traffic, the game
winner. So overall you gotta be pleased but she had 8 assists and made it when
it mattered.  
COACH SMESKO: She is a great all‑around player. We wanted to limit her in
conversion and we didn't do a great job in transition, transition, early we
lose Donohoe a number of times and she was supposed to be a key in conversion
and Tiffany Bias found people in transition and with her assists, Kaneisha
Atwater did a great job on her when she was in, making it so she could get to
the basket, forcing her to take jump shots and we did a good job on the ball
screen defense when she came off them, but she made the big play at the end.  
  
Q. What do you think was the could I to your team hanging in there when you
were down double digits not being able to make a lot of shots and then turning
the game around in the second half where you built up a lead?  
COACH SMESKO: We started off really slow and didn't execute offensively well
and when we got layups we missed them. It was definitely frustrating first 10,
twelve minutes but because our defense was good enough we weren't out of the
game and I thought Stephanie Haas was huge, she wasn't afraid to get in there,
got fouled, made layups and I think she gave confidence to the whole team. We
saw Stephanie was being active and cutting on the catch and people picked up
momentum from her.  
  
Q. ‑‑ she didn't play much in the second.   
COACH SMESKO: No, the‑‑ Stephanie wasn't injured, that was a coach's decision.
We were going with probably our most defensive lineup at the end of the game.
You know, Atwater, I didn't want to take her off No. 3 to put Stephanie in,
she was doing such a great job on No. 3 and it was in zone if they were on man
I wouldn't have taken Haas out because they were in man and she was really
attacking them but we kept our defensive line in and unfortunately we had that
big turnover against the press where we didn't execute our screening to get it
in and they got the tip and then hit a big 3 on us. It would probably have
been a good time to get us organized because we didn't screen very well to get
the ball in bounds there. Unfortunately we got a little tentative at the end
of the game where we didn't want to just attack and take it to them, we were
just trying to‑‑ we were being too hesitant and trying to run out the clock
with the lead and as I said, you have to play this game to the buzzer, and
give Oklahoma State credit they did and they're moving on.  
  
Q. Coach talk about the experience of coaching Sarah Hansen for five
years.  
COACH SMESKO: It's been a real treat, she is the brightest young lady I have
ever coached. She is such a competitor. Would have been nice to see her get to
advance in this tournament and that's going to be another frustration about
this, as our two trips here, We've got two overtime losses in this 12‑5 game,
she is going to be greatly missed, she is the greatest kid, but that just
makes it all the more for her.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS: WEST
LAFAYETTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WEST+LAFAYETTE)

  

## March 22, 2014

  

### [Kacie Cassell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26879)

### [Jodi Kest](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26878)

### [Rachel Tecca](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26881)

  
_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  84  
Akron  55

COACH KEST: You know, I know the outcome wasn't what we thought beforehand,
but I am so proud of these young ladies. I'm not going to allow one game to
define the body of work that we accomplished this year, especially with these
two seniors sitting next to me, and even as poorly as we played today, and
give credit to Purdue.  
And their defense, I guess I'm not used to playing against players that are a
little bit taller and stronger and at no time did our kids give up. I'm just
so proud to be their coach, and I know these young ladies, I will have a
relationship with them ten, 15 years from now, because they are great kids and
they are kids that you want to be associated with.  
  
Q. What did you feel like Purdue did so well defensively to keep you guys
from doing what you wanted to?  
KACIE CASSELL: Their length, they are really long and lengthy. They put their
biggest girl in front of Hanna. We shot the ball not very well. I mean, they
knew our offense. They stopped it and we just couldn't get rebounds and
couldn't get second chance opportunities, because they did a good job of
boxing out and getting on the boards.  
  
Q. You obviously like to get out and run, and to do that, you have to
rebound; how much did that limit your transition game today in?  
RACHEL TECCA: Yeah, we didn't rebound too well today, which did limit us
offensively running the floor. We did have a few opportunities, but yeah, they
rebounded a lot better than us today. They are more physical, taller, and I
just think we struggled with that.  
  
Q. How much was the tough matchup for you guyswith 32?  
RACHEL TECCA: Again, strong, physical post. Very hard to push off the block.
She did a great job feeling inside, and I mean, I definitely struggled with
that today. Wish I could have done a better job. But yeah, commend her for
being physical in there and just stealing really well.  
  
Q. The way Purdue started this game, leading 20 ‑2, how much did that sort
of put you behind the 8‑ball in the first five minutes?  
KACIE CASSELL: We've been there and we played them in the MAC Tournament, so
we didn't get down in ourselves. It didn't hurt us at the end of the game
because that deficit, we could never really get past 11. We never got down on
ourselves, we kept fighting to the end, even down by 20, we just kept fighting
and keep working. So proud of our players because they never give up. I think
the younger kids will feed off that next year so I'm proud of them.  
  
Q. I saw you grab your leg in the second half, did that hinder you
throughout the game?  
RACHEL TECCA: I got hit with a knee brace pretty hard and it was bleeding but
it was just really painful at first, kind of a Shock. I got taped up and went
back out. It was fine.  
  
Q. What do you both take from this season and its totality?  
KACIE CASSELL: I mean, one game doesn't define our season. We've set the
records. Most wins in the season, we won the MAC for the first time ever. We
came in with goals to get a banner up there and that's what we've done, and
I'm so proud of them, and this girl right here.  
RACHEL TECCA: I'm just so proud of what this team has done all season. We have
been together for four years now and we've developed friendships that's going
to last us a lifetime. I'm so happy to be part of it, and like Kacie says,
this doesn't define what we've accomplished this season and the four years
we've been here.  
  
Q. What was it that Purdue was doing so well defensively to take you out of
what you wanted to be able to accomplish?  
COACH KEST: Well, they were a little bit longer and stronger than we've seen
all year. They made it difficult for us to get the extra passes into hands the
way they played and we weren't getting too many offensive rebounds, and we
weren't getting too many stops where we could run and that put us in the hole.
But I was really proud of our kids because they did fight really hard to get
it down to 11 going into halftime and the second half, unfortunately, that's
been one of our struggles is coming out of the second half flat and we did it
again today with not a very good three‑point shot and it cost us two and
another wide‑open three so we are down by five.  
  
Q. Hanna struggled today shooting the ball, how was Purdue able to contain
her from ‑‑ to get going on offense?  
COACH KEST: Again, give them credit. That's the worst shooting she had had all
year, not just her, but first time I think we were under 40 percent all year.
She's not used to going against kids that long and that tall. She's normally
able to jump over everybody and then when she finally did have a lot of good
looks, I think she got a little frustrated at times and started to fadeaway.  
But we wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Hanna and the rest of those
kids. I mean, she's fought all year and unfortunately today she struggled.
Again, give Purdue credit. They did a phenomenal job with that, applying a lot
of pressure, she always had someone guarding her, they kept switching up
different players on her and we don't see that very often.  
  
Q. You mentioned slow second ‑half starts; knowing that, what did you do to
try to jump start them and get them coming out of the locker room, and then
did you call that real quick time‑out; anything there?   
COACH KEST: No, we just talked about what we needed to do better and come out
strong and execute that first play which we didn't do a very good job. We took
a quick three which is something we really didn't want to do. Just happened, I
don't know what to say.  
  
Q. Why was Purdue a tough guard? We heard about your offense coming in, and
they weren't able to put up 80 points on you guys ‑‑  
COACH KEST: They are known for their defense and all the research we did on
them, they are a very good offensive team but she does a fantastic job with
them defensively. They face guarded her a lot and that gave us a lot of
problems.  
  
Q. How much of a problem was it, your matchup with 32?  
COACH KEST: We have a lot of respect for her, very strong kid. We tried to
double as much as possible, and a couple times and we didn't do a very good
job of rotation and it hurt us. She was someone that we talked about a lot.

## March 22, 2014

  

### [Tiffany Bias](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22720)

### [Jim Littell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23326)

### [Brittney Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26550)

  
_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

Oklahoma State: 61  
Florida Gulf Coast: 60

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach to make an opening statement and go to
questions for Tiffany and Brittney. Coach?  
COACH LITTELL: I've got about 50 texts on my phone saying "survive and
advance" and that's exactly what we did tonight. Very, very good Florida Gulf
Coast team. Extremely well coached. That guy can coach with anybody in the
country, I promise you that. He has his team well prepared. We knew going into
the game that it was a very tough guard for us, and the fact that they spread
you out and drive so much, they shoot so many three's. We may have been a
little too locked in on guarding the three's, and we really got beat a lot off
the dribble drive. I'm just‑‑ I'm happy right now that we advanced. It's one
of those games in 36, 37 years of coaching that you kind of look at and go,
how did we win that game? But these kids didn't quit.  
When we were down 10 or 12 in the second half they continued to make plays and
just found a way to win at the end and I'm very proud of 'em.  
  
Q. Tiffany, I guess they say sometimes you save your best for last. You
hadn't made a field goal all day and you had 8 turnovers, but tell me about
that ‑‑ the game‑winning basket. I think there was 41 seconds to play. Talk me
through that play. Did it finally feel good to make one?   
TIFFANY BIAS: Thank you. Sometimes you have those games you can't do anything
about it, you have to keep pushing for your team and 8 turnovers is bad for a
point guard. I was playing too fast, I should have played more under control
but we won and we're moving to the next game. I think it's one of the things
you can't dwell on and you have to look to the next one.  
  
Q. I'm talking about the last play ‑‑  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: The one you went all the way through the middle and made that
last bucket?  
TIFFANY BIAS: Oh! See, I‑‑  
COACH LITTELL: You only made one basket! (Chuckles.)  
TIFFANY BIAS: I know! Um no, I just think its one of those things where you
have to attack and get to the free throw line. I think it was more in our
minds to go through and get the foul and it was one of those things, it's
determination just knowing you're going to make it.  
  
Q. Both of you, you went to the line with a chance top kind of ‑‑ if the
final 5 seconds and missed and Brittney comes away with two steals in two
seconds. Talk about the inbounds plays. You know they're going to throw the
ball the end of the court and Brittney was able to get the steals and kind of
the relief of getting away with a game that you trailed in double digits in
second half.   
BRITTNEY MARTIN: The free throws are something we work on every day. That
shouldn't happen. All of us missed a lot of free throws and I should have made
the ones at the ending, which would have helped us a lot.  
We just pulled it out and we wanted to win and we knew what they were going to
do at the end, and they were trying to get the ball to 14 and she had the hot
hand so I guess we had to just really, I guess, stick to the game plan.  
TIFFANY BIAS: I agree with Brittney, I think Coach put us in a good position
where to guard and to switch on everything and so I think we were in good
position for that.  
  
Q. Offensively or defensively where do you think FGCU caused you the most
trouble?  
TIFFANY BIAS: I think offensively it was drives. I think we weren't moving our
feet and they were getting us off the dribble and I think that's what hurt the
most.  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think so, too, I think we focused so much on them not
shooting 3‑pointers and I think we played too far up on there them and didn't
move our feet so I think our defense really hurt us today.  
  
Q. They put a lot of bodies in the paint trying to prevent you guys from
throwing the ball in the middle. When you got it in the middle it seemed like
you were successful, but can you talk about the struggle it was getting the
ball in the middle and Tiffany, how difficult it was to get the ball into
Jones and Martin.  
TIFFANY BIAS: They played great side help defense so that's one of the things
we need to adjust to, see the skip. That was their game plan, to closing up
the middle. You just kind of have to get it in there any way you can and that
opened up our outside shot.  
  
Q. Tiffany was there anything they did defensively that led you to getting
the 8 turnovers?  
TIFFANY BIAS: I think I forced it on my own. I think I was moving a little too
fast and trying to make things happen that wasn't there. I mean, I blame that
more on myself than I do their defense messing me up.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the stats? Okay, thank you, ladies. Questions
for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, was there a point in regulation where you were thinking if they
get one more bucket this could get sticky?  
COACH LITTELL: I was thinking that from the fifteen minute mark on in the
second half. They play such good defense if get behind them 10 to 12 points
like we did, they're kind of a ball control offense. They're so well coached
in the fact that they'll run the clock all the way down to wait for you to
make a mistake. So by falling double digits behind it was really tough coming
back because they don't shoot the ball in a hurry. They don't make mistakes.
They're going to get a good shot at the basket, so it was touch and go for a
lot of minutes and it was more than the last four or five minutes.  
  
Q. Coach, when you look at the first half and you're up 20 ‑9, they missed a
bunch of layups, now looking back with a 1‑point win how fortunate is it that
is the way the ball drops? They missed 12 layups in the first half.   
COACH LITTELL: I told their coach, I said, you had the shots to win the game
and some of their kids just missed wide‑open layups and we're fortunate, we're
very fortunate and we realize‑‑ I've been in the game long enough to realize
the shots that we gave up and how many shots, and the shots they had and when
you do that, I think on top of that, our top scorers, Donna goes 3 for 12,
bias 1 for 9 and Martin 4 for 11, those kids go 8 for 32, our top‑three
players go 8 for 32, I feel very fortunate to get a win.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about how you thought he could coach at any level. Will
that style of play translate to the Big 12 or the other power conferences?  
COACH LITTELL: I think it will. You know, the one thing that may make a
difference in our league on that is you may have trouble rebounding, playing
the four guards at times but a lot of the Big 12 has gone to that but where
they're different is Whitney Knight is more of a true post, she is a point
guard off‑guard than a true post and where they're different is they've got
five guards on the floor that can lower their head and put the ball down on
the ground and get to the rim and shoot threes. And that's why I saw them on
film and said it was a difficult guard for us.  
  
Q. Coach, LaShawn went 5 for 5, Kendra 4 for 5, granted they put a lot of
bodies in the paint. Were you a little disappointed that you weren't able to
take advantage of some of those match ‑ups in the middle a little more?   
COACH LITTELL: Well, they know what they have. They know the size that they
have. They've spent all year making sure that the ball doesn't go in the
middle. There is a reason they won 26 games. They do the things that they do
very well. We tried to go inside. We had some turnovers doing it. I think
where we got hurt more is we skipped the ball across to the corner and we
missed five, six, seven wide‑open looks. To get 'em out of the paint you've
got to skip the ball and make shots to get them out of the paint and we didn't
do that so they were able to secure the paint all night long.  
  
Q. You mentioned Whitney Knight. Did you do anything defensively either in
the last 5 minutes of regulation or overtime?  
COACH LITTELL: What we did is we told‑‑ when we spread the zone we said for
someone to always stay close to her on that and we were going to make some of
their other guards hit shots. When she went to the dead corner we brought our
5 all the way out of the hole and matched up to have a fifth person on the
perimeter. We got to the corner and a forward replaces the post down low so
that was the adjustment that we tried to make. We lost her twice in transition
and she hit two quick three's and I think that took the game close to say a
10‑point lead right then and we were just determined not to give her anymore
open looks.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

## March 22, 2014

  

### [Whitney Bays](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26934)

### [Courtney Moses](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21782)

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

  
_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  84  
Akron  55

Q. Can you reenact the flex you did after the blocked shot there? What kind
of moment was that for you to go long with the whole game, the way you started
and to have that kind of play and feed off the energy of the crowd?  
COURTNEY MOSES: We started off really well. Coach always talks about getting a
great start, and collectively as a team we did just that and it was just a
play within that run to keep the energy going.  
  
Q. What was it defensively you felt like you did so well, not only the 20 ‑2
stretch to start things but to hold the team to 55?   
WHITNEY BAYS: We really paid attention and I thought that. Dee Dee Williams
did a great job on one of their best players and we rebounded 50‑28, so that
was a key stat.  
COURTNEY MOSES: Yeah, just feeding off what she said, rebounding and I think
we communicated really well like on screens we were talking and switching and
we really had each other's back and we really came out with a good win today.  
  
Q. Whitney, just to be able to control the boards the way you did, how much
do you think that limited their transition opportunities?  
WHITNEY BAYS: Well, rebounding is always an emphasis for us. I just tried to
crash all the time and I think it helped us in transition, getting out and
getting some shots. It was able to slow them down sometimes, too.  
  
Q. For both players, just playing here in the NCAA Tournament, how does that
help you guys move forward year ‑in and year‑out?   
WHITNEY BAYS: Definitely with our fans it helps us and we practice here, we
played here all year so I think it does have our benefit, its benefit, but
yeah, it's our home court so there's pressure to get the win obviously, too.  
COURTNEY MOSES: Our fans were awesome today. They were very, very loud and
hope to see them again on Monday.  
  
Q. You got off to a slow start but you overcame that and what got you going
there and do you feel like you had a pretty big advantage inside what maybe
was a difficult match up?  
COURTNEY MOSES: I think all of our post collectively did a great job. It's
been a long two weeks, that's not an excuse by any means but definitely we
need to knock‑down those shots if we try to get further into the tournament.
Going off of them and they still kept going into me and that gave me some
confidence and I was able to get some looks and actually finish.  
  
Q. Did you see the first game at all, Oklahoma State, any opinions on them
in the impending Big Ten, Big12 matchup?  
COURTNEY MOSES: Yeah, we saw a little bit of the end of the first half, three
minute, and Oklahoma State is a very good team, they are solid, every position
will be a tough match up for us.  
WHITNEY BAYS: Yeah, we saw what they had to offer and everything and they are
a good team and we just want to, we are not satisfied with today. We want to
keep moving forward and obviously get as far as we can.  
  
Q. How nice is it to see Coach get win 300?  
COURTNEY MOSES: It's awesome. She's had one great coaching career at Purdue
and that's going to continue on this year, and to get 300 and be a part of
that is special.  
WHITNEY BAYS: Knowing Coach, there's many more to come. She's a great coach
and she prepares us for everything. We are going to go over Oklahoma and
really prepare for them and she covers all the bases.  
  
Q. How big of an emphasis was it to get the ball inside, not only to Whitney
but just feeling like you had a pretty big advantage there on offense?  
WHITNEY BAYS: Yeah, we knew Akron's players‑‑ our post players have been good
and we could go high, low, so that was the emphasis the last two weeks was
working on the high‑low game and getting inside.  
  
Q. Dee Dee has been on this run of being able to take out one of the other
team's best player; where would you rank this one as far as the last month or
so, what she's been able to do?  
COACH VERSYP: You know, I mean, Dee Dee is just enjoying the moment as a
senior. She's embracing everything. She doesn't want everything to be her last
game. She's just Dee Dee and she's just really doing great. She's knocking
people down and she did a fantastic job.  
Bridget came in and played some of the minutes to give her a rest and you
know, when they listen to the scouting report, we really work on a lot of
tendencies, a lot of coaches don't do that, they just say this is a good
player. But we really work on their individual tendencies and Dee Dee has been
like this since she was a freshman. So she's a tough one to replace just
because of that mind‑set, so she's one in a million.  
  
Q. How were you able to slow them down, and in particular, Hanna, one of
their leading scorers, probably shot one of the worst she's ever shot before,
how were you able to contain her?  
COACH VERSYP: Well, we knew their best game is transition offense, so we did a
lot of transition defense all week. We knew we needed to crash the boards. We
sent four to the boards to put pressure on them that way, and then on a made
basket we tried to jam them; meaning that we tried to find somebody three and
slow her down a little bit so we could have time for our players to get back,
and then, you know, Luburgh is a fantastic player. Die de's length at 6‑1, her
athleticism and then we had other post players if Dee Dee got caught and they
were switching out and then bridge it is 6‑3\. So she was taking the same
shots she normally would have but I don't think in their league they have 6‑1
and 6‑3 and I think that was the difference.  
  
Q. Just the combination of defense and rebounding in this game, just really
was the answer; doing anything they wanted to do pretty much offensively?  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, that was a big key for us. I just felt we always give our
kids a challenge. They are the ninth‑best scoring team in the country and we
wanted to keep them under 60 and we did that today.  
You know, so when we set out goals, that's the big thing, and when they know
someone can score like they can and run up‑and‑down, they all can shoot the
ball well and do some great things, we just have to make sure we keep doing
what we're doing.  
Defense, our players know defense is where you get it done and on the board.  
  
Q. I know you'll start preparing right away for your next game, but will you
spend my time celebrating your career milestone?  
COACH VERSYP: I won't, because it's not about me. You know, our fans, some of
our family and our groups getting together, but it's for the NCAA. It's not
about the wins. Again, it's just about all the coaches and all the players
that have been a part, I guess, of the program all through the years and I'm
just very fortunate that I've had some great ones for us to continue to
achieve milestones.  
  
Q. You probably knew you had an advantage with Whitney, after she got off to
a slow start, did you have to tell her to keep going at it or did she just
pick it up eventually and start hitting some?  
COACH VERSYP: I mean, she‑‑ I just knew she would be fine. You know, when she
had the three offensive boards to pad her stats, to finally make the basket, I
think I was on the sideline jumping up with her every time, but you know,
she's just a workhorse.  
She'll figure it out. She's one of the craftiest offensive players that we
have and that I've ever coached and then we get to have her for another year.
But she's fun. She's just fun to watch. She has to work it out. Players have
to work it out.  
  
Q. What was your view of Courtney's block and her celebration?  
COACH VERSYP: I was right there. I was right in front of her. I saw these big
eyes and this little body coming up. You know, when you have someone like that
that can have a block from the weak side, it's pretty exciting.  
  
Q. How important was the big start to shake off any of the rust or nerves?  
COACH VERSYP: It was huge. For us to get off to a 16‑2 start, that was big.
You know, that's what we have to do, and that's what we talked about and the
kids have been hungry and they are tired of practice and they wanted to go get
somebody else. It's just really trying to set that tone early.  
And I thought our fan base was incredible. It sounded a lot more than what the
attendance says. It was amazing, and that's what we have to continue to
hopefully forge forward on Monday.  
  
Q. Oklahoma State, what do you know about them?  
COACH VERSYP: You know, there's a lot of similarity. They have got a great
shooter on the outside that's got great size. They have got a good low‑post
player, like Camile for us, they have a great point guard and scorer in
Martin. They have all the pieces to the puzzle so we have to play a game like
we did today. We have got to have a lot of bodies in there. I thought today we
wore people down because we rotated a lot of players. You know, but it will be
a fun matchup. If you have a four and five match up in Big12, Big Ten, it's
just a different style, so you know, obviously we'll embrace it.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
COACH VERSYP: Just very excited for the NCAA Tournament. It's been a while
since we've played, and to be one of the Top‑64 teams is obviously‑‑ we feel
honored and we worked exceptionally hard to get where we are and we are just
excited to get back out on the court and do something tomorrow.  
  
Q. From the Iowa game and the turnover problems, I guess when you look back
at that, what was the root of the problems and how do you go about fixing
those?  
COURTNEY MOSS: Iowa's two weeks ago, so we are putting that behind. But the
big thing in that game was communication, and it was a little thing. So taking
care of communication in defense will help settle us down on offense.  
DEE DEE WILLIAMS: I agree wholeheartedly with Courtney. Communication is going
to be a big key for us. It's not necessarily why we turned the ball over but
it's a huge key as to why we turned the ball over. I feel like these last
weeks of practice we really worked on that and we got it together.  
  
Q. From what you've scouted of Akron, what do they do so well offensively
that you guys are going to have to try to slow down a little bit?  
DEE DEE WILLIAMS: They run really well in transition. From the games that we
watched, that's really all that they did. They run plays but mainly transition
and transition our defense is going to be key tomorrow. We are just going to
have to communicate and get to it.  
  
Q. You guys have done a good job all season long, and really over your
career, of slowing down individual players. How difficult is that with them
because they have two players who are pretty good scorers. Do you try and take
one away or look at both? What kind of problems do they present?  
DEE DEE WILLIAMS: I just like just going out there and just locking down and
playing defense. Not necessarily want to take one away; if we take both away
that would be awesome and if we do just take one away that would be awesome,
too. But I do feel like if we can go down with the attitude of lock down
defense, I know that we can take everybody away, and I know that's what we're
going to do tomorrow.  
  
Q. The defensive mind ‑set that you guys had probably the last month or so,
how important is it to get back to that as you start this tournament?   
COURTNEY MOSS: Coach always says that defense wins championships, wins games,
and offense sells tickets. So it's all about defense and we have really
focused on that the last two weeks that we've had off here and really the
whole entire season. That's what Coach has preached to us our four years here.
It's her philosophy that it all starts with defense?  
  
Q. Most of your players, teammates, have NCAA experience but a few don't. Do
you have to give any advice to some of the new comers to what this is like?  
COURTNEY MOSS: We just have to lead by example, just bringing energy and I
think sometimes when you don't know what to expect, it's better than knowing
what to expect. So just let them figure it out and lead by example.  
DEE DEE WILLIAMS: I just feel like leading by example and also just telling
them to go out there and play hard and I know they will. They are girls who
came in and will do anything for their upperclassmen, so I have no‑‑ I feel
like, yes, it's going to be probably a little scary for them but at the same
time, I know if they just go out and play hard, they will be fine?  
  
Q. I know it's simple but just talk about the advantages of being at home
for this and how that is able to help you, especially now having a couple of
weeks of rest.  
DEE DEE WILLIAMS: It's always a nice advantage to be able to play at home and
have your fans here cheering for you. I love it. I feel like the girls love
it, and I think the Purdue who‑‑ the administration who paid for us to host
the tournament here; but I'm really excited about it. I know it's a huge
advantage for us and I'm just ready to get out there and play.  
COURTNEY MOSS: It's awesome be to at home again on our senior day. We knew
that it wasn't our last time playing, so that's always nice when you're
seniors. Just thankful to the administration for letting us be able to get
this opportunity and we hope to see lots of fans out tomorrow.  
  
Q. This whole field that's here can really get up ‑and‑down the court and
score pretty well. Is there anything specific that you felt like you were
doing in the six‑game winning streak that was missing in the Iowa game?  
COACH VERSYP: Communication. I feel like in Iowa, I feel like it was dead
silent out there for us. Of course, you had the fans out there, but on the
court we were dead silent. I feel like communication is huge for us and the
six games we did win, we were out there talking and we were out there moving.
I felt like the Iowa game, it's kind of like we were shellshocked, but at the
same time we just weren't communicating.  
  
Q. Curious if in the time that you've been here, if you've seen Coach Versyp
change as a coach and if so, how?  
COURTNEY MOSS: Through the four years we've been through a lot together with
Coach. We went through a lot of adversity together. I would say just the
biggest change I've seen is just having fun. She told us earlier in the season
it's been a fun year to coach.  
It's kind of teaching us life lessons. It's something she's done her whole
entire coaching career but when you go through adversity, it makes you even
teach those lessons more and enjoy each day.  
DEE DEE WILLIAMS: I just feel like through the four years and all the
adversity we've been through, she's become more of a mother to us. Granted we
are here for four years and freshman year, she's always going to be your
mother away from home but with everything we have been through the past couple
months, the past couple years, she's really become a mother to us and helped
us and willed us to gut seasons in. Thank you, Coach.  
  
Q. For both of the players, just the last game against Iowa, it's been a
while, how excited are you to finally stop answering all these questions and
just get out and play?  
DEE DEE WILLIAMS: I was just telling coach on the way down here I'm just ready
to get out here and play. Practice is always good, but to play is a whole
different story; and then to have‑‑ be at home and have the fan base behind
you is just going to be awesome tomorrow. I'm just ready to get out there and
play.  
COURTNEY MOSS: I think as a whole entire unit, as a family we are ready to get
back and play. The coaches are ready to stop watching so much film and the
players are ready to stop practicing and actually put our game plan into
action tomorrow so everybody is just really excited.  
  
Q. Was it as simple as communication in the Iowa game that got you away from
what you had done so well during those last six games defensively?  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, Iowa is a good basketball team. They won six in a row. And
we did communicate. There was nothing‑‑ there was no unity out there at all.
You could sense it; you could feel it. But we've just got to get back to
Purdue basketball and can't win them all.  
  
Q. Is there anybody that you played this year that you can compare Luburgh
and Tecca?  
COACH VERSYP: I think the guard, Rachel Banham; inside post player, Jordan
Hooper. You know, so I mean, we've had to face and try to take and limit two
to three players in the Big Ten every single game. In the Big Ten, there's
always two or three players that you've got to do that to.  
So you know, I compare them to an Iowa, Nebraska type of feel, and if you want
to compare the kids heights‑‑ she rebounds a lot better than Rachel. Rachel
Banham is one of the best players in the country just flat‑out. Just some of
her tendencies skill‑set wise, but we have to keep both of them off the
boards.  
  
Q. Did communication problems lead to the turnovers in the last game?  
COACH VERSYP: No.  
  
Q. Was that just poor decisions ‑‑  
COACH VERSYP: Just not‑‑ over. Over. Nothing else to talk about. That's two
weeks ago.  
  
Q. What does 300 wins mean to you?  
COACH VERSYP: I don't keep track of stats. Everybody tells me things. I'm
like, oh, that's nice.  
It's all the players; it's all the coaches that have coached with me, and
everybody in the process. I'm only as good as the people that surround me and
if we can get another win, that's fantastic and then hopefully it will be
another milestone. If I can stay in coaching a long time‑‑ I won't be here to
get 900 wins, that's a long time.  
But again, it's about everybody else. It's just a number but again I
appreciate all those that have allowed the success that has occurred here.  
  
Q. You have slowed down individual players this season, and over the years,
Banham this year and Hooper, and Lucas the first game; what do you attribute
that to, just following and executing scouting reports, good defense of
players? What sort of goes into that?  
COACH VERSYP: I think it's a combination. Players have to perform. We put in a
game plan and if they are stepping up and performing‑‑ if one individual has
an assignment, that means everybody else has to be just add attuned because
it's a team defense. And it's that belief that defense wins.  
I mean, everybody in the country, it's all about offense; that's all that was
poured into these kids heads for nine straight months. But I think when‑‑ but
the officiating has changed so we have been able to play some more defense.
It's a combination but it's been a struggle this year at the defensive end.
I'm just pleased where we are at right now.  
  
Q. How appreciative are you of the administration to bring an NCAA
Tournament first and second round back here, and is that an advantage going
into the tournament?  
COACH VERSYP: I think it's big. I compliment this administration every single
second. You don't have student athletes usually verbally say that from a
camera, it's usually coming from a coach, so you know I instill that in our
student athletes.  
That's one of the big reasons why Purdue women's basketball has been one of
the top programs in the country because they started way before I got here.
They were hosting way before and that's when they were able to hopefully get
to the Sweet16 and March on from there.  
So it has not been around just since I've been here. It's been over the last
20 years, and that's huge. It's a big advantage with women's basketball.  
  
Q. I would guess you've looked at a lot of film from Akron throughout the
season. Could you tell the difference, they started 7 ‑8, finished 16‑1, where
did that finish?   
COACH VERSYP: For them their offense is what gets them going. Just really
pushing the ball and making misses and they are just really playing great
basketball together. When a couple kids knock down shots, things just continue
to get better as it goes. If you miss free throws, it kind of goes the other
way.  
But they are just really gelling, and when you win a couple games and you keep
going‑‑ and she rotates a lot of people, and they do their job, and they share
the ball. There's two key players that score a lot of points but they are very
good at sharing the basketball and not taking bad shots.  
  
Q. Other than the two Iowa games last month ‑‑ you've been moving the ball
really well, why do you think that's been the case?  
COACH VERSYP: We are not forcing the ball, we are just moving. We are sharing
the ball, and we are just going to let them play. I think when you have a stat
that's negativeyou try to not talk about it and it becomes a positive and
that's kind of what we did.  
  
Q. Can you talk about their point guard, Cassell? Her assist ‑to‑turnover
ratio is outstanding. What does she do well?  
COACH VERSYP: She doesn't force anything and she has four kids scoring 22
points a game almost, so going to give them the ball. I think she has two
players that can flat‑out score for her and she's setting those players up.  
She's fun to watch, there is no question, and she leads that team. We have to
frustrate her a little bit if we can, but she's just real solid and that's the
key. She doesn't care if she scores. She needs to score. She's just setting up
for that three‑point shot in transition but she's that point guard that gets
everybody involved and everything goes from her.  
  
Q. I asked you about Akron's turning point. You finished the season well.
Was there a game or a time that got you playing good basketball?  
COACH VERSYP: You know, we had moments. When we won at Penn State; that was a
moment. When we won at Nebraska, that was a moment; those were two, early.
After AK went down, every game was a moment. Everybody in the country didn't
think we would do anything. It's stated all over the national news, they
didn't expect anything from us after that happened.  
So each game has been very important for us, so it's not one game in
particular. I think it's the moments and advertises that has allowed us to
rise to the occasion.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
KARL SMESKO: We're really excited to be here. Our goal all season long was to
make it to the NCAA Tournament, and we had to win a couple last‑second games
or overtime games to put us in this position. But we're excited about the
opportunity and we're trying to be as prepared as we can to be competitive and
give our best opportunity to win.  
  
Q. Who gets the challenge of guarding Tiffany Bias tomorrow?  
SARAH HANSEN: Probably one of our guards. I mean, we have a guard rotation
where when somebody gets tired they can sub out and put somebody else on her.
It's mainly just going to be whichever guard happens to be the one that picks
her up in conversion, I guess.  
  
Q. She never comes off the floor. Is that kind of how you have to approach
it, that we're going to have to go with multiple players and hope that we can
kind of wear her down a little bit as the game goes on?  
JENNA COBB: Yeah, definitely. It's just going to be a group effort all around
tomorrow, but definitely with our group rotation, obviously she's an amazing
player, so we're all just going to have to work together to stop her, or do
what we can.  
  
Q. Coach, Oklahoma State talked about your unique offense as everybody does
and shooting the threes, five girls that can hit threes, but does that put a
lot of pressure on your shooting? What happens if you guys aren't hitting
those threes? Does that put pressure on you to make those?  
WHITNEY KNIGHT: I don't think there's any pressure. We're just trying to make
sure we do what we're supposed to do, what we've been doing all year, working
on what we're supposed to do in our offense, screening and cutting and those
type of things. I don't think there's any pressure on making shots. We know we
can knock down shots when we need to.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about rebounding? Oklahoma State has come out
of the Big 12, which is kind of a meat grinder, with a plus average against
their opponents in rebounding. How important do you think that will be to kind
of negate that?  
SARAH HANSEN: We know that second shots are a big deal. Whoever has the most
opportunities to score is obviously going to have the greatest opportunity of
scoring the most points. We just know we have to be able to keep them off the
boards. We want to try to take them out of what they are going to do. And if
they happen to miss a shot, we have to be able to take it from them. We have
to be able to get their rebounds so they can't get second shots. Put‑backs are
about the easiest shot to make. You're right at the basket, there's not very
many people in front of you. We just know we need to try and eliminate that.
And then offensively obviously we want to be able to try to get as many second
shots as possible.  
  
Q. Jenna, you played here in Indiana. Are you and the two Indiana natives on
your roster sort of serving as tour guides here for the weekend?  
JENNA COBB: Well, one of the weird things, I've actually never been to West
Lafayette or Purdue. I've been to IU, Butler, obviously, and a few other
Indiana schools, so this is kind of a new Indiana experience for me. But we
were all pretty excited coming back here to Indiana since we have so many
Midwest girls, and three of us have been pretty familiar with the Indiana
area.  
  
Q. Sarah, I was wondering if you could tell me about your five ‑year career
here at FGCU. I'm not sure you knew about the school originally, and now
you're in the Hall of Fame. Can you just kind of take us through what the last
five years has been like?   
SARAH HANSEN: It's definitely been something special. When Coach called me up
and he brought me down here, I couldn't have asked for a better experience on
that trip and I knew it was where I wanted to be. My first year was a little
bit rough, but then it got better and obviously I couldn't be more happy with
the decision I made. FGCU has been so good to me, the people, from the
students to the community to everybody involved with the administration. It's
just been an amazing experience, so I couldn't be more happy with the decision
I made.  
  
Q. Sarah, can you talk about the second time around being in the NCAA
Tournament and how does this feel the same and how is it different?  
SARAH HANSEN: I mean, it's the same because it's where we wanted to be and we
know it's where we wanted to be and we know that we belong here. We're excited
to be here and excited to make some noise and play to the best of our
abilities, get our team out. But it's a little bit different because we have
such a different group of girls. Before we were playing with a group who knew
each other so well and played together for so many years, and now it's more of
we have played together and we've built that team chemistry that we've been
working on all season, but it's a little bit‑‑ we have a little bit more
athleticism than we did, whereas in the past we were athletic but we were
smaller, we weren't as quick, and we had to rely a lot on intelligence, and
now we're still trying to play a smart game of basketball, but we have a
little more athleticism and a little more quickness.  
  
Q. Whitney, first of all, you sent out a couple of Tweets a couple of days
ago in regards to your health. How are you feeling?  
WHITNEY KNIGHT: I feel fine. I'm great.  
  
Q. Did that come from Coach?  
WHITNEY KNIGHT: No. No.  
  
Q. Sarah and Whitney, after watching the men do what they did last year, how
much when that was going on did that motivate you for this season, and now
that you're in the tournament do you look to them for inspiration?  
SARAH HANSEN: We just knew that we wanted to get back, and seeing them be able
to make the runs they made and upset teams that they upset just showed us that
you can do it. I mean, it's absolutely possible. You've seen it with the games
already in the men's tournament yesterday and everything. There's been upsets
and everything. So that just goes to show you that just because we have a
lower seed or we're not the highest seed where we're at, we're in a good
situation and we're in a position where we can if we play to the best of our
abilities make some noise.  
WHITNEY KNIGHT: Yeah, I mean, I agree with Sarah. Anything can happen. We're
coming in prepared. We're focused and we're ready to play our game. We think
if we play together as a team and have fun out there then we can compete with
any other teams‑‑ well, Oklahoma State.  
  
Q. Jen and Whitney, one of coach's concerns has been about their speed and
just the level of that play. Is there anything you've tried to do to
approximate that speed in practice?  
JENNA COBB: I mean, not really because you can't really make anybody, like, as
fast as them, if we don't have somebody who's as fast as them in practice. I
think the biggest thing is just helping each other out with that speed, going
one‑on‑one is kind of difficult at times, so just making sure our defense
we're playing together and helping out and stuff like that.  
  
Q. Sarah and Whitney, the best part of playing in this offense is what?  
SARAH HANSEN: Probably that we can score in so many different ways that it's
not just‑‑ we rely on one person for isolations or we rely on somebody getting
the ball and blocking and posting out big. Everybody can contribute and
everybody can contribute in so many different ways.  
WHITNEY KNIGHT: There's a lot of different opportunities for different things,
like we can screen, we can cut, we can drive, we can shoot the three. There's
a lot of different things we can do. We're not just sticking to one particular
thing all the time.  
  
Q. You guys have had two common opponents, particularly TCU. Have you been
able to glean anything off of that that may help you tomorrow?  
JENNA COBB: I mean, that was pretty early in the year, and I would say the
biggest thing we ran against with TCU was boxing out. I mean, we struggled
with their height a little bit. They played a pretty good zone and everything.
I don't know if that would be the same as Oklahoma State so much. But I think
we can learn from that. They have quick guards, they have a quick point guard
who could shoot the ball, who could drive, and that's pretty much the same
situation with Oklahoma State.  
I think the biggest thing is that we can take from that is just rebounding,
getting on the boards, everybody in there, five people working together.  
  
Q. Whitney, do you like being known as a three ‑point shooting team, or as
you mentioned, do you have different areas that you can attack teams with
besides the three‑point?   
WHITNEY KNIGHT: I wouldn't say necessarily we like being known, but it's
definitely good that we are able to shoot the three because it makes the
defense stretch out, which allows us to do other things in our offense like
attack or create space for other people to drive and things like that. I think
it's definitely a great asset to our team.  
  
Q. Coach, about Tiffany, their point guard, she seems to be kind of a
special player. When you watch her on film, what's priority No.1 as far as
trying to slow her down? I don't know that you necessarily, completely shut
her down, but how do you slow her down a little bit?  
KARL SMESKO: Well, that is priority No.1 is you have to get back and you have
to get the ball under control. She gets it out, and she's about as fast as
anybody we've seen in the open floor. You have to give yourself a pretty good
head start and get yourself organized defensively, and you can't rely on one
person to stop the ball.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what it's like for you to come back to Indiana? Did
you ever try and get Purdue on the schedule when you were at IPFW?  
KARL SMESKO: When I was at IPFW we were just moving to Division I. I scheduled
the first year of Division I and to be honest I don't remember if Purdue was
on the schedule or if we contacted them to schedule or not. But when we've
been at Florida Gulf Coast we've been close to playing Purdue a couple times.
We were supposed to play them one trip in Cancún and they had an unfortunate
incident with one of their players and they couldn't make it, and then we were
in the same tournament with them this year in México, and we didn't match up
with one another. It was set up so we didn't play each other. We're familiar
with Purdue and how good they are and how good they've been.  
  
Q. Can you give us an update on your team's health, particularly with
Bethany and Anthi?  
KARL SMESKO: Well, Bethany and Anthi aren't playing. They won't be dressing.
They're still out with their injuries. Everybody else is healthy and ready to
go.  
  
Q. Why shoot all these three ‑pointers, not just this year but throughout
your career?   
KARL SMESKO: Well, we want to be efficient offensively, so we try to take the
most‑efficient shot we can get. We try to stretch people out with shooters,
have a lot of movement. We think it opens things up for cuts to the basket and
drives to the basket.  
When we take a shot, we're trying to get the highest return for that shot that
we can possibly get, and a lot of times through a possession that's shooting a
three‑point shot.  
  
Q. You mentioned priorities. Could a second or third priority be boxing out,
because I read somewhere that one of your big concerns was them being able to
chase down misses.  
KARL SMESKO: Well, yeah, they're a big team. They're an athletic team. They're
a very physical team. That's one of the reasons why they are so good. We have
to have our players‑‑ I mean, we don't match up in terms of size or
athleticism. We have to be willing to be physical, and we've basically got to
scrap out some rebounds. I'm not saying we need to win rebounds because that
would be a lofty expectation, but we have to be competitive on the boards so
we're not giving up a lot of put‑backs that are just two feet from the basket,
make them have to at least get long rebounds and work to get another shot
rather than just get a miss and put it right back in.  
  
Q. I was wondering if ‑‑ I understand that one of your recruits, Taylor
Goodall just was named all‑state Indiana. If you could just talk a little bit
about her and if this is going to be an area that you'll continue to recruit
in?  
KARL SMESKO: We've recruited the Midwest pretty heavily since I've been at
Florida Gulf Coast. There's a lot of Midwest kids that enjoy coming to
Florida, so you have to find out early whether there's somebody who's willing
to go away from home or if there's somebody that if they tell you they're
wanting to stay close to home, you've got to move on and go with the people
that the idea of Florida sounds good to them.  
We're proud of what Taylor was able to accomplish this year. We're excited
about having her next year. She's a point guard that can shoot, but she's a
very smart player, and then she's a very physically tough player. I mean,
she's going to add to the toughness of our team. She doesn't mind throwing her
body around.  
  
Q. Does that give you any advantage, so many Midwest girls, probably
bringing a little bit of fan support? Do you feel that's any advantage?  
KARL SMESKO: Well, I think the fact that they are excited about‑‑ one, it's
hard to be more excited than being in an NCAA Tournament, but if there is a
way to be more excited, it was to come back to the Midwest where their family
is going to see them, and not just their family, their families probably would
have traveled anywhere, but their friends and coaches, and there's going to be
a lot of people that normally don't get to see them play in a college game. It
does add a little bit of extra excitement to our players, if that's really
even possible.

## March 21, 2014

  

### [Kacie Cassell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26879)

### [Jodi Kest](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26878)

### [Rachel Tecca](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26881)

  
_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
COACH KEST: We worked hard the last two years, and to win that MAC
Championship, especially what we went through last year, losing to Central
Michigan in the finals and seeing all the chairs that they had in the locker
room. And after that loss, they really got committed to putting in more work
and wanted to get back and feel the joy of winning that championship game, so
I'm really happy about being here.  
  
Q. Casey, Hanna, Rachel, after winning the MAC Tournament for the first time
in program history, how were you able to regain that focus to get back to
basketball and get back and get ready for this game?  
KACIE CASSELL: You know, we just came to practice ready to go. You know, we
won the MAC Championship and we were really excited about that and we came
back to practice on Tuesday and ready to get focused about that. We weren't
thinking about that. We were just looking forward to the next game we played.  
HANNA LUBURGH: We had a couple days off, so we just enjoyed the win for a few
days and then when we got back in the gym on Tuesday, we were just focused and
just ready to listen to what we were going to do against Purdue.  
RACHEL TECCA: Yeah, also, we're playing great as a team right now, and I think
we're having a lot of fun as a group, so we're just excited to be here and
play tomorrow versus Purdue.  
  
Q. Rachel, why is your team so good offensively?  
RACHEL TECCA: Well, thanks to Coach Kest, she put in a fast break offense a
few seasons ago, and we've had a lot of practice at it. We have the personnel
for it, too, as well. We are finesse players. We get out and run and Casey
pushes the ball up the court and looks to get us all the ball. So I think it
just works out great for our personnel.  
  
Q. What's the difference between your team before January 15 when you were 7
‑8 and after when you went 16‑1?   
RACHEL TECCA: I think the biggest difference is that we are playing together
as a team. Everybody knows their role now. I think at the beginning of the
season, we were playing more like individuals. Now I just think we are
clicking as a team and we have a lot of team chemistry out there.  
HANNA LUBURGH: One of the big things is our bench play has improved
tremendously. We have a lot of contributions from everywhere now. Before it
was just a couple of people. So now we have, you know, really, just a lot of
contributions. So it's really helping us, and the confident level of our bench
is really high right now, as well.  
KACIE CASSELL: I would agree. Our bench has stepped up tremendously. I
couldn't be more proud of those girls. And I think we really looked in the
mirror; January 15, we looked in the mirror, what had we been doing wrong, and
we made improvements in practice and so we stepped it up.  
  
Q. At the MAC Tournament, some of you state that had Coach Kest gave you a
chance. Bigger schools looked over you, possibly for being too small, not
strong enough. Does that motivate you going up against a Big Ten school like
Purdue?  
HANNA LUBURGH: I mean, I think we all want to prove ourselves. So I think that
we are just going to go out there and play our game. I'm not really focused on
whether they recruited me or not because I'm happy with where I'm at with
Akron. So we just want to go out and represent the university the best way we
can.  
KACIE CASSELL: I agree with Hanna 100 percent on that one.  
RACHEL TECCA: Yeah, same. I think all three of us are just happy to represent
the university for the first time in the NCAA Tournament and we're just happy
to be here.  
  
Q. You guys are playing pretty good right now and the fact that your
championship game was on Saturday and there's a quick turnaround, no long
layoff, do you feel like that will help you keep your momentum?  
HANNA LUBURGH: Absolutely. We like to play. We like to play basketball games,
as everybody else does. So I think that being able to play right now, in a
week, we're ready. We're in rhythm. We feel good about ourselves. So, yeah, we
are excited to play already on Saturday.  
  
Q. The President of the United States picked you guys to win. What is your
reaction to that?  
KACIE CASSELL: I love it. Thanks, Obama. That's awesome.  
  
Q. First time coaching, getting this team to the NCAA Tournament, is there
any change in your preparation from the MAC Tournament to the NCAA
Tournament?  
COACH KEST: No. We keep things very simple. You know, like they said, it's all
about us. Our preparation is going to be the exact same. It's never been a
concern for us who the opponent is. We've just got to take care of us.  
  
Q. Was there a particular game or moment that you thought was a turning
point in the middle of the season?  
COACH KEST: They talked about it a little bit. After we lost to Miami, we were
1‑3 in the conference and that hurt us, because we lost to Central, wasn't a
big deal. We didn't play well, we lost to BG, but losing to Miami at Miami
really hurt.  
The coaching staff, we came back, and we self‑evaluated on what could we do
differently. Sometimes you always want to point the fingers at your players
and blame them, and we needed to look at ourselves and what we can do to get
better, and then, as well, look at the players and what they can do to get
getter.  
So we made a change in the starting lineup and we sat them down and said: We
are good enough to win the rest of the games, 14 in a row, or we are bad
enough that we can lose 14.  
The change really helped in the starting lineup, Carly came off the bench and
did a fantastic job, especially a senior, that's a tough role; you've been
starting for the last year and now all of a sudden you're coming off the
bench.  
Like the players said, I think our bench has played unbelievable over the last
month: Anita Brown, Katie Nunan, Carly off the bench, Megan Barilla; and even
though Rachel and Hanna both scored 22 points, those other kids knew that they
had capabilities of scoring but were not looking for that early on, and they
were open.  
I think Casey offensively has gotten so much better. Early on they were not
guarding her at all. They were double‑teaming Rachel or Hanna; and I think the
last month, she had a lot of confidence right now in her offensive ability and
that's helped out. We have five players on the floor right now that can score
at any time and that makes it very difficult at times to stop us.  
  
Q. Courtney Moses, their leading scorer, what does she do so well and
defensively how are you going to be able to stop her?  
COACH KEST: I don't really know if anybody can stop her. I think we want to
try to contain her. She's phenomenal. I see her playing the WNBA next year.
She can score so many different ways. She can score in transition. She scores
with all the different sets that they have. She scores in the two‑man game
that they have.  
She's just phenomenal. And to be honest, and I've seen Purdue play on the Big
Ten network as a fan, just watching basketball, but not really evaluating it,
and what I've watched the last six, seven games and watched their team play
how impressed I am with their team and their coaching staff. They do so many
good things. We are going to have to play a great basketball game in order to
beat them.  
  
Q. Is there anybody that you've played this year that has a similar style to
Purdue or that remind you of Purdue?  
COACH KEST: A little bit size‑wise, maybe Dayton. Dayton was a very big team
and they like to score in transition. And you look at Purdue, they score so
many different ways n transition and halfcourt set. They don't set as many
ball screens as Dayton does but size‑wise I would rank them as close.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
JIM LITTELL: We're very excited to be here for the NCAA Tournament. We know
that we play a quality team in Florida Gulf Coast that is very well coached.
They play a very unique style of play. 972 of their 19‑hundred shot attempts
have been three‑pointers, so it's going to be a little different guard than
we've had in the Big 12, but we're excited to be here. We've had a tremendous
year, placing third in the Big 12, and very proud of what our team
accomplished, and we're excited to play.  
  
Q. Can you just kind of talk about the NCAA Tournament experience last year
and how much better that prepares you going into this year's tournament?  
TIFFANY BIAS: No, we're excited to be here. Last year we made a good run. We
had that second game at Duke, and we were up, and I think we learned from that
just knowing to keep our lead and keep our composure and keep the momentum on
our side and slow things down and execute our sets.  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I feel the same. I think that we learned a lot from the Duke
game. We just had to‑‑ we learned to be patient, and I guess work together
when we get in situations like that.  
  
Q. How much does that play a factor in the NCAA Tournament, this experience,
because there's very few girls on Florida Gulf Coast that have that
experience. Does that give you guys an edge come tomorrow?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think a little bit. I mean, I can't say we're familiar with
it because it's something different every year, we play someone different
every year, but I think it does because we know how it feels to be here.  
TIFFANY BIAS: I agree. I think we have a lot of experience on our team. A lot
of the girls know in tough situations what to do and who to count on, and we
all count on each other, so I think we'll be ready just for any tough
atmosphere.  
  
Q. Because they shoot so many threes, can you talk about the difficulty and
just kind of preparing for that?  
TIFFANY BIAS: Well, we have great rebounders on our team, so I don't think
that I'm worried about us that much. I think that if we just do our job and
box out our players, I think that we'll be able to get the rebounds.  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: And I think blocking out is a different situation when
shooting three‑pointers because rebounds go behind you. We emphasize so much
blocking out and getting close rebounds, and I think it's a lot harder to get
the rebounds that go out to the three‑point line, so we have to kind of adjust
our block‑out situations and things like that.  
  
Q. Tiffany, when I look at the stats, I think the one that sticks out the
most is how many minutes you play. How do you kind of condition yourself
outside of basketball to embrace playing basically 40 minutes every single
game?  
TIFFANY BIAS: Well, a lot of conditioning. I think in the off season we
condition a lot, and I just kind of always had that motor growing up. It's
just something I do. I've always just run, run, run. I think whatever I can do
for my team, if I can stay out there 40 minutes, 30 minutes, whatever I can do
for the team.  
  
Q. Brittney, why are you such a good rebounder and how much pride do you
take in that?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I take a lot of pride in it. I think that I could get better
at it because I don't know how to block out, but I think that a lot of
rebounds just kind of‑‑ I don't know, I think just hustle really gets you far
in this league and in the game, so I think just running for them and I guess
trying to push people out of the way.  
  
Q. As a guard?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: Yeah, I'm a pretty big guard, so I'm pretty lucky on that.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Sarah Hansen? She's a two ‑time league
player of the year. How conscious do you feel you have to be of her and where
she is at all times?   
TIFFANY BIAS: I mean, she's a great player, so I think that's one of the keys
of the game is to kind of show down and keep her contained and make sure we
don't let her go off. I think we have a good scout on her, and I think that
we'll be ready.  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: We just have to know where she's at in all possessions of the
game really is what it is.  
  
Q. Had you heard of Florida Gulf Coast before Monday? They're kind of an
obscure team. I know a lot of people heard of their men's team after last
year, but what did you know about them before they announced the pairings?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: Sadly I have not heard of it. I don't want to be rude, but
I've never heard of that school. I mean, it's cool, though. It's good that
we're playing something new and seeing new people.  
TIFFANY BIAS: Yeah, I agree. I think that they're a very athletic team, and
it's always great playing someone else besides the league and seeing how other
conferences play, so it'll be interesting and fun.  
  
Q. Is that good or bad, playing a team you've never heard of?  
TIFFANY BIAS: I think it's good. I think that they haven't seen us play
really, so I think it's a surprise on both ends. So I think that our staff
prepares us well for every game, and the scout is always good, so I think
we'll be well‑prepared and we'll be ready for whatever they have.  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think it could go both ways. They don't know us, we don't
know them, so we have to stick to fundamentals and things like that during the
game. So I think it's going to be‑‑ I think it's a lot of fun playing people
we don't know.  
  
Q. Kind of piggybacking on that, you guys have been through the Big 12,
which is one of the big meat grinders in women's college basketball, and to
play someone like Florida Gulf Coast you may not know as well, how do you find
the tendency of having a letdown?  
TIFFANY BIAS: I think just play our game. I don't think you can really worry
about letdowns. I think if we come out like how we know we can play, we'll be
just fine.  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think that we just have to play. We just have to play hard
and I guess want it more than the other team. Really anybody can beat anybody
if they want it more and if they try harder and work for it, I guess.  
  
Q. Tiffany, the last month ‑and‑a‑half you guys have been on the win one,
lose one type of thing. How do you explain, I guess, the inconsistencies there
or maybe it is consistency where you haven't been able to get on a winning
streak but also avoid a losing streak?   
TIFFANY BIAS: Well, like our coaches tell us, it's one or done, you've got to
give it all you've got and leave it all out on the floor. It's been a little
bit of a roller coaster for us, but we fought through it as a team. That's how
we get through everything. As long as we stick together as a team, we'll be
okay.  
  
Q. Brittney, Tiffany was talking about her motor that never goes off. When
you're looking up to a senior leader, how much does that kind of inspire the
rest of the players on the team to see probably the best player on the team is
the one out there doing that and playing 40 minutes every single night and
making sure this team is doing everything it can to get victories?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I mean, everybody wishes they had a motor like Tiffany. I
think everybody in the world wishes that. I think she grew up like that, and
of course we all want it and we can't all get it. I'm happy that I have
somebody to look up to that goes hard in practice every day, that goes hard in
the games. She never stops, but I think she really helps our team a lot with
even just that, even if she didn't score points. She just tries really hard,
and I think that really picks us up and helps us out a lot.  
  
Q. We talked about the last month, I think 6 ‑7\. Is momentum a big factor
when it comes to the NCAA Tournament, and how do you overcome that because
maybe you don't have as much momentum?   
JIM LITTELL: It's called the Big 12 is the answer to that. You know, you could
look at it in another fashion; we won one, we lost one. We were one of three
teams in the Big 12 that didn't have back‑to‑back losses, so that gives you an
indication of how tough it is. Iowa State started conference play 3‑0, and
they dropped four in a row. Texas late in the year finished third, tied for
third with us, they lost three in a row. Baylor lost two in a row against
UConn and Kansas, but they didn't lose two in a row in the conference. West
Virginia didn't lose two in a row in the conference, and we didn't lose two in
a row in the conference.  
It depends what perspective you look at it. It just tells you the strength of
the Big 12 from top to bottom that we beat up on each other within that
conference. I think it's probably more crucial to look at the big picture,
that we finished third in the No.1 RPI conference in the country. Yes, we
would like to have avoided win one, lose one, but I think that's kind of the
nature of our league and where we're at as a basketball team.  
  
Q. Why haven't you dropped back ‑to‑back games? What about your team has
allowed you to bounce back?   
JIM LITTELL: I think our group has been pretty resilient. Some of those games
that we lost were very tight games we played well. We got blown out a couple
games. But five of our eight losses are to the conference champion. Five of
our eight losses came to Baylor and West Virginia. We led West Virginia at
home with two minutes to go. We missed a lay‑up at the buzzer to beat Baylor
in overtime. We lost to Baylor by four in the semifinals of the Big 12
Tournament. We've had a nice year, and it sometimes doesn't give that
perception when you win one and lose one, but when you look at the big picture
of things, our kids have been pretty resilient and bounced back to always play
the next game.  
We've approached it from the standpoint that it's 18 individual battles, and
you've got to turn the page and let the last one go and get on to the next
game. I think our team has done a pretty good job of that.  
  
Q. One of the things I noticed when I was looking at your stats is you don't
have 20 ‑point‑per‑game scorer, but you've got like 14, 11, 11, 9, 7.
Obviously every coach would love to have that. How dangerous does that make
you when you have eight players deep that are capable of going out and being
scorers on any given night?   
JIM LITTELL: It's helped us from the standpoint that a few years ago we had a
young lady named Andrea Riley who was all‑time leading scorer in Big 12
history until Griner broke her record late last year. We were in a situation
if Andrea didn't get 35, we were probably going to get beat, and if she had a
bad night, we were probably going to get beat.  
What's been good about the balance that we have on this team is somebody can
have a bad night and you still have a chance to win the game. There's been a
lot of games that we've had four people in double figures, some games we've
had five in double figures. So I just think when you have balance, and the
opportunity for different people to score the basketball gives you a better
chance to win games.  
  
Q. Obviously Tiffany is a great player and looks like she can score. She can
set up her teammates and everything. How special of a player is she when you
put the total package together?  
JIM LITTELL: Well, she's been the face of our program for four years. She came
in and started from day one. Probably 80 percent of our games when the score
is tight and in conference games, she's playing 40 minutes a night. Leader,
best worker that we have on the team, tremendous heart. We've used the word
motor before. It's a young lady that in four years has never lost a sprint in
practice, never lost an agility drill, never lost any competitive thing during
offseason workouts. She's just a special young lady that respects the game and
approaches the game the right way every day.  
  
Q. You alluded to this before: Did you have to do anything special to
prepare for their three ‑point shooting, and is there an opponent that's
similar to them as far as the amount of three‑point shots they take?  
JIM LITTELL: Yeah, it's different for us. It's a different guard for us than
we've had a lot of times. You know what people don't realize is they not only
shoot the three extremely well as a team, but they put five people out there
that are capable of doing that. You get conscious of that, and you get up too
tight, you lose a stance, and they're beating you on a direct drive to the
basket. It isn't just one‑dimensional in the fact that they shoot all threes.
They're very good at direct drives to the basket and getting themselves to the
free‑throw line.  
The Knight, the young lady is a special talent, when you're 6'3" and shoot
that many threes and have the ability to put the ball on the floor and then
two‑time conference player of the year, they've got some really good players.
They have good balance, as well, and it presents a lot of challenges for our
team, as I'm sure it does teams within their conference and around the country
because they play such a unique style of play.  
  
Q. Sounds like you want Brittney to rebound a little bit better or at least
put a body on someone when she's going after it, but that aspect of her game
and having a guard of that size, being able to rebound that well, what has she
meant to the team?  
JIM LITTELL: She had 15 rebounds against Baylor, she had 11 in the semifinals
against Iowa State, and to finish your question on that, Iowa State is as
close to them in our league, as many threes as they shoot.  
I'm just old school; I like to have somebody block them out, and she has the
idea I can go get it better just flying around.  
I said, you know, Krzyzewski, Knight, John Wooden, they wanted you to block
out, but what the heck do those guys know. She hasn't convinced me, and I'm
not sure I've convinced her yet, either.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 8, 2014

  

### [Michaela Mabrey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26562)

### [Kayla McBride](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23276)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

UConn  79  
Notre Dame - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open with a statement from head coach Muffet McGraw, then
take questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH MCGRAW: It's hard right now to remember what a great season this was.
But I think that's what we need to reflect back and think about, getting here.  
Tonight's game was incredibly disappointing for all of us, in particular the
seniors. I know how much they wanted it. And I wanted it for them.  
But Connecticut was‑‑ they just overpowered us. They killed us inside. Their
bigs were just too much for us.  
I thought Stewart was phenomenal. Dolson, 16 and 17 is pretty amazing. I
thought we were overmatched in the post. And I thought if they could‑‑ if we
could have made them go to their bench a little earlier in the second half, we
might have had a chance.  
I thought that's when we made a run in the first half, and unfortunately they
didn't have to go to their bench in the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: We have Kayla McBride and Michaela Mabrey. Questions for the
student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Kayla, can you talk a little bit about the dominance that UConn had
inside? And would Natalie have made somewhat of a difference in that regard
tonight, do you think?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: You know, I think that we just came out undermatched. I don't
think anything could have changed to change that. They just came out and they
went directly in the post, and our help side wasn't there from the get‑go.
They got comfortable. They got into a rhythm, and it went downhill from there.  
  
Q. For either of you, how much is UConn affecting your shooting? You had
stretches where you couldn't get shots to fall. How much was it the ball just
not going in, or how much was UConn affecting that?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: I think a lot of it was ourselves. I think we were kind of
being ourselves, we weren't in the rhythm in the offense, we weren't making
the extra pass, we weren't playing the normal way we've been playing the past
37 games. I think that's what made it look so bad.  
  
Q. Again for Kayla. As the coach was talking about, is it difficult right
now to look back and think about how good a season it is when it ends in this
manner?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: No, I'm proud of these girls regardless. We've been through so
much this year, so much adversity. If you look at what our bench has done this
year, I couldn't have been more proud of them. I wouldn't want to be anywhere
else or playing with anyone else.  
  
Q. Michaela, you held your own with them on the boards for a half, I believe
it was 20 ‑18 at halftime, and they came out and just completely overpowered
you in the first five minutes of the second half. What happened that allowed
them to just completely do that?  
MICHAELA MABREY: You know, we really weren't boxing out at all. We weren't
getting a body on them. To begin with, they're bigger than us, and I think we
tried to make that a point at halftime to box it out and get a body on it.  
We came out. We really didn't do that. So I think they got mostly their
offensive rebounds.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything further for the student‑athletes? Okay. Thank you,
ladies.  
Questions for Coach McGraw.  
  
Q. When you shook hands there with Geno after the game, what did you all say
to each other?  
COACH MCGRAW: I said something like I thought we were playing the Miami Heat
for a while; you guys are just that good. What a great season. Things like
that. I thought they were just missing LeBron was the only thing they were
missing.  
  
Q. The shooting, you guys have been shooting the ball so well all season
long beyond the 3 ‑point line, et cetera. What did you see that was not
working tonight, and how disappointing when you've been that good all year?  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, their defense was very good. When you have somebody like
Stewart on the perimeter, she's such a good shot blocker, I think that that
made it a little bit more difficult.  
They were looking to double, I thought, a little bit more. The post was
stepping out and trying to take the guard, and they had had a lot more size
with that.  
And a little bit of it, I think, was just the bad start, then we were
pressing. We were really‑‑ we were just trying so hard, and we went one‑on‑one
instead of ‑‑ our game has been team and assists and working the ball
together. And I thought we tried to go a little bit too much off the dribble.  
  
Q. Geno said before the game you couldn't match up against both Kayla and
Jewell. Looked like they just concentrated on taking Jewell out of the game,
and they did. Were you surprised by how effectively they were able to do
that?  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, no, I don't think they get enough credit for their
defense. They're a good defensive team. And Jefferson is kind of like a gnat.
She was really feisty. K‑Mac was able to get her shots, but Jewell struggled a
little bit to find her rhythm tonight. And I think you have to credit their
defense for that.  
  
Q. You battled back late in the first half and I imagine felt decent where
you were at halftime. What changed right at the start of the second half when
they went on their run?  
COACH MCGRAW: We made our run when they went to bench. We went to the triangle
and two. It was very effective. We made some shots. I think we got into a
little bit of a rhythm on our own.  
And then the second half they didn't sub. And that was the difference. We
couldn't go to the triangle with their starters. We couldn't play them man to
man and we couldn't play them zone.  
So they went off and running. We couldn't rebound. We had no answer, really,
for anything they did.  
  
Q. Muffet, what does this senior class for you mean to the culture of what
basketball is at Notre Dame?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think they changed the culture, the expectation level. I think
they set the bar really high. They've achieved so much in four years, and all
of them have contributed a great deal to it in so many ways, on and off the
court, with leadership and the basketball part as well.  
But it's going to be a really hard class to let go of. This was a real
emotional one for me. And this group has really meant a lot to me personally,
too.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions? Thank you.

THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Connecticut is head coach Geno Auriemma,
Stefanie Dolson, Kaleena Mosqueda‑Lewis, and Breanna Stewart. We'll open with
a quick statement from Coach Auriemma, and then we'll take questions from the
student‑athletes.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, there really isn't much that you can say when we have a
performance like that where your players are just really locked into what we
wanted to do and how we wanted to do it.  
There's just an incredible effort by the entire team, especially these three.  
And there's been a lot of great moments at Connecticut and a lot of great
moments in our NCAA history. But especially for our two seniors and the way
these guys played, I couldn't be prouder of a group of players than I am right
now.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Stewy, you said you wanted to win four titles. You're halfway there, two
Final Four MVPs. What does it mean for you to have two titles in two years and
a chance to win a couple more?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think to be able to have two National Championships under
my belt, I think it means a lot. And I think that each team has been
different.  
And I'm really happy that we could send Stef and Bri off on this note, and
they deserve it.  
And when it's time to get back to work we'll do that, but right now we're
enjoying this moment.  
  
Q. Stefanie, the points in the paint tonight were, I mean, huge. Probably as
huge as we've seen in a title game. What is it like being in the post, knowing
that you could pretty much do what you want on that night?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: It's pretty nice, I gotta say. Right from the beginning of
the game we went in, took advantage of the size we had against them.  
And right when we realized what an advantage we had, we just kept kind of
pushing it at them, and we never really backed down.  
Give a lot of credit to my guards. They got me the ball. Stewy, we got her the
ball a lot in the post, too. When we got it, we just did what we wanted and
finished it.  
  
Q. Kaleena, can you just put in perspective, I mean, with all the stuff
you've been through this season, to play as well as you did tonight and kind
of just put that in perspective for us?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: It's a great way to end my season especially the way,
like you said, it started out. And I just can't say how happy I am to be able
to win it for Stefanie and Bria and for all of us to play the way we did
tonight. I think this is one of the best team wins we've had all season.  
  
Q. Stefanie, when I was out on the court, I talked to Breanna. She said you
and her had a conversation last night, and she said: We've got you; we've got
your back. Did you feel like your teammates had your back tonight?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: Absolutely. I knew from the beginning of the season that we
were going to have a great team and that we had a lot of talent and a lot of
potential. And coming to this tournament I knew this team had both mine and
Bria's back. Coach really emphasized with them kind of sending their seniors
off with the right note.  
And I couldn't have asked for better teammates my senior year. We had a ton of
fun this year. I'm proud to be with these girls, and I thank them every minute
of that game that they helped me get the National Championship my senior year.  
  
Q. Kaleena, there was so much attention towards Breanna and Stefanie leading
into the game. At any point did you feel like you were the forgotten piece and
you couldn't make a mark tonight?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: No, I didn't know that. I was just still on the team.  
STEFANIE DOLSON: We never forget her.  
BREANNA STEWART: She's an essential.  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: There's 11 essentials on this team. So I think all of
us just went into the game trying to contribute as much as we could.  
  
Q. Stefanie, can you talk about what it is with this program when it's a
National Championship game, this program plays its best?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: I mean, there's not much to explain about it. I think it's
just you come into every year knowing you have one ultimate goal, which is to
win the National Championship. So you know when you get there you're so
prepared that there's no other‑‑ there's no other ending than winning. So you
just go into it and you prepare all year.  
I think a lot of people said we had a lot of pressure going into this game.
But when you're prepared, we didn't feel the pressure at all. We went into it
knowing we had this game. We had a lot of confidence, and right from the
beginning we just never backed down. And I think it's something that every
year every team does when you're at Connecticut.  
  
Q. This is for Stefanie. You guys now have nine titles, and I wonder if you
could talk about what it means to be one of the people who gives this to Coach
Auriemma? He's now the all ‑time leading winner in terms of titles in women's
basketball. What that means to you? And also to have it be a perfect season,
kind of the cherry on top?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: Yeah, he's not bad. He's all right. I don't know if he'll say
it or whatever. But we're proud of him, and having nine national championships
is such an amazing accomplishment, and for us to have kind of that two out of
the nine seems like a small little piece, but it's a piece of history and a
piece of a legacy that he has created here at UConn.  
And seeing all the old players here back to kind of cheer us on in this game
was something that I'll never forget. It's just a family, whether you're here
10 years ago, three years ago, or now. You're just connected.  
You bleed blue. But literally you're all connected as a family. And it's
something that not a lot of people can say they're a part of. And obviously
it's pretty solid, too.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach Auriemma.  
  
Q. You probably couldn't write a better script than for women's basketball
and for you guys, 40 ‑0, perfect season. When your ninth title break record
with Pat in Tennessee, what does it mean‑‑ you said you weren't a numbers guy
yesterday, but what does it mean to have No. 9, to cap off another season
against another unbeaten team here in Tennessee?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I honestly believe this: That where it happened, whether it's
here or some other city, really doesn't have any significance for me. That's
never entered my mind. When you get reminded of it all the time about what it
means, you start to think about what it means.  
And it means we've done something that no one else has ever done. So you're
flattered and you're grateful and you're all the things that come with this
kind of accomplishment. Of course. That's not the driving force. That's not
what motivates us at Connecticut.  
As Stefanie said, we try to do the right thing for the people that are there.
If it means winning a National Championship, great. If you come up short,
there were a bunch of ex‑players in the locker room after the game, and there
were six players in there and four of them had played on undefeated National
Championship teams.  
As you start to look back, you see them sitting there, you're just more proud
of the legacy that exists of what is Connecticut basketball as opposed to the
number of championships.  
  
Q. Looked like you were a little emotional when you brought Bria and
Stefanie off the court. Can you talk about them and what this night meant to
you in relation to them?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I probably haven't felt that except a few times. But there's
always a moment that kind of brings you‑‑ kind of brings you to your knees
sometimes.  
When Bria Hartley and Stefanie Dolson played their first game at Connecticut,
it was win No. 79 in a row. That's a lot to be thrown into as a freshman. And
the second game of the year was Baylor. And then we went on to win that record
90 in a row.  
And ever since that day, ever since that day they played their very first
game, I can't think of two people that have given every ounce of their energy
and everything that they possibly have to give for the basketball program and
the people at the University of Connecticut.  
That just doesn't happen very often. So when they came off the floor, I think
we all knew exactly what was coming to an end. And even when it's as great as
the ending was tonight, it's still coming to an end. And it really hit me. Hit
me really hard.  
  
Q. In terms of game planning, it was very clear that you made a point of
emphasis to go into the post. And you knew Achonwa wasn't there, but I imagine
even in your wildest dreams you could not have thought it was as effective as
it was. But specifically heading into the game, was that the point of
emphasis, was to attack them low?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, it was. We thought that there was some advantages that
we had that whoever was guarding Stewy was going to have a tough matchup in
the lane. And Stefanie, the same thing.  
They then changed up a little bit defensively and played the triangle and 2
where they were guarding Stewy hard and Stefanie hard‑‑ I mean Kaleena hard.
And as we spread those guys out all over the floor, then it just left a lot of
openings in the lane. And we took advantage of it.  
But you don't go into the game thinking that you're going to outscore another
team by 30 points in the paint. You have an idea what you want to do, but kind
of went back to some things that were working earlier this season, tried to
get real comfortable.  
We hadn't been shooting the ball great coming in, so the last thing we wanted
was to come out here start firing jump shots. And we knew we had to score. We
knew we had to get a good possession every time down, because they're so hard
to defend.  
Our defense today was unbelievable. It was incredible. I mean, to hold that
team to 20 points in the second half, that's incredible.  
  
Q. Coach, if you could also address with Kaleena sort of the, I guess,
emotional, mental, physical hurdle she's had all this season to play as well
in the tournament and to cap it off tonight.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Earlier Rebecca asked me: There's always themes that run
through a season, and what was this one? And I really think that K's season
represented exactly what this was all about. It started with the injury in the
Stanford game and then all of a sudden we're down. Now we've got to play
without one of our best players. And then she comes back and it's another
injury. And then it's mono then one thing after another.  
I'm most proud how she handled that whole adversity; that for her to play her
best basketball‑‑ we talked about it before the NCAA Tournament started. I
said if we're fortunate enough to play six games, these six games could wipe
out how frustrating the other four months were.  
That's exactly what happened. She was unbelievable the entire tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, on Sunday night, Markisha Wright was the person who probably more
than anybody, other than Kayla McBride, stepped up to fill some of the void
left by Achonwa. Tonight you held her virtually scoreless and I think two
rebounds. How much did that factor into your game plan containing her?  
COACH AURIEMMA: There wasn't any particular big guy that we were focused on. I
think it was more what were we going to do with their shooters, how we were
going to guard Kayla McBride and how we were going to guard Jewell Lloyd and
how were we going to guard when Mikaela Mabrey came into the game.  
In the first half we did an okay job, then did a terrible job towards the end
of the half.  
We just knew we had to rebound the ball. We knew we had to outrebound them by
a lot. Not by a little. And because we scored so many points, I think Muffet
had to go to offensive players on the floor.  
So she probably played those other guys to try to get points on the board more
often than the way they played the other night. When points were just coming
so easily, you can afford to have someone in there that maybe isn't an
offensive player but is just going to crash the boards.  
But Stefanie Dolson played the game of her life and got every rebound. And
that was the key.  
  
Q. Geno, you talked yesterday about how probably there are more eyeballs on
this game because of the two undefeateds and perfect season the casual fan
would watch it. The last time I remember something like that might have been
the Stanford game a couple years ago when it was 20 ‑12 at the half. It seems
tonight the first half was really entertaining, both teams scoring. Big
picture, do you think this may help what you guys are looking at maybe that
could transcend the game and get more people interested?   
COACH AURIEMMA: I think the final score probably maybe, if that had been
different, it could have been maybe even more. But anybody who watched that
first half had to really admire both teams, the way we played, how hard we
played, both teams, how hard we competed.  
I said this the other day: Notre Dame's the best team we played all year. No
one else is even close. And I knew it was going to take an unbelievable effort
for us to beat them.  
I told Muffet after the game, I don't think she got enough credit. She won
Coach of the Year. But I don't think she even got enough credit for how her
team performed all year long.  
That was an unbelievable team we played tonight. And we played about as well
as we played at any other time in the season for sure.  
  
Q. Geno, this is Nashville's first time to host the Final Four. How did the
city do?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, it won't be the last time. It won't be the last time. We
were talking earlier. I know there were some circumstances that why they
haven't been able to have one here earlier, but now that you've got the
building, you've got the hotels, you've got‑‑ I could probably count 50 people
that traveled down here with us that don't want to go home. They said that
they want to move down here.  
And I think it's just perfect. It's not overwhelming. It's not a place you're
going to get lost in. You don't have to travel around for half an hour, 40
minutes in a car to go find stuff. It's all right there. And the people have
been absolutely amazing.  
As you knew they would. This town has a great reputation. I'm sure they host
great events. They're used to it. And I hope this becomes a regular
destination, and I hope we come back here. I hope we're back here the next
time they have it here.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. That's all the time we have. Thanks.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thanks everybody.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now from Notre Dame, head coach Muffet McGraw and
student‑athletes Taya Reimer, Lindsay Allen, Kayla McBride Jewell Loyd, and
Ariel Braker.  
  
Q. Kayla, now that it's here, what does it mean to be playing in this game
tomorrow night for the championship in this historic battle of unbeaten
teams?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: Yeah, we're excited. It's been a long season. So to be playing
in the final game, I know as a senior it's a great opportunity for us and this
team.  
We've been through a lot this year. We're just excited to be able to play on
the biggest stage.  
  
Q. Taya, can you talk a little bit about the challenge inside, the
difference between playing without Natalie against Maryland and now having to
play without Natalie against Connecticut?  
TAYA REIMER: It's been a challenge. She's been our leader all year and
obviously one of our best players in general and obviously a great presence
for us inside.  
But we're going to work as hard as we can, be physical with them down low. And
we did a pretty good job against Maryland, and we're going to try to keep that
up tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kayla, could you just talk about what does the rivalry with UConn mean to
you over the years? And if there's any two undefeated teams that should be
playing for a National Championship, does it seem fitting that UConn and Notre
Dame are those two teams?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: We always have a great game. I think it's great for basketball
in general. I think the fan base increases a lot during this game.  
Yeah, we have history. Especially the last couple of years we had some great
games. It's definitely exciting. I know we're excited. Two great programs
going at it. So I can't wait.  
  
Q. Kayla, how nice is it for you to be here at this stage after what you've
gone through in your career?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: Oh, wow, it's kind of surreal that this is going to be my last
game in a uniform. This program has meant so much to me over the years.  
This season is something special, being undefeated and with this team. It's
definitely a little different than my past years.  
To be in the National Championship game and to be able to play for Coach
McGraw and with these girls, it means more than you know.  
  
Q. Ariel, having played Connecticut so many times in the past, what kind of
advantage is that for you?  
ARIEL BRAKER: I think it's a little bit of an advantage, except this year, I
mean, we haven't played them at all. So you kind of have to X out those past
games, especially because we're a different team and they're a different team.  
So I think at the same time it's kind of an advantage but not really, just
because we're a different team than we were the past years that we played
them.  
  
Q. Kayla, what specifically is different about playing UConn, whether it's
the intensity, whether it's schemes, compared to every other team that you
play or have played?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: I think there's an intensity factor. I think a lot of people go
in playing UConn, they see their jerseys and they've already lost the game.  
I don't think we're like that. I think we have a certain swag to us, and I
think it's like that with any team. And I don't know, I think we already don't
like each other, so that adds to it, too.  
But it's just a good game, and we get up for these types of games. We know
it's going to be competitive. We know it's going to go down to the wire. We
know it's going to be intense, and that's something that we like to do and go
against.  
  
Q. Question for you, Coach. I know you said you were confident in your
team's ability to bounce back even without Natalie, and it really seemed like
they didn't skip a beat. Seeing that as a coach, what was that like and how
confident are you in this next game?  
COACH MCGRAW: I don't think I've ever been prouder of my team than I was in
that game last night, to see everybody, every single person who went in the
game stepped up to help us win, whether it showed up on the stat sheet or not.  
This is a team that's completely united. We have now more of a cause. We're
playing for Natalie. We want to win this for her. We want to win it for the
seniors. This group has tremendous chemistry. And it's been a really great
ride this year.  
  
Q. Jewell, after playing those four intense games last year against UConn,
was there anything in the ACC, was there any rivalry, any game that rivalled
the emotion of what Notre Dame went through last year in all those games
against Connecticut?  
JEWELL LLOYD: I think we had some really good games against Duke. This team,
we play with a lot of passion, so whenever we step on the court, we bring in
that fire and we bring in emotion on the court. It doesn't matter who we are
playing; we play together and we play hard.  
  
Q. Taya, could you talk about maybe you getting a little bit of a crash
course in playing UConn the last couple of days. Obviously you've never played
them before, but what have you found this rivalry means to some of your
teammates?  
TAYA REIMER: Well, obviously just before I even got here, watching the games
and being at some of the games, I'm definitely very aware of the rivalry. But
the past few days, I mean, we were focused on Maryland and we weren't looking
ahead to playing either UConn or Stanford.  
But I'm very aware of the rivalry, and now that that's who our opponent is
going to be, I mean, obviously I'm aware of it and definitely ready to play. I
know it's going to be a battle.  
  
Q. Coach, what has Lindsay Allen's contribution been during this run and
also just fitting into your back court that you have?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think she's playing with the poise of a veteran. Her assist to
turnover ratio has been 5 to 1. It's phenomenal, playing with such poise and
such maturity way beyond her years.  
She's getting the ball to people. She's doing so many great things, both ends
of the floor. I'm just so happy for her. And she's exceeded all of our
expectations this year.  
  
Q. Kayla, you mentioned the intense rivalry with UConn and I guess the
feelings that both teams share, but what part of you as you're watching them
play Stanford was secretly hoping that they would be there at the end so you
could face them?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: I think Stanford and UConn are both great teams. I wasn't
looking for either one of them. I know I was going to the National
Championship and that's the only thing that mattered to me.  
  
Q. Geno last night was talking about how you and UConn have both separated
yourselves. And one of the things he mentioned was passing for both teams. Do
you see that as well in terms of your team in particular? And what makes you
two teams good passing teams?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think we recruit to our Princeton offense. We want players,
especially post players, that are really good passers. On the guard side, we
like unselfish players. So I think we have those as well.  
Our assist to turnover ratio is among the best in the country because we look
for each other. We don't care who scores; we just want to win. So we're always
willing to make that extra pass. I think that can separate you from other
teams.  
Our efficiency, I think, in passing has been really good, too. So our posts,
really we work a lot on our passing, and that was something that Natalie
Achonwa was in particular really good at.  
  
Q. Muffet, two things. One, they're a very physical team. How important is
it that you get some foul calls down low? And, secondly, when Kiah Stokes was
in the game, it gives them that big, big lineup. What extra challenge does
that put on you?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, I think it's amazing. They committed the fewest fouls in
the nation. So they can be a really physical team and yet not manage to foul.  
So we don't really worry about the refs, how they're going to call the game.
We're going to react accordingly. That's not a huge issue for us.  
But they have such great size. Kiah Stokes is playing really well this year.
Gives them nice lift off the bench. They have the big lineup that they play
frequently with the three big posts, and that creates a lot of matchup
problems for us.  
  
Q. Kayla, did you get the sense as the year was going on that the nation was
waiting for this game? I mean, you're still preoccupied in trying to win the
ACC and everything, but in Connecticut, the reverberation was pretty strong
and we're waiting for this. Did Notre Dame feel the same way, or did you sense
it?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: Yeah, I feel like it was something that was always being talked
about. Like as a team we always talk about the noise surrounding everything
else. And that was a big thing is the UConn/Notre Dame matchup and all that.  
But I just think this team has a certain mental toughness to them. And I think
we've just been able to take it one game at a time, and now we're here and now
we're focusing on UConn.  
  
Q. Muffet, could you talk about the ruthlessness with which Kayla plays? And
where do you see your advantages in this game tomorrow?  
COACH MCGRAW: I'm not sure that's a word that I would ever ascribe to Kayla.
She is like an assassin. I think that she's willing to throw the dagger. She
wants to give you the knockout punch. She's going to compete and battle on
every single possession.  
I think it's what makes her great, and it's been fun to watch her enjoying
playing the game and she plays with such passion.  
I think our guard play has been spectacular all year long, and we gotta make
shots in the game tomorrow. That's going to be key.  
  
Q. Coach, as you look at the matchups with Connecticut, is there any area
that jumps out at you? Can you take advantage of your transition, or is it
something else?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think Stewart's a real matchup problem for us. She's somebody
that's hard to guard because of her inside/outside ability. Their size creates
some matchup problems for us.  
They have a great transition game. They really like to get out there to that
long outlet and get down the floor in a hurry. So transition defense will be a
big factor too.  
  
Q. Is beating UConn sweeter than beating another opponent?  
COACH MCGRAW: Not having beaten them this year, I can say it was fun going
through the ACC and beating a lot of teams we beat this year. Last year we
were able to beat them three times, and that was fun. Would have liked to have
won the last one, though.  
  
Q. Muffet, do you think tomorrow night's going to be a historic night for
women's college basketball? You've been in the game so long, coached so many
great games. Do you sense the moment in terms of what this is going to mean
for the game and the history of the game?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it's a historic moment right now because we've never had
two undefeated teams head into the National Championship. So I definitely
think we've made history already.  
  
Q. Muffet, can you compare the vibe? The last couple of years you play UConn
seems like every other week before the NCAA Tournament; this year you haven't
played them once in the year. Is there a different feel to it because there's
been so much time between these games?  
COACH MCGRAW: No, I don't think so. I think we still have that same rivalry.
We were focused on the ACC this year. And it was a nice distraction to not
have to watch Connecticut all year. So I think now that it's here I think
we've got a pretty short memory for last year.  
  
Q. Muffet, I don't know if better team is the exact correct word, but you're
certainly an undefeated team since Skylar left. How are you ‑‑ maybe you are
better without her. And how are you sort of different or compensated for not
having her? Can you sort of explain how that worked this year.   
COACH MCGRAW: I think we're different because of our balance. I think we have
more people that are doing more things instead of relying on one person to
handle the ball 90 percent of the time. Now we share the ball in different
ways.  
So I think we're harder to guard, because you don't know who is going to be on
the attack when we outlet to so many different people that you have to prepare
for.  
I think our post game is so much better with the addition of Taya Reimer. I
think that our bench has played extremely well with Madison Cable and Michaela
Mabrey really giving us great minutes all year long.  
I think we're a much deeper team, and I think we're the type of team we can
sub one person out and still have a pretty good balance on the floor.  
  
Q. Muffet, next December6th you guys renew your non ‑conference association
in South Bend with UConn in the Jimmy V game. Do you want Connecticut to be a
staple on your non‑conference schedule?  
COACH MCGRAW: Unlike football, we don't schedule 10 years out. We just try to
do the next year. And so we were happy that we were able to get them back on
the schedule for next year. I think we have a two‑year deal right now home and
away.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. At this time we're going to let our student‑athletes
head up to their breakout areas.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach McGraw.  
  
Q. Coach, what kind of advantage is it that you have? Your players have
played Connecticut so many times in the past. And then how different are they
this year from what they've seen?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think there's a familiarity. And I think that always helps,
because sometimes when you play a team for the first time like we did so many
times this year, you really can't get enough off the film to see them in
person and see what they're actually like.  
So I think we have that that we can at least fall back on while we're watching
the film.  
They're very different this year. I think they're just bigger, they're
stronger, they're in the post more. Jefferson, I think, has kind of come into
that role that they hoped she would come into last year.  
And Hartley's playing better. So I think they have six really good players
that they're playing right now. And there's just a lot of matchup problems out
there.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about becoming a program that's a perennial in the
Final Four and now you guys have done it for a long stretch here as opposed to
a program that's trying to get to that level or has gone there and then has
that stretch where they don't go? What does it take to ‑‑ is it a superstar
player that gets you there? Is it a combination of things to become that type
of program?  
COACH MCGRAW: It's really hard. I think the challenge of staying there is as
hard as it was getting here. I think we've looked and found the difference in
the players. We've got WNBA players graduating every year. We've got first
round draft picks that are playing‑‑ that are going every year.  
So I think when you have that kind of talent, that's what it takes. I think
it's the recruiting. Niele Ivey does a great job for us in the recruiting end
as well as all the rest of our coaches.  
But you have to have the great players in order to sustain it.  
  
Q. Muffet, is it fair to say you might miss Natalie more acutely against
UConn because of their size?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, I think so. We're not using it as an excuse, though. I
mean, we're going to play with the players that we have and hope that they
give the great effort they gave us last night.  
  
Q. I'll pose the question to you that I posed to Kayla. When you're watching
a semifinal between UConn and Stanford, what part of you really wanted to see
UConn pull through so that you could have this historic matchup in the
final?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it was kind of inevitable, wasn't it? I think you guys
probably had that one on your calendars probably by February1st. I think the
whole country was so distracted with that and enamored with the matchup that
it's kind of nice to be in that moment. Because we really tried to block it
all out and I thought did a really good job of that during the year.  
But now it's great to have the two best teams in the country playing each
other for a National Championship.  
  
Q. You guys might be the only team in the country who walks out on the floor
with them and is not intimidated. How important is that kind of confidence in
a game like this?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it's huge. I think that's what it takes to beat a good
team. I think you saw that with Tennessee over the years, just you play the
name on their jersey instead of playing the game; you're intimidated before
you start. And I think that that that's an attitude that we're bringing into
the game, one of confidence.  
  
Q. Breanna Stewart, you mentioned her before. How do you kind of try to stop
her and how much has she improved since you last saw her last year?  
COACH MCGRAW: She was pretty darned good last year. MVP of the Final Four. I
don't know that you can stop her. I don't think you can. I think she's just a
great player who‑‑ she can score in so many different ways. She has so many
more ways she can beat you at different times during the game.  
So I think we have to hope that she doesn't go off for her career high, but as
far as stopping her I'm not sure that's possible.  
  
Q. Coach, people always look back on that Magic ‑Bird final in'79 as a,
quote/unquote, tipping point, even though we didn't have that term then but we
look at it now that way. Is it fair to say that women's basketball could have
a similar tipping point with two iconic‑type teams or two players? Is that
something you could see happening and could this game possibly be that?   
COACH MCGRAW: Well, I think this game is going to give a lot more attention to
the women's game. I think the fans like the rivalry. I think the media likes
the rivalry. In some ways I think it would be great for women's basketball if
we got some new teams in the Final Four. But I think in order to showcase the
best in women's basketball, I think this is it.  
  
Q. Another one on Stewart. Because it is, like you said, impossible to stop
her, do you have to put different people on her throughout the game because it
may be so demoralizing to try to stop her for an entire game?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think that you have to try different things for sure. I don't
think you'll have one person for 40 minutes that's able to stay in the game
and guard her that long. I think we're going to have to try a couple of
different plans.  
  
Q. Muffet, I just wanted to talk a little bit about your execution
offensively and Taya's role in that. It seemed like as a freshman some people
expected she might be a little bit discombobulated with all the moving parts
and pieces of your offense. But could you speak how she assimilated to this
offense and how she grasped it so readily?  
COACH MCGRAW: She's a really smart basketball player with a really high
basketball IQ, so that part is easy. I think what we encouraged her to do is
follow her instincts because they're always right on point. She thinks, oh,
that would be a great idea to cut to the basket right now, and sometimes she
would stop herself early in the season, not sure if that's what we wanted in
the offense.  
I think gradually she got to understand that the offense revolves around
creativity and freedom of movement. I think she's perfect for the Princeton
offense because she can pass, she can shoot, she can handle the ball. So she
really, I think, felt very comfortable in the offense pretty early in the
season.  
  
Q. Muffet, you sort of answered it, but this is sort of the perfect storm.
You guys have played every year since the last 20 years. First time you're not
playing so there could be two undefeated teams. What does it mean that didn't
play first time ever in the season and now you're playing for the biggest
prize and what it could do for women's basketball down the road?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it's something that everybody looked forward to all year
long because we didn't play during the regular season. I think everybody was
hoping that we would end up here. I think it's great.  
I think it's great for the game. I think it's great that we are both
undefeated coming into it. And it should be just a great matchup for women's
basketball.  
  
Q. Muffet, for a long time at the top of women's basketball the coaching
duality with Pat and Geno and how different they were, you and Geno both being
sully people, maybe more alike. Could you talk about that, because people
sometimes do look at this as a head coach versus head coach, how you guys are
alike and different, both personality ‑wise and then also philosophy‑wise in
basketball?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think we're very different. I think basketball‑wise, maybe
philosophically we have some things in common. Sharing those Philly roots is a
commonality in our personalities. I think we both like to play the same kind
of game. I think they're running a lot of the Princeton offense now. They're
running a lot of the same kind of things.  
So I think that type of game I think appeals to both of us. I think we both
take pride in our defense as well as our offense, and we're probably sort of
perfectionists in that we want the team to be great on every given day.  
I'm a little bit more of an introvert. He's quite the extrovert.  
  
Q. Muffet, you said how the fans like the rivalry, the media likes the
rivalry. How do you feel about it? Do you enjoy there's this rivalry between
the two teams?  
COACH MCGRAW: I do. I do. I love the rivalry. I think it's the one that gets
your competitive juices flowing. I think it's something that you look forward
to. I mean, you want to be coaching for this kind of game and this kind of
moment.  
  
Q. You mentioned your coaching staff and you've got Beth, obviously was a
head coach for a long time; Niele, who I think a lot of people think could
easily be a head coach; and Angie; and Carol obviously has been with you a
long time. How has that helped? Because Coach Auriemma has a similar
continuity in staff. How big of a deal is that in terms of recruiting and
philosophy?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it's a huge deal. It's definitely the reason that we've
been successful as the staff. They do all of the work, really. They do all the
scouting. They do so many things off the court with the team. They get the
players ready, the individual workouts.  
I'm so blessed to have the staff that I have. Two head coaches. We've got tons
of years of experience on our staff, and then you have somebody like Niele who
is the brightest young star in the game.  
And we just have great chemistry. We have fun together. We work hard together.
But the loyalty and the trust that we have, I think, is critical because in a
game situation, in those moments in the game where things are tense, you gotta
be able to trust the people you're with. And I think that's a big reason that
we've been able to be successful.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned the excitement of the rivalry between you guys and
UConn and looking forward to the game tomorrow night. But what would be your
final message to your team heading into a game of this magnitude?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think the same it's been all year: This is what we've been
working for. We got ourselves to this point. We've been here before. And we
just want to go out and play our game, but we want to have fun when we're
doing it. We want to be relaxed.  
The pressure is on them. We have to come out, feel loose and play our game.  
  
Q. Coach, Geno says that the shots don't come off the fingers the same in
January and February as they do in March, except for with Kayla McBride here
in the Elite Eight and the Final Four. Do you agree with that, and why do you
think she's so unaffected by the lights?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, I don't agree with that. I think‑‑ I agree with the
Kayla part. I think she's the kind of player that enjoys the big stage and the
competitiveness of it. She enjoys going head to head with good players. And I
think she just has that passion and she has fun while she's playing.  
And I think that's the biggest key for her. When you see her smiling, then you
know she's going to be on her game.  
  
Q. Coach, one thing that I think is sort of different about these programs,
and you've alluded to it before, you have been an underdog, in fact a big
underdog in the NCAA Tournament. You've won as an 11 seed, upset teams on
their home court. Can you talk about that mentality? It seems like you've
maintained that mentality even when you've become more of an overdog; you
still have that underdog kind of feistiness.  
COACH MCGRAW: I do. I think I've just always loved the underdog. It's really
only been the past couple of years when people ask me who do I want to win the
men's tournament, I want Wichita State to win, I want these top seeds to win
now.  
I think that's the role I've grown up with. I think we've always had that role
coming in. It was Tennessee, it was Connecticut.  
We just took that role and we enjoyed it and we worked hard at it and we got
some wins early on, and I think that kind of fed into it.  
And we don't talk about people don't respect us, don't know our name. We just
care about the people in our locker room. That's the only people whose opinion
that really matters.  
  
Q. You speak to the intensity of the rivalry and how it's kind of welcomed
by both sides. But Saturday when you accepted Coach of the Year ‑‑
congratulations, by the way‑‑ and Breanna Stewart was there for Player of the
Year, both teams were assembled in that room, could you sense the palpable
tension in the room? Was there like a stick of dynamite that was getting ready
to go off there?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, I think there was definitely tension in the room. I think
for us we wanted Kayla McBride to win the Player of the Year award. So I think
it was a little bit of that. And certainly the rivalry has gone a little away
from the civility it was when we were in the league together.  
  
Q. Muffet, when you were first recruiting Lindsay, what caught your eye
about her that made her special, and was it as much about her being a winner
as her physical ability, too?  
COACH MCGRAW: It was a lot of things. Of course for us she was a great
student. That was big for us. But her IQ, important for the point guard. I'm
really, really tough on point guards. I always have a really short list
because I just‑‑ there's a lot of people that I don't want to coach. So she
was somebody that caught my eye initially because of her intelligence, her
decision‑making on the floor.  
She did not turn the ball over. That was just probably the first thing I
recognized. She was a good defender. She got the ball to the right people. She
threw it ahead. She had that kind of steady demeanor that I think is
important. And she was such a team player and a winner.  
  
Q. Muffet, you've always had really good support at Notre Dame from the fan
base and such. Has this run this past couple of years, this year with the
undefeated season, moved the needle at all or gotten more attention on campus,
anything of that nature? Obviously Notre Dame is a huge football school. What
you've done in the last four years, and the last 20 years there have been
pretty special?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, you know, it has been. I think everybody on campus is
here, our president was here. He's been here through all of our games. And he
is somebody that we really are blessed to have on us. The Board of Trustees,
those guys are always around.  
I think on campus, Brian Kelly‑‑ probably the first voicemail I got after we
beat Baylor was from Brian Kelly. Mike Brey. We really do feel like we have
the support of everybody on campus, all the other teams. I think there's great
camaraderie among the players on other teams.  
And it is, it's great to walk around campus, know that everybody's talking
about you.  
  
Q. What do you think it would take to bring the civility back to the
rivalry?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think we're past that point.  
  
Q. Is there ‑‑ you talked about the level of recruit that you need to get,
but there's also I would think a personality type. And I'm wondering if you
could talk about that, the type of kid, not just her ability, but the type of
kid that you look for recruiting‑wise to be able to compete at this level.   
COACH MCGRAW: You know, there's a lot of good players out there. Some of them
are really good students. So our pool gets a little bit‑‑ makes it a little
bit smaller.  
But I think for me, I don't offer scholarships to kids that I've never spoken
to or have spoken to only once. I know a lot of coaches see a player, they
think she's good, they offer a scholarship when they're in eighth, ninth,
tenth grade. We did it with Skylar, but she's the only one.  
But I like to get to know a player, because I want to know about the
relationship we're going to have; I like to see the relationship with their
parents, because that's the relationship I'm going to have with them.  
When they come on campus, I want to make sure they're somebody that fits in
and wants to be a team player and not somebody that's all about themselves. So
I think the unselfish part is really, really important to me and how they get
along with the team.  
And after they visit the campus, I always ask the players: What did you think?
How did you think she would fit in? And it's great with all the friendships
they make early because they have a really good feel for that. And somebody
like Brianna Turner, Kathryn Westbeld and Mychal Johnson, they knew a lot of
our other players, a lot of them know Taya. That's been a big draw because we
love her personality. If they fit in, she's going to let us know about that.  
  
Q. Coach, I know Jonathan is here supporting you. He's meant a lot to your
program. What makes him a good coach and what do you see him being able to
take to the GW program?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think they did a great job with them this year. He has Megan
Duffy on his staff, one of our former point guards. He's so full of passion. I
think his energy level is extremely high. He knows the game and knows the
scouting reports and very thorough and organized and has good relationships
with his players.  
I think he knows how important that is. So I expect him to do really well
there.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for Coach McGraw? Thank you.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from Connecticut, head coach Geno
Auriemma and student‑athletes Moriah Jefferson, Bria Hartley, Kaleena
Mosqueda‑Lewis, Breanna Stewart, and Stefanie Dolson. Any questions?  
  
Q. Stefanie, so much is made all season long about you guys potentially
meeting for this historic game. Now that it's here, what does it mean to be
playing in this game tomorrow night?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: Obviously historically it's pretty cool. It's not something
that happens all the time, having two undefeated teams play each other in the
National Championship game.  
For us, we're not really thinking about that. You can't focus on all that
stuff, all the hype that's around the game. We know it's going to be a tough
game with Notre Dame. It always is. We have to focus on ourselves and make
sure our game plan is on point for the game on Tuesday.  
  
Q. For both Coach and maybe Kaleena, can you talk about last year, the
difference between the first three games and maybe Breanna's emergence in the
Final Four and getting over the hump against Notre Dame in that matchup?  
COACH AURIEMMA: The difference between the semifinal game? Yeah, I mean, I
think every team goes through growing pains, you know. I think for us asking
so much out of our freshmen last year, I think that's hard to do.  
There aren't a whole lot of teams that get to the Final Four that are relying
on a lot of freshmen. It's not easy.  
And funny stuff happened in those three games. And I think in the Big East
championship games, Bria had a pretty good game. I think she played really,
really well in the Big East championship game. We just came up short. In all
three of those games had the ball or had the lead in the last minute of the
game and we didn't get the job done.  
And when we got to the semifinals last year, Stewy played great, the rest of
the team played great, and we handled them pretty easily.  
So I guess that goes to show you that through the course of the season things
change and you hope you get better. And we got better as the season went on.  
  
Q. Geno, would it be one of your goals tomorrow night to make Notre Dame
miss Natalie Achonwa more than they did last night?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. When players get hurt, sometimes that just opens
up opportunities for other players. I remember when we played Notre Dame in
the 2001 semifinal, we were missing Svetlana Abrosimova and Shae Ralph. People
thought it was going to be hard for us to get to that point, to get to the
Final Four. But we had players step up and played better than they had their
whole regular season.  
So they're more than just one player. They're more than any one individual.
And if they can continue to get contributions from their other three post
players like they got yesterday, they won't miss Natalie at all.  
  
Q. Coach, looking at Notre Dame, the point guard spot, how, if at all, has
going from Skylar to Lindsay changed their team?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, the biggest notable difference is that both Kayla
McBride and Jewell Loyd have gotten a lot more shots, a lot more
opportunities, have been more involved in handling the ball. So in one sense
it's made them even more dangerous.  
You can just see how hard it is to defend those two. They're not always
necessarily waiting to get the ball. They have the ball in their hands a lot
right from the beginning of the possession. And that's one big difference that
I've seen in watching them play this year.  
  
Q. For Breanna. Hi, Breanna. Quick question. Speaking to the intense rivalry
between these two teams, could you ‑‑ did you have a sense of appreciation for
that when you sat Saturday at that table when you were named Player of the
Year and you looked around, and was the tension in that room pretty
appreciable and was it such that if someone had rolled a ball into the room it
would have been game on?   
BREANNA STEWART: I think there were two teams in the room and they were both
supporting‑‑ can you hear me? I think that there was two teams in the room and
they were both supporting their respective player and coaches. And I don't
think that we are very fond of each other. I think everyone knows that. But at
the same time we still respect each other and know that tomorrow night it's
going to be a huge battle.  
  
Q. Bria, you obviously had a chance to play in those great Tennessee games,
but probably that legacy was part of what drew you to Connecticut. I'm
wondering if you could tell us what playing Notre Dame for the three years and
now in your career, what it's been like, both in terms of the games themselves
and the intensity that Breanna just referred to?  
BRIA HARTLEY: Yeah, throughout my career we all know we played Notre Dame a
number of times, and I think every time we played them the game was played at
a really high level. It was always really competitive, and I think those are
the games we kind of live for. Those games we were playing a really good team
and you know it comes down to who is going to make the plays, who is going to
step up and win, whether we came out on the losing end on the win.  
It's always been a great rivalry, great thing for women's basketball. I think
the fans enjoy watching games like that. Just in my career, I think it's just
great that we're able to play them in a National Championship in my senior
year, because it's been such a competitive game throughout all the years, and
I know we've all enjoyed it.  
  
Q. Breanna, when you come to Connecticut, how do you get introduced to the
notion that you're not very fond of Notre Dame, or did you know that before
you came in? How does that kind of atmosphere seep into your consciousness?  
BREANNA STEWART: Well, I don't think it was anything when I was in high
school. I didn't have any sense of rivalry between college teams. But I think
that last year when they beat us three times in a row, that created a sense of
rivalry just because they were all so close, the games were all so close, came
down to the last minute. And we eventually were able to get them back in the
semifinals last year.  
  
Q. Stefanie, I know how beloved you guys are in your region of the world.
But outside that, women's basketball fans are always like anybody but
Connecticut. They want to see you guys lose. Geno has always sort of embraced
that. He likes to be the one with the target on his back. How as a player have
you embraced that? Do you like being the heavy, so to speak, that maybe the
rest of the country is kind of rooting against because you guys are so good?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: It was something that Breanna and I stepped into when we were
freshmen coming off as they had just won. So when we initially came here to
Connecticut, we already had a target on our backs. It's something that Coach
has done, definitely embraced. It's something you get used to.  
We know every game we play the other team is going to give us their best game
and knock down shots they don't usually make. We're always prepared for that.
We're always expecting it.  
And it's something that you get used to and you definitely embrace because you
just have to go out on the court with that confidence that we knowno one wants
to see us win, so we're going to win anyway.  
  
Q. Stefanie and Bria, anyone else who wants to take it, all the games last
year were so intense. This rivalry is so intense. Have you missed not playing
Notre Dame this year? National title aside, are you looking forward to getting
back on a court to test yourselves again against Notre Dame?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: We always know when we play Notre Dame it's going to be a
good game. They're a tough team. We're a tough team. I mean, we played some
great teams this year. We're not going to take any credit away from them,
obviously. We had some tough games this year and in the tournament.  
And we're definitely looking forward to playing the best in order to win,
obviously. It's going to be a fun game tomorrow. I think we're all looking
forward to it. I'm sure they are too, so...  
BRIA HARTLEY: Yeah, I don't know if we necessarily missed it this year,
because playing a team 12 times in three years is a lot. But I know we enjoyed
the games and playing them and they were always competitive.  
But like Stefanie said, we're going to go out there go over our game plan, and
we want to go out there really confident. And I think this run in the
tournament we've been playing pretty well, and we're excited to go out there
just play on Tuesday.  
  
Q. Stefanie, one of the other major differences between the programs is in
terms of social media, like the Notre Dame kids can do what they want during
the season with Twitter and whatnot and you guys can't. And they also ‑‑
strangely enough, they're told to wear green fingernail polish and you guys
can't do that stuff. As ladies, as social media mavens, do you miss being able
to participate in any of that and being blacked out of that during the season,
and will you be happy when you can go back on? Does it have a factor at all?
  
STEFANIE DOLSON: No, it's not a factor at all. First of all, as seniors you
get used to it. You just don't really care. And for us, I think it's a
benefit. I mean, it takes away from the distractions. I think social media is
such a narcissistic thing. I think people do it for themselves and to kind of
get themselves out there.  
And I think for us it just takes away that attraction and makes us focus on
what we're doing and why we're here in college, is to play basketball, not to
go on social media and boast about ourselves.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach Auriemma.  
  
Q. Geno, Muffet McGraw, in the locker room just shortly, a while ago, talked
about the lack of civility that now exists in your relationship with her and
the relationship between the two programs. I wanted to know if you sort of
wanted to comment on where you see or how you view your relationship with her
and how you view Connecticut's relationship with Notre Dame.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. I mean, I think when you play as often as we
havein a short period of time, I think a lot of things happen that wouldn't
happen if you didn't play that often.  
I think you guys alluded to what's it like being us. Nobody knows what it's
like being us. Nobody knows what we go through every day, what our players go
through every time they win award, they get pissed off. Worst off, they act
pissed off because our guys won an award because it's Connecticut all the
time, all Connecticut all the time. People are sick of it. It's just natural.
We live with it 365days a year. If you come in with that air, then you have to
live to deal with it.  
  
Q. Geno, I'm wondering if Muffet ‑‑ given where you're both from,
tranquility is not what's expected of people in Philadelphia, is she taking a
page from your play book, trying to get under your skin? Is it like a‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. I don't know. You'd have to ask her that. I
don't know. I don't think anything about me has changed. People who know me
know I haven't changed, and the program hasn't changed and the respect we have
for everybody else hasn't changed.  
We think we're the best basketball program in America, but we don't flaunt it,
we don't go around talking about it all the time. We're not out there all the
time.  
So I haven't changed. But a funny thing happens once they start beating us.
Everything changes. It's just the world we live in. I've learned to deal with
it. I don't put too much stock into what anybody says. For me, I'm at an age
now where if it's not happening between the lines, I really don't care. I
don't care what anybody says. I don't care what anybody does. I don't care
what conference you're in or what school you're at. I don't care about
anything.  
I'm at an age where I spend whatever time I need to spend worrying about those
40 minutes we're going to be playing. The rest of the stuff, I could care
less.  
  
Q. Kayla McBride, who's experienced both of you, at least you briefly at
that camp and Muffet now for four years, said in many ways you're actually the
same coach and that's why the demand for excellence, the demand for precision
is why your two teams have separated themselves from the country. Do you see
that that is the one similarity left between you two?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I think I said this either yesterday or the day before,
when you are able to recruit really good players, which Notre Dame can and we
can, and you know how to coach them, which they do and we do, you tend to have
happen what's happening.  
If we were to stop getting good players or they were to stop getting good
players, doesn't matter what kind of coaches we are, we wouldn't be here. So
we have‑‑ the only thing similar in our background, we grew up in the same
area. But there's a lot of similarity in terms of how her team plays and how
my team plays. I think that's very similar in what's demanded and what's
expected and how we share the ball, the intensity level we play at, and I
think that's probably why the games are the way they are.  
We've got two really, really good teams. Forget the other stuff. The other
stuff is such nonsense. Really, that's nonsense. I could sit here and list
10,000 coaches that don't interact with each other whose rivalries are
intense. This is a function of women's basketball. Sometimes we act like
girls, like we're supposed to go to dinner every night.  
We're supposed to play each other, try to beat each other's brains in, try to
win a National Championship and compete like hell, Muffet and Geno, and then
we're supposed to get together afterwards and go have a bottle of wine. That's
just not going to happen. So stop asking us why it doesn't happen.  
  
Q. Geno, like with boxers when you have two heavyweights in the press
conferences before they fight, they often go back and forth to try to get
under each other's skin. Is there any element of that in this?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't think so. I mean, I don't know.  
  
Q. Is there any advantage?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Not on me, not on my end. Because I don't think it means
anything. I don't think it means anything at all. This isn't Muhammad Ali
taunting Joe Frazier. That's not what this is about.  
I think deep down that's not who Muffet is, and that's not who I am. We don't
sit up here and taunt each other because we're trying to get under each
other's skin. I don't think that's got any part of it.  
It's superfluous. We use big words, too.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of talk about the undefeatedness and all the other
stuff. But the sort of under ‑angle is this would be No. 9 if you win and
doing it here in Tennessee and just what would it mean to win that ninth title
and become the all‑time winningest coach as far as championships go as far as
in women's basketball?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. I think if you win a National Championship, that
doesn't really‑‑ I don't think it really matters where you win it, who you're
playing against.  
Anytime you win a National Championship, it's pretty special. When Pat won No.
8, there may have been a perception out there nobody's ever going to catch
Pat.  
So if Connecticut or anybody else were to win eight or nine, somebody's going
to come around someday and win ten. I'm really not a numbers guy. I don't
really get caught up in that stuff. I've said this 100,000 times. Wednesday
morning, when I wake up, win or lose, my life doesn't change one iota.  
Now, Stewy said she came to Connecticut to win four national championships. So
that's what I think is more significant for Bria and Stefanie Dolson, to win a
National Championship their senior year. That's pretty significant, because
they only get X amount of chances to do it.  
God willing, I'll get more chances down the road. So that's kind of been my
focus. Ever since maybe like the second or third one, you know, after a while
it's just like, yeah, it's great, but it's not, not because it's going to
change my life.  
At one time I did want to win championships because it was going to change my
life, because I thought I wasn't getting paid enough. But now that I am, I
really don't care.  
  
Q. Coach, I have a two ‑parter here. A, was it uncomfortable for you to be
in that room with them the other day? And, B, I wonder if you would comment on
what Muffet said earlier about how, quote, it's amazing how they've committed
the fewest fouls in the country, unquote.   
COACH AURIEMMA: Actually it was not uncomfortable for me at all to be in that
room. I thought Stewy deserved to be Player of the Year and I'm glad I was
there to be a part of it, and I thought Muffet deserved to be Coach of the
Year and I'm glad I was a part of it.  
It wasn't uncomfortable for me at all. Not at all. Maybe because I've been in
those situations so many times, it doesn't bother me.  
When you won as much as we won you get to appreciate when other people win. So
it's not all about Connecticut all the time. So it wasn't uncomfortable for me
at all.  
As far as the foul part, the only thing more amazing than that, than how we've
committed so few fouls, is how many free throws they've shot against us in the
last three years; that only one team in America gets to shoot free throws
against us. You want to talk about amazing, that's amazing.  
  
Q. It's following up on what Doug was asking you about, winning the ninth
one. Would it be meaningful, though, to do it in this state? I know you said
it doesn't matter, but where Pat Summitt made her name, where you guys have
enjoyed an intense rivalry, too, over the years.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Honest to God, I may have said this when I first got here.
When I found out that the‑‑ when I found out that the Final Four was going to
be in Nashville, I just assumed that if we got this far, if we were fortunate
enough to get this far, that we would have to play Tennessee at some point.  
And I know how disappointed their fans are and their coaches and their
players, obviously. And I'm sure if that had happened, then it would all be
brought out and it would‑‑ all those memories would come back, you know.  
But not now. Not now. It's‑‑ I think Connecticut, Tennessee, Geno, Pat, all
that stuff, that's history. It's great while it lasted, but that's history.  
  
Q. Coach McGraw said playing in the ACC helped make them tournament ‑ready.
Did you get that from the American, and if not, how do you grow‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: No, we didn't. We got it by beating all those ACC teams.  
  
Q. How do you grow a conference, or do you focus on the nonconference?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Like what I said was we really can't focus on any of that. In
1995‑‑ I don't remember when Notre Dame joined the Big East, but in 1995 we
were undefeated going into the NCAA Tournament. Exactly two teams from the Big
East went to the NCAA Tournament that year. And everybody, all they kept
talking about was you're not tournament ready, not like the SEC teams are, not
like the Pac‑12 teams are. You're not tournament ready.  
I wish I could say there's some truth to that, but I don't know. I don't know
because I've had teams play in the best conference in the country in the Big
East and not get to the Final Four and I've had teams play in the old Big East
where we won every game by 40 and win the National Championship.  
So I don't know. I don't know. If Muffet thinks that helped them, I would
venture to say Muffet played a lot better teams last year in the old Big East
than she did this year. Guarantee it.  
  
Q. Your success has given her a bit of a chip on her shoulder. You just made
two remarks, one about Moriah getting a good education and not a Notre Dame
education, and another, superfluous ‑‑ we use big words too ‑‑ is there some
chip on your shoulder about Connecticut education against the Notre Dame
education?  
COACH AURIEMMA: No. No, but you have to understand in recruiting, when we
recruit somebody and the kind of kids that we recruit, it always comes down to
us, Stanford, Duke, Notre Dame. I would say 90 percent of the kids we recruit,
it always comes down to that, and the refrain that we always hear in
recruiting is how could you pass up a world‑class education to go to UConn.  
So I just kind of like to laugh about it. Last time I checked our library, we
have lots of books. And they're all pretty good.  
  
Q. Geno, seems like you've played a role in just about every significant
historical moment this sport's had in the last 20 years. You're going to have
another one tomorrow. And I'm wondering, is there a parallel to be drawn
between what we'll see tomorrow and what happened that night at Gampel against
Tennessee, and do you think this might help in some way take the game another
step?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think whenever you have‑‑ whenever you have the two best
teams in America playing against each other, obviously there's going to be a
lot more interest than their normally would be.  
The fact that it's Notre Dame and Connecticut, I think the women's basketball
fan obviously has an interest in tomorrow night's game; the almost women's
basketball fan will have an interest in the game; those that have not had any
interest may tune in to see what's going on.  
So I think all that is important. All that is good on the way to, I think,
where we want the game to go. There needs to be more rivalries like
Connecticut and Notre Dame. There needs to be more games like Connecticut and
Notre Dame where the intensity level is that high, where you have so many good
players on the floor playing at a real high level.  
And there are more than there have been in the past, but I think people out
there need to see it. And I think it's good that an awful lot of people on a
really big stage are going to get to see it tomorrow night.  
So whether Connecticut wins tomorrow or Notre Dame wins tomorrow, the actual
game itself will‑‑ the actual game of women's basketball come Wednesday
morning will be better off for what happens tomorrow than if it had never
happened. I truly believe that.  
  
Q. Geno, along those lines, was this sort of the perfect storm this year
because you guys didn't play and if you had there wouldn't be two undefeateds
and there is this rivalry? Was it sort of everything came together here for
this potential historic game that could grow the sport and make it more along
the lines of what people are hoping it becomes?  
  
Q. COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I think sometimes the women's NCAA Tournament is
kind of predictable, but predictable is not always good. Like tonight our men
are playing Kentucky and it's a No. 7 versus No. 8. The chances of that
happening in women's basketball are probably zero. It's just not going to
happen.  
So the predictable part of it is you know which teams are going to win pretty
much all the time. There's a reason for that. All of our players stay pretty
much four years. I understand that Connecticut wouldn't be here if our players
were able to leave early. Kayla McBride wouldn't be there, Jewell Loyd
wouldn't be there, Stewy wouldn't be here, Bria and Stefanie probably wouldn't
be here.  
The fact that all these guys get to stay for four years allows the absolute
best teams in the country to play each other on the final night. That's what's
best for women's basketball.  
There's a lot of bad games on television. There's a lot of bad men's games on
television, too, don't get me wrong. But I think whenever it is a game on
national television between two great teams and it's going to be played at a
high level, there's nothing that could be better for the sport.  
  
Q. Could you talk about matchups and what are key areas, key player matchups
as you look at this game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, there's absolutely‑‑ I don't think‑‑ there's no matchup
for Kayla McBride and Jewell Loyd. I don't think anybody in the country has
figured out how to guard those two. And I'm not sure we're going to be able to
guard them either. I think we've got to come up with a game plan where we've
got some things they're going to struggle with trying to defend.  
But the two teams are so similar. If somebody were to ask me what's the
biggest downside to playing these guys tomorrow is that we're just too
similar. We do a lot of the same things. That's always not good. I'd rather
play somebody that's completely different than us that looks at what we're
doing and goes: What? What is that?  
But they know exactly what they're doing. We know exactly what they're doing.
So it's really going to come down to if one team shoots 55 percent from the
floor, there's no way the other team is going to win tomorrow unless the other
team gets every offensive rebound like Notre Dame did last night.  
So it's going to come down to just making shots, because I think each team is
going to struggle defensively to stop the other team.  
  
Q. I just sat down, Geno. I don't know if anyone approached you, but do you
feel it's kind of surreal that Immaculata a few minutes ago ‑‑ that whole era,
you were associated with the camps, kids named in the Hall of Fame, and now
you and Muffet, who also was involved, are playing for a championship?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Philadelphia has been at the center of women's basketball
since Immaculata. And I don't know that the city or its products have ever
been away from that. It's been a constant from as long as I can remember.  
And rightly so. I mean, that area of the country produced some of the best
players ever, some of the best coaches ever, some of the best teams ever.  
And finally I'm thrilled that Immaculata is in there. We tend to forget just
the impact that they had. Had they been doing today what they were doing back
then, they would be off the charts.  
So they did it in an era when not too many people are paying attention, but I
think it's important for our history that we go back and celebrate that. And
I'm proud to be from that era and I'm proud to know all those people that were
part of it. I think Muffet and I are part of that.  
  
Q. Geno, Lindsay Allen in this tournament has 24 assists with just four
turnovers. Is there anything you can do to throw her off her game tomorrow
night?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. She's had a great year all around. Somebody
asked me recently how come we have so many assists, and I said because every
time you pass the ball, you're passing it to a pretty good player.  
And I wish I could have been Lindsay Allen this year and just come down the
floor and make a decision, should I pass it to Kayla McBride or should I pass
it to Jewell Loyd. I think players that understand their roles and players
that play their roles really, really well are a huge key to having a
championship team.  
And the outside world probably doesn't appreciate it. But I'm sure her
teammates and her coaching staff understand the impact she's had on their
team.  
And we've got a pretty good point guard, pretty good defensively. So we'll
see.  
  
Q. Geno, if they send their guards to the board the way they did last night,
how vulnerable do they become to your fastbreak?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Only if we rebound it. I mean, there's a lot of‑‑ there's a
lot of things you can do to stop a team in transition. The two best are send
everybody back on defense or send everybody to the offensive boards. But those
are both really good.  
Now, one of the things‑‑ it's not bad strategy to do either one. I don't know
which is the best strategy. But one strategy that I know you have to have, and
that's defensive rebounding. If you can't defensive rebound, then you can't
beat Notre Dame in a million years. And that's going to be a huge challenge
for us tomorrow night.  
Everybody's so serious here today. What's going on?  
  
Q. We'll try to make it loose then?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Loosen it up a little, would you?  
  
Q. Two ‑part question. First, could you talk about'95 when you played
Tennessee during the regular season and beating them. What do you remember
about that day? Also, the second part, can you talk about just now from that
day to now what your kids have accomplished here to go from a losing program
to one that can set a record tomorrow night?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That day was one of the‑‑ that day was one of the most amazing
days that I've ever experienced. We had come so close to playing them in the
NCAA Tournament and we always seemed to lose before we got to them early
on,'88,'89. I know ESPN was working really, really hard to try to put together
a Martin Luther King Day game, and they approached us and I was really excited
that somebody would want to do that.  
When we found out that Tennessee was going to be the opponent, it was just
exactly what we needed at that time. We needed to be in that game on national
television, to be tested like that. And for us to win that game and the fan
reaction the way it was and the aftermath of that game, we went ten straight
years until 2004 where we sold out every single game at Gampel Pavilion and XL
Center.  
That's what that game did. And what it also did was give us a platform to go
out and recruit the best players in the country. I think without that
happening, without us winning the National Championship in Minneapolis, we
probably wouldn't have been able to do that.  
At that time, you know, when we won that game and when we won in Minneapolis,
I never imagined that it would come to this. That's a little farfetched to
think that this was in the cards. So to look back now, whenever I see the
numbers and the things that we've done, I kind of just shake my head. I would
hate us, too.  
  
Q. If Muffet is talking, have you succeeded in getting in her head? Isn't
that when people generally talk? Two, isn't there some side of you that kind
of appreciates that when other people are talking trash a little bit?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't think Muffet's going to win the game tomorrow night. I
don't think I'm going to win it. I don't think I'm going to lose it. I don't
think Muffet's going to lose it. So all that other stuff I think it would be
much more interesting if Kayla McBride and Stewy were going at it, like they
do in the NBA. You don't see in the NBA the coaches saying this, that, the
other thing. It's all the players talking trash.  
And I don't think it's anything like that. I don't think it's anything like
that. I think it's just natural. Like I don't know why everybody thinks it's
like a big deal or that it's like a wow moment, I can't believe that. I just
think it's natural.  
Like when we came along and started beating Tennessee, you know at some point
it was going to get a little chippy. And it did. So you know at some point
when you play Notre Dame enough times and it's not one‑sided anymore. For the
longest time, from 2001 to I don't know when, it was all one‑sided. So, of
course, it was civil. Because it just doesn't have that intensity level yet.
But then once you start playing each other two, three times, four times a
year, it gets pretty intense for lots of reasons. It's only natural. It's only
natural. It will probably‑‑ it will probably die down, now that we're not in
the same conference, now that we probably are only going to play each other
once a year. If you get to the tournament, maybe two.  
But what was happening before, that's just not realistic. That's not normal.
It's not healthy, to be honest with you. I don't think it's healthy. Play
teams four times a year. I don't think they want to do it. We certainly didn't
want to do it. It's just too much.  
  
Q. Coach, just curious, some coaches who have coached men and women will say
I don't ever want to coach that side anymore, I'd rather coach this side. What
has kept you with women's basketball as opposed to dabbling, say, in men's
basketball?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, probably two reasons. One, for the longest time no one
even in women's basketball wanted me. So I got the Connecticut job and I
thought four years from now I want to go to a really good school and win a
National Championship. And nobody wanted me so I'm stuck.  
And then when we got to be really good, there weren't any men's programs
knocking on my door saying I have a great idea, let's hire the women's coach
from Connecticut. That wasn't going to happen.  
I coached my son's AAU team, and we had five DivisionI players on that team,
and I said now I know why I'm not coaching men.  
A lot of things have happened to make me think I've got a pretty good job
where I am.  
What did coaching my son's team tell me about men? They're uncoachable. Don't
get me wrong. It was fun. You don't have to throw nine passes to get a shot.
You just screw up a play, throw it up at the rim, guy catches and dunks and
you go like this. I love that about coaching guys.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 6, 2014

  

### [Chiney Ogwumike](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21930)

### [Lili Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26521)

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

UConn  75  
Stanford - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from Stanford we have head coach
VanDerveer and student‑athletes Chiney Ogwumike and Lili Thompson. We'll take
an opening statement from Coach VanDerveer and then questions for the
student‑athletes.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Our team is, I think, really disappointed with how we played
especially in the second half. And I think we really struggled. We turned the
ball over too much in the second half. And we did not do a good enough job
defensively.  
And I credit Connecticut and they played a really good game. And I'm proud to
have coached Chiney for four years and our future great player in Lili
Thompson tonight.  
But, overall, we did say our teammates are very disappointed but we're really
proud of being at the Final Four and representing the Pac‑12\.  
  
Q. Chiney, can you talk about the defensive change that Connecticut made?
You guys obviously were hitting some shots early and then you probably needed
to hit more. Did they do something defensively that was a big change?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: At what point, first half, second half? I think that we just
needed to be aggressive. Anytime Amber penetrated, she found good things. I
think they were giving us penetration and being aggressive as like guards and
spotting up. Obviously there were people in the paint.  
But I don't know if there were many defensive changes besides maybe their
personnel, like having their big lineup with Stokes, Dolson and Stewart. And
that changed things, because it was bigger on our 3s. So it would affect
shots. That was the biggest change. I'm proud how the team was aggressive for
40 minutes tonight.  
  
Q. Chiney, can you just ‑‑ like the North Carolina game, two games in a row,
you had a whole team all over you, from front to back. Could you talk about
how difficult it was to operate?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I think it's always an honor for a team to focus so much on
me on the inside, and I trusted my teammates. I think like they were the
reason we were competitive in the first half.  
They were aggressive. They were knocking down shots. It's tough for a player
to have one, two, three people, and it's hard for me not to force things. But
Coach reminds me to let the game come to me. I have full trust in my team. I
think we did a great job the first half managing the game and taking timely
shots, and people were aggressive in finishing.  
Things got a little away from us in the second half. Maybe if two things went
our way we could have swayed the momentum. But that's just the way the game
goes sometimes.  
  
Q. Chiney, can you address the impact that Kiah Stokes had in that first
half when she came in? That's when they made their run on you guys.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: In the first half? I think she changed things maybe
defensively so they could go big and guard the 3 with the bigger person. I
think that changed our vision offensively, harder to get passes inside and
your shot up if you're being guarded by the 3 in Stewart. I think that
affected the game.  
  
Q. Chiney, I know it's just ended, but can you put your time at Stanford in
perspective?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I think it's been an amazing run. I'm not even that emotional
about it because I was just trying to have fun today, just have fun, enjoy the
moment, play hard. And that's easy to do when you have a great coach and you
have great teammates that support you every possession. No matter the outcome.  
So my experience at Stanford has been a blessing. I've met so many great
people. I've been pushed. Days like these will make me a better player and
person. Just to have the support in the fan base and family and friends and
teammates, it's been an amazing remarkable experience and I'm just fortunate
to be able to have Stanford on the front of my jersey this one last time.  
  
Q. Lili, you scored ten points right out of the blocks. Stanford was really
playing well with a lot of enthusiasm and adrenalin. Could you describe what
it felt like at that point to have that lead on Connecticut and be playing so
well at that point in the game?  
LILI THOMPSON: We came out very well. And I was just trying to stay focused on
the game and try to continue that. I don't know if so much we kind of‑‑ we
kind of just tried to stick with our game plan and make adjustments as we
went, but it was a very good start. So I'm proud of my team for the way we
played.  
  
Q. Lili, this was your debut at a Final Four. What was it like to have to go
against Connecticut's 40 minutes of ferocious defense?  
LILI THOMPSON: They're a very good team. And defensively they made some very
nice plays. They made it difficult for us. We played against other teams with
very tough defense. So we kind of just tried to stay calm and focus on our
game plan and try to run our offense.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Tara, can you talk about, obviously things were working well early. Could
you talk about how difficult it got to run offense, maybe from the point where
they went into that run in the first half and into the second?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I don't think it was‑‑ we knew that probably the biggest
challenge for us would be to score. I thought we worked hard defensively. We
had a lot of good stops.  
But their size, when they went big, their size is really disruptive. But
probably more than anything, I mean they have very skilled players that play
very well together. And they really pass and move the ball and they screen.  
And one of the biggest problems was we didn't get a single free throw the
first half. We did not get to the free‑throw line. And in the first half I
think we made more field goals than they did. But that's a problem.  
Second half I thought we really turned the ball over too much. We really
struggled. Just they got in passing lanes and our pace was not fast enough. We
weren't attacking and being aggressive. And we would have spurts of things,
then they'd come back and we could not sustain any runs.  
  
Q. Tara, now as a fan and great supporter all these years, now that we've
arrived at this dream final with two unbeaten teams, can you talk about the
impact that could have to get the casual fan to tune into the game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I hope it's going to be a great game. And maybe that's what
‑‑ there's been a buildup all along through the whole tournament. Maybe that
will get the attention of some people. And I think the tournament here was
great support. There was a great turnout. That won't change, but if that does,
as you say, attract some more of the casual fan, more power to.  
  
Q. The free throws you didn't get, your lack of aggressiveness I suppose,
what was the biggest disappointment from your perspective on your team's
play?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think really the inability to run offense. And we knew it
would be challenging, and we had seen other teams. Just some of the unforced
errors and also on defense, total breakdowns where we gave layups and then the
turnovers to Moriah Jefferson. Just things that I thought that we could have
been better at that I thought we could run some offense and get better shots.
I thought we could take care of the ball better.  
I thought we did a good job of getting back in transition, not allowing them
runnout baskets and in the beginning we didn't box out well. We gave them two
offensive boards the first two possessions. As the game went on I thought we
rebounded better.  
But just our pace, their pace was really good. I thought our pace was too
slow. We're not moving, we're not moving the ball. We weren't screening, and
they wouldn't run our offense the way we needed to.  
  
Q. Can you describe ‑‑ in the outset you had ‑‑ seemed like Breanna Stewart
was a little bit out of her sync. What did you do to disrupt her rhythm? And
again Kaleena Mosqueda‑Lewis was held scoreless. How was it to see her get hot
in the second half?  
COACH VANDERVEER: They're very talented players, and I think different people
on our team worked hard defensively on them. But like you said, like maybe the
first half Kaleena struggled a little bit. She got her rhythm going, and maybe
just took Stokes coming in and helping them relax a little bit.  
But I think their big lineup was disruptive when they went with Stokes and
they moved Stewart to the 3 a little bit. But Dolson was pretty steady in
there. She was very physical. And I just think that one of the things I see
with our team and kind of knew this, but in some ways it takes one thing to
get here, but then to beat Connecticut when you're here, we needed something
else. And we needed to be bigger. We needed to play a bigger lineup. But we
didn't. We weren't able to play people together when we needed to. We tried it
and it didn't look very good.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 6, 2014

  

### [Jewell Loyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26561)

### [Kayla McBride](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23276)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Notre Dame  87  
Maryland - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Notre Dame, Coach Muffet McGraw and Kayla
McBride and Jewell Loyd. We'll start with a comment from Coach McGraw and then
the questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH MCGRAW: We thought the game would be won on the boards. I think it was.
To hold them to four offensive rebounds for the game is an amazing
accomplishment.  
When you look at our rebounds everybody had a few. That was our game plan,
everybody had to do their job. Everybody had to do one or two more than they
usually do. We did a great job boxing out, limited their rebounds.  
I thought Kayla McBride got us off to a phenomenal start; put the team on
their back, made shots early and loosened everybody up and everybody else
contributed throughout the rest of the game.  
I was happy with the bench. I thought Markisha Wright, in particular, was
amazing.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Did you feel like this was your night; things were going off the
offensive end, you were in the zone that would carry this team to the
championship game?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: I was trying‑‑ in past games I was pressed a little bit. As a
senior, I felt I had to do too much. But I let this game come to me.  
But it was a team effort all around. I think if you look at what she did,
Jewell, Taya and Maddie. It was everybody. I think I got us out and gave us
that confidence but they took care of the rest.  
  
Q. Kayla, could you talk about what you did to Alyssa offensively and
defensively to take her out of the game?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: It was more of an awareness. I think in the first game, we let
her be loose be too comfortable with the things she wanted to do. We kept her
off the glass.  
I think it was a team effort. I think we threw a lot of different things out
her. Jewell was guarding her. Markisha. Different people. And we were trying
to keep her out of her comfort zone.  
  
Q. Kayla, given your history with UConn, isn't there a part of you that
really wants to see them beat Stanford and you guys end up playing the final
game?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: I just want to play. I'm just going to take it as being in the
National Championship game, two great teams out there, it's going to be a
battle. And it doesn't matter who it is. It's about this team right here.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student‑athletes? Right here.  
  
Q. Jewell, Coach talked about how you stepped up in the rebounding end. You
destroyed them on the board. Never seen a game like that. Offensive rebounds
and overall. Just talk about the effort on the glass on both ends of the
floor?  
JEWELL LOYD: I think it's just our mentality. We wanted the ball. We wanted to
box out. We've been working on that for a while. Great to see that we actually
dug deep and boxed out and a lot of different people stepped up. Our point
guard. Rebounding. It was great to see.  
  
Q. Kayla, you said you would cut somebody else's heart out to win. Was that
the attitude you went into tonight with knowing that you were going to be
ruthless and relentless out there?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: I think I'm just competitive in general. I love playing for
this team. I love playing for Coach McGraw. And it means so much to me.  
I just want to go out there, play as hard as I can as long as I'm out there.
And I just take it as that.  
I'm just really competitive. I don't think I would necessarily cut anybody.
But I would definitely do a lot of things to win.  
  
Q. All season long it's been one game at a time, one game at a time. Well,
there's only one left. What does it mean to be in the National Championship
again and being undefeated at this point?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: It means a lot. Especially as a senior. I'm just so proud of
this team. I think we've been through a lot of adversity especially after
losing Ace in the Elite Eight. But I think it's this team's mentality.  
I think we're very fearless we have a certain toughness about us, and, I don't
know, I think we're ready for anything. I think we have a great coach who is
more competitive than us. It trickles down. We're going to go in look at the
film and we're going to be ready for the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student‑athletes? Okay. We'll take
questions for Coach McGraw. We'll start back with Richard.  
  
Q. When you headed into this game, did you make it an intentional point to
try to get Kayla off early, because clearly, as you said, that really seemed
to impact not only your team but really sort of the flow of the game?  
COACH MCGRAW: Without Ace in the game, we probably ran a few more sets than we
would and tried to get the ball to her early on. When she was playing well, we
continued to give it to her.  
She can create a lot of shots out of our entire offense. I thought she did a
great job on transition, but she was great on ball screen today, too.  
  
Q. What does it mean to get back to the championship game, three times in
four years now. What does it mean to be back here again one win away from
something special?  
COACH MCGRAW: We put ourselves in a great position. I think this team had some
goals early on and it's an amazing accomplishment that we're sitting here
undefeated right now.  
I don't think any of us really thought about that or expected that to happen.
I think we kind of wanted to be here, maybe expected that we could get here.
But the reality of being undefeated and being in the championship game is,
it's quite an accomplishment.  
  
Q. I know as a coach you always find stuff to nitpick, but how close was
tonight's effort to maximizing what you guys can do as a team?  
COACH MCGRAW: It really was pretty close. I don't think we painted our
masterpiece yet. Every game we want to go out and play well.  
We look at the players individually and say if everybody played well on the
same night, imagine how good we would be. We were pretty darned close tonight.  
I thought the turnovers were probably the only exception. We had quite a few
unforced errors. And if you take that away, I think we're getting there.  
  
Q. Coach, wonder if you could talk about the keys to a couple things, the
big rebounding edge and also a shutting down Alyssa for the most part, what
were some of the keys in both those?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, the biggest keys and the thing we've worked on all
week against our practice guys was boxing out, really getting a body on
someone, not worrying about who was going to go get the rebound, just putting
a body, especially on Thomas and making sure she didn't get the rebound.  
Whoever was guarding her, that was their job, to keep her off not to get any
rebounds. And I thought it was such a great team effort. We really worked hard
at that. You could see them. And I think our confidence grew when we saw how
it was working.  
  
Q. Teams go different ways when an impactful player goes out. Was there a
point either before the game, or maybe it's in the first couple of minutes,
when did you know that this team was going to respond the right way to
Natalie's injury?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, I think I saw it at practice. I saw it the day after,
when we came back Wednesday for practice, I think you could see it in their
eyes. They were determined this was not going to slow them down.  
  
Q. Late in the first half, Taya Reimer had a pass to Kayla on the UCLA cut
after an offensive rebound. Then the next possession she goes to the basket on
a fake screen roll. Seems as if Taya has really acclimated to all the seniors
and playing well. Talk about Taya's development in really playing with the
seniors and with the other players; it seems to have been pretty fast.  
COACH MCGRAW: She really fits well in the Princeton offense. She's perfect for
this offense, because she can read screens. She can move about the ball. She
can read the defense. She sets great screens and she's strong and physical and
she's fast.  
So everything she does, we had worked on the slipping the screen. We worked on
that a couple of days this week and thought we could get her on some of those.  
But she really read it perfectly today. I think she showed a lot today coming
in as a freshman in this big role and played extremely well.  
  
Q. She got off to a little bit of a rocky start; you sat her down for a
second and then all of a sudden looked like she had her feet under her. What
did you tell her at that moment?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think she just needed to breathe. It's a big moment for you,
come into the game, big stage, everybody's watching you. And I think she just
needed to kind of catch her breath, sit down for a minute.  
We thought, after she got one foul we might take her off, because we wanted
her on the floor, didn't want her to get the second one.  
When you get the adrenalin going, you get winded a little bit earlier. I think
it was good for her to just relax a minute, talk again about how we're going
to front, what we're looking for defensively, and keep focusing on the defense
and rebounding.  
  
Q. Did you have any idea that Markisha Wright had a 12 and 9 game within
her?  
COACH MCGRAW: What a great day to bring it out. She really was great. I think
she's been ready all year long. I think for her, this is the moment she's been
looking forward to, the opportunity to get out there and play a little bit
more than she has been. And she really took advantage of it.  
  
Q. Obviously the second game could go either way, but you've been around
this team for a while. What would it mean to have the two undefeated
essentially playing on Tuesday night for a National Championship?  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, better than us meeting in the semifinal. That would be
much better.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Thank you.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Notre Dame  87  
Maryland - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Maryland, head coach Brenda Frese and
student‑athletes Lexie Brown and Alyssa Thomas.  
We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Frese and then go to the
student‑athletes.  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: Obviously the better team won tonight. And I thought Notre
Dame just did a terrific job, really took advantage, especially I thought they
set the tone from the first possession with the offensive rebounding, being
dominant on the glass.  
Obviously we really struggled to be able to have an answer for Loyd and
McBride. And they showed their experience, I thought, throughout this game.  
But like I told the kids in the locker room, you know, we're one of the last
four teams to be able to play. When this tournament started, nobody counted on
us being able to make it to the Final Four, and really when the season ends,
only one team gets to end with a win.  
So couldn't be more proud of the ride that this team took us on to be able to
go to the Final Four. And anything and everything that Alyssa has meant to our
team and our program and to be able to bring her to the Final Four was a dream
come true.  
Obviously we're sad because we wanted to continue on playing for her, but you
couldn't coach a better person with everything that she's meant to our team
and our program.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Questions for the student‑athletes now.  
  
Q. Alyssa, your thoughts on playing your final game. I know it's not the
outcome you wanted, but you accomplished so much in your career up to this
point.  
ALYSSA THOMAS: Sad to see it's the last game, it ended like that. I can't be
disappointed. We made it to a Final Four, and I had so much fun this year. I
know we'll get started from this game and we'll be better next year.  
  
Q. Alyssa, what did they do differently in this game to defend you that they
didn't do in that first game that gave you trouble early?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: I think early foul trouble hindered me a lot. But nothing‑‑
they didn't do anything that they didn't do in the first game.  
  
Q. Lexie, your thoughts to be able to play with Alyssa and with all she's
meant to the program? You've been a point guard most of the year. How has that
been?  
LEXIE BROWN: She made my job really easy playing with a player like Alyssa.
I've never had a teammate who could do it all. And it's been an incredible
season. I'm going to miss her so much. She's one of the most dependable
teammates I've ever played with, and I'm just sad that we couldn't win our
championship. But how far she brought us has been amazing.  
  
Q. Alyssa, the rebounding coming in was a big factor and they were a monster
on the floor, just they were being aggressive. What was the difference out
there with the rebounding factor?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: They just wanted it more. They beat us at our own game and we
just never seemed to get on the boards.  
  
Q. Lexie, when you were facing a 22 ‑point deficit, you guys were able to
come back. You guys were facing a similar situation tonight. What's the
difference between that game and this game that hindered you from getting back
in this game?  
LEXIE BROWN: Like Alyssa said, they just wanted it more. They clearly
remembered what we did to them last time. So they weren't going to take us
lightly the second half. I mean, we were our second half team, and they knew
that.  
They just played harder than us.  
THE MODERATOR: Continue now with questions for Coach.  
  
Q. If you went into the game and knew that you would be outrebounded by the
margin it was, I mean, shock, what's the thought on what happens on that
end?  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: You know, it's something that we talked about at length
even with our team. That was something when we played them back in '09, they
set the tone from the beginning with their rebounding.  
So disappointed, obviously, in terms of our lack of response to it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Brionna Jones's performance tonight. She had a great
game.  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: She was huge. I thought she was really poised and she
didn't play like a freshman. She played like she's been to the Final Four.
Gave us a tremendous inside post presence.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what they might have done differently defensively on
Alyssa?  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: I thought they were key really in terms of every time she
got by a line of help there was another layer. So they were constantly sending
waves of people. When she would get through one, there would be another one
there waiting for her.  
  
Q. Brenda, did Alyssa's foul trouble impede not only her minutes but do you
think it impeded her style of play and her aggressiveness a little bit as
well?  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know when that happened to Alyssa, at times she
has to pull back because she knows she wants to be on the floor. So definitely
it was difficult.  
But I thought that the chess match going on from rotations on their end and
our end we were never able quite able to make that difference. When they went
small, we weren't able to make that small from the rebounding end.  
  
Q. Brenda, what makes Kayla McBride such a difficult matchup?  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: Her IQ. Obviously she can score the basketball. Her
ability‑‑ she gets a clean look; it's going in. But in game, watching her
attack our guards, every time she knew when A.T. had two fouls and she went
right at A.T., when another guard got two fouls she went right at that guard.  
So just watching her in‑game IQ. I probably didn't appreciate it as much as I
saw it in games in terms of she's got a high level in terms of understanding
the game.  
  
Q. Brenda, you mentioned this team has Final Four potential from the
beginning of the season. It took a little bit longer to kind of get to the
level you wanted this team to play. But seeing that they kind of got to that
level, that finally got to the level you wanted them to play at and they got
this experience, how do you think that kind of ‑‑ how do you carry that into
the next season?  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: Well, obviously when you get to have that kind of
experience, when you make the run that we did, Sweet 16, Elite Eight and to be
able to play on the biggest stage, it can do nothing but help your returners.  
And so when you look at the nucleus of who we have returning and our three
freshmen and the presence they've been able to have and the depth we've been
able to have this season, definitely that experience factor is key.  
Just like Notre Dame's been to the Final Four four times, you can't substitute
for that kind of experience.  
  
Q. Did you say anything special to A.T. in the locker room in postgame? And
I know you didn't want to think about life without A.T., but obviously that's
the next step. When does that phase kind of start moving forward?  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: Geez, can't you just give me a couple minutes? You know,
both taking her off the court and in the locker room with her and our five
seniors, I thanked her. She was a dream come true to be able to coach.  
And she left every single thing that she possibly could on the floor. So,
yeah, it's too early to be able to think about life after her. But I am
encouraged by the great minutes that our team was able to get this year. When
you talk about our underclassmen and the depth that we were able to develop.  
So you become different. You become different in terms of you're encouraged by
the presence that we got from Bri tonight, Lexie, Laurin, Shatori, there's a
lot of great things for us as a team to be able to look forward to and it will
just be a different style of play in terms of how we move forward.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach Frese? Okay. Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 6, 2014

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Bria Hartley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21837)

### [Breanna Stewart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25344)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

UConn  75  
Stanford - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from Connecticut head is coach Geno
Auriemma and student‑athletes Breanna Stewart and Bria Hartley.  
We'll take a brief statement from Coach Auriemma and then go to questions for
the student‑athletes.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thank you. I think the game played out at least in the first
half how I thought it would play out. We knew it would be a little bit of a
struggle. It's hard to make shots‑‑ unless you're Kayla McBride‑‑ it's hard to
make shots at the Final Four.  
Once we got settled in and got our rhythm, I thought we played one of the best
games that we played all year, given the fact that we beat a really, really
good team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Breanna, talk about the first ten minutes of the first half and did you
guys feel like you needed to settle in?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think at times we were a little jumpy, getting too excited.
And we had to settle down and get into the right rhythm of the game. Once we
did that, it seemed like we went on a run to end the first half and shots
started falling.  
  
Q. Bria, what does it say about the state of basketball and the state of
Connecticut that your men's team will be playing for the title tomorrow night
and you'll be playing for it Tuesday night? And what does it say to see Team
Kevin and Team Geno playing for it all?  
BRIA HARTLEY: I think it's awesome. I know our men are really excited for us
and rooting us on. We're doing the same thing for them. I think all the fans
in Connecticut are really proud right now and both teams have worked really
hard all year and through the preseason preparing for this moment. So it's now
the time has come when we make sure we finish on a good note.  
  
Q. Bria, did something change defensively at any point in the first half
when you went on your run but you suddenly were making it really hard for them
to score?  
BRIA HARTLEY: I think we just picked up the pressure on our defense, really
getting into passing lanes. I thought Moriah did a good job, got a few steals
out there. One steal that Stewy got was awesome. It changed the momentum of
the game.  
That's what our defense does when we go out there and we make it tough for
them to score and we're able to create offense off of that. It really helps
our offense and we're able to play a lot better.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student‑athletes? Thank you, ladies.  
  
Q. Geno, how big of a difference did bringing Kiah into the game make in
your defense in particular?  
COACH AURIEMMA: When we went with the bigger lineup, we have a few more
options defensively that we can do. It allowed us to move Stewy onto a shooter
and get some length out there. Kiah has been a real good defensive player and
a shot blocker, and we trust her now. We didn't in the past. But we do and
we're not afraid to put her out there in big moments. That's the best game
she's ever played, I think, since she came to Connecticut.  
  
Q. Wanted to get you to respond to the question about seeing your men and
seeing your team get to it undefeated, and was Bria or Breanna a Team Geno
draft pick?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, unfortunately when we did that, that Midnight Madness
thing, we didn't get to pick our teams. So I was just assigned a team. And I
thought I had it made. I had Shabazz, DeAndre Daniels. So I thought there's no
way we could lose. And we're down like 20 at halftime. Finally told them, I
said that's one reason why I don't coach guys, you guys just don't listen. And
then Shabazz scored like 30 straight. We won at the end.  
So you could see these guys that are playing for Kevin, you can just feel it,
the energy that they play with, that they get from Kevin.  
They just have so much confidence in each other. It's quite remarkable. I
don't even know what words you could use to describe that. For the second time
in 10 years we've got two of our teams playing for the National Championship.  
It really is‑‑ you don't want to say it like it's incredible, because we've
done it before. But just the fact that it's happening for a guy that's been a
head coach for two years, that's pretty remarkable. That's pretty remarkable.  
Somebody told me that no one who has never won at least a regional has ever
won a National Championship.  
But they're coached by a guy who played 13 years in the NBA all on one‑year
contracts. I would bet on Kevin. Not that I'm allowed to bet, because this is
the NCAA.  
  
Q. Thanks for clearing that up.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Absolutely.  
  
Q. You've seen a lot of things in women's basketball, including with your
own team, but 39 ‑0 versus 37‑0 is a unique place for this sport. Can you step
away obviously from the fact that you're coaching one of the teams and sort
of, do you recognize that this is a pretty historic thing coming up on
Tuesday?   
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, it was almost‑‑ it looked to me like, as the season went
on, it almost looked like it was inevitable, you know. Like it was supposed to
happen.  
And our sport probably doesn't have enough significant moments, you know. I
don't know that we have the kind of moments that happen last night at the
men's Final Four where you get a 7 and 8 seed playing for the National
Championship. I don't think we have enough of those moments in our game.  
So to have the spotlight on Tuesday on two teams that one of them is going to
lose for the first time this year, and it's pretty remarkable when you think
about how hard that is to do for one team, much less two.  
And they're far and away the best team that I've seen this year. Far and away.
No one else is even close of any team that we've played or that I've seen play
on film. No one else is even close.  
  
Q. Geno, can you talk a little bit about Bonnie Samuelson? She was 1 from 7
from the field. I believe they were all from beyond the arc. And she was
shooting 46.7 percent through the first four tournament games. And they're a
team that typically tends to shoot a lot of 3s. Can you talk about what
emphasis you placed on defending the 3 ‑point line and how you went about
doing that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We knew that. We knew they were going to shoot a lot of them.
They took 25 of them. Our goal was not to let them take 25. They made 10
against North Carolina, I think. They made 10.  
That's 30 of their points. And tonight they made six. They banked two of them
in. That's the kind of stuff that happens at the Final Four. But we can do
things that other teams can't do. We can play Chiney one‑on‑one. We don't have
to worry about doubling down there leaving 3‑point shooters open.  
We can switch some screens that maybe other teams can't because they don't
have our size or our versatility.  
So Bonnie's a great shooter. I've seen her make that one shot she made when
Stewy got up in the air she went by her. That's the kind of stuff she can do.  
Their whole team can make seven, eight, nine, ten in a row. So that was part
of the game plan. Doesn't matter how many 2s they get. But we gotta limit the
3s and the free throws. I thought we did a great job of both of those things.  
  
Q. Geno, speaking of 3 ‑point shooting, for about the last week or so you
guys haven't shot at the clip that you're accustomed to. How have you guys had
to adjust and modify what you're doing to account for the fact you're not
hitting as many shots from the outside as you normally do?  
COACH AURIEMMA: There's not a lot of adjustments you can make when you're not
making shots. At one point I think Stanford had all five of their players
inside the lane and just daring us to make a shot.  
As I said, it's contagious. You're not going to believe this but yesterday at
practice here and today at shootaround, we made every shot to the point where
I'm like, yeah, I like this. And then couldn't make anything in the first
half.  
I've always said if you play great defense, you put yourself in a position to
win a game. And then however good your offense is, that will depend on what
the spread is.  
If your offense is great that night, you can win by a lot. But if your offense
isn't great that night, you can still win if you play great defense. And we
managed to do that this entire season.  
  
Q. Geno, although it's led to this dream Final, both you and Notre Dame have
not only gone undefeated, you've overwhelmed virtually everybody you've
played. Is it good that two teams have separated themselves so thoroughly from
the rest of the country to make it seem like it's really been a two ‑team
season all along?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think it's good once in a while. I think it's good. I don't
know that I would want a steady diet of that every year. But I think once in a
while it's good. Draws a lot of attention to the game. An awful lot of people
might tune in Tuesday night that wouldn't normally maybe tune in.  
I think it's okay. I know that there was more‑‑ it was much more competitive
beyond those two.  
Like if you took those two off the boards, everything else was really, really
competitive this year. It's a work in progress. I don't think we're there yet.  
  
Q. Why have you two separated yourselves so thoroughly from ‑‑ what do you
think it is about these two teams that has allowed each of you to separate,
this season, to separate you so thoroughly from everybody else?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, we had everybody coming back from last year's team
except Kelly Faris and Caroline Doty, two kids that played a lot. And Kelly
was the backbone of our defense and was unbelievable.  
But the core of our team was back. So that obviously was a huge benefit.  
And the same for Notre Dame. They lost a great player in Skylar Diggins. But
what they had coming back was a great team. The way both teams have managed to
make the necessary adjustments throughout the season.  
I'm not surprised. We are the two best passing teams in the country. I think
we pass it great, and I think they pass it great. I think we're the two best
passing teams in America. And that's something that a lot of teams can't do,
they can't pass.  
So when you pass the ball really well and you have a lot of really good
players on the floor, you end up kind of having a dominant team.  
  
Q. You hit on this a little bit, but you mentioned that they were far and
away the best team when you looked at them on film. Can you be specific? Is it
when you look at them on film, is it just a question of talent? Or is it the
execution that the talent that you see performed is at a higher level than
anybody else?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't think talent is always the answer. Except they have
two First‑Team All‑Americans that are as good as any two players in the
country, individually and collectively. There's not too many players better
than those two. And they're so aggressive, and they have such a scoring
mentality.  
And when they run their stuff, they really run it. They execute as well as
anybody in the country. They probably attack the basket as well if not better
than anybody I've seen.  
When Kayla McBride gets the ball, when she gets to half court, you better put
three people around the basket and hope because at some point she's going to
get there and she's going to score or get fouled. And Jewell Loyd is the same
way. So when you play with that kind of aggressive mentality and you're that
talented, you look like a great team, which is what they are.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from Stanford student‑athletes Chiney
Ogwumike, Mikaela Ruef, and Lili Thompson and head coach Tara Van Derveer.
We'll take an opening statement from Coach Van Derveer and then questions for
the student‑athletes.  
COACH VAN DERVEER: We're excited to be here. We've worked hard. I think our
team has really improved throughout the season, and we're looking forward to
playing UConn tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes. Start with Michel.  
  
Q. Chiney, what has to be different against Connecticut this time than in
November?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I think since November we're a different team. We know our
offense better. We know each other better. So, honestly, I'm just looking at
it like we just have to play Stanford basketball, the basketball we've been
playing throughout the NCAA Tournament and just being confident. Just going in
there and just playing a game.  
You're just playing the next opponent. Don't think of anything bigger. It's a
basketball game. Just take it smart. Know our game plan and just be confident
and play together. That's all I'm thinking about right now.  
THE MODERATOR: Question right over here, the aisle.  
  
Q. Mikaela, I would assume that your team is probably pretty loose at this
point. And is that exemplified by the fact that you folks did a line dance at
the end of practice today?  
MIKAELA RUEF: Yeah. Our team, we're loose coming into the Final Four. I think
that's the best way for us to play. We came out a little tight against North
Carolina, and that didn't go so well at first.  
But once we loosened up and started having fun, we started to play better. So
that's what we're trying to do on this trip.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes. We'll come up here first.  
  
Q. Chiney, if you would just talk about the way teams have tried to defend
you this year. You've been able to back them down when they played behind you,
you've been able to field them when they come in front. I'm sure you'll see
double team zones. What do you expect UConn to play and talk about the
defenses that you've faced?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Coach Tara did a good job of reminding me every game that I'm
probably going to have two or three people on me, so I should just trust my
teammates, which I always do. And I've seen a lot of defenses. We've seen
zones that try to take away the paint and then we can double team.  
It's not necessarily what they do. It's just making sure I make‑‑ lead the
defense and make the right play. If they double team me, that means someone on
the outside is open and we just have to find a shooter and get a good shot on
the play. So we're just trying to take it as it comes.  
And it's a 40‑minute game. If I can get down the court early, I'll be
one‑on‑one for a while and take advantage of that. Other little things like
that are what I try to stick to.  
THE MODERATOR: Question down on the front.  
  
Q. Any of the three athletes, can you talk about this chance of getting
UConn again? They're undefeated and for them to talk of you all being extras,
the JV team. But when you think about this chance and how different you are as
a team, what's the confidence level like right now for you all?  
THE MODERATOR: Chiney you want to take that?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Surely. I think we're just trying to focus on this game.
We've done it all season long, one game at a time. We're not intimidated.
We're excited.  
We just want to play our game. I think no matter the outcome, if we play
Stanford basketball, we'll be happy. But, granted, we'll be happier if we win,
obviously, and that's what we're working towards.  
So I think we just‑‑ we're different. We're improved, and we're confident and
we're going to play together and play tough. That's why I think we're loose
right now because we know what we can do and we're confident in each other's
abilities.  
THE MODERATOR: Question right here.  
  
Q. Chiney, having played UConn a number of times during your career,
specifically what is different about them as an opponent versus other
opponents?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Do you mean by this year or what's different about‑‑ in
general? They're very well‑coached. They play together. They're very
unselfish. Usually the person with the open‑‑ the open person gets the shot.
That's the way Coach Tara teaches us. The open person gets the shot.  
They're very dangerous because they're a very talented team. So I think this
year in particular they've really weathered the storm. I know they've had a
short bench, and it's very impressive to have their run. But at the end of the
day, whoever sides out there for us, whoever sides out for them, we're not
going to hold anything back.  
  
Q. Chiney, this is kind of an offshoot of that question, but do you see any
weaknesses in UConn?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Maybe Coach does. I think that will be a better question for
Coach. I just listen to what her game plan is and we try to go and execute it.
They're a very great team, and we just try to do what we're supposed to do out
there based on Coach's game plan.  
THE MODERATOR: Question right here.  
  
Q. Lili, your development has been one of the big reasons that this team got
this far this year. What was that like for you the first, second games of the
season when you played at UConn? I don't even know how much you played them
that game. But could you describe a little bit about what your emotions were
playing such a lauded team so early in your career?  
LILI THOMPSON: It was the second game. And I think for all the freshmen, we're
just coming into the team and haven't played in front of a crowd that large.
And so of course there were some jitters and nerves and just overall not
having the experience.  
But in the 30 games or so since then, we've all improved as a team and settled
into what we do. So it's a completely different atmosphere.  
THE MODERATOR: Question over here on the right.  
  
Q. For both Lili and Mikaela, for both of you guys. How important is it to
not be intimidated by UConn? They get so much hype, and you guys have had
success against them as a program. How important is it to go in believing you
can beat a team like UConn?  
MIKAELA RUEF: I think obviously the most important thing is to believe that
you can win. We wouldn't be here if we didn't believe we could win. We would
have just stayed home. We're confident going into the game. You have to be
confident, otherwise you don't have a chance.  
LILI THOMPSON: I feel the same way. I think that it's the same with any
opponent. You get a game plan and you get your confidence going and you go
play the game. The opponent matters for the Xs and Os, but not for your
confidence level.  
THE MODERATOR: Question right here.  
  
Q. Mikaela, I'm going to sneak in two here real quick. Talk about your 3
‑point shooting the other night against North Carolina and where that came
from. Is that now a part of your arsenal? And then secondly, if you could talk
about Chiney in terms of the way she steals opponents down on the block and
how well she receives those passes coming in.   
MIKAELA RUEF: I have to say that my 3‑point shooting, it was thanks a lot in
part to Chiney because my person was guarding her as I had the ball. So I
figured why not shoot it. And it went in. When it goes in, I feel like I could
shoot it again and Coach won't be so mad.  
At this point in the season, any game could be our last. So why not have it in
my arsenal now?  
And then with Chiney catching my passes inside, or any of our passes inside,
you can literally just throw it in her vicinity and she'll jump up and catch
it. If she can't catch it, she'll try her hardest to catch it.  
And then on top of that, after she catches the ball, she goes out of her way
to try and go up right away so she can give you an assist, which I think is
something special in a person, that she's trying to help you out with your
stats. You're like just score, it's fine. She's like, no, you made a great
pass; I want you to get something good for it.  
THE MODERATOR: Question in the back.  
  
Q. First for Mikaela and Lili and Chiney can chime in. Coming up short
within the Pac ‑12 Tournament for the first time in eight years, how much did
that motivate you guys even more? Or was it already built in once this
tournament started. How did Pac‑12 semifinals kind of lead you towards this
run to Nashville?   
MIKAELA RUEF: I think the number one thing it did was it kind of just woke us
up. Like we were kind of playing in a daze a little bit, and we were getting
by in games, but we weren't playing the way we should be playing. And I think
losing there really like gave us a sense that our next loss is our last game
of the season. And I think it really put a sense of urgency into everyone on
the team to improve on what we could improve on in the two weeks we had from
the loss to the beginning of the NCAA Tournament.  
And I think our team took great advantage of the time that we had and we
really did improve in what we could.  
THE MODERATOR: One last question down here for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Chiney, looking at some of the recent teams, not just you guys, but
overall Stanford has done well. When you think of Andrew Luck, people like
that, is it a cliche or is there something cute, kind of likable, nerdy,
articulate thing? Is that a forced reference or do you think there's something
there? Also being all these teams lately kicking butt on the court, too?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I love that aspect. I think that Stanford overall grooms you
to be ready for life after. And I think I'm experiencing that right now. And
when people ask us what's the great thing about Stanford, it's the people,
people like Coach Tara, people like Bernard Muir, the AD, people like
President Hennessey. We just have great support staff that really give you the
confidence to be who you are and discover who you are. And you feel more
confident as a person so when you're confident as a person, you can go out
there and you know football or basketball comes easy.  
I think just being able to go to Stanford University has been a huge blessing
for all of us. We all have different stories, but at the end of the day, we
all love each other, as people come first. So we're willing to do anything on
the court. That's like the easy part.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Thank you, ladies. You can go back to your locker
room. They'll be available until 4:30.  
COACH VAN DERVEER: Good job, Lili. That was your best press conference.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start taking questions for Coach. In the back there.  
  
Q. Same question I asked Chiney. What weaknesses, if any, do you see in
UConn?  
COACH VAN DERVEER: Well, they aren't as deep as they were when we first played
them. They've had‑‑ they lost a player. They hurt us actually when we played.  
I think that they have four All‑Americans on their front line and they have an
excellent point guard. So I wouldn't say that there's any glaring weaknesses.
Have a Hall of Fame coach who does a great job for his team.  
And I think obviously they're a confident team. They're defending national
champions, and we'll have to play very well to win the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Question right here.  
  
Q. Tara, I know that a lot of times you love to game plan in X and O's, and
that's your thing. With this particular team that you just mentioned, without
any glaring weaknesses, has it been more of a nightmare to try to figure
something out, or has there been any pleasure in it?  
COACH VAN DERVEER: You know, I like the challenge of kind of thinking about
what we want to do and being here and having the opportunity to play
Connecticut and actually having played so many great teams to get here
throughout the whole season. Really, it's so exciting to think, well, these
are the shots we're trying to get, these are the shots we have to limit that
they get. And then to come out and see, can we do it.  
And we will have to really execute a game plan for 40 minutes to be
successful, because they are that good.  
THE MODERATOR: Question from Richard.  
  
Q. Tara, along the same lines of game planning. Breanna Stewart is such a
unique player with her size and length and ability to score inside and
outside. When you look at her on film, how do you try to attack her
effectively?  
COACH VAN DERVEER: I think that she does have what you said. But it's who all
she plays with. By herself out there, she would be another 6'4" kid with some
versatility. But we played against some of that. But she plays with Dolson who
allows her to play 4. She plays with Lewis who forces you to spread the floor.
Or she plays with Jefferson who gets steals and creates for her.  
So she's a very talented player. But the story of Connecticut is not just one
player. That was evidenced by four All‑Americans. They have the most talented
team in the country. When you're playing with other really talented players as
LeBron James wanted to, as Michael Jordan did, when you're around other
players, in some ways there's less pressure on you and there's this synergy,
and it makes life easier.  
So she's very, very good. And she brings a great dimension to their team. But
they are clearly not a one‑person team. That's why they repeatedly win.  
  
Q. Tara, you and Coach Auriemma both have been around the women's game for a
long time. You're both very blunt spoken in some ways. You have gone up
against him numerous times in recruiting battles, I suppose. How would you
describe your relationship with him? Has it always been ‑‑ I mean, just
personally, has it been rocky at times, or as just mutual respect? Have you
really butted heads with him?  
COACH VAN DERVEER: Not that I can remember at all. I totally respect the job
that he‑‑ he went to Connecticut the same year I went to Stanford. And so we
have been at the Final Four. Sometimes we didn't play each other going to the
Final Four. But Geno's done just a great job. We've kind of walked the same
path with coaching the Olympic team.  
He's just done a fabulous team with his teams. I respect the job. I learn from
him. I think he's very funny. And I won't say‑‑ I'm on the West Coast, he's on
the East Coast, but I feel very confident. I have him in my cell phone, his
number, and I can call him at any time or text with him.  
I consider him a friend. We don't really recruit that much against each other
just because of the different‑‑ maybe the different kids that we're looking
at, but everything that I know about it has been always professional.  
  
Q. Have you discussed Chiney's evolution as a player? Is this the first year
she's had an reliable mid range jumper, coming in earlier?  
COACH VAN DERVEER: Chiney as a player, it's fun to actually think about her
journey. And I might get in trouble for this little story, but I am the oldest
of four girls and one boy. But Chiney‑‑ and Neka is oldest, and basically I
bonded Neka and recruited Neka. Then Chiney came to Stanford, and I was closer
to Neka. And my assistant coach Amy Tucker was close to Chiney. And Amy would
say, Chiney is pretty good, too.  
But Amy at first said to Chiney, wow, how hard of a life would that be to
follow Neka? And obviously Chiney has done pretty well. But Chiney, when she
started at Stanford, she was to rebound and play defense and keep Neka out of
foul trouble and rebound Neka's shots.  
When Neka graduated, basically we ran plays for Chiney that went into Cheney.
It was Chiney. She was working on her outside shot all that time. She has a
3‑point shot. She might bust that out here. But she really has a great
perimeter shot. We need her to play closer to the basket, but if we need to
move her out, we'll see that.  
I think she's had it, really since her sophomore year. She was working on it.
She works in the off season. She had it last year but we wouldn't let her take
it. Now it's more if we play against some better rebounders, then she can move
outside a little bit more.  
THE MODERATOR: Question on the right.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the evolution of the other players on the team
around Chiney this year and how far they've come from way back at the
beginning of the season to get you to this point?  
COACH VAN DERVEER: I think this might be the most improved team, one of the
most improved teams I've ever coached, in that when we went to Italy early, we
had five freshmen. And a lot of it was kind of kind of looking at people,
putting people in the mix. We start a whole different lineup than we did in
November.  
We're playing different people. Lili has pretty much‑‑ she owns the 2‑guard
spot. Amber owns the 1‑guard spot. Our 3 is in flux a lot. We start with Sara
James, but we play Bonnie, we play Taylor. We could actually play Chiney at
our 3.  
Mikaela Ruef has improved tremendously. For the players that have followed us
as she was a freshman, she would go into the game and turn the ball over so
many times and so fast, it would be like we could only play her one minute.  
She has been one of the most improved players that we've ever had at Stanford.
And she came back to Stanford this year without a scholarship, and she has
made just incredible strides this year, her shooting, her passing, her
defense. And I mean, just even her ability to sit up here and do such a great
job at the press conference, she's improved in that too.  
THE MODERATOR: Couple of questions down here.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Chiney in her ability to defend the post. Is she one
of the best maybe that you've seen at that? And what defense do you think
UConn will play against her based on that first meeting?  
COACH VAN DERVEER: Well, we've had some great, great post player's. Jayne
Appel, fabulous low block player. And Neka. I don't know that comparing would
be good.  
But Chiney can score one‑on‑one pretty much against anybody. If they're really
big, then she'll bring them away and hit her high post shot.  
I think she'll do what she said. She'll read the defense and just kind of get
what the defense‑‑ take what the defense gives her.  
  
Q. Seems like every Final Four team, especially on the women's side, always
has a big star, and you're no exception. But I'm wondering, the relative value
of the supporting cast, when you get to this level as opposed to the regular
season, maybe, does it change in how ‑‑ how do they compare in the Final Four
to the regular season, maybe?  
COACH VAN DERVEER: You know, like you said, to get here, you've gotta have
probably a great leader. We do with Chiney. But we cannot be Chiney and the
Chiney‑ettes. We know that we have to have a great play from all of our four
other people that are out there on the court with her.  
What I'm excited about is the fact that we have five people in double figures
through the NCAA Tournament. Amber has really stepped up her game and is
really doing a great job at the point. Lili, Mikaela Ruef. Bonnie Samuelson.
We can probably play seven or eight people, bring in Karlie Samuelson, Erica
McCall, and Taylor Greenfield.  
  
Q. When players read that most people are picking UConn or that UConn is
locked to win, is that just outside noise, or can you and your coaching staff
actually use that as motivation? How does that sort of work really inside the
locker room?  
COACH VAN DERVEER: You know, I think that there's‑‑ Connecticut and Notre Dame
have earned the right to be No. 1 seeds. I think the media has kind of put
them in the championship game to make it some Cinderella ball, wouldn't it be
great to see these two undefeated teams?  
But myself and Brenda Frese, us and Maryland, we're here. If we're going to be
someone's hors d'oeuvres, we're not going to get swallowed easily. We are
going to work really hard to play the best game that we can. We definitely
talk about it.  
And for us, you might think sometimes it's good because there's a lot of times
where we are clearly the top dog, and we're supposed to win.  
We didn't win the Pac‑12 tournament. And I remind our team that. I said, you
know, No. 1 seed didn't do us any good there. So I'm definitely kind of a
little bit of a smack talker in the locker room with our team. And I just kind
of‑‑ I think if our team has had a little bit of a chip on our shoulder, then
I've carried it, too.  
THE MODERATOR: Question right there.  
  
Q. When you beat Connecticut in the semifinals in 2008, I think you shot
about 100 percent from the free ‑throw line. That was a big upset. Would this
be an infinitely bigger upset given how overpowering they've been all
season?  
COACH VAN DERVEER: You know, they had a great team in 2008. Think of the
players that were on that team. Tina Charles. Maya Moore. Charde Houston. Just
to name a couple that are pros. I think that that kind of game, I remind our
team of that game.  
They have a very talented team this year. But we just have to play well. So
we're not‑‑ I don't think we're‑‑ we're not caught up in‑‑ our kids haven't
paid attention to what UConn's done since we played them.  
We're out there. They don't watch them on television. They're not shaking in
their boots. They're excited. And I want them to be excited.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for Coach Van Derveer? Okay. Thank you very
much.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 5, 2014

  

### [Jewell Lloyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25261)

### [Kayla McBride](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23276)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Notre Dame, Head Coach Muffet McGraw,
student‑athletes Jewell Lloyd and Kayla McBride. Questions for the
student‑athletes, raise your hand for a mic and state your name and
affiliation and address the student‑athlete. And we'll begin with questions
now. Start right here.  
  
Q. Kayla, what's your team's mindset right now that you're at the Final
Four?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: I think right now, we kind of took it all in after the game,
but it was right back to business the next day. We knew we had a great team in
Maryland and we're just trying to focus on how we're going to win those 40
minutes.  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to take questions for the student‑athletes first.  
  
Q. Kayla, then. Wonder if you could talk about the experience of making four
consecutive Final Fours and then how much would it mean to kind of break
through and win it here if you get that chance in the last one?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: I think it says a lot about this program, Coach McGraw and the
coaching staff and being able to get to four Final Fours. I know me and the
seniors are excited to be here. Your senior year you want to take it all in
and have a lot of fun and that's my mindset, is just taking it all in and
trying to win the whole thing. Obviously I want to win the national
championship. I am just trying to focus on playing 40 minutes of basketball.  
  
Q. Kayla, that first game against Maryland, what did you do that you liked,
what do you think you need to change, and how do you do that?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: I think Maryland's a great physical rebounding team. I think
that that's their biggest strength, how they crash the glass. Alyssa Thomas is
a great player, All‑American. So how we're going to contain her and be able to
contain their transition game and their rebounding game.  
I liked how we moved the ball. I think we kind of got open looks, got easy
layups, especially in the first half, which got us in a big lead, then we
started to settle down and closed the gap. I think it's just it's running our
offense and executing our game plan and also defense and rebounding.  
  
Q. Jewell, can you talk about, now that you've been to one Final Four
already, what's more helpful to you and is it more of a help on the court or
off the court dealing with ‑‑ knowing what the Final Four experience is
like?  
JEWELL LLOYD: It's definitely easy to get distracted with everything here with
the media, different town. But I think as a team, we do a good job making sure
our mindset's focused on the game. That's what we're worried about is the
game. Coming into practice I'm worried about the details, stuff like that.  
I think our team does a really good job making sure we're focused for the game
ahead.  
  
Q. Jewell, they came back on you, made a pretty exciting game when you
played at their place. Do you think that helps you guys that it wasn't an easy
20 ‑point win, that you had to battle and have shots at the end to sort of win
the game?  
JEWELL LLOYD: Definitely. I think it helps us. I think we came together at
times and we kept our poise and it helps because down the stretch, Final Four
is crucial games, crucial moments. You need to stay together and use this as
something in our back pockets for this game coming up.  
  
Q. Jewell, I wonder if you could talk about the challenge, of course, of
Natalie going down just a few days ago and kind of changing the lineup and the
chemistry and how you guys think you'll adjust to that in the Final Four.  
JEWELL LLOYD: I don't think it's necessarily a challenge. It's time for other
people to step up. We have all the confidence in them they will. And how we
prepare for games and we don't depend on one person; it's a whole team effort.
And Coach has done a great job of making sure we're prepared for that.  
  
Q. Kayla, what words of advice could you maybe give Taya Reimer this weeks
as she prepares to take on a larger role?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: I don't want Taya to put too much pressure on herself. I don't
want her to come in until she has to. We talked about it being a collective
effort. I think everybody has to do more, myself included, Jewell. We have to
do one more thing to assure that everybody is going to get Ace. I don't want
to put a lot of pressure on her. I just want her to play the game and have fun
like she has been all year.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student‑athletes. We'll dismiss the
student‑athletes. They'll be in the locker room. Before they go I wanted to
introduce the Notre Dame sports information director Chris Masters. If you had
anything further that you need, this is Chris. Thank you. And we'll take
questions now for Coach McGraw and we'll start right here.  
  
Q. You said on the teleconference that Jewell had even exceeded your
expectations. Given how remarkable a player she was coming out of high school,
what a freshman year she had, expectations would have been pretty high anyway.
In what ways did she exceed your expectations?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think how she played in the big moments. She got her career
high against Baylor as a freshman. It ws the number one team in the nation.
She was very consistent for a freshman. I think you expect that a freshman's
going to be a little up and down, they're going to have a learning curve. At
some point in the season, maybe question some of their own ability.  
She just never did that. I think she was just so steady all season long. And
then this year to come in and really elevate her game, she's playing like a
seasoned veteran.  
She's aggressive, looking for her shot. She knows how important she is to the
team and she's really stepped her game up.  
  
Q. Her demeanor, she was the most professional college freshman I've ever
seen. Her demeanor is so unflappable. Do you think that's where the
consistency comes from?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it does. I think she has a deep faith and I think that
keeps her going and it keeps her steady.  
And she has really, really gained a lot of confidence this year, too.  
  
Q. Coach, I was wondering if you could, could you talk about what the
rebounding will ‑‑ in the specific matchup against Maryland?  
COACH MCGRAW: It's our biggest challenge. I think it's the key to the game for
us is rebounding. They're a great rebounding team. They've got so much size
inside. They're physical. They're skilled. And for us losing our leading
rebounder creates a little bit of a problem in that area.  
So we're really hoping that everybody does a little bit more. If everybody
just gets one or two more rebounds, we're trying to make up for what Natalie
would have given us.  
  
Q. As you consider how to replace Natalie in the lineup with which person,
what were some of the considerations that you took into effect in making that
decision?  
COACH MCGRAW: It's a pretty easy decision. Taya started for us at the
beginning of the year when Natalie was out. Natalie missed our first three
games. Taya was a starter. She played very well. She's similar to Ace in what
she can do at both ends of the floor. She helps us in the press. She handles
the ball. She's a good passer. She does so many things that we really need in
our offense. She's very good in the Princeton offense. So I think it was a
pretty easy decision to go with Tay.  
  
Q. Coach, when you had that stretch early in the season without Ace how did
that help you and did that prepare you for Natalie's fate?  
COACH MCGRAW: It really did. It was so early in the year, but to see a
freshman come in immediately in the starting role, at that point we're
starting two freshmen. So to see their maturity at that stage, I thought, was
really, really beneficial to them for the rest of the year.  
Tay has been in every big game. She comes in pretty quickly off the bench. So
she's had a lot of minutes. We've had some times with Natalie in foul trouble
that she's had to go a little bit longer. So I think we definitely have played
a lot of minutes with Taya in the game.  
  
Q. Coach, how much does experience play in a role here? You've been here
four straight years. Maryland, the first time sincethey won the title in '06.
None of the players have been here. You've been through this. Is it going to
make a difference that you guys have been here before and if it is, what's the
biggest thing that is outside of the basketball game that Maryland has to deal
with?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think the distractions. I think that's the biggest thing you
have to deal with is so many distractions, so many people, the fans. You
really can't get out of the hotel without running into people.  
And I think for us, you know, it's more of a business trip. And we're enjoying
it and I think we've enjoyed all the moments that we've had this year, but I
think there's so many distractions today especially with the open practice,
autograph signings and all those things, that you need to make sure you're
focused on the task at hand.  
  
Q. You've had a lot of experience with replacing players and continuing to
have success with Skylar last year being the most recent one. Natalie is the
big story now. Anytime you go through that transitioning process, what's the
key to continuing to have a good program as opposed to just relying on one
specific player?  
COACH MCGRAW: We have really good players. Tay Reimer is McDonald's
All‑American, so it's a role she's comfortable being thrown into. And I think
giving them confidence, I think that's the coaching staff's job to give them
the confidence they need to go out and do it on the floor.  
We believe in them. And their teammates believe in them. And hopefully that
will kind of get rid of the jitters for them.  
  
Q. Coach, same thing I asked Kayla before. That first game I remember at
Maryland you were really upset with ‑‑ they were able to come back and such.
Does that sort of help you in a sense now that you've beat them by 20, a tight
game, you had to sort of pull it out, playing them again?  
COACH MCGRAW: It really does. Watching film, you get to see them at their
best. That's what you need. Going into a game like this, you want to see what
they do well. Alyssa Thomas was unstoppable. She was phenomenal in the second
half. She rebounded, she scored, she did everything she wanted to do. She
played like the All‑American that she is. We watched that and were able to see
a lot of things we did wrong.  
And I don't know that you can guard her. I think she's really, really
difficult to match up with. But at least we saw some of the problems that we
had and tried to fix them the last couple of days.  
  
Q. You sort of answered it just there, but seems like if possible Alyssa
Thomas has even taken her game to another level in this tournament. How
difficult is she to defend? What type of problems does her athleticism
bring?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think anytime you have somebody with her size and mobility‑‑
and she can have it in the open floor. She's great in the press offense. She
gets the ball and brings it up. She's just so hard to guard, because she plays
so hard. She's relentless. She just is diving for loose balls, attacking the
glass. She's doing everything that a coach could want a player to do.  
So it makes the matchup really hard. I think it has to be a team defense. I
mean, you really have to try to have an awareness where she is all the time.
And they're good enough you can't forget about anybody else, which makes it
even more difficult.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions?  
  
Q. How do you keep them focused on this being one game at a time instead of
the bigger picture? All season long it's one game, it's one game, but you're
sitting here 36 ‑0, two games away from a historical year?  
COACH MCGRAW: It's been easy. That's probably the easiest thing we've been
able to do this year is take it one game at a time. The seniors have done a
great job. The captains, the leaders they've done a great job making sure
nobody's looking ahead. They set the tone.  
I mean, we're in the Final Four. We've been here before. But we still know we
have a lot of work to do. So I think for us we know we can't get to a National
Championship until you win the first game. So I think it's really easy to stay
focused. I don't think there's any distraction there at all.  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to take a question from our junior journalism group
in the back.  
  
Q. What is your mindset for the game today?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, our mindset is really pretty similar to what it is
every game. We've got to take care of a certain amount of things, keys to the
game, rebounding, gotta find Thomas, get a blockout on her. Transition
defense. We're working on what we're going to do and how we're going to attack
them. We're trying not to get too involved in anything else outside of that
and really focusing on how we stop them.  
THE MODERATOR: One more from the journalism group.  
  
Q. How do your players maintain school and basketball?  
COACH MCGRAW: Being a student‑athlete is a difficult challenge. I think the
thing that you sacrifice is your social life. You have to put a lot of time
into studying when your friends are out doing some fun things because you've
been at practice all day.  
So it's difficult. I think it's definitely worth it. But you have to put a lot
of time in it and certainly being a student is the more important of the two.  
THE MODERATOR: Question over here on the side.  
  
Q. How do you plan on defending freshman Lexie Brown, does she pose any type
of problem for you?  
COACH MCGRAW: Lexie has improved since we played them last. In fact, I thought
our game was her coming out party. She really played well down the stretch in
that game and since then has played extremely well. So much poise in the
Louisville game, making big free throws and shots down the stretch.  
She's a very, very talented player. All rookie team in the ACC, which is
difficult to do in our league when we have so many talented freshmen. And she
presents a lot of problems for us. She's somebody that we really have to be
aware of.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions? Thank you, Coach.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Maryland, head coach Brenda Frese and
student‑athletes Alyssa Thomas, Lexie Brown, and Katie Rutan. Opening with a
brief statement from Coach Frese then questions for student‑athletes.  
COACH FRESE: Obviously it feels really, really good to be back here in the
Final Four. This is something that everyone aspires to achieve, and personally
it's been such a phenomenal year when you talk about our son Tyler receiving
his last dose of chemotherapy and then being able to reach the Final Four with
our team. So it's a special year for all of us.  
I love the fact that we're the underdog. The team really flying under the
radar. I feel like it's been a solid year for us. We missed a few chances to
be able to get some big wins, and I think that's kind of when people forgot
about us as a team.  
But it's okay, obviously, for us. I felt like it was time for us to be able to
grow and develop as a team. When you talk about bringing 14 players, three
freshmen into a pretty large roster with five seniors, but now we get to share
some of our stories in terms of who we are.  
When the bracket came out, I thought we had a chance. I didn't really feel
like there was anybody that we were overmatched against. But that being said,
to be able to beat Texas, the No. 1 seed in Tennessee and Louisville, in front
of 15,000 fans on their home court, is something for us to be really, really
proud about.  
To some extent, I feel like Maryland and Stanford are the extras at the Miss
U.S.A. pageant. Everybody's rooting for the other two. Our job is to be able
to crash the party.  
I have all the respect, obviously, for Muffet McGraw and her staff and Notre
Dame. About two or three years ago Muffet and I were out on the recruiting
trail and she asked me to sit down and we had dinner together at the Cracker
Barrel. She also had my mentor. Bill Finley from Ohio State is somebody who
worked for her. So some great ties and relationships being together.  
Notre Dame has the best 1‑2 punch in the country when you talk about Loyd and
McBride. They've been devastating all season. No one's been able to stop them,
including us. Loyd and McBride had really big games against us. McBride hit
some really big shots in crunch time, very similar reminder in terms of what
Kristi Toliver used to be able to do for us.  
We're going to try to do what nobody else has been able to do this year. We
want to try to slow Notre Dame's attack down. Lastly, it feels great to be
here with our team and it feels amazing to be able to bring a team to the
Final Four. I like if we wouldn't have been able to do that, I think
personally I would have felt regrets as a coach not being able to get her
here. She's a phenomenal person, even a better family when you talk about her
parents, and she deserves every single moment of this.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes. Address your questions to
specific athletes.  
  
Q. Alyssa, so you heard what your coach said about sort of feeling like
extras. Is that actually motivation for you knowing that the way that the
season is set up, that so many people are imagining the possibility of two
undefeated teams playing in the National Championship?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: It is. I mean, that's what everybody expects, is for them to be
undefeated and to meet up with each other.  
But I mean, we're here to crash the party. And I know Stanford is too. I
talked to Chiney, and we're here to crash the party.  
  
Q. Alyssa, what do you remember about the first meeting with Notre Dame? I
know it was way back at the end of January, but what do you remember about
that game?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: We did not come out to a good start. Spotted them 22 points.
Once we settled down, we were able to get back into the game. But they had
already gotten hot. So it was hard to slow their big 2 down.  
  
Q. Alyssa, what does it mean that you're finally here now and you've been
before for WBCS stuff, but what's it like playing in the game tomorrow?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: I think the biggest thing is to experience this for my
teammates. I've been saying it for the longest time. I just want them to be
here with me. I'm really excited that finally get to be on the playing side of
the Final Four.  
  
Q. Katie, as a senior, now that you're finally here in Nashville, is it
still surreal for you, or are you letting it settle in now that you're going
to be playing the Final Four tomorrow?  
KATIE RUTAN: The opening days are really surreal, after the win. But you can't
think like that now. It's time to get down to business. And so the happiness
is over and it's time to lock in.  
  
Q. Lexie, I just wanted to ask you, your confidence level. I know that
freshmen season and all that, compared to the first time that you played these
guys and the challenge of their guards.  
LEXIE BROWN: Our confidence, and my personal confidence, is sky high right
now. We've come off two great wins as a team. I just think all together as a
team, we're stronger, we're mentally stronger, we're physically stronger, and
we have a lot of confidence going into tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. Alyssa, they said that no team ‑‑ no player in the country means more to
their team than you do. Is that a lot of pressure for you? Or talk a little
bit about that.   
ALYSSA THOMAS: Not at all. I think I'm just a player on the team. We have
plenty of people that can score on our team. I think we've proved it
throughout this tournament that it's not just all about me.  
We have a ton of other players. Lexie can score for us. Shatori. We're a
well‑rounded team.  
  
Q. Alyssa, how is this team better today than it was after the ACC
tournament?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: Well, we had the two weeks to refocus ourselves and get
ourselves back on track. And we're peaking at the right time. We're playing
our best basketball when it matters, and this is what people are going to
remember.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for the student‑athletes? One more here.  
  
Q. Lexie, what's been the biggest challenge being a freshman point guard and
acclimating yourself to a team and heading to the Final Four?  
LEXIE BROWN: I would definitely have to say the mental part of the game. As a
point guard, you have to keep your poise the entire game. And at the beginning
that was very tough for me to do. But as the season progressed, I met a lot
with Coach B, and my teammates have really helped me with that. And I think
when you have your poise, really nothing can go wrong in the game because
you're there mentally.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions? Okay. We'll dismiss the student‑athletes
back to the locker room. I do want to take the time to introduce the Maryland
SID Rose De Paula, if there's anything more you need from Maryland. And we'll
begin with questions for Head Coach Brenda Frese. Start right back here.  
  
Q. Brenda, when you go to a Final Four and you win a National Championship,
does any part of your delude yourself into thinking it's not as hard as you
thought and you don't come back and you realize it's much harder to get back
here than you thought it would be?  
COACH FRESE: No question. You know, I mean, when you think about it, I was so
young your first time going through it. And you march through in six games and
win the title.  
And then you realize, you know, after the fact in terms of just how much more
difficult it is, being able to be lined up at the right time, have the right
bracket, have the right possessions go your way, being completely healthy
throughout the run.  
  
Q. Brenda, who picked up the check between you and Muffet at the Cracker
Barrel?  
COACH FRESE: Funny you asked, because I was trying to remember that when I had
the memory. We might have each picked up our own. But it was one of those
moments that, when I walked into the Cracker Barrel, she was in front of me,
asked if I wanted to dine with her, at her request first. So I just remember
at that time just appreciating that's what it's about in women's basketball
and as coaches in terms of our bond with each other in the profession. It was
in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and it was a break in between the AAU games, so we
both decided to go get something to eat at the Cracker Barrel.  
  
Q. Coach, you know, you talk about their big 2. When they have a shooter
like Michaela Mabrey, how do you defend those two and still keep Mabrey from
hurting you badly on the perimeter like that?  
COACH FRESE: You know, it's difficult. Mabrey, you know, was phenomenal the
first time that we played. So now you have to keep in check. I really feel
like all their guards, all their guards are extremely talented.  
So there's not many teams like Notre Dame that can score the first time they
look at the basket. Oftentimes, in women's basketball, you need to get a
couple more chances, maybe an offensive rebound putback, but Notre Dame is so
efficient in terms of their first look, it normally goes in.  
  
Q. That game against Notre Dame was sandwiched in between two road losses,
Virginia, NC State. I wonder if you can speak to the evolution of the team
particularly on the road and how you've been able to handle hostile
environments a lot better.  
COACH FRESE: It was a difficult stretch for us when you talk about the
conference play and two road games and then undefeated Notre Dame coming in
and really finding ourselves as a unit, when you talk about your second, third
and fourth leading scorers being freshmen and really kind of introducing them
to those elements, road games, and then an undefeated team coming in.  
So we were really green. We were really raw. We were going through
experiences. So I think it was critical for us as a coaching staff not to get
too low in that moment to have kind of perspective that we were going to grow
from those experiences, which now, to be able to go into Louisville, again
probably ranks up as my all‑time top two favorite games to coach in.  
We wouldn't have been able to win that game in January as a team. And you can
see how far the physical and mental toughness has really come.  
  
Q. You said you're really happy to play that underdog role. But after
Natalie Achonwa got hurt, was out for the season, Notre Dame says, we're the
underdog. Almost like hot potato. Why does everybody ‑‑  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, yeah, Notre Dame can't play that card. They've been to four
straight Final Fours. You're not an underdog. You still have a roster that‑‑
it's unfortunate, we all go through injuries. We did especially last year.
It's a terrible part of the game.  
But when you have the best 1‑2 punch in the country, two of the best
All‑Americans, the top 10, the depth in the roster, the All‑Americans that
they have, they by far still had the experience. Everyone's still picking
them, so there's no way they can be the underdog. They can try.  
  
Q. Brenda, two questions. First one is, when you played them the first time,
I think Achonwa was in foul trouble, so she didn't play as much. Did that help
you prepare, not knowing what they were going to do without her, that you sort
of saw that, at least on film a little bit? The second one is, can you
compare, if there's any comparison, this year's run to the one in 2006?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah. Yes and no in terms of, yes, it allows you to kind of see
what they went to, Notre Dame, when Natalie was in foul trouble. But we still
didn't win that game. So we have to be better in terms of who we are as a
team, because she didn't play a lot in that game.  
So it does make it extremely difficult in terms of getting the preparation.
The comparison between the two teams, you know, I think one of the big ones is
we're being led by freshman point guard when you talk about between Lexie and
Katie.  
But the teams were definitely different. They were built differently when you
talk about the'06 team having five players averaging double figures. This team
had AT, Lexie and Shatori at times. And on any given night, nobody knows who
consistently or where we're going to get our scoring from.  
This team is by far probably a better defensive team than'06. But both teams
are probably consistently really dominant rebounding teams.  
THE MODERATOR: Question down here.  
  
Q. You just mentioned rebounding physically. Wondering, especially with
Natalie out for them, is that an area that you'd like to try to take advantage
of on the boards?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, we‑‑ absolutely. That's something that we've been really,
really strong at. But I really think our defense is going to be more critical
than our rebounding because like I said earlier, Notre Dame doesn't need
second‑chance opportunities. When they get clean looks at the basket, they're
able to put it down. So then rebounding really doesn't matter.  
It really comes down to us defensively being‑‑ having to make them have to
take difficult shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. You talked a lot about the development of your team over the course of
the season, some of the young players. I'm wondering if you can address
specifically how Lexie's progress has gotten you to where you are now as a
team.  
COACH FRESE: Well, first, I can remember the conversation I had with her in
the summertime. She was having a hard time adjusting, and when we started the
fall semester really talking about where things were going to need to go in
terms of to be ready to lead this team to a Final Four.  
And so for Lexie, and you talk about our other two freshmen, there's so much
thrown at you your freshman year, and then for Lexie to be the starting point
guard on a team that has three senior starters, five seniors on the team, that
takes time for a freshman to get comfortable. And Lexie's somebody that has to
be comfortable to be confident.  
So it took a while obviously for her to get that comfort for us, to grow with
the team and really understand one another. But Lexie's playing some of her
best basketball right now and couldn't have come at a better time.  
THE MODERATOR: Question back here.  
  
Q. Brenda, good to see you. Sorry if people already answered this question,
but have you talked to the girls about what the experience is like back in
2006 to sort of prepare them, and do they sort of get it?  
COACH FRESE: You know, I have. Anytime I can lend experience on situations to
protect our team, I'm going to. And so, yes, throughout this entire
tournament, you know, I've been able to be able to do that.  
What's the second part of your question?  
  
Q. That was it. Just if you shared any experience with them and do they get
it.  
COACH FRESE: They really do get it in the fact that when you have five seniors
on a roster, you know, they get it and then they're able to pass it down to
your younger players.  
  
Q. Is there any one thing that you tell them that they just can't imagine
until they get here? Is it all the media? Is it the fans? Is it the different
location? Is there one thing?  
COACH FRESE: The big thing is the distractions and being able to lock in.
Because everyone wants a piece of you. Everyone wants tickets. And there's a
lot of media requests.  
So just really trying to find that balance and being able to eliminate those
distractions.  
Q. First meeting with Notre Dame, the middle of the game when you overcame
the 22 ‑point deficit, what did you do well during that stretch?  
COACH FRESE: We defended. We went to our press. We were able to get stops that
led to our transition.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? We'll take one right here.  
  
Q. Brenda, philosophically, how do you look at matching up with a team that
you played before as opposed to a team that hasn't seen you? I imagine there
are advantages and disadvantages, but both teams obviously know each other.
You have film on each other. How do you look at that philosophy?  
COACH FRESE: I love it. One, I liken it to'06 when we got to play in North
Carolina and Duke and opponents we played over and over. I think it gives your
team a great comfort level so you don't spend the first 10 or 15 minutes
feeling out a team you've never played.  
But I'm sure both teams feel that way. So now you have to kind of figure out
what's going to be the difference in a game that could come down to
possessions, you know, it's critical in terms of your play calls, your
defenses, your strategy. How can you kind of separate yourself within some
possessions.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for Coach Frese?  
Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 5, 2014

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Stefanie Dolson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21811)

### [Bria Hartley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21837)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from Connecticut student‑athletes
Stefanie Dolson Bria Hartley and head coach Geno Auriemma. We'll begin with a
brief statement from Coach Auriemma and then we'll take questions for the
student‑athletes.  
COACH AURIEMMA: It's one of those things that you try to figure out something
different to say every time you come up here, and it always comes back to the
same things.  
Just two games left in the season. There's four teams left. Trying to play on
Sunday and Tuesday and for us to be one of those four teams is obviously the
goal every year.  
And Bria and Stefanie fortunate enough to be here four years in a row and
that's pretty special for the two of them and I want to make sure that we, as
coaches and players, do everything that we can to make sure that this weekend
goes the way it deserves to go for these two. So that's kind of my focus this
weekend.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll take questions for the student‑athletes,
first, please. Raise your hands and state your name and affiliation and
address the specific student‑athlete. Anything for the student‑athletes? We'll
take one right here.  
  
Q. Stefanie, I'm curious, after watching film what do you think the best way
to defend Chiney on the interior?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: I think for us, we don't ever look at how to defend a certain
person. We're really looking at the whole team. We're making sure we're
concentrating on making everything they do difficult, making sure every shot
they take is a tough shot. We rebound the ball because obviously Chiney is an
extremely good rebounder. We have to take away her strengths and their team's
strength and worry about executing on offense and defense.  
  
Q. For both of you, does it ever get old? This is your fourth trip. Is it
more anticipation, excitement, or pressure to finish this off sort the UConn
way?  
BRIA HARTLEY: I think anytime you're able to compete for a National
Championship or make it to the last four teams, it's a lot of excitement. I
think we've worked hard all year. And we want to get to this moment. So I
think we're all excited. We're eager to go out there and play. So we're going
to make sure we have lots of energy and lots of intensity when we step on that
court.  
STEFANIE DOLSON: Yeah, it definitely doesn't get old. Like Coach said, we're
fortunate to be able to be here four years in a row. It's something that we
have never taken for granted. And like Bria said, we're excited to be here and
excited to get out and play. The first two days of being here is kind of all
the media stuff, the fun stuff.  
But we've gotta get down to business, and we're just excited for the game
tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student‑athletes? Down here.  
  
Q. Stefanie, everybody probably in this audience and basketball fans are
talking about UConn/Notre Dame battle of the blah, blah, blah. How do you tune
that out when you've done so much, won by 35 points a game?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: It's pretty easy. We just don't pay attention to it.
Obviously like you said, there's a lot of hype between the whole two
undefeated teams going into the Final Four and the National Championship game,
but for us, we don't think about that. We take it game by game. We always
have. It's something we emphasize during the season. And we go into the
tournament the same way. We're just looking forward to the Stanford game right
now, preparing for that, and not really focusing on what's going on around us.  
  
Q. For both Bria and Stefanie. How would you say that Stanford has improved
since the last time you saw them? And how do you think your team has improved
since that second game of the season?  
THE MODERATOR: Do you want to take it first, Bria?  
BRIA HARTLEY: I think both teams have improved a lot. When we played them, it
was so early in the season. So there's a bunch of things that the team really
needs to improve on. And you look at their 3‑point shooters, they have really
good guards. They're really good at attacking and getting in the paint. I
mean, you have All‑American post player in Chiney, and she's able to create
for her team. They've improved in running their offense and everyone's a lot
more in sync. For us, it's the same thing.  
We've been running around offensively playing together for a few months now,
so everything's a lot more crisp. And when we go out there, we have to make
sure it's going to be who comes out there, executes each play better. And at
this point in the season everyone has to step up. And this is when great
players make great plays. So it's going to be really tough competition out
there.  
STEFANIE DOLSON: She said it all. Both teams have definitely gotten better. I
think at the beginning of the season, you're finding your identity as a team.
I think both teams are at that point. I think just each team has had
individuals who have just gotten better as the year's gone on.  
Like Bri said, it's going to come down to executing offense and defense better
and then just outworking the other team. Obviously it's Final Four game. No
one wants to lose.  
I think both teams are going to go in there ready to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Question over on this side.  
  
Q. Stefanie, what was it about last year's run in the tournament that maybe
springboarded this team to how good you guys have done this year?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: I'd say Breanna Stewart was a big part of that, obviously.
She had a tough year last year, then just made an incredible run for the NCAA
Tournament last year. And I think with her and Bria kind of gaining more
confidence, just getting better throughout this summer. Having the two of them
coming into this year just started us off better, and I don't know. Just set
the tone for the year.  
From there on out everybody got better individually. We picked each other up
as the year went on. Our chemistry grew stronger and stronger as we played
more together. And we're at the point that we are now where I think we just
play extremely well together.  
THE MODERATOR: Time for one more question for the student‑athletes. Back here.
Sorry. Over here.  
  
Q. Bria, I want to give you a chance to brag on Stef a little bit here. Can
you tell me, as you look at Notre Dame, what they're going through right now,
missing Achonwa, is it unfathomable to think about what it would be like to be
here without Stefanie and what she's meant to this team and this run?  
BRIA HARTLEY: Absolutely. Stef does so much for our team. Our offense runs a
lot better when she's out there on the floor for us. When we're in the offense
and she's in the middle, she sees a lot of things. She's a great playmaker,
and I think sometimes people always pay attention to her posting up and her
presence in the post, but the way she's able to pass the ball and screen
really creates offense for other players.  
I mean, it's hard to find that. And I think we always say how Stef's the best
screener on the team. People don't always pay attention to that, but that's a
big part of your team and that helps get a lot of your teammates open. And
there's so many things she does that go unnoticed. She knows that we notice it
and we really appreciate everything she's done for us.  
STEFANIE DOLSON: They definitely notice it. They tell me. They're great
teammates.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll dismiss them back to the locker room.
They'll be available until 3:20. Continue with questions for Coach Auriemma.  
  
Q. I think you talked during the teleconference about being able to win
games in a number of different ways. Curious, where does the team defense for
this team rank in those factors?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I thought last year we had one of the best defenders in
the country in Kelly Faris, and we were able to do a lot of things with her.
We don't have anybody like that this year. So it's had to be more of a
team‑oriented thing.  
And everyone‑‑ everyone on our team knows that we can't afford to make a lot
of mistakes on the defensive end. We can't get ourselves in foul trouble. We
can't give up easy buckets. So I think Kelly graduating and the fact that we
know we don't have anybody like that has made us a really, really good
defensive team.  
People have a hard time scoring against us, generally speaking. We block a lot
of shots. The best way to keep people from scoring is don't let the ball ever
get to the rim. If the ball gets to the rim, it's got a 50/50 shot going in.
Right? If it never gets to the rim, that's pretty good defense. That's been a
big part of our defense this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Question from Michel.  
  
Q. Geno, you and Stanford have played a lot over the past three years. What
are the two or three things that you know are either going to happen or you
are going to have to do when you go up against Tara and their staff?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, they're going to be really well prepared. They're going
to have a game plan. And you'll be able to tell right away what their plan is.
And you've got to be able to make the adjustments if you can. If you can't,
then you're going to be in big trouble.  
You also know that, same as it was when they had Neka, that Chiney is going to
be a huge factor around the basket on both ends of the floor, offense and
defense. And I don't know that there's anybody in the country individually
that can guard her.  
So you know you're going to have to deal with that somehow or another. And
they're going to take a ton of 3s. That's always been the case and that will
be the case on Sunday. And how well we're able to defend that is going to go a
long way towards who wins the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Question here from Richard.  
  
Q. Geno, understanding that it's very hard to compare teams of different
years and players, Kelly has obviously graduated, but where is this team at
this point of the year heading into the semifinal game versus where last
year's team was heading into the same point, the semifinal game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think mentally for whatever reason, we didn't have any
reason to be, but we came in last year mentally in a pretty good place. We
didn't win the regular season, the Big East. We didn't win the Big East
championship tournament. And yet I think we came into the Final Four expecting
to win, even though I don't think anybody else expected us to win.  
This year, there's been so much hype surrounding the team because of what
happened in last year's tournament and we're undefeated. I don't know that
we're in the same place, because you can't be, you know. But I think this
team, for whatever it's worth, I don't know what it's going to be tomorrow,
but the team's a lot more confident and sure of itself than last year's team,
last year I think we were determined but there was still a little bit of
doubt. And I get the feeling from this particular team that there isn't any
doubt in their mind that we're the best team here.  
Whether or not that plays out, I don't know. But right now, that's the mindset
that I see.  
THE MODERATOR: Question back there.  
  
Q. After two slow starts in Lincoln last week, have you placed any extra
emphasis on starting strong tomorrow night?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. I'm probably going to have to mention that in the
pregame speech. Let's start strong. I guess last week saying let's start
[Bleep] didn't work too well.  
I don't think we, coaches, fans, everybody, I don't think we realized how hard
it is to make shots in the Sweet 16 and the Final Four. Every time the ball
leaves your hand, it's not the same as playing in January and February. And if
you don't make the first couple, it gets even harder to make them.  
And especially when you're used to making them and all of a sudden you shoot
the ball poorly like we did, both of those games in the beginning, it starts
to become contagious.  
I'm a huge baseball fan. And guy throws a no‑hitter for three or four innings,
going to be hard to get any hits the next four or five innings. And shooting's
the same way. Start the game. Couple guys knock in a couple of 3s right away,
get up 10‑0 and everybody thinks the basket is as big as the ocean.  
So last time we played Stanford in November, I think the score was 2‑2 the
first seven minutes of the game. So I'm going to tell them before the game
starts.  
  
Q. Geno, after the beginning of the season, your conference is a little bit
down. The only really tough team you had was Louisville several times. Next
year it's going to be Louisville and Rutgers going. It could be an even easier
conference. Are you at all concerned that ‑‑ obviously this team has gained a
lot of confidence from it, but is there an opposite side of that that they
don't really know what it's like to be challenged when they come to a
situation like this?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't believe that that's the case this year. I can't speak
for what might happen next year. But the three teams that are here besides us,
we beat Maryland at Maryland and we beat Stanford at home. And we beat Texas
A&M. And we won at Duke. And we beat Louisville three times. And we won at
Baylor. And we won at Penn State.  
I think this team thinks they can win anywhere, anytime against anybody. Next
year, I don't know. But we've been in this situation before. Remember in 1995,
before the Big East really became the best basketball conference in the
country, that year, two teams from the Big East went to the NCAA Tournament.
Two out of, I want to say, nine or ten, maybe 12. I'm not sure how many were
in the league back then. 12. So I think we had two teams go in 1995. That's
how bad the league was.  
And we were undefeated, won the National Championship. All we heard was we
were the bet. Stanford played in the Pac‑12\. Tennessee was there. Georgia was
there. And how tough the Southeast Conference was and how tough the Pac‑12 was
and how every league in the country's great and we played in the Big East,
that's what they called it. We beat Stanford by 30 in the semifinals and then
we beat Tennessee for a National Championship.  
So if you have the right kind of players and you prepare properly, I don't
know. I have a lot of respect for everybody. But I respect certain teams. I
don't respect conferences. A lot of teams playing in big time conferences that
haven't won a damn thing in their careers. So I'd rather be in our conference
and win them all instead of being in another conference.  
THE MODERATOR: Time for a couple more. We'll take one right here. Michel.  
  
Q. Geno, Brenda said that Stanford and Maryland might be like extras in the
Miss America competition. Tara at one point this week I think said maybe they
feel they're a little bit like the JV team. If they're feeling that way, does
that ‑‑ and they're motivated by that, do you think that that ends up being
relevant at all in anything that happens tomorrow?  
COACH AURIEMMA: No. I really don't. At this time of year, the teams that play
the best basketball are the teams that are going to win. And whatever
motivation you want to use only works if the other team doesn't play well. So
if we play poorly against Stanford and Stanford plays well and they win, it
won't be because they were motivated by being a JV team. It will be just
because they played better. And the same goes for Maryland.  
There's an awful lot of emotion on every team going into the weekend. But
after about five, six, seven minutes, maybe, all those things go away and it's
just play basketball. All four teams are capable of winning a National
Championship. That's the beauty of the Final Four. You don't have to win three
out of five. You don't have to win four out of seven. Not best out of three.
All you gotta do is play really well two nights and you can win a National
Championship. And all four teams that are here are capable of doing that
because they've already done that.  
So I don't think they should feel like they're a JV team. I don't think they
should‑‑ anybody should feel like they're the extras at the Miss America
pageant. I've never won any pageants.  
  
Q. Coach, somebody just looked at the box scores and your team seems
automatic this year, but I know you guys aren't robots. From your close
vantage point to the team, could you explain the humanity of you guys or
something like that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We have five starters that are really good offensive players.
But they all have their weaknesses. All five of them. They're not superhuman.
They're not infallible.  
If we had enough time and I was inclined to do that, I would list five things
about each five starters that I hate that I wish I could fix between now and
tomorrow night.  
The key is you're not going to know what they are and neither is the other
team because we're going to try to hide it as best we can. But we all have
them. We all have them.  
What we're good at, we're really good at. Really, really good at it. What
we're not good at is we try to pretend like we are because we don't want you
to see it. And that's kind of our philosophy. Let's just be really great at
what we're really good at and hope they don't find out what we're bad at.  
THE MODERATOR: Question in the back.  
  
Q. Coach, when you get to UConn, no tradition. Haven't been winning. Not
exactly in a metropolis. How did you sell ‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: It is now. We have more stores than just one store. It used to
be called store. Lou Holtz's great line. Used to be called store. Then they
opened another one. Now it's called Storrs.  
  
Q. How did you sell the kids on you and the belief that you can do something
great here with this program?  
COACH AURIEMMA: In the beginning, greatness had nothing to do with it. There
was no such thing as talking about being great back in the early
years,'85,'86,'87. So what we did was we identified who were the next level
players that the schools that we were trying to beat down the road were not
going to recruit. So from an area of let's say Boston to Pittsburgh to
Washington DC, we had tried to identify in that area who were the best players
that are not going to be recruited by the best schools in basketball, who are
the next level down. Maybe two levels down.  
Let's go recruit those guys. Let's convince them that they can come here and
be part of something, and a bunch of them bought it. And then when they got
there, you know, we coached them pretty good.  
They got a little bit better. We started winning a couple of games. And then
we started getting a little bit better player. And then when we won a National
Championship in 1995, I thought, you know, we only have two kids on our team
that were recruited by everybody. Rebecca Lobo and Nykesha Sales. Everybody
else was like, those other kids we could go undefeated, win a National
Championship with two players on our team that a lot of schools wanted. We
start getting a bunch of those guys, we're going to be really good. That's
when we started talking about being great.  
But by that time we had already built a pretty good program so it wasn't hard
to convince them to play there.  
But in the beginning we could never get great players to come play at
Connecticut. That would have just been impossible. As a matter of fact, when I
got the job at Connecticut. There was a kid playing in Boston called Tonya
Kardoza, and she was one of the best players in the country. I was recruiting
her when I was at Virginia. But when I took the Connecticut job, I didn't
recruit her, because why waste my time recruiting her? She's not going to come
to Connecticut. Eventually she came, ten years later, as an assistant coach,
but we didn't waste time recruiting kids we knew we couldn't get.  
Now, we haven't changed that much. We still don't waste time trying to recruit
kids we know we can't get. So a little bit has changed but not a whole lot.
And Storrs has changed. The university has changed. It's 1985, there's
absolutely no comparison between the school, the basketball program,
everything. It's like night and day. It's like night and day.  
THE MODERATOR: That's all the time we have. Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2014

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good afternoon, and welcome to today's Women's Final Four head
coaches media teleconference. For the next several minutes you'll have the
opportunity to visit with the head coach of the Stanford Cardinal, Tara
VanDerveer. Stanford is playing in its 12th Women's Final Four and pursuing a
third championship. At this time I'll ask Tara to provide an opening
statement, and then we'll give you directions on how to get into cue.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Good afternoon. We're very excited to be invited to the
Final Four and playing in Nashville. Our team had, I think, one of our best
weekends beating Penn State, and NorthCarolina we're playing very well.
Everyone's healthy and ready to go.  
  
Q. Last night you kind of mentioned a bit about this seemingly inevitability
that everyone seems to be expecting UCONN and Notre Dame in the final. But are
you looking forward to the chance of the rematch of the game? It was your
third game back in November, when you went to stores and had a chance to do
what so many people thought was unexpected and advance yourself instead of
UCONN?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, first of all, we're very excited to be going to the
Final Four, and you know that you can play great competition, and Connecticut
has a great team. I'm really glad that we did play them early in the season,
and I feel like our team is playing with a lot of confidence. We're looking
forward to the rematch. You know, just I think people, players in the
tournament just kind of resent a little bit of the inevitability. Like why
have the tournament if it's inevitable? So we're just‑‑ we definitely want to
be party crashers.  
  
Q. What do you think the mindset of your seniors will be going into this
tournament? Do you think it's different for them? Obviously, Mikaela's been on
the roster for a couple of these, and Chiney for a couple. Is it different for
them when they come in for the last time?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think it is. I think that seniors definitely feel a
different sense of urgency. You know, I think you saw that last night with how
much it meant to Mikaela and how well she played. Obviously, Chiney's been
playing just incredibly well all season long. But between Sara James and
Chiney and Mikaela, I think that we have great leadership with our seniors.
They're going into it, I think, with like really two good things in their
mind. First of all, they've been there before, so they know what to expect.
And we didn't go last year I think people are very hungry.  
  
Q. I was wondering, I'm curious as to what your philosophy is about getting
your players to give you optimal performance during a game and to fight for
every loose ball and do what you need them to do to battle through games? What
is the secret in convincing your team to give you what you need?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I don't feel like it's them giving me anything. I feel
that we kind of try to set up practices and conditioning to make the games in
some ways easier and fun. So during the game, because they have trained hard
and practiced hard and been drilled in situations, the games are almost like
taking a final that you're really ready for. You're excited to do well. So
they're not doing it for me, they're proving things for themselves.  
  
Q. We suspect here in Connecticut that Chiney will be moving east in a
couple of weeks when the WNBA draft commences. Just a quick evaluation of her
professional readiness?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that the pro fans are in for a really special treat.
She's an outstanding‑‑ you know, Connecticut has obviously with the teams that
are in Connecticut, they have a great appreciation for quality basketball, and
they know the real thing when they see it, and Chiney is the real deal.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how much Chiney has grown through the years and in
particular this season how much she's come along?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think that really the biggest change kind of
happened last year when without Nneka, Chiney became our go‑to player. And I
think Chiney is just an exceptional young lady. She plays on a team that
without Chiney we're maybe, I'm going to say, an average team; with Chiney,
we're in the Final Four. She is a builder, an encourager, a leader. You know,
sometimes you might have a great player who almost looks down on their
teammates or in some ways she is by far the best player on our team. And she
is so humble. Her leadership, just her demeanor is something that's really a
joy to be around and a joy to coach.  
  
Q. All teams celebrate differently. Three of the four teams that won in the
regionals cut down the nets, and UCONN didn't. I just wonder what went into
your reasoning to cut it down? You just wanted the kids to celebrate that
moment?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think it's really special going to the Final Four. You
know, in a tournament whether it's a regional tournament or even your
conference tournament, it's a really special thing. I do think we were
celebrating. Different teams choose how they're going to do it. We definitely
were net cutters, and we were excited about it last night.  
  
Q. The game that you played against UCONN was back in November, and so much
about both teams has obviously changed. That was a home game for them, but the
19 ‑point loss for you. So when you're looking at the tape or even evaluating
and thinking about this upcoming match‑up, where can you find those 19 points?
  
COACH VANDERVEER: Like you said, it was so early. At that point we didn't
have‑‑ Bonnie was just back. We didn't have our quote "three spot" the way we
do now. We played Kailee who was totally playing out of position there. Lili
wasn't a starter at that point. So I think the biggest thing is our freshmen
have really developed a lot since then.  
We didn't really know who was going to be in our rotation. We were looking at
a lot of players at that point and I feel like I understand our personnel a
lot better. It's a tough way to start. Our team knew that, and I think that
coming back from‑‑ it was a great way to start for us to kind of be able to
benefit from playing again. Connecticut, they were clearly better than we were
then. Our goal from then on was to put ourselves in position where we would
improve a lot, and I think that we have. We've lost some games and we've
improved because of our losses, including that loss.  
  
Q. Just one follow ‑up just looking at the box score and seeing Bria
Hartley's efficiency, 9 of 13 for that game. Lot of rebounds for a guard, a
lot of assists. I didn't see the game, but from the box score you could tell
that she had an incredibly efficient game. What was it that you remember from
her play that allowed her to have the kind of game she did against you?   
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, our transition defense was horrible, and that is
something that I think when you play Connecticut. And Bria Hartley is an
open‑court player, and she's an outstanding player. She got the ball in
transition, and I was going to the basket like hot knife through butter. I
mean, she really took it right at us. That is something that in order to have
any chance, we have to do a better job with our transition defense.  
  
Q. Just wanted to ask, yesterday there was a lot of buzz with Tyler Summitt
being named head coach of Louisiana Tech at 23. I know you became a head coach
at a very young age also. So what was it like for you coaching at such a young
age? I believe you were 25, correct?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Right. Honestly, I think times were very different then.
There were a lot of people kind of my generation whether it was Theresa
Grentz, Marianne Stanley, Rene Portland, women's basketball was in its
infancy. So who do you turn to for coaches and you're not going to pay
anything?  
So at that point I really had minimal experience, but I was an assistant coach
for two years. I had been at Indiana. I had really, I think, been working hard
to become a coach. But I can't even look back at it. I can't even believe I
was a head coach when I was that young. It's just so many kind of things that
I guess you just don't know when you're that young. Kind of the opportunity to
get experience of working in a great program is what young people have now for
the most part. It's very different.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2014

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good afternoon, and welcome to today's Women's Final Four head
coaches' media teleconference. For the next several minutes you'll have an
opportunity to visit with the head coach of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish,
Muffet McGraw. Notre Dame will be playing in its sixth Women's Final Four in
2014 competing for its second NCAA national championship. At this time I'll
bring in Coach McGraw to provide an opening statement.  
MUFFET McGRAW: We're really excited to be heading back to the Final Four. At
the beginning of the season, losing Skylar Diggins, I don't think anybody had
us advancing this far, and certainly there were a lot question marks for us,
but Kayla McBride, Jewell Loyd, Natalie Achonwa have had fantastic seasons,
and we're just excited now about continuing on our journey and really thrilled
that the ACC has two teams, and would have been great to have three, but nice
to have two.  
  
Q. I'm curious, how do you approach this week with Taya Reimer, and also how
do you kind of assess her play up to this point, her freshman season?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think Taya has had a very good year. I think that she would
be a starter for most other programs in the country, and she was able to come
off the bench and learn a lot through Natalie Achonwa and Ariel Braker and she
is ready for this opportunity. I think she's been waiting for this opportunity
all season long to break into the starting lineup, and she certainly is
talented enough and has a great skill set.  
  
Q. Does it provide you any solace that when you played Maryland the last
time because Natalie had a lot of foul trouble that she had a relatively for
her had an unproductive game and yet you were still able to beat them, and
without Natalie out there, what bigger challenges does Alyssa Thomas
present?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, we did look at that. We looked at the stats. We
watched the game film and we noticed that Natalie's minutes in the game, I
mean, she played about half the game, and so we were able to get a good look
at what the team is like without her in there, and that helped us a little
bit.  
But it does present some problems when you lose your best rebounder against a
team like Maryland, who is just big and terrific on the boards, and a player
like Alyssa Thomas, it creates a little bit of‑‑ a couple more problems for
us.  
  
Q. I was wondering whether you thought the key was to motivating your team
to perform at its highest level for as long as you need them to? What does a
coach need to do? What do they need to say? What's been your method to success
in getting your players to give you maximum effort?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, I think our players are very self‑motivated. Our seniors
and our captains have done a great job in the locker room getting them ready
for practice every day, getting them to look at the next game, and never
looking ahead. I think we've trained them in that way over the years. I think
it's been passed down from leader to leader. But we really don't have to do
anything to motivate this group. They're competitive. They want to win, and
they've been a very easy group to lead.  
  
Q. Just to follow that up, what was the ‑‑ I imagine it was very difficult
for them in the locker room after Natalie got hurt, just the camaraderie that
they build among teammates and what she's contributed to the team. Was there a
mourning period and how long did it last?   
MUFFET McGRAW: Natalie Achonwa sets the tone for our team in everything that
we do. She's been the vocal leader for our team. When she went down on the
floor and before she even left for the locker room, she bounced back up and
went after the team and really gave them a very spirited talk and
encouragement to finish that game. I think she set the tone right then. She
came back onto the bench, she got up and cut down the nets, and she proved to
them it's not about her, it's about the team. We talked about it in the locker
room yesterday. There were no tears, there was no mourning. We are ready to
move on, and Natalie is going to be on the sidelines doing everything she can
do to help us win.  
  
Q. With this being a rematch, the fact that Maryland was able to kind of
come back after you all had such a big lead and made it so close at the end,
does that maybe help you as you get your team refocused on the challenges of
this game on Sunday?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I would rather they didn't come back at all. You know, I think
that they're a really good team, and they've gotten a lot better since that
game. In fact, I would say that may have been the turning point of the season
for Lexie Brown. I think she's really come into her own since that game. I
think that really was kind of a catalyst for her to continue to improve.  
It's great to be able to watch the film and see how good they look because
they looked really good, and Alyssa Thomas in particular looked really good in
the second half of that game.  
  
Q. When did you specifically find out Natalie was lost for the postseason,
and what do you remember about the exact moment you were told, and I imagine
you were told by a trainer or a doctor?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, right after the game. We were still out on the court
celebrating, and they said it looks like it could have been the ACL. So I
think we knew almost immediately. The MRI wasn't until the next day we got the
official word probably around noon the next day, and I think we were prepared
for it. I think it really‑‑ it kind of took the wind out of our sails during
the celebration, but we still continued to celebrate our success, and I don't
think it had as big an impact the next day when we got the official word. I
think we pretty much already knew by then.  
  
Q. Would that have been you or a member of the coaching staff who told
Natalie directly or a medical person who told her directly?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I don't know what happened in the locker room when
she left the floor. I don't know if they told her. I don't think they did.
They told me not to say anything to her. So I think in her own mind she knew
that something was wrong because obviously she's had a couple of knee injuries
and she knew this one was a little worse. It really wasn't until the next day
that she got the official word. Right after the MRI I think she got the
official word.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Ariel Braker? She's been very successful in the
lineup and people don't talk about her but what a great role player for you.  
MUFFET McGRAW: She is kind of the unsung hero of our team, and what a great
game against Baylor, ten points, six rebounds, four steals, some big plays.
She's kind of a blue collar worker. She makes her way around the basket, sets
screens, does the dirty work, doesn't really care if she gets any credit at
all. Like you said, she doesn't get a lot because nobody talks about her, but
she's so important to our team, just that experience of having her on the
floor. She's great on the scouting report. She knows exactly what she's
supposed to do and what everyone else is supposed to do, and I look for her to
take a bigger role in the vocal leadership. I think she is somebody that is
very smart and will be able to help the rest of the team really get to the
right spots.  
  
Q. Coach Ivey has gone through what Natalie has gone through, and having
somebody like that on the bench for Natalie and for the rest of the team to
say push forward, does that help?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, it does. It always helps to have somebody in the same
situation. We've gotten texts from other people who have gone through the same
thing this year, and it's been really nice for her. Her boyfriend at Drexel
tore his ACL earlier in the season, so they had a lot to talk about.  
It's really been great, and she's really, really doing well.  
  
Q. Just wanted to ask you, yesterday with all the buzz about Tyler Summitt
being hired as Louisiana Tech's new coach at 23, I wanted to see if you could
recall what you would have been like as a head coach of a Division I school at
age 23.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, I was coaching high school at age 23, and when I looked
back on it years later, I thought, I don't know how I did it because I didn't
know anything.  
When you're in that position as a young coach, there's so many things that you
don't know in terms of running a program. I mean, the Xs and Os are probably
the smallest part of the job sometimes. Recruiting is important, the
community, the alumni. There's so many things, handling budgets and just
taking care of managing a staff and doing so many things that I don't know how
you do it at that age. I think that most people have been assistant coaches
for a long time when they get the head coaching job. It's a very difficult
transition, and I don't think I would have been prepared for that at 23. I was
fortunate back then in the '80s‑‑ you know, women's basketball wasn't nearly
as big as it is now, so you could start jobs a little bit earlier back then.  
  
Q. In some ways Alyssa Thomas is a taller version of Jewell Loyd. She's an
unbelievable passer, she doesn't take threes as much but she's what they call
a point forward, I guess. Does that mean that anybody would be inclined to try
to defend her with a smaller player, or does Ariel Braker get a lot more work
trying to do that? Without giving away your game plan, do you have thoughts of
going smaller even though they're very big and trying to beat them with
quickness?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I don't know that you can match up with a Alyssa Thomas with a
guard because she's so good around the basket. I think her strength is really
rebounding. That girl is relentless. She plays so hard, it's really, really
hard to guard her because she's so active going after the ball. I think you
need somebody strong to try to guard her, and we really did a poor job last
time. But she's a tough match‑up because you've got to be physical and keep
her off the glass, and that is not an easy task.  
  
Q. I didn't see the last game. When you started that game in the man ‑to‑man
situations you were in, who was guarding her?   
MUFFET McGRAW: Ariel Braker did guard her for a pretty good stretch with
Natalie in foul trouble. Markisha Wright came in and guarded her some. I don't
recall putting a guard on her. I just watched the game, but I don't remember
if a guard‑‑ a little bit in transition or on a switch or something, but not
for any stretches.  
  
Q. What does it take to be a good post passer in your system? Where does
Reimer kind of fit in that whole paradigm?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, when we recruited Taya, I thought she was going to be
great in the Princeton offense, and she is. She's very similar to Natalie in
that she can put the ball on the floor, she can pass and she can shoot.  
I think we kind of recruit kids that can do that when we see them. We feel
like she is somebody that can play well in that system. We don't have a lot of
back‑to‑the‑basket players. We like the high post player who can do a lot of
things from there. We do a lot of breakdown work to improve our passing. A lot
of it is decision making, and that's even more important, I think, than
actually making the passes, the ability to read when it's there and when it's
not, and that's something that we do spend quite a bit of time on that.  
  
Q. I wonder if you have any plans to utilize a four ‑guard front against
Maryland, and I know you talked about Alyssa Thomas, but if you do how would
you match up with the rest of their team?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, they're pretty big. It's a tough match‑up. It's going to
depend how the game goes, whether or not we can stay out of foul trouble, how
a lot of things go. We've played the four‑guard lineup before with foul
trouble. It's been very successful for us last year. We haven't played it as
much this year because we have so many post players. But we're kind of looking
at all the options right now.  
  
Q. When you're evaluating the previous Maryland game and you said you had
taken a look at that game this morning on January 27th, how do you and the
coaching staff evaluate a game where such a key player played in the previous
game but won't be playing in this game? That's kind of fascinating to me how
you would sort of visualize what you can do while the video in front of you
has such a key player in Natalie. How do you approach that?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, we really looked at so many different things. Was the
zone effective? Was the man‑to‑man effective? How did we like how we guarded
the ball screens? How were the match‑ups? What did we do in transition?
There's so many things that are just general philosophical issues of how are
we going to guard it this time and what do we want to look at; what hurt us,
what didn't. There's a lot of things that I think would be the same whether
Natalie was in the game or not.  
  
Q. I wonder if you could speak to the player development of Jewell Loyd. She
came in as a fairly well ‑ranked individual a couple years ago but seems like
she might have exceeded your expectations, and to become the leading scorer
this year, was that something you expected from her?   
MUFFET McGRAW: I think she continues to exceed our expectations. Last year
National Player of the Year was a phenomenal achievement for her, and she had
a great freshman year, and then to come in this year and be so much better.
She was so much more aggressive. I think her mindset has changed. She is no
longer the freshman who was deferring to the upperclassmen or waiting to be
given the green light. She has just taken charge and knows this is my
opportunity, and not in a selfish way but just in an aggressive way of here's
how I can help the team if I can score in these particular areas.  
I think her work ethic has always been terrific. She never takes a day off.
She's in the gym every day. Whether we're practicing or not, she's in there at
8:00 a.m. getting shots up. She's in watching film. She just always wants to
learn and always wants to know how she can get better. I think when you have a
player like that who the team loves to have around, and with the athletic
ability she has, it's great, but it's her skill set with that athletic ability
that makes her such a great player.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you, you all and Stanford got to play on your home courts
in your regional finals. You look at what Maryland did not only as a 4 seed
but to have to go into Louisville, beat a No. 1 seed, then face Louisville on
their home court. When you look at that team, you mentioned how well they kind
of came back in the game against you, but right now when you look at them, how
potentially dangerous could they be?  
MUFFET McGRAW: They're very dangerous. I think they're a great team. They're a
team that has really, really kind of hit their stride lately. I think they're
playing great basketball, and when you have a great player like Alyssa Thomas
who just really continues to lead them in so many areas, they're a tough
match‑up. To go in there in front of 10,000 or whatever the crowd was and to
come away with that win, that was really something. I think that it was great
to see that. To win on an opponent's home court is not an easy thing to do,
and especially at that point in the season. But they were the better team
yesterday.  
  
Q. I just wanted to ask, Taya Reimer, because Natalie was injured and missed
the first three games earlier this year, she scored 19 and had 13 rebounds
against Michigan State, also had a double ‑double against some very good
teams. I think maybe the expectations soared off the charts for her. Can you
talk about her progress as she goes into the NCAA Tournament?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, I think she's so ready for this moment. I think she's
been waiting all season for us to have to count on her. I think when you're a
freshman you're learning the ropes, you're playing well in some games. It's a
little bit inconsistent with your playing time and how things are going.  
I think for her she's kind of looking forward to just getting out on the court
and showing us what she can do.  
  
Q. Obviously when a team is undefeated, I'm not sure how many moments there
are going to be when you look back at the season, you find that there was a
key moment or a moment in the season which sort of changed everything, but
when you look at the season up to this point, there are a couple of key
moments during your year where you really think things clicked or maybe where
you really thought that this team had Final Four national championship
potential?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I think when we looked ahead back in October at the
schedule and we saw that stretch where we had at Tennessee, big Monday, at
Maryland, big Monday, at Duke, three in a row, and I thought that's going to
determine our season right there in terms of how far can we go, how good can
we be, and I think when we won those three games, I think that's when we
started to think, you know, I think we can be pretty good. But we're not there
yet, and we certainly have a lot of work to do.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2014

  

### [Brenda Frese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15652)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good afternoon, and welcome to today's Women's Final Four head
coaches media teleconference. For the next several minutes you'll have the
opportunity to visit with the head coach of the Maryland Terrapins, Brenda
Frese. Maryland is playing in its fourth Women's Final Four, and pursuing its
second National Championship. At this time I'll ask Coach Frese for some
opening comments and we'll give you instructions on how to get in the cue.  
COACH FRESE: First and foremost, thank you for having us. We feel very honored
and humbled. We still haven't come down from last night's high. Just an
incredible resiliency, toughness from our team to be able to go into
Louisville's home court and be able to get a win and just an incredible
environment.  
The game for me personally ranks right up there all time as probably one of my
favorite to be able to coach in in my career. Just really to be able to see
our team, how we've grown, the paths in this NCAA Tournament and the games
that we've gotten to play, Texas, Tennessee, and Louisville, we've really seen
our team grow into a special young team.  
Obviously, our next opponent is a very common opponent in Notre Dame who is
extremely talented, led by their two All‑American guards in Kayla McBride and
Jewell Lloyd. It's a team that's extremely well‑coached, has a ton of depth,
and is undefeated for a reason. But I know from our end, we're really excited
about going to the Final Four and getting there and getting to Nashville.  
  
Q. When you played Notre Dame back in January, as it turned out because of
foul trouble they didn't have Natalie Achonwa most of that game either. Just
what do you expect from them without her? Does this look like a classic match
‑up, but you've got one spectacular bigger player and three big people doing a
lot of work for you. Does this look like a classic guards versus big people
match‑up?   
COACH FRESE: You know, I think it's really hard to be able to answer that
question. It's a great question. I don't think anybody knows how it's going to
play out, us or Notre Dame, given that it just happened. I do know that Notre
Dame is a tremendous team, and, obviously, guard‑oriented. But their bigs are
very talented as well. They have a phenomenal team. They have a ton of depth.  
You know, for us, I really like where our team is headed. Yes, we really like
our inside game, but our guard play is much different than what it was in
January, and I feel like we've really grown as a team.  
  
Q. If I might follow that up, Alyssa has been described as a point forward,
a forward guard, a whatever, how would you describe her?  
COACH FRESE: A winner. She can play any position. Her true position probably
at the next level would be in that guard, that wing position, but for us she's
played every single position on the floor.  
  
Q. At this point it seems like all eyes are expecting Notre Dame and UCONN
to be playing on Tuesday night for the national title, but the way you've all
come through this tournament with the win especially against Tennessee and
Louisville last night, do you like your chances of maybe getting in and
spoiling this party and moving on yourself?  
COACH FRESE: You know, no question. I think for any of the four teams that are
left remaining you have to have that mentality. But the expectations are high
with Notre Dame and UCONN for a reason. They've backed it up all season long
with their undefeated record. But we just want to be true to who we are and
continue to keep fighting and battling and scrapping and see where it takes
us.  
  
Q. If I can follow up on that, you talked about how different your team
feels right now. Muffet said she noticed you guys maybe making a bit of a turn
in that game against them. Even though you all fell short, maybe to help your
team understand just what it was capable of?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, your schedule, absolutely. Our non‑conference game with
UCONN, our game at home with Notre Dame and being able to come back and being
within two possessions of that game really gave us the confidence that we felt
like we could play with anyone. But it is a process. We've had a very young
team. We've had to add into the lineup with our three freshmen, so it's been a
process for us to get comfortable and be able to work together.  
  
Q. You kind of continued along with this line of questioning. Can you
identify what changed for you all during the course of the season, because,
obviously, you've come on very strong here. Maybe if there are any people that
are responsible for the change or maybe it was just a collective thing with
the team, because I've noticed you have a lot of team unity? I saw a
Washington Post story yesterday about the dancing and all the fun you guys
have. Is there maybe one ‑‑ can you identify what about your game has changed
since January or December, and then what might have instigated that change?   
COACH FRESE: I actually, you know, and you never know when a team is going to
fully get it, but for us it was pretty late. It was after the ACC Tournament
was when we changed having two weeks to be able to get our minds in the right
direction for each other. That humbling loss to NorthCarolina I think really
grounded and rooted our team. From that moment forward we committed to one
another.  
Sometimes when you're watching a team grow and unfold in a season, you don't
know if they're going to get it, but this team, obviously, has bought in and
has committed in terms of a season where when you're managing 13 players and
everybody having to sacrifice, just really proud to be able to see them fully
be able to grasp that within a season.  
  
Q. Does this feel like 2006 at all or do you not want to make any
comparisons like that?  
COACH FRESE: Well, of course you'd love to say that. Every team is different,
so, no. I think my appreciation is greater because you know how hard it is to
get to a Final Four. Just only four teams left standing, but you know the one
thing I will say that is similar to 2006 is watching how everyone's been lined
up and committed for one another, our staff and our support staff and just
always pulling in the right direction for this team.  
  
Q. With all the buzz yesterday of Tyler Summitt getting hired by Louisiana
Tech at 23 years old, what do you think you would have been like if you were
hired by a Division I school at 23 years old?  
COACH FRESE: Very good question, a wreck. That is the first thing that came to
my mind. Yeah, I would not have been in a position to be able to handle that
animal, especially how much women's basketball has changed with the media
attention and everything you have to balance. The one thing I will say for
Tyler Summitt is he has experience on his side. You can't underestimate the
fact that when you grow up with the game and have as many games under his belt
that he's had as a child and through his experiences with Pat, I'm sure he is
more than ready. He has been learning all those years under her, so I'm sure
that he will do a tremendous job.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little about Malina Howard? I know she doesn't have big
time numbers, but what she brings to your team?  
COACH FRESE: I mean, first and foremost, not a better person in the world to
be able to coach, not a better person. She brings so many things to the table.
First and foremost, she's a winner, and she has an extremely high IQ on both
ends of the floor, defensively in terms of her rotations and how we guard, and
offensively just understanding the game and where the ball needs to move to,
the screens that need to be set. She just does all the little things that
don't always show up on a stat sheet but that allow you to win a game.  
  
Q. Just wondering, off the subject a little bit, just your thoughts about
joining the Big Ten next year and coming over in this direction and playing
some games?  
COACH FRESE: Oh, I'm thrilled. I'm going back to my roots, the Midwest. When
you talk about, as you go through this career and you get to be at my age and
have a family, just how important it is to be able to share kind of your
livelihood and your profession with your family and your friends. So for me,
that's kind of where my path started, obviously, in the Midwest and the Big
Ten ties and the relationships that I've developed throughout the year. So I
couldn't be more thrilled to be able to have the opportunity to be able to
come back into the Big Ten Conference.  
  
Q. Jewell Lloyd has got a rather remarkable skill set rebounding, passing,
little bit of Michael Jordan in her attitude. In your mind, what makes her
such a special player?  
COACH FRESE: Jewell has had a phenomenal year. By far probably one of the‑‑
when I watch her on film, she is just a pure joy to be able to watch. You wish
you were coaching her instead of having to game plan against her. Her
athleticism, first and foremost, her exchanges, her and McBride on the court
for their alley‑oops, which is like a dunk in the women's game. Her ability to
be able to just a really high game IQ. She can read the defenses, knows when
to post you up, when to pull up, when to shoot the three, an extremely
difficult match‑up.  
  
Q. Plus, she's also a surprisingly effective player in the paint at 5'10 ".
What does she do so well that allows her to be that effective down there?   
COACH FRESE: You would think when you look at Jewell that maybe she's, based
on how she's built, maybe she's not that strong, but she is. She's extremely a
lot stronger than her body type looks. So she's a really difficult match‑up
when she can go in there and post up smaller guards. She's able to kind of
motor her way and get the shots that she wants.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations on your win. I heard you talking a few questions
ago about going to the Big Ten. Kind of piggybacking off of that, do you and
the program take any extra pride in being ‑‑ in representing the ACC in the
Final Four in this your last year?   
COACH FRESE: Yeah, no question. The ACC has been really good to us in the
tradition and the history that we've been able to have. But I think obviously
the conference prepares us, when you talk about the teams that we've faced and
having two ACC teams that are in the Final Four.  
But I think probably the overall theme when you look at the different
conference realignments is that we're probably most proud of the fact that we
get to represent the university of Maryland and be able to, for our fans and
our community, to be able to represent our university.  
  
Q. You've played Notre Dame before, so you obviously know the team. But I
wonder do you have to speak to the team? Is there any danger about players
maybe thinking that the Notre Dame team is not as strong because, obviously,
they've lost a really great player in Natalie Achonwa? Is it something you
have to specifically address with your players or do you think your players
know the strength of the other players of Notre Dame and you play who is in
front of you?  
COACH FRESE: Obviously, it will be stressed but no team gets to the Final Four
with just one player; it takes a team. When you see the four best teams that
are coming through, and it's truly about a team. We faced adversity with
injuries last season, and I know those injuries made us a stronger unit. Just
like we faced when Connecticut came to play us this season, and Kaleena went
down before the game to play us. We knew they were going to come in and play
stronger in spite of losing her.  
So we've been through that element before, and the reality is that most of the
time your team rallies behind it and plays even better.  
  
Q. You guys have obviously been to the National Championship before and been
to the Final Four. Tell me how it differs going from different stage to
different stage. How does it differ from your preparation and how will it be
different from last time?  
COACH FRESE: Well, there are a lot more demands that take your attention from
being as focused as you probably want to be or be as prepared as you want to
be. So it's a different animal. I know from going through it the first time
and already seeing your morning unfold, there is just a lot more that you have
to tune your team into and your staff to be able to minimize the distractions
that are out there.  
  
Q. Coach, this is more of a fun question. So having Alicia DeVaughn on your
team, does Yolanda Griffith pop up at practices all the time?  
COACH FRESE: You know, actually she doesn't, I'm sure because she has her own
real job as she's a coach. But we've been able to‑‑ it's been fortunate for us
to be able to see Yolanda in the postseason. She's been through the NCAA
Tournament runs usually when her season is complete.  
  
Q. Do you feel like Alyssa Thomas has been somewhat underrated maybe even
this year?  
COACH FRESE: You know, she's received a lot of attention and rightly so
because she's extremely talented. I guess if you wanted to compare and
contrast in regards to the other players that are out there or are deserving
of the attention as well, it's a great question to be able to ask. But you
know what? At the end of the day, none of it really matters. What matters is
that this team has taken her to a Final Four in everything that she's meant to
our program. I know that the people within Maryland and what she's done to
leave her legacy here is the most important thing for her.  
  
Q. You had a stretch, I think it was three games in a row in January where
you lost back ‑to‑back to back, Virginia, Notre Dame, and N.C. State. A lot of
times when a team has that kind of stretch, they can go either way. They
respond as you clearly did, or they can go in the tank and that is the season.
What happened after those three games that, I don't want to say that changed
things, but obviously they went a certain way as opposed to another way?   
COACH FRESE: I think it's important as a leader to continue to give
perspective and not to get too high or too low when you're going through those
moments in a long season, for us just giving back to our players. Two of the
three were on the road. The third was against an undefeated Notre Dame team.
Just that we were a young team with three freshmen that we needed to figure it
out as a team together. So just not losing confidence in your team and their
abilities.  
  
Q. Was there a game that happened after that, whether it was a February game
or maybe a game in the tournament or maybe not in the tournament, because that
would be too late. But was there a game a couple weeks after that stretch
where you sort of knew that this team was heading in the right direction?  
COACH FRESE: You know, honestly, it was after the ACC Tournament, after we
played NorthCarolina and lost in the quarterfinals. You say that's pretty late
to be able to see your team kind of rally, but for us, I think it was kind of
that our team clicked into that this could be the finality of our season. So
really some people don't like the two‑week stretch that is off before you come
into play. For us, it was the best thing that ever happened. No question
having those two weeks to recenter and refocus and put all the time into us
was tremendous.  
  
Q. Was it practice schedule during those two weeks the same or did you
change something up after the NorthCarolina loss?  
COACH FRESE: After the Carolina loss the practices were grueling. So it was a
mindset that you're going to figure out how to‑‑ you're going to get tougher
and you're going to learn what it takes to fight or this is it. Credit this
team. We saw our team really within a week figure it out together. I mean, it
really was incredible to be able to watch.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2014

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good afternoon, and welcome to today's women's Final Four head
coaches media teleconference. Over the next several minutes you'll have a the
opportunity to visit with the head coach of the UConn Huskies, Geno Auriemma.
UConn will be playing in its record seventh straight Women's Final Four in
2014 and will be playing for a record ninth national championship in the next
week or so. I will ask Coach Auriemma to provide an opening statement.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Thank you, Rick. I think I speak, I'm sure, for all the other
coaches that it's a great opportunity, one that you never take lightly, to
play in the Final Four. For our team it's something that you work all year
long for, something that every basketball player that's playing aspires to be
doing at this time of the year, and we've had a great season with a lot of
great moments and some fantastic wins and an awful lot of accomplishments that
we're really proud of, and we're looking forward to coming out there this
weekend.  
I know we already played Stanford once, and it seems like years ago that we
played them, but it was November, and I watched them play last night, and
they're a vastly different team than they were in November, and I hope we are,
too.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about the shot blocking this year. Obviously you have
three players who are really good at it. Can you talk a little bit about how
they became good at it? Is it something Marisa is coaching them and how they
stay out of foul trouble while doing this?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, it goes back to one of the best shot blocking teams in
the history of college basketball was our 1995 team with Carol Walters and
Rebecca Lobo. I think that might have been before Marisa was born. I'm not
sure. She probably likes to hear that.  
It's something that when you have the right kind of players, when you have the
right ingredients where you've got kids that are obviously skilled enough that
have great footwork and are pretty intelligent defenders and their timing is
pretty good, then you can have the kind of success that we've had this year.
Both Chris Dailey and Marisa really emphasize positioning way more than
anything else. I think blocking shots just is a byproduct of being in the
right place at the right time and making good decisions.  
I've got to tell you, I think the improvement in officiating has helped,
believe it or not. I think blocking a shot is not as hard as making sure the
official understands it's a blocked shot and not a foul, which didn't always
used to be the case in women's basketball. It used to be every time you
blocked a shot, it was a foul. Every time you got an offensive rebound it was
over the back.  
So I think the officials have gotten better at recognizing when it's a blocked
shot and when it's a foul, and I think therefore our players have‑‑ as other
players around the country, have been allowed to be better defenders and play
better in the post.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you attribute your success to, and what do you think is
the key to motivating players to give maximum effort at all times? Your team
seems to epitomize that and has forever it seems, but what does it take for a
coach to convince his players that all it takes is 40 minutes, and how do you
get them to do it?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, yeah, it's something that we take great pride in, how
hard we work every day, how hard we work in the off season, and how hard we
work in the preseason, how we maintain that during the season. We used to do
that in 1985 and '86, '87, and we weren't any good. We didn't make the NCAA
Tournament. The last 20‑some years we've worked just as hard, we do the same
thing, we work our butt off, we have high expectations for our players, but
the players are really, really, really good. I'd like to think that we get
some of the best players in America to come to Connecticut, and when they get
here, I'd like to think that we have them work as hard, if not harder, than
any other team in the country year in and year out.  
We could do the same exact thing and not have the players that we have and we
wouldn't have the success that we have. It's a combination of things,
obviously, but I think the expectation level here is you go to the Final Four
and you play for a national championship, and we're pretty proud of it, that
since 1988‑'89, every player that's been recruited at Connecticut has played
in the Final Four. The kids know that. That's why they come here. When you
have high expectations you tend to live up to them.  
  
Q. Why don't we talk a little bit about the match ‑up with Stanford and what
you said a little earlier about how they're vastly different and you are
vastly different. If you could elaborate on both those points.   
GENO AURIEMMA: Just based on what I saw last night watching them, they seem to
be much more well‑rounded. I think early in the year you're trying to fit all
the pieces together. I think there was a inordinate amount of the load placed
on Chiney, and maybe rightly so, because the kid can carry her whole team for
a whole season if she has to. But based on what I saw yesterday, they seem to
be much more well‑rounded in terms of other people are doing more things. You
saw players step up and make big plays. It wasn't just let's stand around and
watch Chiney. That means their team has grown, their team has evolved. They're
certainly experienced enough. It's not like they're playing four freshmen and
Chiney, so they've got people around here that are certainly capable, and they
beat a really good team last night. If anybody thinks, well, yeah, we're going
to play the same Stanford team that we played in November, they're kidding.  
  
Q. Just to follow up, in what ways do you think your team is vastly
improved?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I think my team has changed. Every team changes. You just
hope you change for the better, that you improve on the things that you
thought you needed to improve on and you get better at what you were good at.
Playing together all these games, all these months certainly has made us much
more confident, not that we weren't confident in the November game, but in
some ways we've changed and it's a little bit different. We didn't have
Kaleena Lewis our second half of that game, so if everybody is healthy
tonight, that'll be a little bit different for us and we'll have our starting
five.  
We got great contributions from Kiah Stokes and from Saniya Chong in that
particular game. Kiah continues to get better and better. Saniya has not. So
hopefully Sunday the five that we have as starters playing together and
playing really well and we can get some contributions off the bench.  
  
Q. It seems like it's just a monumental achievement just to come within 20
points of you this year, and only seven teams have done that, and you've got
five players on the all ‑America team. You probably get asked this question at
the end of every year, but I'm wondering how this team stacks up with the
other UConn teams you've had. I'm not asking you to rate them, but I'm
wondering in what particular plays is this team among your best in any
particular way?   
GENO AURIEMMA: I think most of the good teams that we've had have
similarities. They have obviously good players at every position, which we do,
really good guard play we've had since Moriah Jefferson had a great, great
year, and she and Bria Hartley in the backcourt have been just really solid
all year long.  
We've got, I think, the best center in America, Stefanie Dolson, and certainly
that's huge.  
And then we have a couple players that are just dominating the game, but I
don't think we win games the way we want without having more than just one way
to win games. All the great teams that I've had could beat you a lot of
different ways. That doesn't necessarily mean they're going to. That doesn't
mean they can't lose, but that they're a hard team to just say, okay, if we do
that we can beat Connecticut. Some teams that I've had, if you did one or two
things, it would be difficult for us to overcome those things. This particular
team, they team to have answers for a lot of things that come up on the court,
and I just hope that continues.  
  
Q. You obviously know Chiney well. You've seen her for the last four seasons
and you saw her sister before that. But just on sort of first blush, what do
you think you're going to have to do to slow down Stanford beyond Chiney?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, it's kind of the same as that question that I was just
asked about our team and why we're a good team. If Stanford wants to just rely
on Chiney, they're a really, really, really good team, just by she doing what
she does. She's so good at scoring the ball, rebounding the ball, playing
defense, running the floor. She's a great emotional leader. But I don't think
that's enough to win a national championship.  
What I think has happened is Ruef has become, I think, a much, much better
complement to Chiney. Amber has become much a more aggressive offensive
player, much more consistent offensive player. Watching last night the kids on
the perimeter, Bonnie Samuelson and Karlie, they look very confident. They
look confident, they look they know that they're good and that they know that
they can provide the other things that you need to win a championship, that
it's not just let's put three guys on Chiney and let's see if Stanford can
win.  
So I've been impressed watching them and how much their other players have
evolved, and I think that's what's going to make the match‑up, for anybody to
play Stanford, a difficult one.  
  
Q. I know you didn't play Notre Dame this year, but you've seen Natalie
Achonwa 12 times in the previous three years. In what ways will her loss
motivate Notre Dame most, particularly when they have the challenge to trying
to defend against Alyssa Thomas?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I doubt that Natalie Achonwa was going to be guarding
Alyssa Thomas anyway. That wouldn't have been‑‑ probably, it could have been,
I don't want to speak for their coaching staff. The problem when you have a
great team and you lose somebody as integral as she is to their team and you
lose them late in the year, it's hard to just put somebody in and expect the
same results. She was a terrific passer. She could score around the basket.
She played great defense inside. She rebounded the ball. She had a little bit
of an edge to her, which I think every big guy needs. What effect does not
having her? Well, obviously the easy answer is she's averaging 20 points a
game in the NCAA Tournament, so that's a huge effect. What effect does it have
emotionally on the team? I don't know, each team's makeup is different.  
In 2001 we lost two first‑team all‑Americans, Svetlana Abrosimova and Shea
Ralph. We lost Shea in the Big East championship game, so we went into the
NCAA Tournament missing two First‑Team All‑Americans. When we got to the Final
Four and we ended up losing to Notre Dame that year, but I know exactly what
it feels like to all of a sudden you've got to retool your team. It's not
something that you wish on any team, and certainly you don't wish that kind of
injury on any player. But I don't think Notre Dame is just Natalie Achonwa. I
think they're a whole lot more than that. And if anybody thinks that that's
all they are, they haven't played them enough times. That just means Joe Lloyd
and Kayla McBride are going to take even more shots, which makes them more
dangerous. Losing her really, really, really hurts. I guess we'll see this
weekend how much.  
  
Q. I realize I'm asking this question about a team that hasn't lost a game,
but what for you up until this point did you or do you consider the key moment
of the season, and why do you consider that the key moment of the season?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Wow. Well, there's been moments, I believe. One moment was in
the Stanford game when Kaleena went down and we played the whole second half
without her, and we got some great contributions from the bench and we beat a
really, really good team. That was one moment.  
The next one was not long after, we played at Maryland without K, and I don't
know if Morgan Tuck played. I don't think she did. So we played without
Kaleena, without Morgan Tuck, and we went down at Maryland in front of 15,000
people and played a really, really good team and we got great contributions
from guys off the bench, and still we took over the game. That was another
great moment.  
I think those two games maybe let everybody on our team know that, hey, it
doesn't matter whether we have everybody or most everybody. We may have it in
us to just persevere and overcome no matter who we're missing. I mean, there's
certainly a limit to how many people you can play without, don't get me wrong.
I wouldn't want to go through next weekend missing one or two key players.  
I think those two games early in the season really showed us an awful, awful
lot.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Stewie's goofy personality and how well it
balances or complements her skills and her serious approach to the game?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, she certainly has a different personality than you would
expect. Someone from the outside looking in would probably be surprised to
know that Stewie doesn't really take herself too seriously. She's not one to
make everything about her. She's not one of those prima donna types. She's not
one of those me‑me‑me looking for attention types that we've seen in the NCAA
Tournament recently. She's just more about winning. She's just more about I
go, I play the game, and everybody says I'm a great player, and everybody
heaps all this stuff on me, and she tries really, really hard to live up to
that all the time. It doesn't always work out that way. She really struggled
this weekend, and one of the reasons why she does struggle is she really wants
to be great, and she wants to be great every minute of every game, and that's
a lot more someone who's a sophomore and young.  
But I do think one of her biggest strengths is that she doesn't take herself
way too seriously and that she just acts like a normal college kid who's a
sophomore who has been blessed with a lot of things and doesn't want any more
than that. Just wants to play basketball.  
That's what I love about Stewie, when she committed and she signed, no
fanfare, no nothing. We don't have an entourage, we don't have bodyguards
following us around. We don't need to hire anybody to protect her from
anybody. She's just a normal kid who loves to play basketball, and that's why
we all love her.  
  
Q. Natalie's injury notwithstanding, do you feel like this Final Four has a
little bit different aura or dynamic considering there are two unbeaten teams
going into it?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I do, but not for‑‑ not internally. For us internally we're
getting ready to play Stanford, and it's no different than us last year
getting ready to play Notre Dame regardless of what their record was,
regardless of what our record was. We've entered the tournament undefeated a
number of times, and I know what the hype is surrounding that, and I know how
everyone throughout this season has wanted to make it about this inevitable
march towards two undefeated teams playing for the national championship.  
I've kind of not bought into any of that, so I don't really feel that. I kind
of don't like when you have a sense of like you're disrespecting people, and I
wouldn't want either Maryland or Stanford to feel like we're just there as
filler for the Notre Dame Connecticut big thing, because I've been there, I've
seen it, and I don't like it.  
So we're just preparing as if we would anything else. I know it's a great
story, and I know everybody loves story lines, and in today's day and age God
forbid if you don't have a story line, we'll just create one. So fortunately
there is a story line. And the story line, God bless them, is two teams that
are undefeated. Great. As opposed to years past when it's individuals.  
This is a team sport, and I'm glad that there's two teams that are undefeated.
But I caution everybody, there's two other teams out there that are good
enough to win a national championship, so let's not write that story just yet.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you, yesterday with all the buzz about Tyler Summitt
being hired as a 23 year old. I wanted to see if you can recall what you might
have been like as a head coach of a Division I school at 23.  
GENO AURIEMMA: (Laughing) When I was 23, actually when I was 23 I was driving
a truck for a friend of mine, for my dad's friend who owned five supermarkets.
I'm not sure that I was confident that I was going to be able to keep that
job, so I wasn't really in a position to do anything like I guess Tyler is
going to be doing at Louisiana Tech.  
It's been an interesting couple of days, I guess, in women's basketball with
the last couple of hires, both at Arkansas and at Louisiana Tech generating a
lot of buzz in the women's basketball world. Like they say, any kind of
publicity is good publicity. I think when you're young and it's your first
head coaching job and you've only been a coach for a couple of years, I think
two years as an assistant, heck, I was 30 when I got the job here at
Connecticut, and that was my first head coaching job, and I thought I knew
everything about everything. Two years later I realized I didn't know anything
about anything.  
So I'm sure he's going to be overwhelmed at times, and I'm sure he's got a lot
of great ideas that he's going to implement, and I'm sure he's going to have a
great staff that's going to help him. That's just a tall task for a 30 year
old, much less a 23 year old.  
  
Q. Obviously you schedule your out of conference schedule with the idea of
testing your team throughout the season. That really hasn't happened. How do
you prepare when you have such a large margin of victory for what might be
some tight games at the end, and are you at all concerned about how your team
will react?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, you schedule the games that you think would be really
good games to play. You hope that those games are competitive, and you hope
that your team comes out of there with a certain knowledge of themselves and
what it takes to win games. You can't orchestrate what the score is going to
be. You can't say, okay, well, we just played four of the top 10 teams in the
country, and damn, I wish some of them would have gone into triple overtime so
we could find out how we would do in those kind of games. It just didn't
happen. People say, what are you going to do. Hey, I hope both of these games
we're up 25 with three minutes to go and I don't have to worry about it.  
But the reality is whatever happens, whether it's a close game, not a close
game, I think we've proven in the past as coaches that it's all about putting
your players in the position to make plays. It works the other way, too. You
can also have the kind of team where your players feel like it doesn't matter
what happens, we're good enough to win every game we play, regardless of what
the score is, regardless of what the situation is. That doesn't mean if we're
in a close game we're definitely going to win it, it doesn't mean we're going
to lose it. But it won't be because we're not prepared or we haven't been in
any games. If you look back, every single one of these kids has been in a
close game and then some during the three or four years that they've been at
Connecticut, so I'm not really worried about it.  
  
Q. Earlier in this conversation today, you mentioned Stefanie Dolson, and
we've seen her, of course, over the course of her career, and she's really
evolved, and I just wanted to hear from you about her evolution.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Stefanie Dolson is one of the great success stories that I've
ever been around in all my years of coaching, high school, girls, boys,
college. It doesn't matter. For someone to come out of high school and for her
to do what she's done, and not just do it anywhere, it's one thing if you're a
big kid and you go to a mid‑major or you go to a place where nobody is paying
attention, and all of a sudden before you know it somebody looks up and goes,
wow, what happened to that kid, she turned out to be really good. You're doing
it at Connecticut, you're doing it in the spotlight, you're doing it against
the best teams in the country on national television, and she got exposed as a
freshman early of what she couldn't do, all the things that she had to get
good at.  
Stefanie's sophomore year in the Final Four, we lost, and she made a
commitment at that point in time, this is never going to happen again, and
went about and changed how she trained and how she was going to look and how
she was going to prepare and made herself into the best center in the country.
A lot of kids say they want it. A lot of kids talk about it. A lot of kids
wish they could do it. But we're talking about somebody who actually set her
mind to something and did it and has done it as well if not better than any
kid I've ever coached in my life.  
  
Q. No one has come within 11 points of you this season, your teams have lost
11 games in the last six years. Talk about how you create adversity just to
keep it fun for yourself, for your players, just to keep yourselves
interested.  
GENO AURIEMMA: That's a good question. I've been known to keep things
interesting at practice, and creating adversity has never been a problem for
me in practice and creating situations where we have certain things that are
monumental that can't get through. I kind of enjoy that, and I teach my
players how to enjoy that, how to embrace how hard it is. You've got to‑‑ the
joy in doing something is creating an atmosphere where it's just so difficult
to do it that when you do accomplish it, there is a tremendous sense of
self‑satisfaction, and it's not fake, either. It's not like you get kids today
who they jog up the floor and you've got coaches clapping going, way to run,
baby, way to run.  
For us it's‑‑ the kids love it. Like I'll give you a perfect example, and I
can relate back to some of my teams. It's a little different today, don't get
me wrong. You have to work a little bit harder today to get players to really
embrace the challenge because there's so few challenges that they face growing
up. What's their biggest challenge: Which AAU team to play for. What's their
biggest challenge: Should I get three pairs of sneakers this weekend or four.
There's very few challenges, so we would lose seven games in a weekend, so
what, I'm not really playing for my team, I'm playing for the college coaches
to come and watch me play. I'm not really interested in winning, I'm
interested in how many scholarship offers I'm going to get. They don't face
many challenges.  
I remember we would play‑‑ and like every coach does, every coach does this,
you play four or four, and maybe you put five defenders and four offensive
players or maybe six defenders and four offensive players, or four offensive
players on your team and five defenders for them or five offensive players for
them, four‑‑ you just keep changing things around as you go. I remember we
were playing one time, and it was five of our guys against seven of them. So
there's 12 people on the floor, we were playing five against seven. Our guys
kind of got a kick out of it. Yeah, let's see how many times we can get stops.
And then a week later it was five against eight, and it was like Jesus, Mary
and Joseph. Every once in a while they would get a couple stops and they would
feel unbelievably good about that. Then the following week I went five against
six; they looked at me like, what, you think we stink? We aren't seven anymore
or eight?  
So once you create that challenge, then all of a sudden they start to look for
challenges. But they need to be challenged every minute of every day, and I
just don't think that kids that we get today‑‑ me all the way down, I don't
think they face enough challenges throughout their high school careers. So
that's one of the biggest things we try to teach them: Embrace the challenge,
embrace how hard it is. That's what makes winning so special.  
  
Q. You mentioned Moriah a ways back in this conference. I'm curious how many
different ways could her career have gone after what was kind of a tough
freshman season? Was it a certainty in your mind coming off last season that
we would eventually see who she is now?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I think that's the big question that every player has to
answer: What am I going to do between my freshman year and sophomore year to
prove that I belong at this level, because freshman year at Connecticut,
there's not‑‑ there are expectations, don't get me wrong, but you also have a
lot of leeway. You don't get necessarily scrutinized as much as some of the
upperclassmen do. So last year‑‑ Moriah's biggest problem was she didn't
really believe that she could do all the things that I thought she could do,
so I just kept looking at her incredulously going where's the kid I recruited
out of high school that was so confident, so cocky, thought she could do
anything any time anywhere with the basketball, offensively, defensively, and
now there's this kid who keeps looking over at the bench to see if everything
is okay, can I do this, can I do that, should I try this, should I try that. I
thought, you know, that's not the winning edge, and towards the end of the
season that kind of got dispelled a little bit and a little bit more and a
little bit more, and like with all the great players, they go through a summer
between freshman and sophomore year where they figure things out, come back to
practice, and she came in in September, and the very first day that we got
together to practice, you could tell she was a different person. She went from
should I, should I not, can I, do you think I can, to, Coach, this is what I'm
going to do, and telling the other players this is what we're going to do. The
transformation was absolutely incredible.  
That's the player that we recruited. That's the Moriah Jefferson that we
recruited. There's a lot of great guards out there, and certainly we played
against all of them.  
But right now I'd take Moriah Jefferson as a sophomore for the next couple
years over anybody.

_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  

Maryland  76  
Louisville  73

  
JEFF WALZ: First, I just want to say a thank you to our crowd. I mean, the
city of Louisville to come out, our fans to come out like they did tonight was
just absolutely amazing. I thought it was a great event. I thought it was a
great crowd, a great atmosphere, and we asked them to come out and support us,
and they did.  
Not every place gets the type of support that we get and has the fan support
that we have. I mean, they're true University of Louisville fans, and we're
grateful for that, appreciative of that, and we know that there's choices to
be made on places you can go, things you can do, places you can spend your
money. I never want one of our fans to ever think myself or any of these young
ladies or our team take it for granted because we travel too many places where
they can't get anybody to come out to a women's basketball game, and it's
absolutely amazing what our fans do, how they cheer, how knowledgeable they
are, and I want to say thank you to them.  
I would like to congratulate Maryland. I thought it was a very good basketball
game. It was a game of runs. We got stuck there on 45 for about five or six
minutes and just could not get a shot to go. Had three or four of them that
were in and out. We finally would run a play and get a lay‑up and they'd call
a hold on the screen, and it was like, boy, can I decline that and I'll take
the lay‑up. Calling for a foul all game and finally got a foul when we got an
open lay‑up. We didn't need that one there. We needed the ball to go in the
basket.  
But it sucks. There's a few other words I could use, but it wouldn't be
appropriate. These kids fought. We're down 12 with two minutes to go, and I
mean, there was never quit in one of them. I mean, we executed that play at
the end there to perfection, and we got a great look. The ball just did not go
in the basket. Unfortunately for us it wasn't our night.  
Thank you.  
  
Q. Shoni, can you talk about the final play there, how it went down, was it
what you were looking for, and did you think that it was going in?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I mean, we executed it perfectly. We both came up, Bri and I,
and Asia was going to get the ball, and she got it. All she had to do was
throw it to me, and I was actually kind of open, and so for me to take that
shot, we perfected it. The ball just didn't go in.  
The one that didn't go in was the last shot that I wanted, but it just didn't
fall. Nothing much you can do about that.  
  
Q. Shoni, it looked like all you could do when it didn't go was smile, and I
know you weren't happy and I know Coach wasn't, but it seemed like you did
everything so right down there. That was kind of your last moment. What was
going through your head when it didn't go?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Just not to get down on myself. It was my last shot, and it
just happened to be the one that didn't go. It sucks, but‑‑  
JEFF WALZ: Amen.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: What can you do about it?  
  
Q. Shoni, if you could talk about the final 18 seconds, the two threes that
you made to get your team within a shot of forcing overtime. What was going
through your mind when you were trying to rally the team?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I was just trying to get easy, quick buckets and I knew they
were going to guard me, and her hand was down so I took that quick one right
in front of her. I had that mentality like I wasn't going to quit and I knew
my teammates weren't going to quit and so we just ‑‑ we did a great job of
fighting back, especially that last two minutes, and I couldn't be any more
proud of my team because we battled to the very last second.  
  
Q. You've always had a short memory when it comes to shooting. During that
stretch where you missed seven in a row, I think, did you just tell yourself
just keep shooting, just keep giving yourself opportunities?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I was tired of missing so I had to get an easy bucket. That
lay‑up helped right then and there. I'm not going to sit there and dwell on
the past. I'm not going to sit there and think about the last shot I just
took. I'm just going to move on, move forward, there's nothing I can do about
it, except learn what to do differently. I thought we did a great job those
last two minutes of doing the best we could.  
  
Q. Asia, just talk about playing with these girls the last three, four, five
years and what it meant to you and just kind of your thoughts about them and
spending time with them.  
ASIA TAYLOR: Yeah, well, it definitely meant everything to me. Coming in as a
freshman, from Columbus, Ohio, I never would have thought that my five years
here would have went like this. I've got just to say thank you to Coach Walz.
He believed in me when I was in high school and stuff. We've had our ups and
downs. I know there's a lot of times he could have given up on me, he didn't,
and he just kept pushing me. I'm a better player because of it. Off the court
I'm going to be I successful person because he's pushed me. Shoni and Nita and
Tia, it's been amazing playing with them. I'm just going to miss them. I'm
going to miss their faces and smiling and dancing and everything. It's been
amazing, and the fans, as well. Never going to forget this.  
  
Q. Asia, what did you think about the stretch where you guys ‑‑ I think it
went about seven minutes where you guys couldn't score and they went on a big
run. What do you think contributed to that and how frustrating was it to see
some of the baskets that didn't go down?   
ASIA TAYLOR: It was definitely frustrating. We were playing really hard, we
were boxing out, we were defending, and we were getting good looks, they just
weren't falling. It was tough, and they just went on their run, and we just
tried to fight back. Nobody ever hung their heads, though. That was the big
thing. We always thought that we had a chance. We always believed we had a
chance to come back, and I think that's why we made the run at the end. If we
could have just not given up one or two of those baskets, mistakes I made in
the first half, getting that technical foul was huge. There's a lot of things
that could have prevented this, but just proud of how we fought.  
  
Q. Antonita, we didn't know if we were going to see you on the court again
and you get to play this last half of the season and played tonight. What has
this meant to you?  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: It's meant everything. It's just a blessing, first of all
just for my health, and then just playing with these guys. You know, they're
great teammates but they're great people off the court, as well. Like we said
in the locker room we're going to all keep in touch. These four years at
Louisville have meant a lot.  
  
Q. Shoni or actually any of the players, two things: The last two minutes I
think was one of the best examples of end ‑game clock management that I've
ever seen, especially the amount of timeouts. Is that a drill you practice
regularly, two minutes we're down 12 or whatever? And secondly, you've become
much more of a facilitator this year than you seemed to be last year. Was that
a conscious choice, and how did you develop those skills?   
SHONI SCHIMMEL: The first question, I think our coaches have done a great job
of preparing us for situations like that. I mean, we knew that we weren't
going to give up and we knew that Coach Walz knows what he's doing, especially
when it comes to perfecting the time and the scoring. He's a very smart coach,
and he shows it every game. For him to do that, we have to believe in him and
he has to believe in us. That's exactly what happened. We just came up a
little bit short, and I mean, what more could you ask for? We ran the play
perfectly, and the ball just didn't go in the hoop. It's not always the ending
you want, but I couldn't be any more proud of my team because we fought to the
very last second, and so I mean, I can't hang my head on that. I don't think
any of us should because we fought, we were down 12 with two minutes to go.
Who comes back from that? We almost did, and so I mean, I'm proud of every
single one of my teammates and I'm thankful for them.  
For your second question, I definitely put a lot more work into my game just
because I wanted to be the best person I could be on the court and off the
court. I took the time and went out there and worked on things that I need to
get better at and just did all the smart things that I needed to do.  
  
Q. Antonita, everything seemed to be working the latter part of the first
half. You were forcing turnovers. You were up by four. If you could talk about
the early minutes of the second half and how everything changed there. What
did Maryland do to kind of swing that momentum?  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: I'd say that the second half they came out and hit us in
the mouth, just on the glass and just rebounds that we didn't get, maybe a
couple turnovers that we had. All that led into their run. But like Coach was
saying, it's a game of runs, so I'm proud of my team, like Shoni was saying,
for fighting back, and just never giving up.  
  
Q. Tia, thinking back on the last minute, the last 30 seconds, what did you
think about just seeing Shoni hit all those threes that were so deep, every
time down she was hitting them and keeping you guys in it. What was it like
seeing that and maybe what that's been like just seeing her do that kind of
thing her whole career?  
TIA GIBBS: From day one we knew Shoni was a special player and she was going
to make a huge impact on our team and the program. Every time she shoots, of
course the crowd thinks it's going in, but we kind of know it's going in.
We're on the court and Shoni is like, all right, she's going to send a three
and I'm going to shoot it, you go rebound. Gotcha, simple as that.  
Shoni, that's nothing that amazes me. She hits those shots in practice with
the tallest person in her face. When she hit that, it was like normal. Of
course it gave us a huge boost and there was no doubt in my mind she wasn't
going to make the last one. That's what she does. She puts the team on her
back. I was very grateful to spend four, maybe five years with her.  
  
Q. Just the seniors who have given so much to this team over the last four,
five or six years, what do you say to the juniors, the sophomores and the
freshmen in the locker room when you go back in?  
ASIA TAYLOR: Well, just tell them to keep their heads up, and next year they
have to keep carrying the torch. We still didn't win a national championship,
and I know Coach Walz is going to do everything in his power to have them
prepared. As long as they put in the work over the summer, everything is going
to be fine, and they know what it's like, and this year we made history, and I
know that everybody enjoyed being a part of that. It doesn't mean that it
stops now. We're going to be in a better conference next year, it's going to
be tougher competition, but I think they'll be fine. Listen to coach, and
everything will be good.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I definitely think it's nothing to base your next season on,
the rest of your career on. I think it's something to learn from, especially
being the younger kids. They have to learn from this. They saw what everybody
could be, what they could do, especially on our team. We saw the potential in
the younger people, and for them to kind of grow up and be mature, exactly
what we did. We matured as people, and for us to do that, they have to do
that, as well. They're going to have all the correct things for them to do
that, the coaches and the people around them. They're going to be set up to
where they're going to succeed, and they have to be willing to do that, and
they have to go out there and do it for them and this team and this program.  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: I'd say just listen to the coaches because every game
they're going to have them prepared to win. They have the best fan support in
the nation, and just to play here is a blessing. Just work hard this summer
and listen to the coaches.  
TIA GIBBS: Well, for me I think it's just to continue to believe. This year we
believed. We believed in our coaches. We believed in each other, and we
believed that no matter what, we'll have a chance to get to Nashville. You
know, I think I can speak for all of the seniors here, we've matured and we've
trusted our coaches so much that if Coach were to tell us to run through a
brick wall, we'd definitely do it. For the younger ones, coming in at 18 as a
freshman, it's kind of hard to buy in, but once they buy in, we'll have a
special group again. We've got a lot of work to do and we've got a lot of
freshmen coming in, but we still have five seniors, five seniors on the floor
with maybe five or six freshmen coming in. We'll still be a mature team with
the mentality of getting to the Final Four. We'll work.  
  
Q. Jeff, considering the crowd support and what you've seen lately and
having a regional semifinal and final here, what do you think about the odds
of maybe hosting a Final Four here? I guess the NCAA has a rule as far as home
arenas ‑‑  
JEFF WALZ: I'm not sure how that works. I would think you'd want to be able to
host a Final Four on your home court, but I'm not sure what those rules are.
Like I said in my opening statement, we're very blessed to play here and have
the fan support that we have. Tom Jurich believing and putting a bid in to
host a regional, I'm sure that there were a bunch of people that they couldn't
even get their school to even bid on it, to put their name in the pot. You
have to believe in your fans that they're going to come out and support
women's basketball, and ours do. It was a remarkable night tonight.  
  
Q. You said the other day by tip ‑off you'd have a strategy against Alyssa
Thomas. What was that today, and how do you feel your team executed?  
JEFF WALZ: I thought we did a really good job on her. I thought we slowed her
down in the first half. I mean, the frustrating thing for me is we sat there,
the things that I told them we had to do: Stop transition baskets, we did.
They get six points in transition. We had to do a good job on the glass and
limit their second‑chance points. They get six. We just couldn't beat them at
the free‑throw line. They go 25 of 28 from the free‑throw line, we go 11 of
13. We couldn't get there enough. And that really is where the game was won.
It's real simple. We turned it over way too much in the second half, some
uncharacteristic turnovers. When we got up seven there the start of the second
half, we just did some things that we don't do, and you can't do those in a
game like this.  
We had opportunities to get up nine I think at one point, and we throw the
ball out of bounds. If you go back and look at the number of lay‑ups that we
missed, there's at least six, and just one‑on‑one lay‑ups where you've just
got to go finish it, and we didn't finish it tonight.  
Our kids, I'm so proud of them. They played so hard. We never gave up, and
they know it. We give credit to Maryland. It's a great win for them. But when
we sat down in the locker room, we were proud of our fight, but we knew we had
an opportunity here tonight, and we let it slip by, especially with missing as
many lay‑ups as we did.  
  
Q. You talked about that point where you were stuck on 45 for about seven
minutes there and I think Sarah had a lay ‑up rim‑out, Shoni had a‑‑ will you
look back on it as you got the shots you wanted‑‑  
JEFF WALZ: We had some really good shots. Schimmel had one on the baseline off
of a ball screen, a pull‑up that she makes eight out of 10 times. It didn't go
in. I thought we did a decent job for about two minutes of that stretch of
defending them, and then we rushed a couple shots after we had missed four or
five that led to, I think, four of their six transition baskets, and that's
what happens. When you start to press and you really want to make a shot so
bad, sometimes you take one too quick.  
You know, I'm proud of the kids. It's been an unbelievable year. There's no
question that our goal was to get to Nashville, and unfortunately we fell a
game short.  
  
Q. How do you think you'll reflect back on that last minute and 30 seconds
or so, just to furious you came back and the threes that you hit and how close
you came? Was it surprising to see how well, other than the final shot didn't
go in, just how well you guys executed and how you nearly pulled something
off?  
JEFF WALZ: No, it's not surprising to me at all. You know, we have worked on
that last‑second play. We executed it to perfection. We got a great shot. You
really can't ask for anything more.  
We subbed, we had our offensive subs, our defensive subs. Just things that we
do when we work on, we sub on the second made free throw instead of before the
second one so now you've got a dead ball and you can set up your press. If you
sub before that, then when it goes in they have a chance to get it in as quick
as they want. It's things like that that we do practice. It's a tough way to
end.  
  
Q. Coach, your team averages around 19 forced turnovers against some other
teams. You guys forced 15 on Maryland the first half. What were you doing
against Maryland?  
JEFF WALZ: I thought we did a great job of getting our hands in passing lanes.
I thought we back tipped a bunch and got some steals off of those. We forced
them into 25 turnovers, but you can't win by getting one point per turnover.
Our problem was we turned‑‑ we forced them into turnovers in the first half,
but then we turned it over ourselves after we stole the ball, so it washed
itself out. That's what you can't do. We had a lot of opportunities in that
first half to really put some things together and just could not finish it.  
  
Q. Just wanting to reflect on your time with Maryland, when you were with
Maryland, and you knowing the coach there, Brenda, did you and her talk prior
to this game, and if you did, what kind of conversation was that?  
JEFF WALZ: We probably haven't spoken, besides saying hi out there, in six
years. I mean, no, there was really no conversation that took place. We both
have families, we both have teams that we're trying to run. No, but they had a
great season and they played a great game tonight, no question about it.  
  
Q. There's a momentum shift there early in the second half. Were they doing
something differently when they came out of the locker room or whatever that
caused that?  
JEFF WALZ: No, because we went up seven. It's not like they‑‑ it didn't start
the second half. We come out and go up seven and have an opportunity for a
transition lay‑up and throw it‑‑ just got a little too excited and throw it
out of bounds. I don't think they did anything differently. We missed open
shots. We had a great post move by Sara Hammond that's halfway down and comes
out, Shoni gets a great three on the wing that goes in and out. We
unfortunately went for about a four‑minute stretch where we could not get the
ball to go in the basket.  
  
Q. Just talk about Shoni, what she's meant to this program, and sort of the
last few years what she's brought to Louisville basketball.  
JEFF WALZ: You know, it's been a great four years. If she's not one of the top
10 players in the country, top five, I'm not sure what everybody is looking
at. You know, the kid loves the game. She loves to play basketball. That's
what she does. She's been extremely coachable. She's developed her game. I
asked her to work on her pull‑up jump shot this summer, and she did. That
really helped her game.  
She's going to go down as‑‑ her and Angel are the two best players as of right
now that have played here. She took us to a Final Four, to a national
championship game, and it's unfortunate that it had to end tonight the way it
did, but she's meant a lot to not just our program but the city, the fan
support, the amount of people. It's not just us. When we go on road games, the
amount of natives that come out and her and Jude have inspired, it's been a
remarkable story all season long. When you sit there after games and you're
signing autographs when you're at Memphis out by the bus for an hour after the
game, you know, all of our players are, and they're coming up in busloads from
Mississippi because that's the closest game that we played.  
It comes down to the game of basketball, it's wins and losses. There's no
question about it. That's what we're here to do. But this year for our program
it's been a lot more than just that, just seeing how our players have been
able to inspire so many, it's been a wonderful experience.

_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  

Maryland  76  
Louisville  73

  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, what a great game, just a phenomenal environment. I know
the fans probably didn't enjoy the outcome, but you can't ask for a better
game when you talk about the fans and how many were here. Obviously two teams
you saw battle. Coach Walz and his team battled for 40 minutes when it comes
down to a possession, but I think the biggest thing for our team, what I'm so
proud of is the fact that we had to grow as a team to get to this point, and
to be able to see all of the lessons that we had learned, the sacrificing,
just being prepared for your moment, to be able to see it unfold before your
very eyes is going to be something that each and every one of us is going to
remember for a lifetime.  
Only appropriate, obviously, with everything that Alyssa has done for this
team and this program, that we take her and our five seniors to be able to go
to Nashville.  
  
Q. Alyssa, with as much as you accomplished in your career, now you can add
a Final Four. What does that mean to you personally?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: Oh, man, something that I've been wanting for four years, but
we're not done yet. We've still got two more games, and hopefully we can get
this national championship.  
  
Q. Alyssa, Brenda mentioned the great environment that was here tonight. Was
the environment kind of everything you expected it to be, taking into account
how the environment was in the regional semifinal there? Is that something you
weren't surprised when you saw?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: Yeah, we weren't surprised at all. It was everything we
expected and what we wanted. We wanted to be the people that were cutting the
nets down at the end, and we just wanted to silence the crowd.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that final few seconds, particularly when Shoni
Schimmel gets that last shot up? What were you thinking and your thoughts when
you saw it bounce off?  
KATIE RUTAN: Well, we chose to double her, but they threw a great pass and she
got that. Just thank God Mincy was there to contest that because that ball
went up and I'm pretty sure that ball took about 25 minutes to go through the
air. But then just seeing it just bounce out, I mean, and then the buzzer hit,
I don't have words. Like I just‑‑ my whole life went blank for a second.  
ALYSSA THOMAS: I think it was probably the longest three seconds, and I spent
that three seconds on the ground watching the shot go up. I was just glad to
see it hit the rim and go out.  
LEXIE BROWN: I mean, they said it all. She had hitback‑to‑back crazy‑wild
clutch shots, so for her to‑‑ it was a great look, and all I could do was pray
that it didn't go in, but when that buzzer sounded I went running to go jump
on the first teammate I could find.  
  
Q. Lexie, did Coach say anything to you to prepare you for the crowd and the
noise and how do you drown it out with so many thousands of fans screaming at
you?  
LEXIE BROWN: She just said to stay poised. The crowd will feed off of your
body language, so if you show them that they're bothering you, they're going
to bother you. The only thing that you can do to silence them is to score and
to get stops, and that's what we did.  
  
Q. Alyssa, you're playing a familiar opponent in Notre Dame. Does it help a
little you know who you're playing and probably have a couple scouting reports
from a couple months ago?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: It does, especially we had them at home, and we let it slip
away. We let them get up early on us before, but we're a different team now,
and we're looking forward to the match‑up.  
  
Q. Katie, four threes for today. Was there any indication going into the
game that you were feeling good about your stroke?  
KATIE RUTAN: I had a good shootaround and a good coach with Coach B and Coach
Atkins and Coach Langley before the game and Sue, and so my mindset was if I
saw an opening I was going to take it. I play every game like it's my last,
and I'm going to do anything I can. It takes a lot to step up and hit those
threes in a game like this with a crowd like that, but those are moments that
you live for, so that's all I could think about was seeing that ball go
through the net.  
  
Q. For Alyssa and Lexie, the first half Louisville's defense, what was
discussed in the locker room in terms of really trying to beat that in the
second half and really trying to overcome that?  
LEXIE BROWN: We just had to kind of settle down. I think we were playing into
what they wanted, which was a lot of junk defense and a lot of extra
physicality that was unnecessary, but we kind of had to get our minds right,
slow down, get back to our game, run transition and get stops.  
ALYSSA THOMAS: We're just getting set up on the offensive end and they were
swiping at the ball, and we just had to cut down on the turnovers and try to
capitalize and score.  
  
Q. Lexie, Brenda mentioned that this team has grown throughout the season,
and four of your past six losses have come on the road, some of them in
hostile environments, especially the Duke match ‑up. What do you think has
grown about this team to be able to pull out a win in front of such a big
crowd in such a hostile environment?   
LEXIE BROWN: I just think we've got a renewed focus. We really have come
together as a team these past couple weeks. We've been spending a lot of time
with each other. We've been really getting our chemistry right on the court
and practices we've been working hard for each other and we just have this
new‑found trust and now we have a common goal and we've reached it, so now we
can only go up from here.  
  
Q. Lexie, you were like ice at the foul line down the stretch. I'd like to
ask you how you felt that pressure, if you were thinking about it and that
sort of thing, and I'd like to ask Alyssa and Katie what it was like for you
to watch your freshman guard at the line in a clutch moment like that.  
LEXIE BROWN: Free throws are free shots. It's really about focus. You've got
to tune out the crowd. I think the best thing that Coach B would bring us a
stroke called free throw ladder, and it's the same kind of pressure in
practice, but instead of not scoring any points you got 15, 20 line sprints. I
would take the pressure in a game over free throw ladder any day.  
ALYSSA THOMAS: We have complete confidence in our freshmen. I mean, they're in
the game in the tight minutes and making plays for us. I wouldn't have it any
other way.  
KATIE RUTAN: I agree with Alyssa. As Lexie is my shooting partner, I have to
give her a little extra moments, but if the ball is in Lexie's hand I'm more
than confident than anything. I don't think she's a freshman anymore. She
doesn't play like this. She doesn't hold herself as it. To see her on the
line, I just knew it was two easy points, and I knew she was going to hit it
no doubt.  
  
Q. Take us through what you said to your team to kind of prepare them for
the crowd out there and the hostile environment.  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, the last couple days I can't say enough for our staff
in terms of the teamwork and obviously all season in terms of what our staff
has done to prepare this team. You know, we really got them to buy into
welcoming the environment, embracing it, being excited, being able to silence
them, being able to get them to boo against you, and really just enjoy it.  
If this was three months ago we wouldn't have been prepared or been in this
place, but just to see this team grow, the trust level, the confidence level
was really special to be able to watch.  
  
Q. There's a chance if Carolina holds on this could be a very similar
situation with three ACC teams you've already played. Does it help you to play
familiar teams that you already know, sort of take some of that out of it?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know, there was a lot of déjà‑vu going on these last
couple days. I've already had that feeling in terms of feeling that us and
Carolina could advance, three ACC teams. It brings back special memories
obviously from 2006. And really the teamwork is the same, when you talk about
your players and your staff and your support staff, very similar to '06 in
terms of just being lined up together.  
  
Q. I know you said before that everyone knows your name now after you beat
Tennessee. Clearly everyone is talking the UConn ‑Notre Dame match‑up for the
championship game. It's the hype, it's already been said that's what's
happening. Does it make it easier, you guys are there, there isn't the
pressure with the underdog in that game?   
BRENDA FRESE: I love it. I love it. It's par for the course. You know,
continue to talk and we'll just try to fly under the radar and just be who we
are. Nobody expected us to be able to walk in here in front of 15,000‑plus
fans to be able to pull off this upset. It's easy to say that a team should
win on their home court, but this team just keeps believing and they just keep
staying grounded, and we'll just continue to be true to ourselves.  
  
Q. The game was so fast ‑paced throughout, there was a lot of turnovers from
both teams. You guys had 15 turnovers in the first half. When a game is going
back and forth like that so quickly, what do you say to your team to kind of
calm their nerves or make sure you guys get more solid possessions throughout
a game?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think one of the biggest adjustments that we made as a staff
was at halftime when we settled our team down, and then really getting‑‑ every
time‑out we went into talking about ball reversals and being patient. I
thought we were too quick to get the first pass, to be able to go attack, to
go have aggressive pressure that was going on the ball. Making them have to
defend for a longer period of time, the ball reversals, the screening action
we had taking place off the ball reversals was huge.  
  
Q. The kids said what was going through their head the last three seconds.
What was going through your head? Did you think of fouling?  
BRENDA FRESE: There was. Even leading up to that when Alyssa was at the foul
line, our staff talked about‑‑ when I saw her two threes that went in,
absolutely that was my thought, do we foul? Took it into the huddle with the
team, asked them. It's their team. They're going to decide the end, and they
chose not to foul. They wanted to go straight up in terms of what they were
doing. Obviously it paid off for us.

_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  
JEFF WALZ: First off, we're just thrilled to still be having the opportunity
to play. You know, to be playing in a regional championship with eight teams
left, I think it speaks volumes about this group of young women that we have
here that represent our University. The amount of effort, work and dedication
that they've put into this program has been very much appreciated not only by
me but by all of our fans. They've been a great group to coach, and hopefully
we can continue this, but we do know we have a tall task at hand tomorrow
night against a very talented Maryland team that made Tennessee look bad.  
I don't think it's anything that Tennessee did not do in yesterday's game, I
think it was everything that Maryland did. I was so impressed with how well
they rebound the basketball, how they push the ball in transition, did
everything they needed to do to set the tempo of the game and did not let up.  
So we know that tomorrow night should be a lot of fun, should be a great
environment here. Hopefully we can get 13,000 or 14,000 to come out and see a
great women's basketball game. That's what it's all about, two great teams
playing for the opportunity to play in a Final Four.  
I know we're going to be prepared. We're going to play hard, and we're
excited. Thank you.  
  
Q. Shoni, what do you remember about the last time Maryland and Louisville
played, and do you take anything from that game that you can apply to tomorrow
night?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: You know, I remember playing them my sophomore year, and we
didn't rebound there at the end, and we were up by four at one point, and we
ended up losing. You remember that because it's the last time you guys played.
You don't usually play each other until it's tournament time. You take that
and you remember it and you take it like‑‑ you remember it but at the same
time you've got to move forward with it and you've got to go out on the court
and just continue to keep getting better. Now we have the opportunity to play
against each other again. It's going to be a great game. It's going to be
exciting.  
  
Q. Asia and maybe Bria, what do you think about matching up with Alyssa and
what kind of challenges will she present for either of you or for anybody on
the team?  
ASIA TAYLOR: Well, she's a great player, and we know that. Just from watching
film on her, we're going to get all her tendencies down and what she likes to
do. I don't think you can ever hold a great player scoreless, but you can do
everything in your power to make every bucket that they do score harder than
the previous game. So we're just going to try to take away what she likes to
do and play good scouting report defense and we'll be fine.  
BRIA SMITH: Yeah, definitely going off what Asia says, we're just going to
find out her tendencies and pretty much try to take those things away from
her. I think that it's going to be very difficult because she's such a great
scorer, and she's a hard worker. But we're up for the challenge.  
  
Q. For you two and Sara, not only does she handle the ball well, she can
pass out if you do collapse on her. How dangerous does that make her and how
aware do you have to be of the other guards and bigs when she's not getting
the ball out of her hands?  
SARA HAMMOND: Well, I think that's what makes their team so good. I think
that's why they're doing so good right now is they're having other players
step up, and obviously when you have your all‑American in Alyssa Thomas
playing at the top of her game and you have your other teammates around you
playing their best basketball, they've proven they deserve to be where they're
at right now in the Elite 8. So it is going to be challenging, but I think our
coaches are doing a tremendous job in helping us in film and knowing what
their tendencies are, what their strengths are. But people like Mincy and
Brown who are stepping up in the guard positions, like you said, when she
kicks it out, that's another threat that we have to be aware of. I think we
just have to contain her, pick her up early in transition and not allow her to
see the floor and let her do what she normally does. It is going to be
challenge, but I think our team is up to it and our coaches are going to
definitely have us prepared.  
ASIA TAYLOR: Pretty much just the same thing. We just want to play good
scouting report defense. We trust our coaches are going to have us ready,
prepared, and we just have to follow that game plan.  
  
Q. Shoni, just before we came to the press conference we got word that you
were a USBWA All ‑American. What's that mean to you, that you kind of
officially got that, that you're considered among the top 10 players in the
country and got that prestigious honor?   
SHONI SCHIMMEL: It's a great honor. I've put a lot of hard work in, especially
this last year, so for it to all pay off in the end, it's a great feeling.
Especially where we are right now, it's kind of like, oh, yeah, that's cool,
but at the same time we still have an Elite 8 game to go play. So it's
exciting, and it's a great honor. But I'm ready to play this next game.  
  
Q. Shoni and anyone else, a year ago you played for a trip for Final Four on
someone else's court. Now the idea of being at home where you are, I think, 18
‑1 this season, what's that comfort level like and what kind of a confidence
does it bring?   
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I think it's going to help us a lot, just because we're at
home and the fans are going to be behind us. We have a great fan base, and so
for them to support us throughout every game this season and so forth, like
it's going to be great for us. We're looking forward to playing. It's not just
our fans getting excited. We're excited to play. We're playing in an Elite 8
game, and we're looking forward to it, and we're just ready to play already.  
We still have focus and we still have to take care of business, and that's
going to be on our part. Our coaches are going to do a great job of preparing
us, and we have to go out there and stay true to the game plan.  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: Just going off what Shoni says, our coaches are going to
have us prepared, just following the scouting report, playing scouting report
defense, hopefully taking care of business at home, hopefully in front of
20,000‑‑  
JEFF WALZ: We'd be okay with that.  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: Just giving back to our fans.  
  
Q. Sara, tomorrow is sort of a second senior night for a lot of these
players, and especially Tia and Nita will be playing their last game in
Louisville, Louisville kids. What does it mean to see Louisville players at
Louisville and being an in ‑state player, as well, kind of seeing what they've
meant to the city and the program?   
SARA HAMMOND: Yeah, just being an in‑state player, it means a lot to us. It's
personal because our family is here, and they get to watch us every chance
they get here in the Yum! Center. I know for Nita and Tia, they've meant a lot
to this program and to this city of Louisville just because like you said
they're from here and they're representing their families, their communities.
I'm excited that they get to play one last game here in the Yum! Center. I'm
sure they were disappointed like we all were in the result we got for senior
night, and I'm just grateful and thankful that they have another opportunity
to play here in front of our fans, in front of their family again, and
hopefully we get a win for them. Not only Nita and Tia, but Shoni and Asia,
all four seniors, we want them to go out with a win.  
  
Q. Bria, has coach discussed with you at all his history at Maryland and
what kind of background, coming up and winning a national championship at
Maryland, has that been discussed at practice and how do you approach getting
a chance to play his former team?  
BRIA SMITH: That hasn't really been discussed. I feel like the motivation
basically is just‑‑ it's an Elite 8 game, and we just want to get out there
and play our hardest because our goal is to get to the Final Four.  
  
Q. Coach, you've played opening round NCAA games in this arena before, but
this is your first go ‑around to host a Sweet 16 and an Elite 8. How much
different is it for your team when you're basically at home just with a
different floor in your arena?   
JEFF WALZ: Well, you pretty much stay with the same routine. Times change. You
don't get the exact shoot‑around time that you normally always have. But
besides that, everything is pretty much the same. Our players are staying in
their dorm rooms. We aren't staying in a hotel. It's not what we do. I mean,
you get the opportunity to play a game at home in the NCAA Tournament, the
reason you do that is so you have the comforts of home, so why would I want to
stick them in a hotel?  
And I've got a group of players that I feel are mature enough to handle the
distractions that might come with that. It's pretty much everything same as
we've always done, just some time changes.  
  
Q. Brenda said she knew right away you'd be a star at your next stop. Can
you talk about what you learned from her maybe, and is there an advantage or
disadvantage of knowing a tendency of a coach you worked with for so many
years?  
JEFF WALZ: You know, it's been seven years, so a lot has changed with both of
our programs, the personnel, you know, things that we do. It's really, for us,
a year to year. What our personnel presents is how we'll try to play. We don't
play the same way as we did in '09 when we had Angel McCoughtry and Candace
Bingham. Angel pretty much just stole it when she wanted to half the time. I
don't have that player out there right now, so we have to play a little more
player‑specific defense and know the tendencies of the opponents.  
We have more players right now than can score for us. Our bench is deeper than
what it has been in the past, so we try to take whatever we have that's to our
advantage and make sure we use it.  
The one thing I say is I'm not stubborn in how I coach. I don't have an ego.
If we need to throw it in the post 50 times, we'll throw it in the post. If we
need to shoot 30 threes like we did yesterday, we'll shoot 30 threes. I'm not
claiming to be smart, but I'm not dumb. I'm not going to sit there and say
this is what we have to do if it's not working.  
So we are willing to change up. I had a great six years, a year at Minnesota,
which was an outstanding experience, was fortunate enough to have Brenda hire
me after I spent six years with Paul Sanderford, I go back to Paul, and Paul
is one where I was fortunate enough to just learn a ton of basketball from.
The man should be in the women's basketball Hall of Fame, and unfortunately
for some reason he's not. He only took three teams at western Kentucky to
Final Fours. So hopefully somebody in women's basketball might figure that
out.  
And I learned a lot of basketball from that man. Seeing how he handled himself
during games, not worried about the first 10 minutes of the game of running
something if you're going to score, more so how are they defending it. So in a
time‑out you make an adjustment.  
And then Brenda gave me the opportunity to come join her at Minnesota, and it
was a great experience. Brenda is a coach, and I've said it all along, we had
the opportunity to work together for six years, one at Minnesota, five at
Maryland, and she has no ego when it comes to the game. She allowed me to
coach. She gave me the freedom to do some basketball things that I learned
from Paul. I learned a ton about recruiting from her. She was relentless when
it came to recruiting.  
She was doing it before most head coaches were. She'd miss four or five days
of practice and go out on the road recruiting, knowing, hey, we have to get
better players if we're going to want to compete with Dukes when we first got
there, and then she was confident enough to say, all right, hey, my staff
that's back here, you guys take care of practice. We obviously discussed with
her what we were doing. Erica Floyd at the time, Brenda's sister Marsha, then
Marsha moved on and Joanna Bernabei joined our staff. She was confident enough
to hire people that were good at what they did and allowed us to do it, and
that's not always the case. There's some that are like, hey, I want the reins
of all of it, and I think those are the ones that you see that aren't as
successful as Brenda has been.  
She does a great job with her players. There's no doubt there's a lot of
respect there. They play hard for her. She motivates them. I was fortunate to
get into a situation where she was confident in herself, and at the same time
I knew I was an assistant. I wasn't trying to take over. That's not what I
wanted to do.  
But because she allowed me to do so much, it helped me get this job, because
that's one thing when I asked Tom Jurich why did you hire me, he's like, hey,
I was able to see what you were doing during games even as an assistant, and
not everybody allows you to do that, and Brenda was comfortable enough in her
own skin to say, hey, we want to win, and she allowed me to do some of those
things, and that's why I've been‑‑ I've had the opportunity to be here, and I
try to do the same thing with my staff. We've had three of my assistants now
move on to be head coaches in the past seven years. The past two years we've
had one turn over, and we don't have assistants going on to take other
assistant jobs. They're going on to take head coaching jobs, which I think
speaks volumes for our program and for how I try to treat my assistants,
because I want them to have as much responsibility and as much into this as I
do.  
  
Q. You saw Alyssa Thomas score 33 in such a big game yesterday. You see how
she's been able to perform. She had 32 against Wake Forest in the ACC
Tournament, these big games of her career. It's another big stage for her.
What's the plan to make sure she doesn't go 30?  
JEFF WALZ: I'm hoping she misses the bus, which would be great. So we're going
to change the arrows down there where their bus is supposed to be before they
come to the arena, first off.  
She's not a kid that you're going to shut down. It's just not going to happen.
What you have to do is just try to make it difficult for her to score. You
can't give her easy looks. She doesn't miss the easy shots, and she makes a
lot of the tough ones.  
So for us we have to make sure we're making it as difficult as we can for her
to score the basketball, and then we have to do a good job on everybody else.
I think at times you get caught up on the star player, and all of a sudden
you're giving wide‑open shots to other ones that start going in, and now all
of a sudden you've got five or six players that you're really out there trying
to defend, and now you really can't focus that attention on her, and she goes
for 30, which is what I thought she did last night.  
Laurin Mincy stepped in, came in off the bench and hit two big shots for them.
Lexie Brown was playing very well. And now Alyssa Thomas is one‑on‑one, and
you can't stop that kid one‑on‑one; it's about impossible.  
What she did last night, I've seen her do it before on film, and now that I've
had the opportunity to watch some film, she's pretty impressive.  
  
Q. You mentioned not being able to stop Alyssa Thomas. The last time you
played you limited her to six points. Is there anything you can take away from
that game that you can apply defensively to her this time?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, that was when she was a sophomore. She's had two years to
really work on her game, and she's done that. You know, she's not the same
player she was as a sophomore in college. If she was, then I'd feel good that
we could hold her to about 10, but unfortunately she's really worked on all
aspects of her game.  
I have gone back and looked at that film, trying to see what we did to her,
how we frustrated her, but unfortunately I don't think it's going to be as
easy tomorrow night.  
  
Q. When you look at how Jude's game has matured, what she means to you when
she comes on the floor, and just kind of gets you guys settled, makes the
right decisions, and then watching Shoni not just always go to the three, the
mid ‑range game, the ability to cut down the turnovers, that kind of thing,
how have you watched their games improve? Was that all part of the game plan
or just take them will care of business?   
JEFF WALZ: You know, it's all about film work, it's all about sitting down
with players and trying to develop them as they get older and mature. For
Shoni, it's all about time and score, and that's one thing that I think she
has really grown into, the knowledge of that. When you go back to her freshman
year, she wanted to win so bad, which all freshmen do. They all want to try to
win basketball games, and don't always do it in the best way. You're down
eight and they're coming down the floor firing up shots, and it's like,
there's no such thing as an eight‑point shot.  
Now we get down eight, ten, it's, hey, let's relax, people. Let's get the ball
inside out, let's get a good shot and then let's come up with a stop. Those
are the things that she's really grown into.  
Her passing, which I think you saw in yesterday's game. Starting off the game
there were some simple chest passes, bounce passes, and then we get a little
bit of lead and then she throws the behind‑the‑back pass to Jude, she lays it
in, and the whole place goes crazy. Those are big plays for us, too, but I
really have a hard time thinking if it would have been like a two‑ or
four‑point game that she tries to throw that pass because she had Antonita
Slaughter slicing down on the right, I think she just drops the pass to
Antonita for a lay‑up. Knowing time and score is really important for Shoni.  
Jude is just playing with a lot of confidence. Jude has the ability, the
basketball IQ, that is probably as high as any player that I've coached. She
understands the game. She's always asking questions. She's the type of kid
that can go out there, I can put her on somebody, she'll get beat once, but
she's not going to get beat twice with the same move. And that takes some
talent and some still because you've got to be able to adjust in the middle of
a game.  
I thought in yesterday's game when she went out there and went on Ballard, she
actually did a great job. Did she score, yes, but she also disrupted a lot of
things that she was trying to do, which made it harder for her to score.  
So Jude is very, very important to this basketball team. She also has the
ability to knock down some open shots, and when she does that, it just spreads
everything out.  
She had a great drive and dish to Antonita in the first half that kind of
started our run. We're expecting the same type of play out of her tomorrow
night.  
  
Q. Do you expect to put Taylor or Smith on Thomas?  
JEFF WALZ: All five. We're going to put all five on her and leave the other
ones wide open and see if they're in such awe that they just miss shots. You
know, we're actually still debating on what we're going to do, but come 7:00
tomorrow we will have a plan. You know, will it work, I'm not sure yet, but
that's one thing that I feel good about is we will come with a game plan. Our
kids will execute that game plan, and then if it's not working, like I said,
I'm not stubborn enough to stay in it; we'll switch. We might have to go
through three or four game plans until we figure out what can slow her up. But
our ultimate goal is to try to get that done before it's too late.  
  
Q. With this being your second trip to the Elite 8 after last year's Final
Four and the team a few years back that went to the Final Four, do you think
it's safe to say that Louisville women's basketball is firmly in the
conversation when it comes to the elite teams in the country?  
JEFF WALZ: I would hope so. I mean, we've had the opportunity, besides UConn
and Notre Dame, we're the only team that's played for two national
championships in the past five years. So I think that puts us with a pretty
good group of teams right there.  
That's not Baylor, that's not Tennessee. You're looking at Louisville, UConn
and Notre Dame, which I still go back, and I'm very proud to be in the AAC
right now, but you look at the teams that used to be in the Big East, boy, I
still argue that the Big East was the best women's basketball conference for
years.  
You've got three of us right now, the old Big East teams again playing in
Elite 8 games with a chance to go to a Final Four. We've had that experience
of playing some great basketball teams, so we know tomorrow is going to be a
battle. But it's one that our kids have been through before.  
  
Q. Can you kind of summarize thinking back on the careers of the two
Louisville players that are on the team and who will be playing their last
game in Louisville tomorrow night, Tia and Nita, and what has it kind of meant
that you've had those two local players and the accomplishments they've had?  
JEFF WALZ: It's been great. You know, it's something we really don't sit here
right now and look back on and try to bring some tears and all that good
stuff. I mean, we have a game to play tomorrow. That's really all we're
focused on. Having even thought about the fact that it's their last home game
for sure because our goal is to get to Nashville. That's been our goal from
day one when the season started.  
And now we've got the opportunity to play a great Maryland team on our home
court with the chance to do that. You know, that's our focus. That's our
complete focus. Haven't even thought about anything else. All of our seniors
have meant an unbelievable amount to our program. Tia has been here about as
long as I have, going on year six as a player. She got her clock extended
because of all the injuries that she's had. It's remarkable that she's been
able to make it through this year. I mean, I don't think people have any idea
what she's gone through, just her body, the aches, the bruises, the pain, but
she's figured out a way to do it.  
Antonita with the scare that we had in December, just so fortunate and very
blessed that she's even able to come back and play.  
So we've had‑‑ these kids have dealt with a lot and been through a lot. It's a
great group of young women, and we're going to miss all the seniors for sure,
and I know these two have meant a lot to this program and this city because
they are from Louisville.

BRENDA FRESE: Obviously we're happy to still be playing. As you've seen in our
last couple games, I mean, it's been against really rugged opponents, and we
expect more of the same in our next game out. Obviously getting to a regional
final, you've had a really, really good season, but I know this team wants so
much more.  
I was really impressed with the fans that we saw come out on Sunday. You can
tell how much support that they have for their team, and it's really how
college basketball is supposed to be. I know for us, Tuesday night is going to
be a fun environment to be able to play in front of so many fans.  
Clearly Schimmel is the star of the show. So much fun for fans to be able to
watch. But as you look at Louisville's team they have a lot of other really,
really good parts. Didn't get to see Louisville much in the regular season. We
didn't have really many common opponents, didn't come across much film with
them. But I kind of liken them, they're somewhat similar, I think, to their
team in 2012 when we played them in the NCAA Tournament.  
I think it's great in terms of what Jeff has been able to accomplish here. So
proud of him. I knew when we worked together that he would be a star. We went
through a lot obviously in our four years together. I can think back to our
first season when we went down and played Duke and got drilled by them by 51
points, and four years later we were standing on the podium to be able to win
a national championship.  
So that whole staff, including Jeff, was a very important part of our success,
and it was a really fun time for us as a program.  
I think the biggest thing when you look at what Jeff and I have done, we've
taken our programs to this status. You take about that inevitably our paths
were going to cross. The reality is we've continued to cross on numerous
occasions, but the reality is only one team gets to move on to Nashville. I
think where you're looking at both teams, both teams are playing extremely
well. That's where you should be playing if you're an Elite 8 team, and I know
both teams are going to be ready to play tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Alyssa, what do you remember about the last time you played Louisville? I
think they held you to six points. Do you take anything from that going into
this game?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: Yeah, that was my sophomore year, and they just came in and
tried to take me out early and get in my head. I'm definitely a different
player from back then, so I'll be interested to see what happens.  
  
Q. Alyssa, you play at a regional final, usually you're going to be playing
in a very tough environment. Talk about playing Louisville, they had 10,000
plus yesterday, 11,000, going to be a lot of people, probably going to be
pretty hostile. Do you kind of expect that at this point of the season, and
how do you deal with that?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: Yeah, we were there yesterday and just the environment that
they had, the fans were great, very loud. We're definitely expecting that
tomorrow, and looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Katie, as a senior can you speak to what it means to you to be in the
Elite 8 and the opportunity that's in front of you?  
KATIE RUTAN: I mean, of course being one of the last eight teams is one of the
greatest feelings you'll ever have, and going out your senior year, us five
seniors, this is all we have left and we put everything into it every day, and
we try to show that through in practice and games to our underclassmen and to
whoever is watching. Not many people get this moment, and you have to
appreciate it and just be humble with it.  
  
Q. Alicia, Brenda mentioned it would be another rugged team you're playing
in the tournament. The past two games it's been really tough battles inside.
What do you anticipate going into this game?  
ALICIA DeVAUGHN: From here on out, all our games we're going to be playing are
going to be a physical game, so I think it's just match the physicality and
not just give in and not give up, just got to play hard and play good.  
  
Q. Alyssa, coming off of yesterday's game, career game in some senses for
you. How much confidence does that give you going into tomorrow, and then what
do you kind of think about that you have stepped up and played these great
games on some of the biggest stages with the most on the line?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: It's just good to see your shot falling on this court. Tomorrow
is just about letting the game come to you and not forcing anything.  
  
Q. The last time Louisville and Maryland played, Maryland had to overcome
some foul trouble. Is that something you're focusing on to make sure you don't
get into foul trouble early so you can stay in the game?  
BRIONNA JONES: Definitely that's going to be a focus for this game, trying to
stay out of foul trouble so everybody can be in the game and play, so we have
all the pieces that we need.  
  
Q. Katie and Lexie, Louisville shoots the three so well and they knocked
down a bunch yesterday. What do you have to do to try to attack them and keep
them from getting into a rhythm from outside the arc?  
KATIE RUTAN: Well, we have to be on attack. Obviously we can't give them the
space they need, so it's more focusing on being there on the catch and not
giving them the easy open looks. When they're open they can hit shots easy,
but to be in them it's going to make the game tougher for them and their shots
a lot tougher.  
LEXIE BROWN: Yeah, going with what Katie said, it's going to be all about our
communication on the defensive end, switches when necessary, and we just have
to be all up in their face before they can even get a shot off, and it's going
to turn into a mental thing to make sure that they don't get any shots off.  
  
Q. Brionna or Katie, were you aware that Jeff Walz was an assistant at
Maryland? Is that something that comes up? It's been seven years since he's
been at Louisville, but is that something that you guys were aware of or that
people in the program are aware of?  
KATIE RUTAN: Yeah, just knowing the history of Maryland basketball and when
they won, you know who was there, who was a part of it, and he was one of the
major parts of that team.  
Just hearing from Coach Frese the history they had together, he's a great
coach, and when he was at Maryland he made his mark.  
  
Q. Alyssa, what do you feel like makes this such a tough match ‑up for teams
now, the four years that you've been doing it? Why is it that you feel like
you've really ascended to the level that you are and that you are as hard to
defend as you are?   
ALYSSA THOMAS: I think just my versatility, being able to play inside,
outside. I can take it off the bounce, and just am able to hit the open
player, that it's not just all about getting my shot.  
  
Q. Is it an advantage or a disadvantage when you're playing against someone
you worked with for so long? You know his tendencies, he may know yours. How
does that work?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, yeah, obviously I think we both know‑‑ I mean, when
I'm watching film and I see some of the different sets, we've run them at
Maryland. So I think we can both on the sideline understand kind of what's
coming next and fully can prepare our team.  
But at the end of the day, it's the players. I mean, yeah, as coaches we have
our programs, and I'm very proud of everything that Jeff has accomplished.
That's part of our tree and where he got one of his starts. But this game
belongs to the players. Every step of the way that we've gone, it's been about
the players taking the game plan and the scout and executing it, and I really
think it's obviously going to come down to that tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Your depth must be a luxury for you after all you've gone through with
the injuries, and you talk about it's all about the players, the joy that they
show to be able to be healthy, give you guys a chance for rotations, it's been
joyful to watch that.  
BRENDA FRESE: Thank you. I would agree. It's been a work in progress. Each and
every player this year has had to sacrifice minutes, roles. You look at Laurin
Mincy, a starter in our program who had to sacrifice this year for the better
of the team to be able to come off the bench for us. But as you've seen it all
line up together in our run here, it's the true definition of a team. When
you're allowed, like we've said, we can go two or three deep at every single
position, and when you look at we're really kind of opposite ends of the
spectrum where we were a season ago when we were kind of limping to the finish
line, to get to the Sweet 16, to now what we went through a year ago to be in
this position.  
  
Q. You mentioned you could take some things from I couldn't match ‑up
against Louisville in 2012. What specifically do you think you could take?   
BRENDA FRESE: You know, obviously the physicality is going to be there
obviously from the tip. I thought watching Louisville live last night, they
were even more physical than what I saw on film. Their box‑outs, how they're
going to rebound, in my opinion they're a better rebounding team than
Tennessee. When you talk about that kind of physicality, we saw it back then,
it's been a staple of who they are and it's obviously something that we have
to be prepared for.  
You know, I think any time ‑‑ we've both played each other twice now, we're
1‑1, so obviously we know what to expect.  
  
Q. You mentioned Laurin, she had a huge game last night Louisville and
Maryland played. What kind of contributions do you want to see from her
tomorrow night?  
BRENDA FRESE: Just more of the same. She's come in ready in the first half and
has given us just a huge boost off the bench. I mean, her scoring, her
defense, her toughness, to be able to see Laurin now coming off of her knee
injury at full strength, we knew Laurin would get to this point, we just
didn't know how long it was going to take. To see it all kind of coming at the
right time for her is really special to be able to see.  
  
Q. I know you'd love to be home and playing in front of your fans, and yet
tomorrow will be special. There will be a lot of folks here and some special
kids on both teams. This is what women's basketball needs and is all about,
correct?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah. You know, I'm just going to visualize that sea of red as
for Maryland, that they're screaming for Maryland. But it is; I'm going to
embrace the moment. So is our team. We've worked hard just as Louisville has.
This is what you talk about star power, depth, talent, two evenly matched
teams. It's made for TV, two coaches that have worked together, and you've got
all the drama and all the excitement. We're going to embrace it. We're going
to love every single moment of it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what's your relationship like with Jeff now? How often
do you stay in touch? What's it been like since you guys have moved on and are
no longer on the same staff?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, first of all, I take full credit for all of his success.
I've taught him everything he knows. (Laughter.)  
You know, I mean, Jeff was a huge part of our program. In the four years, I
said before, I knew he'd be a star because his work ethic, how he thought,
really talented. I've been really fortunate just like my current staff to have
great assistant coaches.  
I'm not surprised for Jeff to be able to come in here and have the support.
It's even better coming here to be able to see my first time in the Yum!
Center and the fans and the support that he has, so I'm really, really proud
of him.  
Obviously we cross paths. We're both extremely busy juggling our families as
well as our teams. But we cross paths on the recruiting trails, and we've
recruited some of the same players. But obviously thrilled for him in terms of
the success that he's had.  
  
Q. I believe that was a career high for points yesterday for Alyssa against
Tennessee. Is that a result of a match ‑up or do you let your star players go
at this point of the season?   
BRENDA FRESE: Well, first of all, it was a great day for the Thomas family
that I heard her sister Lexie won the halftime show with musical chairs, so I
think it shows you how competitive their family is.  
Seriously, with Alyssa, our staff has been blessed to be able to watch her for
four years. When you talk about the human spirit and her will to win and how
she elevates everyone to follow her lead, it's incredible to be able to watch.
And I think the thing that separates her as a player is, yes, she puts the
team on her back and makes these incredible runs and plays and finishes and
rebounds, but she also does it within the framework of the team, and like you
saw yesterday, there's times when she knows she needs to give it up. She knows
now she can trust her teammates and the depth we have on this team.  
  
Q. A lot of coaches at this stage might shy away from saying we can win it
all. This team has Final Four written all over it; you will know us after this
game. The boldness, obviously that's you, and the kids kind of extend off
that; is that the mindset, what you bring to the table, or is it just your
personality, and speaking of the last question, you just let her fly?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, I think for any team and any program, you have to have
confidence. You wouldn't be in this position if you didn't. Yeah, you know, if
it comes across as bold, the snippet that you get in a pregame locker room
talk and don't get it all, but yeah, you have to believe it. You have to
believe that you can win the whole thing. You have to believe you can get to a
Final Four. You have to believe you can get to a Sweet 16. You have to believe
you can beat a No.1 seed. If you don't have that mindset, you're not going to
win.  
Fortunately for us, our team has a ton of confidence, and we believe in each
other.

_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  

Louisville  73  
LSU  47

  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to open it up with opening remarks from coach.  
COACH WALZ: First I'd like to just start off by saying thanks to all the fans.
What an environment we had here today for both games.  
That's what I know we're trying to do is get as much publicity, as many fans
as we can to come out and watch women's basketball. I thought our marketing
department, the University of Louisville did a fantastic job.  
I'm expecting an even bigger crowd for Tuesday night, which is only good for
our game.  
I would also like to congratulate LSU on a great year. We understand how
things can be when you lose a few kids to injuries. Unfortunately for them, it
was at a tough time of the year to try to regroup, but I thought they fought.  
I was very impressed with Danielle Ballard. We knew coming into the game
tonight how well she had been playing. She was extremely hard to defend. She's
got a great midrange game and goes to the offensive glass extremely well. So
we had a hard time containing her, but I thought we did a good job on the rest
of their players. That's what gave us the opportunity to win the ball game.  
  
Q. For Tia, what were you doing effectively defensively to wear them out to
cause them to shoot such a low percentage?  
TIA GIBBS: I think we just focused on our pressure. We knew we needed to slow
Ballard down or attempt to as much as we could. I think our post did a great
job on Plaisance. Those are kind of their two go‑to players.  
The rest of us just were playing scouting report defense. We knew what the
other team was going to do, and we tried to prevent them from doing it.  
  
Q. Question for Tia and Shoni. Talk about the hammer you guys have been
laying down in the tournament. Would you have expected that you would have won
by these kinds of margins and be up from start to finish in these games the
way that you have so far? What do you think has contributed to that?  
TIA GIBBS: I think it's just that we don't actually play the score. We won't
let up on people, and we know that there's a lot that we still have to work
on.  
So we can be up 30 with a minute left, and we're getting upset at our players
for doing something wrong. So I think it's just our focus and knowing that we
still need to get better and not play the score.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I think the big thing is we can't take anybody lightly
regardless if there's still eight minutes left in the game. We were the person
last year that everybody didn't expect to win. We know what it's like to be on
the other side.  
We like to keep pushing at it. Regardless of who's winning, we just want to
keep going and keep getting better. Regardless of anything, we still want to
play one more game after the one we're playing in right then and there.  
  
Q. The back ‑to‑back three‑pointers got the team going. What was going
through your mind in terms of just trying to get open for a shot? Were you
thinking about the three? Was it a matter of just maybe trying to answer
Danielle and what she was doing and really just become involved in the
offense?   
TIA GIBBS: I don't think I was trying to answer what she was doing. I was just
trying to provide a spark to the team. Coming off the bench, that's kind of
what our job is to do. Whether it's on defense, making threes, whatever the
case. My teammates did a great job looking for me. They were the ones creating
the open shots by driving and kicking to me.  
It's easy to knock them down when somebody is pulling two people towards them.  
  
Q. Shoni, can you just describe your play so far in this tournament and
today, not just in terms of scoring, but also efficiency.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Yeah. Well, it's tournament time. So it's kind of like if you
win, you're done. That's important to me because I don't think we should lose.
I think we need to come out and play strong every game because, if you lose,
you are done.  
I mean, I'm just letting the game come to me. I'm having fun. It's been a
blast these last couple of games just because we're just enjoying the game of
basketball. I mean, I'm having fun just playing what I love to do.  
  
Q. Shoni, it's an 11 ‑12 game, media time‑out. Then you guys take off on an
11‑2 run. Did Coach Walz say anything that inspired you all go on that run?   
SHONI SCHIMMEL: He probably stuttered a little bit just because that's him.
Coach is always talking to us, getting us ready to go out and play for the
next four minutes until whatever the next media may be.  
He says a lot of great things, but we also as a collective group, as a team,
we talk to each other a lot. We hype each other up. We get out and like, hey,
you've got to do this better. We just talk to each other as a team. We're at a
good point with our team where like we're able to do that with each other.  
  
Q. Shoni, when did you kind of think about ‑‑ I mean, were you aware sort of
that they didn't have very many players? Did you feel like you guys could kind
of take it to them, that they only had eight players available and two
starters out? Did that sort of give you motivation to sort of put the pedal to
the metal against them?   
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Definitely. In the back of your mind, you know that they are
kind of short a team. They lost two players, important players that they
needed. So for us, take advantage of that.  
It wasn't what we strived at, but we also understood, hey, they don't have
these two players. We still have to play Danielle Ballard. We still have to
play Theresa Plaisance, so for us not to take them lightly and just keep going
at them. It definitely helped us. You can overlook somebody, but at the same
time, we didn't do that.  
  
Q. Nita, you are a starter in the game. What do you think about the bench
that you guys have pretty much ‑‑ I don't even know if you're aware of it.
You've almost shut out every team, the reserves have. How important is the
bench to your team compared to how good other benches are for other teams and
how much your bench has outplayed other benches?   
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: Coach actually just read out a crazy stat. It was like 80
points‑‑ yeah, 84‑2\.  
Our bench means a lot to us. It's a team sport. One of us goes down, we need
rest, we've got players on the bench that can come in and just give us a spark
of energy, and that's good to have on a team.  
  
Q. For Antonita, a year ago you all were in that same position as LSU, just
really trying to get everybody to chip in because of injuries. If you could
kind of compare what the mentality is now to then in terms of having everybody
back and how much that's really, really helped you, particularly this time of
year.  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: Yeah, I'd say the mentality last year, no one expected us
to win, so we came together and we did what we did. But this year people know
our name and they know who we are. So we just have to, like Shoni was saying,
not overlook anyone and just leave it all on the court.  
  
Q. Tia, what was your thoughts on the crowd today? 11,000 people here and
getting to play a Sweet 16 game at home with that kind of a crowd. What did
that do for you guys?  
TIA GIBBS: Well, our crowd has been great all season, and our following just
continues to grow. So I don't think we expected nothing less but the 11,000
that we received.  
As you can tell, it kind of provides a spark to us. We take advantage of
having the crowd and playing the Sweet 16 on our home court. Like I said
before, we're very fortunate that our athletic department took a chance and
believed in us that we would make it this far to give us the opportunity to
play‑‑ to have a chance to play on our home court to get to Nashville.  
THE MODERATOR: That's our time with the University of Louisville
student‑athletes. We'll open things up for Coach.  
  
Q. Jeff, compare and contrast Shoni's play this tournament as opposed to
other tournaments.  
COACH WALZ: She always figures out a way to play her best basketball at the
right time of the season. I think you can go back to her freshman year. We
went on the road at Xavier, a 2‑7 game in the second round where we weren't
given much of a chance.  
I can still remember she hit back‑to‑back threes in the last two minutes of
the game on shots that most kids probably aren't going to take. It's a
one‑on‑four fast break, and she's the one. That's kind of how she plays.  
Now I think, as she's gone and gotten older and more mature, she's letting the
game come to her more. I was really impressed. She goes 6 of 13 from the
field. They were doing a really nice job trying to face guard her, trying to
frustrate her, and she didn't force thing. She let the game come to her.  
She did not force any threes, six assists, two turnovers, just a solid
basketball game, and she's been playing that way the entire tournament. So
hopefully, that will continue.  
  
Q. Jeff, obviously, Tuesday night you'll be facing your former team,
Maryland, where you coached at. Your thoughts on that. And what were you
looking for today, knowing that you were going to be facing them? What kind of
effort were you looking for today?  
COACH WALZ: You know what, we haven't even worried about that yet. We haven't
even concerned ourselves about it. I told the kids we're going to enjoy this
for about two hours. We'll go get something to eat together, have some fun and
some laughs, talk about the game.  
Then we'll get together as a coaching staff and start putting together a game
plan, starting to break down some film. We know we're going to have our hands
full. They're a very talented basketball team. They've got great size. Alyssa
Thomas has been playing passionate basketball. She's on a mission to get her
team to a Final Four.  
So we know what's at stake. We understand what we're going to have to do. Now
it's a matter of us being able to put a game plan together to try to slow them
up.  
  
Q. As a followup, any thoughts about facing your former boss on Tuesday
night?  
COACH WALZ: I don't worry about that. It's the third time we played‑‑ we
played each other in the NCAA Tournament, and we're 1‑1\.  
I haven't scored a point since about '92, and I'm not even sure I scored that
year. So it's not about me. I've got to do my job to get these kids prepared
and motivated and confident that on Tuesday night, if we follow a game plan
and go out and execute, then we're going to have a chance to win.  
  
Q. Coach, tonight you faced a rather different post ‑game than is likely to
be the case on Tuesday, in that they had so much height on you, but you still
effectively shut that post‑game down. Maryland, you're more on even footing
with in terms of size‑‑  
COACH WALZ: Have you looked at their size? They've got 6'6" starting, 6'5",
and 6'4". We're at 6'1", and we lie about our height.  
  
Q. You lie?  
COACH WALZ: We're all about 6 foot if we're lucky.  
  
Q. Can we quote you on that?  
COACH WALZ: You sure can. If you ain't cheating, you ain't trying.  
  
Q. But in terms of players who score the most points.  
COACH WALZ: Yes, they have great size in there. Everybody does it with the
media guide. You're always going to make your kids up to be a little bit
taller so they think, oh, gosh, she's 6'2". We don't have that. Sara Hammond
is a good 6'1". Asia Taylor is about 6 foot, 6'1". We know we're going to have
to rebound the basketball. That's my biggest concern.  
You're looking at a ball club that I thought handled Tennessee extremely well
on the defensive glass, stopping them from getting any second chance points,
and that's what Tennessee makes a living off of. Maryland was fantastic with
that.  
And then I thought Alyssa Thomas, in a really important part to the game,
where Tennessee thought they had a little bit of a run going. They get it to
ten, they got it to eight at one point, and she comes back with the offensive
board and stick‑back. Ones that as a coach, you're like, man, if you're on the
other sideline, it's a dagger. It's one you can't have.  
So they are very talented. They're very strong. We're going to have to give
the best effort we've given all season long on boxing out.  
  
Q. If I could just follow on that, with the mobility that Thomas has and the
ball handling skills, which are pretty impressive ‑‑  
COACH WALZ: Oh, yeah.  
  
Q. I know you did a lot of trapping and denial to Plaisance tonight.  
COACH WALZ: They're completely different players. Thomas is playing the three
for them. So she'll post up some, but she's getting most of her work done on
the perimeter, attacking off the dribble.  
Plaisance is a great outside shooter. She really missed Kenney on the floor.
Having a point guard that's a senior that understands the game as well as she
did, she's‑‑ when I watched the film, she was able to pick teams apart. Was
she getting 20 a night? No, but she was‑‑ if you threw in all of her assists
and how she got people to have to guard her because she could shoot the three,
Plaisance really missed her on the floor in this game.  
So Tuesday night, Alyssa Thomas is a completely different player, no question
about it, but they're still going to put the traditional four and five on the
floor that have great size. So we're going to have to make sure we somehow
figure out a way to box out Alyssa Thomas and then both of their big posts.  
  
Q. Jeff, same question I asked the players, but have you been surprised that
margins of victory that you've had, just you've really ‑‑ have you played a
better stretch than you are now? You mentioned, before the tournament, you're
talking about you've tended to think that after the two‑week break, you guys
always sort of peak at the right time. Are you doing that now? Have you been
surprised at just the blowouts you guys have had, 25, 40 points?   
COACH WALZ: I think we're playing really good basketball right now. Did we
look to me exceptionally sharp in the first half in the half‑court? No. I
thought LSU really did good things in trying to confuse us some, trying to
make things a little unorthodox. But I thought we really did a nice job of
just attacking out of transition.  
We had some really nice kick‑outs from our post players for some open threes,
and that really got things going for us. I think the first half we go 7 of 18
from the three‑point line. If you're going to do that, it's going to make
things a little difficult for your opponent, and then it spreads the floor out
for us.  
I mean, I told our team, we didn't have a true post entry pass probably until
about ten minutes left in the game where we actually were posting up on the
low block and then threw a post entry pass. We can't do that on Tuesday night.
We've got to try to go inside out, try to get a presence in the post.  
Not that we're just going to barrel somebody over and dominate them, but Sara
Hammond and Asia Taylor do a great job of reverse pivot, face up, shoot the 10
to 12‑foot shot. Those are things that we have to do in the post because we
have to have a post presence in order for us to be successful.  
  
Q. Is your team playing its best basketball these last couple of games? And
if so, why?  
COACH WALZ: It's not that we're playing our best basketball. I mean, we're
winning by larger margins than we have in the past. I've had a lot of people
say, well, why couldn't you guard like this all year? Why couldn't you guard‑‑
because we can't.  
For six games, they let me coach them. I mean, they let me, when they don't do
it right at practice, boy, I'm on them. I'm demanding it from them, and you
can't do that the entire season. It's not what they're going to be able to
handle.  
So we go play some people, and we're up 25, and instead of putting the hammer
down and winning by 40, we give up a 7‑0 run. So now it's 8 with two minutes
left. Well, I tell my assistants all the time, relax, we're going to win, it's
okay.  
So there's time and places when you can push your players to try to get the
most out of them, and because we've had success here in the postseason, and I
think we've done fairly well, my kids know, okay, the conference tournament's
over. Coach is going on his mission, stay out of his way, and they let me do
it because they want to win. They know what the prize is at the end.  
Does it guarantee we're going to win every game? No, it sure doesn't. If that
was the case, we'd have two National Championships here, but they go into it
with such more focus.  
I mean, you look at this tonight, we held them to 23 and 24 points in each
half. I mean, Plaisance goes 1 for 13, Harden goes 1 for 11. Ballard is
phenomenal, there's no question about it. I was so impressed with her and have
been on film. So I was like, guys, we're not going to be able to shut her
down. We've just got to try to make it hard on her, but we've got to be able
to shut everybody else down, which is what I thought our kids did, and they
did a great job of that.  
In the past, we might get up 18 or 19 and then we allow Plaisance to hit
back‑to‑back threes. We give Harden, who I think is a great three‑point
shooter‑‑ our number one goal was to run her off the three‑point line. You've
got to make her put it on the ground. We did a fantastic job of that. These
ladies did an unbelievable job of that.  
During the regular season, it's very possible we probably would have given her
two threes too. Now they're honed in, and they know personnel. That's what
makes us, I think, a very talented and good basketball team right now.  
  
Q. Jeff, how have Asia and Tia helped make this team what it was this season
separate from what it was last season?  
COACH WALZ: They add depth to us. They add depth. When you're able to bring
Tia Gibbs off the bench and she gets us 15 points in 16 minutes of play, it's
pretty special.  
Asia brings us some athleticism that she can play inside out. She comes up
with 10 boards tonight, 3 assists, 1 turnover, really causes a little bit of a
mismatch problem because she rebounds it so well, but then you're going to
have to defend her at about 15 to 18 feet.  
It's still‑‑ I mean, you know, we've got to get Sara going right now. We're
running out of games to get her going. So I'm going to talk to her tonight and
tomorrow, just how important she is to our ball club. The past two games, if
you had told me that offensively she would have had the output that she's had
and we still won, I would have doubted you.  
So we're very fortunate to have some bench players and some other players that
are stepping up to take more responsibility while Sara's in a little bit of a
slump, is what I would call it. There's no doubt in my mind she'll get in the
gym tomorrow, we'll have a great practice, and I'd be shocked if Sara Hammond
had three games where she struggled at the offensive end of the floor.  
Thank you, everybody.

LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONALS+SEMIFINALS+%26+FINALS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 30, 2014

  

### [Cierra Burdick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24841)

### [Meighan Simmons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24840)

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

  
_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  

Maryland  73  
Tennessee  62

  
HOLLY WARLICK: I'm just sad that that was Meighan's last game, and we're going
to miss her. She's done a hell of a job for our program, and I know she's
going to go on and do great things. Got beat by a better basketball team
today.  
  
Q. In the second half Meighan showed her will and her heart for the
University of Tennessee. What has it been like to play with Simmons this year
and last year and the years you've been here?  
CIERRA BURDICK: I think Meg is a competitor. She's going to compete every
single time she steps in between those lines. Meg just wants the best for the
team. She wants to win. She's had a great career here we're definitely going
to miss her. She's going to go on and do some great things and represent the
lady volume program. In 10 or 15 years down the road, we're all going to have
the opportunity to say that we played with Meighan Simmons. Probably one of
the best scorers to ever play the game, and we're going to miss her.  
  
Q. Cierra, you guys have played a lot of strong, physical teams in the SEC
and you were able to prevail against them. What was the difference against
Maryland today which seemed to dominate inside, especially early?  
CIERRA BURDICK: They just out‑willed us. They out‑muscled us. Like Holly said,
they were the better basketball team today. I think our turnovers really hurt
us. You can't win the ballgame when you've got 20‑plus turnovers. We couldn't
get into a rhythm offensively and we weren't getting the stops that we needed
defensively. Give Maryland all the credit; they came out and played a heck of
a ballgame, and they took away our strengths.  
  
Q. Meighan, as far as Alyssa Thomas is concerned, every time you guys cut it
down there in the second half to eight or nine points she would come back with
a big bucket. What did you guys do to try to limit her today?  
MEIGHAN SIMMONS: First we had Cierra to face guard her, and later on in the
game when she got to runs we tried to double‑team her. Me and Cierra had said
in an earlier media session that we have so much respect for her. She's one of
the top recruits as of right now to go to the WNBA. She's worked really,
really hard. Really she outworked us and out‑muscled would us today. Like I
said, we have the utmost respect for her.  
  
Q. How painful is this loss? I hate to mention it, about the Grind For Nine
and the Final Four in Nashville, it's been a goal all season long. Can you
talk about that?  
MEIGHAN SIMMONS: It's always been a grind for us. We've had a heck of a year,
and any game where we were down we found a way to fight back and Maryland just
had the extra oomph today. They pushed through even harder. We just didn't
have it today. It was always a grind for this year. I mean, I think we showed
that. A lot of people realized exactly what we could do out there on the
floor, and for the people that they have coming in, the freshmen who are
coming in and the people who are returning, I would just say to any other
team, just look out because I know when I leave here I know everybody else
that's going to be coming back is going to be pushing twice as hard to get
back in this position and maybe even get over that hump and get to the Elite 8
and get to the Final Four. That's all I can really say about that.  
  
Q. Holly, deficits early have been a problem so much of the season. I know
finding the answer would have helped fix it today, but what was it you saw
them doing today that they couldn't dig out of it this time?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, I thought we came out just nervous, a little scared for
whatever reason. We didn't have that fight‑back at the beginning, and then we
got ourselves in a hole. We're a get the ball inside team, and we couldn't
find a way to get it inside. It was physical, and we just couldn't, for one
reason or the other, get the ball inside. When you turn the ball over 22
times, you're not playing very well. As this team has battled back all year,
Maryland wasn't giving in. We dug ourselves in a hole too deep.  
  
Q. With the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, is there anything you would have
done differently in terms of preparing your team for this game or strategy or
approach or anything?  
HOLLY WARLICK: No, I thought we had a good game plan. I mean, Dean did a great
job scouting, and we wanted to mix it up. We were going zone, going man, and
we just didn't have the togetherness on the defensive end, whether it was
trust, we gave too many lay‑ups. We understood that they score in the
transition. We couldn't stop that. We understood that they were great
rebounders, we worked on that quite a bit, and we couldn't stop that. You
know, I don't know. Looking back maybe play more zone, but I thought we had a
good game plan, we just didn't stick to it.  
  
Q. In the first half when Maryland made their run, you elected not to use a
time ‑out. Did you feel that this team could overcome that without you calling
one, or take us through that for a little bit.   
HOLLY WARLICK: I obviously didn't feel the need to have a time‑out, so I
didn't call one. I don't have a‑‑ I didn't feel the need to call a time‑out.  
  
Q. You mentioned you thought the team was a little nervous and jittery. You
said the same thing about the Louisville game last year when you guys lost in
the Elite 8. Is that maybe a greater concern for you about the team than
execution or Xs and Os or anything like that?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, I mean, think about it right now, probably yes. All we
can do is prepare them for what we need to do in the game and put them in
situations where they know what they're defending and where we need to attack
offensively. I don't know, the last two times we've been in the tournament, we
didn't get it done. We lost to a very good basketball team today, very good.
Maybe we'll address that for the next season.  
  
Q. Will you assess the play of Jasmine Jones and Mercedes Russell today?
Jasmine came in in the second half and provided the spark, and obviously
Mercedes's wing span played a big role today, as well?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Yeah, they're kids. Jasmine just is an athlete who plays hard,
and I was proud of her. She did what we wanted to do. We wanted to attack the
basket, stop the clock and get to the free‑throw line, and I thought she did
that. Mercedes is going to be a great player for us. She's getting stronger
and better every day, great knowledge of the game, and I have so much
confidence in her. I mean, I thought she‑‑ she didn't score a whole lot, but
she was a factor on the defensive end, which helped us get back into the game.  
  
Q. In the first half, Meighan put a whole lot of points on the board and she
was your only double ‑digit scorer in the first half but she was also shooting
a business less than 25 percent, and I noticed that you sat her out for a
while in the second half, and when she came back she seemed to be shooting way
better. Can you talk about the decision making there?   
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, we needed defensive stops, and we thought when we brought
Meighan out that we would get‑‑ brought in our better defenders, and we needed
stops. That pretty much was plain and simple. I think when Meighan sits and
settles down a little bit, she shoots the ball a lot better. So that was our
thinking.  
You know, we weren't hitting outside shots. I mean, they were packing it in,
they were taking away our middle‑‑ our inside game, so we needed to hit a
couple outside shots, and we didn't. And they were quick shooting the
basketball.  
  
Q. In the second half the team got down by 16 points, but kept battling
back, brought it to eight. How proud are you of them just the way they battled
back and against a team that had a player hitting nearly all her shots?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, this team is special to me. I mean, they have committed
since last year. They don't give up. They don't have that in them, so I think
that's what makes it tough. It makes it tough for us to go out this way.
Obviously all teams put in the time and effort; that should be a given. But
this team has been really close‑knit team and they'll take this pretty hard,
as the staff and myself.  
But we just get down and we keep fighting and we keep battling, and that's
what our MO has been. We've just had to prove our worth all year. I don't know
why we've had to prove our worth, but we have. But I think this group has had
a great season and a season to be proud of, and we're Tennessee, and we're not
happy that we're not playing for a national championship. That's in our DNA.  
So we'll go back to work and we'll prepare for next year.  
  
Q. When you guys game planned for Alyssa and you saw I guess her being a
lefty, do you game plan differently because of that because the way they shoot
the ball is different than what you normally see?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, when we game planned we wanted to limit her touches, we
wanted to force her right. We wanted to keep her off the boards. She did just
about everything she wanted to do. 13 rebounds, 33 points. I thought she came
up with big rebounds when they needed them. We just didn't have an answer for
her tonight, and I don't know why. We just didn't step up and get it done.
She's just had a great night, and you understand why she's an All‑American.
She made great plays.  
  
Q. You guys had three tough, good games in the SEC Tournament against a
really good team. You think that maybe took a little out of this team and
perhaps that's when you guys peaked, in that tournament?  
HOLLY WARLICK: You know, I thought it was going to prepare us for what we
needed to get ready for in this tournament. They were tough. They were tough
games. The SEC is just a brutal conference. It's tough to survive the regular
season, and then you go into the tournament. You know, I don't know. We took
off‑‑ I thought we took off days that I thought would help us. We had some
pretty hard practices. We were in great shape. We just didn't have it today.
We just didn't have it, and give Maryland credit; they came out, they played
just an outstanding game. They did whatever they needed to do to get the win
today.  
  
Q. What's your advice to Meighan as she leaves the University of Tennessee?
You've been with her the last four years.  
HOLLY WARLICK: Yeah, get her degree, number one. She's got to get her degree,
which she'll do that in the spring. Meighan works at her game, and I think she
will be a very good professional in whatever level, whether it's the WNBA or
overseas. I think she's got a special gift, and that's to shoot the
basketball. Not too many people can do that, and she has tremendous speed.
Just continue to be a professional that she is and keep her head up. I know
today was tough for her, but she had a great career, and just continue that
effort and her love for the game at the next level.

### [Lexie Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26967)

### [Brenda Frese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15652)

### [Laurin Mincy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26968)

### [Alyssa Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26541)

  
_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  

Maryland  73  
Tennessee  62

  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, this game was everything we thought it was going to
be, just a phenomenal game by both teams. You know, it was intense, obviously
we felt like it was going to come down to the rebounding and being able to own
the glass. Going into this game obviously we knew it was going to be a game of
runs and we had to maintain our confidence. Obviously have the utmost respect
for Holly and her staff, and obviously the tradition that Tennessee has,
that's where we all want to be. But I'm really proud of the fact that our kids
played for Maryland and played with a lot of confidence, were never
intimidated and really played for each other. I thought you saw us really get
after it defensively, dominated, being aggressive on the boards and really
being able to get out in transition. We want to continue to be under the
radar, make sure nobody writes about us, talks about us, but really proud of
our team and what we were able to accomplish today.  
  
Q. Alyssa, can you talk about just your mindset tonight? Obviously you had a
decent game against Texas, but tonight you looked to be very aggressive, and
can you talk about Laurin, she hit some big shots today and came in and did
well off the bench.  
ALYSSA THOMAS: Just came out and went for my opportunity and just attacked to
the rim. And Mincy, this is the Mincy that we know, it's crunch time, the
lights are on and she's playing her best basketball.  
  
Q. Alyssa, their coach said that they didn't have an answer for you tonight
and she thought you could do whatever you wanted to. Did you feel like you
were able to impose your will?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: We knew we could get to the rim on them, and that was my
mentality, just get to the rim and just try to get easy shots.  
  
Q. Laurin, you guys came out from the very outset and looked really
confident and aggressive. Was there something in their scouting report or the
preparation that made you guys feel so at ease and so confident against a
favored team?  
LAURIN MINCY: I think the coaches just did a good job of preparing us for
Tennessee. We thought that we had to beat them on the boards to win this game,
so we focused on that for the last two days.  
  
Q. Lexie, Alyssa has the ability to score whenever she wants, but she also
kicked it out to you guys for threes at times. Talk about her passing ability,
too.  
LEXIE BROWN: I mean, it's incredible. She draws so much attention to herself
when she's on on offense, so for her to be able to just be unselfish and dish
it out to us, it's our job to knock those shots down, and it makes her job
easy, too, because then they won't be able to send so many people at her.  
  
Q. Lexie, the team really in the regular season against teams of the top
tier had regular ‑season losses against Notre Dame, UConn, Duke in particular,
but how does it feel to get a win against a top team on a big stage at this
time of year?   
LEXIE BROWN: It feels great. I think it was great that we got to play those
three teams before we got to the tournament. I mean, we have a lot to prove in
this tournament, and to get a big win over Tennessee is just giving us a lot
more momentum going into our next game.  
  
Q. Laurin, after you went on your run to pull out in front, you never let
them go. What was the key to stopping them and making sure they couldn't get
possessions where they scored consecutively?  
LAURIN MINCY: We just wanted to focus on making them take tough shots. Meighan
Simmons gets it going so we wanted to make sure we contested all her shots and
box out. Like I said, that was the key for this game, and obviously we won the
battle on the boards.  
  
Q. Alyssa, do you feel a little bit fresher this season, whether that's
mental or physical, not having to play quite as many minutes as you did last
season?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: I just feel like this year we have so much more‑‑ last year we
didn't really have any subs, and now this year we can send so many waves at
them, it makes it so much easier.  
  
Q. Laurin, you've been through some things obviously in your career at
Maryland with knee injuries, but you looked very good, very explosive. Can you
talk about how you're feeling right now?  
LAURIN MINCY: I'm feeling really good. I had time to refocus a couple weeks
ago, just staying confident throughout the season and being patient. I think
patience has got me where I am right now.  
  
Q. Alyssa, Tennessee is usually known as a top ‑tiered defensive team. What
did you guys see on the offensive end that you knew you could get to the hoop
and score on them down low?   
ALYSSA THOMAS: Well, we knew we could get out on them in transition and just
get easy baskets, and then once we got ball reversals we were able to attack
the rim and get easy lay‑ups.  
  
Q. You've talked about getting to the rim in terms of the offensive side of
the game, but you also effectively shut down a Tennessee post that
cumulatively has a significant height advantage on you. What was your
defensive strategy and how were you so successful in shutting them down?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: Our post players did a phenomenal job of just limiting them,
getting them in foul trouble really early and just trying to keep them off the
boards from getting second opportunities.  
  
Q. Laurin, is there something about this time of year that brings out the
best in you? A couple years ago against A &M you had 21 points.   
LAURIN MINCY: I think I just like the big stage. I mean, it's crunch time. I
want to send my seniors out well, so I want to play as hard as I can for them.  
  
Q. Alyssa, did they do anything to you defensively that you hadn't seen for
a while or maybe even seen this year?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: No, it's just the typical face guard trying to make it
difficult to get catches.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your defensive game plan? It seemed like you were
really able to clog the lanes and take away penetration. Was that the mindset
going into today's game, because it seemed like your height on the perimeter
seemed to shut down them wanting to penetrate.  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I thought when we came out in the first half, we were
really locked in, being able to kind of keep them in front against the dribble
drives, did a phenomenal job and Theresa being able to get that spread. I
thought the second half they did a much better job getting to the rim, really
getting to the free‑throw line. They shot a ton of free throws. I thought they
were a lot more aggressive in the second half.  
  
Q. Tennessee suffered from turnovers earlier in the season, they averaged
about 16 turnovers a game. Obviously you forced 22 turnovers against them
today. It seemed like every other time driving the lane you were swiping the
ball away. Was that something you guys wanted to do in the beginning of the
game or is it something that you guys pointed out in preparation for this
game?  
BRENDA FRESE: It was a stat I came across when I kind of compared our
conference stats and our cumulative. When you watch them on film you see their
dangerous deal is they get to live‑ball turnovers. I looked at our stats and
we actually had more steals than they did. I really felt like we could be
getting that message to our team to be able to understand how aggressive we
could be.  
That was important in terms of being able to get steals and being able to
cause turnovers.  
  
Q. Tennessee in winning the SEC Tournament had to go against three big,
strong, physical teams, beat them all. What made you think that you could beat
Tennessee and its very strength, inside and at both ends of the floor?  
BRENDA FRESE: When you watch what we've grown into, obviously we have a ton of
depth this season, and it's taken us a while to be able to kind of‑‑ for
everyone to understand how critical their role was. But when you look at our
bigs, you want to know the difference? Alicia DeVaughn, you look at
defensively what she was able to do in her rebounding, then you add Brionna,
you add Malina, AT sometimes going down there playing the 4 for us. Just the
fact that I felt like even with all the foul trouble that happened in this
game, we were able to withstand that. Fortunately for us we had a lot of depth
because there were a lot of fouls called in this game, so we were fortunate to
be able to have that kind of depth.  
  
Q. You've seen so many great performances from Alyssa. Where would you rank
this one, and also particularly the zero turnovers?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think the most special thing about Alyssa, when you talk about
everything that's been written and everything that we've seen, is just her
ability to, obviously, the higher the stakes, she elevates her game, and I
think the thing that separates her is her ability to elevate everybody else on
our team around her. They raise to her level. She was huge. I mean, and then
when you talk about the unselfishness, she was having fun being able to
penetrate to be able to get really nice kicks for her teammates.  
  
Q. Laurin mentioned needing to have patience this season as she got back
into her rhythm. What kind of patience did you need to have with her and she
found herself again?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, I think it was more for Laurin to trust and be
patient. This is very similar to when Laurin came in with a knee injury. We
knew it was going to take her time, for her body to be able to respond. But I
think what you see, what's so special about Laurin is her competitiveness. She
wants to be on the floor. She wants to make plays. Really being able to see‑‑
I saw in her the last two to three weeks, just the bounce come back, her step,
and obviously you see how she's playing.  
  
Q. Can you talk about apparently your pregame speech to your team, you
talked about ignoring Tennessee. How much of that is that tradition and trying
to get your team to not focus on that and to play their game, and then
secondly, how big a win is this for the ACC over the SEC Tournament champ?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, I think first and foremost, obviously we all want to
be where Tennessee is. We have the utmost respect for what they have and their
tradition and what they've been able to create. Obviously that's where we all
want to be.  
I think more of my pregame speech was the talk of like, hey, nobody is picking
us, taking the pressure off of us, and really playing so we can make sure that
everybody knows who we are in this tournament. Just the mindset. I mean, that
is a hurdle obviously when teams go out to play is sometimes you kind of
overthink the game, and I think we wanted to make sure our team was just as
confident as we could possibly be.  
For the ACC, you know, nobody goes into these games thinking about
conferences, obviously with the shifts that are taking place, but we do feel
like our conference has prepared us for postseason. When you get to have the
battles that we've had all year with Notre Dame and Duke and Carolina and the
depth of our conference, we feel like it's prepared us for this time, so we're
really proud.  
  
Q. Sometimes coaches will take a look at the box score at halftime and get a
glance at the numbers. Were you shocked to see the margin of your lead
compared to your field ‑goal percentage in the first half? I think you shot 37
percent in the first half but still led by about 14.   
BRENDA FRESE: You know, yeah. But I thought our defense and our rebounding was
keeping us in it. If we could tighten some things up, I really felt like we
needed to be able to get to the free‑throw line more to be able to kind of
help. I mean, sometimes these are games that you have to grind out, which you
saw with the different possessions that took place. But again, just trying to
put it all together.  
  
Q. All season long the SEC has touted itself as the best conference in the
country. The selection committee kind of followed that in its seeding. Do you
think maybe the SEC was a little overrated and the ACC maybe underrated?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, I think the selection committee has a really tough
job, and I think this season when you look at it, there's really two teams
that have separated themselves in this field, obviously with UConn and Notre
Dame being undefeated. I think they had a really difficult job. I think they
based it on how you played in your tournament, and rightly so. Tennessee did a
great job going out and winning the SEC Tournament, three games in three days.
Obviously for us we didn't perform well in that tournament.  
You know, I think they have a really difficult job, and I think the biggest
thing is to come into the tournament that it's the clean slate and just come
out and play the best basketball you can to be able to advance and move on.  
  
Q. What were you able to do defensively to prevent them from going on those
runs to get them back within a few possessions?  
BRENDA FRESE: We talked about a lot in the second half the dribble drives that
were taking place. We went a few possessions of zone and we also just talked
about being able to get better help‑side defense to be able to withstand the
runs that they were making. Just some simple adjustments.  
  
Q. Alyssa said that you all felt like you could get some easy baskets in
transition. Is that an advantage you've had all season over teams with your
quickness, or is that something you specifically saw coming into this game
against Tennessee you felt like you could take advantage of?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, our transition is a big piece of who we are, and then
when you talk about having Alyssa Thomas lead your break, it's like having
LeBron come down the center of the court. We feel like there's a great
advantage between Alyssa and Lexie in how our team runs. But we did feel like
we wanted to be true to who we are and that we could take advantage of their
transition D by putting them into a track meet. We felt like we had more depth
in this game.

_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  

Louisville  73  
LSU  47

  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to start with opening remarks from Coach Caldwell.  
COACH CALDWELL: I'm extremely proud of this group. They have an unbelievable
spirit about them. They have shown not only to our fans and families but to
the basketball community that they can achieve when people think that we
can't, and they've shown that we can.  
Honestly, tonight we played a very tough Louisville team that played extremely
well. Tonight just wasn't our night. But I can't say enough how proud I am
with this group for the challenges and the adversity that they had to
overcome.  
  
Q. This question is for Theresa. If you could just kind of sum up what
you're going through right now as a senior and what it's meant to play for LSU
these last four years, or for your career.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: For me, it's a pretty sad moment. I really take pride in
wearing LSU across my chest, and knowing that I won't get the opportunity to
do that again is pretty heartbreaking to me.  
But I just‑‑ I've been through such a huge journey, and the people‑‑ the
seniors that I came in with, Katherine Graham, Latear Eason, they really got
me through my first year, along with LaSondra Barrett, Swayze Black, those
people really got me through my first couple years here where I was
struggling, and I wasn't the player that I expected myself to be.  
My junior year, my teammates just really had trust and faith in me that they
were going to get me the ball, and I have nothing but great things to say
about the girls that I've come through with.  
And the players that are currently on the team right now, this is a great
group of girls. I can't say more about them. It's a sad moment for me. I'm
really going to miss this place. I'm going to miss the staff. I'm going to
miss the players. I'm just going to miss the whole tradition of LSU. It's a
great place to be.  
  
Q. This for all three of the girls. Jasmine, we'll start with you. Could you
just talk about the lack of offense today and, I guess, the teamwork to create
it. It seemed, if you weren't making it on your own, just two assists on the
game, it just wasn't happening for you guys. Was that something they were
doing or something you were unable to do?  
JASMINE RHODES: Like Coach said, it just wasn't our night tonight. But we kept
fighting, even though we were down by a lot. We strive to come back and never
gave up. We tried to overcome adversity, but we just came up short.  
DANIELLE BALLARD: We were just never in our rhythm, running plays. We couldn't
hear each other really on the court. We tried to do our own thing, but‑‑
that's good.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: I think they said it all. We never really got into our
rhythm, and then coming down playing on defense, we didn't really start off in
what we‑‑ in the rhythm that we wanted to start off in on defense, and then
Louisville kept hitting those threes.  
So our defense really sets a tone for our offense and vice versa. Our shot
selection wasn't that great. We just weren't making buckets. And even easy
little buckets that we typically make, they just weren't going our way.  
But we were playing against a great defensive team, and those nights happen.  
  
Q. You guys obviously are missing two key members of your offense as well,
and I understand they traveled with you. Have you texted them or been in any
kind of contact with them, any communication since the game?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, yeah. Rai's here with us. She's our supporter on the
sideline. It's really hard to keep Rai in her seat. She's always trying to
keep us hyped. She's trying to keep us in the game.  
I can't say enough about Raigyne and her heart and determination to succeed
even when she's obviously limited with a torn ACL. We have a great trainer
that's going to get her right back to health, and she'll be 100 percent as
soon as they're ready to go.  
Jeanne Kenney is at the hotel, and she wrote us a note before the game.
They're here, and they're supporting us. Having those two probably would have
helped us out a lot on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Do you have the note?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: I don't have it. It's in the locker room. Basically, she
just told us to play hard and that no matter what, she's proud of us. We
worked really hard to get to the spot, and we just need to play in the moment
and just play for LSU across your chest.  
  
Q. How good is Louisville compared to the teams you've seen in the SEC? Two
1 seeds out of the SEC. Just kind of how good are they, and how far do you
feel like they have a chance to go in this tournament?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Going up against a Louisville team, I can't compare them to
any team in the SEC. Their pressure defense is one of the best we've come
across this year as well as their three‑point game. They shot an unbelievable
percentage tonight. That's what they do. They do a great job, and they're led
by a great senior, Shoni Schimmel, who really gets it done for them.  
And also defensively, they caused us a lot of trouble. We had a hard time
splitting the traps and getting out of the traps and converting, finishing
contested shots.  
They're just a great team. I don't think I can really compare them. They have
a pretty good shot of making a really good run this tournament and doing well.  
  
Q. For Jasmine and Danielle. Could you talk about next year's team. Clearly,
you kind of assumed that role in the postseason. How do you carry that over to
next season? Jazz, you as well, stepping up here, you're going to be the key
cogs moving forward.  
JASMINE RHODES: Coming in next year, I know we're going to have a pretty big‑‑
some big shoes to fill with the seniors leaving and everything, but it's been
a nice run with them, and I'm happy to have had this opportunity.  
But for next year, we just want to keep working hard. I know Coach is not
going to let up any. So just going to keep working hard and having fun as much
as we can and do our part to get back here and even further.  
DANIELLE BALLARD: Going on next year, we have some great players coming in
next year, and I'm going to step up, and I'm going to improve to be a leader.
We're going to grind hard. Next year we're going to be a better team than we
were this year.  
We're going to have some good players, and the returning players, they're just
going to improve on their game. So we're just going to be a good team next
year as a group.  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to excuse the student‑athletes.  
We'll open it up for questions to Coach Caldwell.  
  
Q. Nikki, Theresa looked like she had a hard time offensively around the
basket. Were you trying to do some kind of action with her, high ‑low with
Shanece, or were they just making it difficult?   
COACH CALDWELL: I think the one thing about Louisville's defense is they do a
nice job of changing up their defense, and they do a nice job of picking and
choosing who to trap, when to trap, and things like that. So we wanted to take
the guesswork out of it.  
With Theresa's ability to pass the basketball, we wanted to always have a
relief person, if you will, in the middle of the floor, and that hopefully
will take some pressure off of Jasmine and Dashawn because we were down two of
our other ball handlers. So that was the reason for putting Plaisance in more
of that high post area.  
We would have liked to have gotten her inside a little bit more than we did,
but she obviously kept us from turning the ball over as much as we typically
have been.  
  
Q. Along those lines, if you knew going into this game that you were only
going to commit 12 turnovers, would you have thought that this would have been
a drastically different game than what the final score ended up being?  
COACH CALDWELL: Our turnovers, even though we've had 20 a game, we typically
have good turnovers. So 12 probably averaged out for us. But I thought our
shot selection really hurt us. I felt as though there were times we were
rushed, and we didn't get any of the reversal action. That could be attributed
to the play action that we were running.  
But definitely did a better job of taking care of the basketball because we
didn't want to put our players in those positions to get trapped as much, and
so that kept us away from a lot of our ball screening action.  
But, again, I felt as though we got some good looks. We didn't knock down a
lot of those looks, though.  
  
Q. Coach, late in the game, Danielle came out, and you had a pretty long
conversation with her. What was your message? Were you looking to the future,
like the girls were talking about here?  
COACH CALDWELL: With Ballard, I just thanked her for being a competitor and
putting this team on her back, if you will, and carrying us. She's just a
sophomore, and she's playing like one of the best guards in the country.  
We have her coming back, and I'm glad that she's on our roster. But just
wanted her to know how proud I was of her and that we will be back, and she's
going to be better because of this experience.  
  
Q. Nikki, how much did the shorthandedness really kind of maybe catch up
with you guys today? I don't think anybody off the bench scored, and just
maybe the second half wearing down, especially Louisville plays 10, 11 deep.
Did it catch up with you guys today?  
COACH CALDWELL: I think it played a role. I mean, when you lose what we did
with Moncrief and Kenney, two players that are two of our better offensive
players, if you will. And, obviously, Jeanne Kenney is one of our‑‑ we'd love
to have her back there in some of those transition breaks they've got because
she typically saves six to eight points in transition alone.  
But this team, they did all that they could considering, and our bench, they
came in, and they tried their best. I'm proud of them for that. We didn't
execute as well as we wanted to, but it wasn't that they were fearful. I
think, when you look at Louisville, they're a very experienced team. They have
unbelievable guard play. They have depth. They did a nice job of pushing the
tempo. Their transition game is one of the best in the country, and they get
out quickly.  
But they also do a nice job of finding the open player. Their spot‑up shooters
from the three‑point line, they're hunting for the three‑pointers. And there's
so many times when Schimmel is coming down the floor, and you can just see her
searching for an open teammate. She's a great play maker for her team, and her
teammates have answered the call.  
  
Q. What did you say to the team in the huddle? When you were up 12 ‑9, and
Danielle, I think, hit like four or five in a row, five baskets in a row, what
kind of things did you say to your team to try to get them to support her, or
what did she say in the huddle?   
COACH CALDWELL: Honestly, I don't remember, but it would probably be along the
line of we've got to make sure our shot selection‑‑ I know we were talking
about that because we were getting good looks, but also I knew that their
transition game was where they had scored half of their points at that point.  
So we were talking about probably the transition‑‑ our transition defense
because we didn't do a nice job. And once you get the crowd involved and that
first three goes down, I mean‑‑ because we know how it is when we're at home.
That right there was a momentum play for them, and then it became contagious.
So then you had different players stepping up and making shots for them.  
So I know we talked about our defensive scheme.  
  
Q. As a followup to that, when Gibbs hit the back ‑to‑back three‑pointers
that got them ahead or helped them get ahead, is that the kind of, I guess,
twist that you were warning them to avoid?   
COACH CALDWELL: Yeah, I think the one thing is that we were doing a nice job
of guarding their initial action. We just didn't do a great job in our
transition game. And that's where they're very good.  
  
Q. Coach, this is a two ‑part question. First, could you kind of give us the
scouting report, in a sense, on Theresa Plaisance at the next level. She seems
to me to have so much more than height to offer. And maybe a little bit under
appreciated. And then the second half of that is that Louisville is known for
its guard play, but they did a very good job of containing two taller post
players tonight. Could you evaluate their post‑game.   
COACH CALDWELL: I think the one thing about Theresa is you've got a player
that's very versatile who can play with her back to the basket, and she can
also go to a face‑up game. She has the ability to stretch the defense with her
three‑point shot. She's also a player that, when you are looking for a player
that can play away from the basket and be a great passer and a read and can
read defenses, she's been that for us.  
I like Theresa's ability when she's‑‑ when play action isn't being ran to her,
her going and getting those offensive boards. I thought she's added that to
her game as of late.  
Defensively, Theresa's somebody that we've had to play on the perimeter, and
that's not an easy task. But every game, night in and night out, she's does
that. We play a matchup, and she's on the back side, and we're asking her to
go out of her comfort zone. So you're going to get a player that's going to do
whatever the team needs of you.  
I thought that our post‑game, the disruption of our guard play kept the ball
from getting there, and I think that hurts you. When you don't have one of
your best passers in Jeanne Kenney able to get the ball there and play in that
high‑low action, that will challenge us. They did a nice job of taking that
action away.  
  
Q. Nikki, could you also look towards next year. I know you have a couple of
transfers maybe. Who else can kind of supplement this roster and kind of get
you guys back where you want to be?  
COACH CALDWELL: Every year it's different, what you lose and what you have
coming in, and we're going to be a different team next year with different
post play. We won't have two 6'4" book ends next year, but we will have an Ann
Jones, who's a very mobile post player. Akilah Bethel is that 6'1" tweener
type post player, guard. She'll play three and four.  
We'll have Boykin back at a swing. She can play the four or five for us, and
Anne Pedersen can play the three or four. So we're going to be a little bit
smaller, if you will, but faster and quicker.  
We also had a couple of first years and looking forward to them adding. I see
this team pressing a little bit more. I see this team spreading the offense a
little bit more. I think we're going to be a little bit more guard oriented
than we have in the past. But, again, it's about how well you're going to play
this game together, and I feel like we've got some great cohesion already.  
Thank you.

_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  
JEFF WALZ: First of all, we'd like to welcome everyone here. Hope you're
enjoying the beautiful weather outside.  
For us right now if it's not snowing, it's great. So we are thrilled that you
all were able to make it. We're thrilled to have the opportunity to come back
here and play, and looking forward to a great ballgame tomorrow.  
We know we're playing a very inspired LSU basketball team who's been doing
some great things despite some injuries that they've had. I've been very, very
impressed with what I've seen, and we know we're going to have a ballgame on
our hands tomorrow.  
  
Q. They have had two key losses in their last two games. How are you going
to kind of counteract that?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, they've won both of them. We have to be prepared to play.
I've been very impressed with watching them on film the past game, two games,
of how some players have stepped up for them, exactly what you have to do.
That's what our kids did a year ago when we had our injuries.  
You know, you're giving players an opportunity to play that were not getting
those minutes before, and they're taking advantage of that, and that's what
you have to expect. I've been really impressed with what Danielle Ballard has
done in their absence. There's been a lot more put on her shoulders and she's
responded extremely well.  
So we know that even without those two, they're a very talented basketball
team. I mean, as I said, it's the same thing that we did last season. We were
without two, three players, and then you just have to have other players step
up to the challenge.  
  
Q. We see a lot of high seeds host the first and second rounds, but as the
tournament gets deeper does it become more of an advantage to be at home when
you're in the Sweet 16 and the Elite 8?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, of course. It's nice to have the opportunity to play on your
home floor in front of your home fans. I was just told five minutes ago that
we've sold out the lower bowl, and now we're opening up the top at $10. You
know, it's great. You're going to have that home feel behind you.  
Now, at the same time there are distractions that come with that. Families
come in town, they all want tickets, they all want to hang out with their
kids. It's like, no, it's a business trip. Even though we're at home, they
have responsibilities, we have to make sure they're focused to play
basketball, not worried about where families are going to go eat. Don't ask me
to go eat with mom and dad when we have a team meal tonight. You've got the
distractions, but they definitely don't outweigh the positive.  
  
Q. You mentioned last year the situation you guys were in. Probably people
are thinking LSU's chances are about what they thought your chances were last
year. Chances are they'll be inspired by your year last year. How do you
remind your players about that ‑‑  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I've already reminded them. You don't have to worry about
that. I'd be extremely disappointed if we did not come out prepared to play
tomorrow. I know how talented they are. They've got a fantastic coaching staff
that they've got the troops rallied, and they have been impressive to watch.
They beat a very, very good West Virginia team without those two. I know
Kenney played about 12 or 13 minutes in the second game, but they played a
majority of it without her.  
We know how good West Virginia is from having been in our league in the old
Big East for so long. They've got our respect. That's not a concern of mine.
My players are not going to be going, oh, they've got two starters out, easy
game. No, it's not going to be that.  
If we lose tomorrow, I promise you it's not because we overlooked them.  
  
Q. You talked last year about conversations and texts you exchanged with
Coach Pitino. Obviously a tough loss for his team last night. But how has the
relationship that you guys have developed helped you and your team grow?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, it's great. I mean, Coach has been great to me. If I've got a
basketball question, he's more than willing to have me come out to his office,
sit down and talk. You know, a really tough loss for them last night. I mean,
no question about it. Those late games I'm not a big fan of myself. I was
sleeping before halftime, and somehow woke up with 3:58 to go in the game and
watched it and went back to sleep.  
I would like to be able to tell you I watched the whole thing and was cheering
for it, but unfortunately I can't stay awake that late. I've got a nine‑month
old at home, too, that when she sleeps, I sleep.  
Rick has been great. He's very supportive of our players, our program, and
we've got a great relationship, and I think that's what makes our university a
special place to work. It's special for our student‑athletes because it's not
just men's and women's basketball that support each other. We're all
supporting each other. We just had a swimmer that won a national championship.
There's a lot of great things going on here, and they don't go unnoticed or
unappreciated.  
  
Q. What specifically did you think Kenney did for their team and what maybe
do they lose without her out there and specifically against the kind of press
that you may put on them?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, she is a great shooter. She has great basketball instincts.
She understands the game. She made big shots for them, but she also got the
ball to the right people at the right time. But you know, you have Danielle
Ballard, who's taken up all of that slack. She does a great job of getting to
the basket. She gets the ball up on the rim. Their post players are doing a
fantastic job of cleaning up her misses when she does miss.  
You lose someone as talented as Kenney, and then you're giving Ballard more
responsibility and more of a green light. It's kind of like, it's funny
because we were watching the Baylor game today, and I'm not sure what that
score ended up against Kentucky, but everybody is like, people are talking to
me going, oh, they're a better team without Brittney Griner. No, they're not,
it's just Odyssey Sims now is taking 25 to 35 shots, and they're nights when
she can make 22 of them. And when she does, they're hard to beat.  
There's a big difference as a player when you know you can shoot it whenever
you want and you're not coming out because there's nobody else to put in for
you, you feel pretty good out there. Right now it's not that LSU doesn't have
players to put in, but Daniel Ballard I think is playing more free, and she's
making some decisions that are pretty impressive and taking some tough shots,
but it's like I tell our players, and Shoni, I think, plays the same way, too,
you're going to take a bad shot or two, but she knows she ain't going to come
out, and Danielle I think has got that feeling my coaches have confidence in
me, they know they need me, and I need my teammates, but she's willing to put
that on her shoulders. That's what I saw in that West Virginia game. I was
just really, really impressed with how she competed.  
  
Q. I'm certain LSU is your only focus this time around as I'm sure was the
case for your two previous opponents. On Selection Monday when you saw your
region unfold and you saw Maryland, did it cross your mind maybe I'll get a
shot at the Terrapins?  
JEFF WALZ: No, never thought about it to be honest with you. I was too
concerned with getting back here. We knew we had a good Idaho team that shot
the three well, and going to play at Iowa, was a game I was really concerned
about. It never crossed my mind that it would be a 30‑point game. And then as
soon as that game was over, we knew we were going to be playing LSU, that's
where our focus has been. I have not watched a minute of film on Maryland or
Tennessee because we have to get past a very, very good LSU team before I
worry about that.  
  
Q. What do you kind of remember or what do you take away from the last time
you guys played, and what does that do for you guys that you think about that
you do have a 20 ‑point win against them?  
JEFF WALZ: We don't take anything away from it. I've told my kids over and
over, and I share our experience at Maryland, in 2006 we won the national
championship at Maryland; 2007‑'08 season we play an Ole Miss team in a
Thanksgiving tournament and I think we won by 30, and then they're our
second‑round game in the NCAA Tournament, and I think we're a 2 seed at that
time, and we get beat. You know, you can't sit there‑‑ what happened in
November has no bearing on what's going to take place tomorrow.  
They're a completely different basketball team. We're a different basketball
team. We've both improved in areas. There's not going to be any surprises.  
As great as it is for us to come back home and play, I think they also have
the advantage of having played here, also. So they're not completely
unfamiliar with what they're coming into. They know about our crowd. I'm not
buying drinks tomorrow, so we might not have as many, but they know what's
going to take place. They know the environment. So I think that's a big plus
for them.  
You know, we don't worry about what happened in November. We have to worry
about what's going to take place tomorrow.  
  
Q. You were successful shutting down Theresa Plaisance when they were here
in November. She's averaging 15.5 a game. Same strategy again or do you have
to switch it up?  
JEFF WALZ: We're definitely going to have to switch some things up. We'll try
what we did in the first game. She's very talented, goes inside out, really
causes some problems when she sets ball screens because if you switch they'll
sit there and post her up, if you just hedge big she'll pop for the three. She
presents concerns for us defensively without a doubt. We're going to have to
be on top of our game making sure we know where she is at all times, and then
more importantly, we're going to have to make sure we somehow try and keep her
off the offensive glass.  
  
Q. You mentioned your press. The press obviously is physical and you're
trying to mentally affect your opponent. This is a team that turns the ball
over 20 times in a game and it doesn't seem to faze them that much. How do you
deal with that?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, and that's kind of what we've done in the past, too.
Everybody tells me you have to cut your turnovers down. You have to cut your
turnovers down. The two years that we've had the opportunity to play in the
Final Four, we've averaged 20 turnovers a game. It's just a matter of what
type of turnovers you have. If you have turnovers that lead to baskets, then
you've got problems. But if you've got dead‑ball turnovers where you can get
back on defense, it's not‑‑ sure, it's not something you want to have happen,
but at the same time it doesn't affect you as much.  
So that's one thing that I've noticed about them. They have a lot of dead‑ball
turnovers. When you look at the stat sheets, people aren't getting 25 and 30
points off their turnovers. You know, they're getting 15 to 18, but LSU is
also getting 15 to 18, so it's turned out to be a wash for them.  
For us if we can get them to turn the basketball over, we need to somehow
convert those into baskets.  
  
Q. Although you don't take a lot away from that November game, how has your
team improved our grown since that early ‑season game?   
JEFF WALZ: Well, I think our depth has improved. We've had some players that
have grown into some roles that back then they really weren't sure what their
role was going to be. We've also become a better rebounding team, which we're
going to have to do extremely well tomorrow, especially with how well LSU has
been rebounding the ball at both ends of the floor. They've got great size, so
we know we're not going to be able to just out‑jump them. We have to put a
body on them.  
And then our shooters have continued to shoot the basketball well, which has
allowed Asia Taylor and Sara Hammond to have some things open up for them in
their mid‑range game and in the post.  
  
Q. What you were just saying there at the end, and then you also mentioned
it on Tuesday, how motivated you feel like Sara and Asia are to bounce back,
play a lot of minutes this game and contribute a lot. Asia had maybe one of
her best games of the year against LSU previously.  
JEFF WALZ: They're both excited to come out and play. I know Sara especially
is a competitor. The great thing about it is Sara wished she would have played
more and played better and stayed out of foul trouble at Iowa, but the bottom
line is we won, and she was excited about that. That's really the character of
all of our players.  
Sara Hammond was just as excited for Cortnee Walton for how well she played as
she would have been for herself if she would have gotten 15 or 18 points.  
Asia Taylor, although she didn't play a bunch of minutes, she was very
efficient in our Iowa game with I think about 10 or 12 points in about 10 or
12 minutes. She took advantage of the opportunity when she was on the floor,
but we definitely can't have those two get in foul trouble. We've talked about
that. They understand that. You've got to be able to play with one or two
fouls and know I can't pick up this third one. And that's what we really sat
down and showed film with Sara on. Sara had two in the first half and picked
up her third within 40 seconds of the second half on a reaching foul. Those
are the ones you can't get.  
Excited for both of them. We're excited for the opportunity to play tomorrow,
and it should be a great basketball game. The first game should be a great
game. I think we're very fortunate to have four very good basketball teams
here in this region, and I'm expecting three great basketball games.  
  
Q. Sara, how much does LSU remind you of your team in the regional semifinal
last year and the fact that people probably aren't giving them much of a
shot?  
SARA HAMMOND: Oh, yeah. Well, I think they're a very well‑coached team. I
think they have a great coach. She's a great motivator. She knows how to get
her team going, and I think her players respond to that. They did a great job
when they played West Virginia, they were down two players I think it was, and
their team rallied around each other and got a big victory against a 2 seed in
West Virginia. I think they're going to have that same mentality coming up
here as everybody is counting us out, we're the underdogs, but we're going to
stick together as a team, kind of the same mentality we had last year going up
against Baylor. Nobody gave us a chance. I know they're going to come in here
thinking we're the underdogs like everybody is thinking, but they're going to
stick together as a team and I think it's going to be a good ballgame. I think
we're looking forward to their competition.  
  
Q. Asia, you and Sara had the best seats in the house in Iowa. Kind of talk
about what you're going to do to prevent something like that happening against
the LSU Tigers?  
ASIA TAYLOR: Definitely this is going to be a physical game, going to be an
aggressive game, but we've just got to be smarter. We know our value to the
team and we need to be out there and our best attributes are when we're on the
floor. I'm a good cheerleader but not as good of a player. We're just going to
be smart. Me and Sara talk to each other a lot. Shoni talks to us and just
tells she needs us out there with her and we've just got to be smarter at the
end of the day, stay away from the tic‑tack fouls that we can avoid, and if we
do that I think we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Asia, what do you remember back about the first LSU game, and how
important was that for you to kind of know that you were back and going to be
back this year and playing at a high level?  
ASIA TAYLOR: Well, that was definitely a good game. It was a good game for me,
good win for the team, as well. It just felt good being out there. I felt
comfortable. I felt like I could be aggressive. I was playing off of instincts
and I wasn't overthinking things. I think it was just good. It was a good win,
and we fought hard. I just remember just the battle of it all and just that
21‑0 run that we went on. Everybody played well in that time, and I know that
LSU is saying, other than that spurt we went on that 21‑0 run, they played us
pretty much even. But they're going to see a more‑aggressive team, a better
team, a smarter team and a more‑disciplined team this time around.  
  
Q. Just going back to the locker room talking to the girls before here, they
said that Party Crashers 2 is what I'm hearing now. Can you explain what Party
Crashers 2 is all about and what that exactly means to us fans? We need to be
in the loop here, ladies.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I mean, in reality not a lot of people expect us to continue
to keep winning. We went to Iowa and it was going to be a hard game going in
because you're on Iowa's home court. They average 10,000 fans or whatever it
is, and for us to go in there and get that win by so much, it was just kind of
like, hey, we're here having fun, we're here for the Big Dance, and that's on
our mind. We're a 3 seed, and so we embrace that because, hey, we're going to
come in and ruin a couple people's parties. It's kind of like last year all
over again, but it's a little bit different at the same time, and so we just
embrace it because we like to have fun, so why not go out there and be the
party crashers again.  
  
Q. Shoni, your impressions of LSU, and I don't know how much you've really
seen of them since the last time you played, but how has that team maybe
changed from the last time you played them in November until now?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Yeah, they've definitely grown. For them to go through a whole
season since the last time we saw them in whatever the beginning of November I
think it was, for them to grow, it's just you've gone through a whole season
now. You understand what you're good at and what your strong points are on the
court, and so Theresa Plaisance, she's a very good basketball player, actually
had a chance to play with her this summer, and she's a great ballplayer, and
Danielle Ballard, she's coming in tough and she's out there to go out there
and win. At this point it's going to be a battle because everybody wants to
win, and nobody wants to go home.  
For us to just sit there and not take these people lightly as a team, we can't
take them lightly. That's something we have to just go out there and do the
best we can and dominate for us.  
  
Q. Shoni, obviously when you're watching film of LSU you're trying to figure
out ways how to stop them. But as a fellow basketball player are you kind of
at the same time admiring the way Danielle Ballard, the creativity around the
basket in her NCAA games, the ability to rebound as not a very tall player?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Yeah, definitely. She's a great basketball player. She's
shooting left‑handed, right‑handed floaters in the key, and how do you stop
that? She obviously is versatile, so for her to have that, it's great for LSU.
She knows what she's doing. She's obviously played basketball for a long time
and she obviously loves the game, because she embraces it and she goes out
there and she's a hard worker. That's something we can't take lightly. We have
to box her out, because we know she goes to the glass ‑‑ she ended up with
like 15 last game or something like that? So for her to do that's impressive
from the guard spot. Usually the guard is getting back, picking up the
transition, whatever it may be, so she's not doing that this game, and so we
just need to box out.  
  
Q. Sara, how much do you think it'll be an advantage for you guys, even
think about last year when you played Purdue, that you're at home and that you
guys have been in your own beds and been going to class and not traveling, not
staying in a hotel this week? How much is that an advantage for you and how
much are you encouraging fans to come out and support you guys tomorrow?  
SARA HAMMOND: Yeah, obviously I wouldn't say it's an advantage, but we prefer
being in our own bed and having our own routine and not being in a hotel all
day and being on the road, it's really nice because you get to do your daily
things that you're used to, going to class. I think really like that, and I
think just like you said, being at home with all of our fans, the people that
come out all season long, that really gets us going.  
But it's the NCAA Tournament. Anything can happen. I think we've seen that
both on the men's and women's side this year in the tournament. If you don't
come ready to play, whether you're on the road or you're at home, you're going
to get beat, and I think our coaches have been telling us that this whole
week, the time we've been practicing. Yeah, you're on your home court, but
look what we just did to Iowa. I'm sure they had the same mindset going into
it, we're on our home court, this is an advantage, and LSU is going to have
the same mindset we had going in that they're thinking they've got this
because this is on their home court, so let's go prove people wrong and have
that underdog mentality, we're going to come in here and ruin their season. So
I think we've just got to put that in perspective and say it's great at that
we're home and we're wanting as many people to come out on Sunday, but we've
got to treat this like it's do or die, win or go home, and not kind of think
of that as an advantage over the other team.  
And we are, we're trying to get everyone possible out to this game on Sunday
because we need all the support we can get, and our fans is what make us go.
The energy they bring, the excitement they bring and how loud it gets here in
the Yum! Center, I think me, Shoni and a Tay would all agree that gets us
pumped and gets us going. I think we want as many people as possible, 22,000
plus, as many people, bring a friend that's never come, bring your grandma,
bring your grandpa, anybody, a friend, as many cardinal fans as there is out
there.  
  
Q. Shoni, is the Emmonnie Henderson coast ‑to‑coast lay‑up something that's
new for the offense?   
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Yes, that's something we've definitely practiced. For her to
just finish a lay‑up. But she's learning the game, and so for her to just make
that move, she's pretty beastly, and for people to not get in her way, it's
probably smart. We've got to keep pushing her to be the best that she can be.
Full‑court, coast to coast, whatever it may be, she's going to learn and
figure it out. I think that was kind of a once‑in‑a‑lifetime kind of thing.
She was tired after that. She needed an oxygen tank after that.  
No, she's figuring it out, so it's good for us.  
  
Q. Asia, can you kind of just comment on maybe where you guys watched the
men's game last night, if you're able to, your thoughts on their season and
you guys have kind of over these last two years, both teams have had these
great runs and maybe how well you know the guys on the men's team if you do
and anything about your relationship with them and kind of seeing their season
end?  
ASIA TAYLOR: Yeah, we love our men's team and we were all supporting them. I
know a lot of people were supporting the game. Some of us fell asleep, but I
got to watch the game. I just want to congratulate them on a great season.
Their success and our success last year was a big story around Louisville, and
we were the heroes. We were the talk of the town, and that was great. And this
year I know they were just as hungry as we are, and it just sucks that their
season had to end like that. But they had a great season, nothing to hang
their head on, and I'm just proud of them. I hope the city still supports them
the same, whether they won a championship or not.

_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, excited to be here. Just looking forward to seeing all
the teams play, obviously. Our first‑ and second‑round games were challenging,
but figured out a way to win and now we're here.  
  
Q. Coach, just kind of give me your general impressions of Maryland, what
you've known about him, what the scouting reports have revealed about them and
what kind of challenges you feel like you'll face?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, I think Thomas is one of the best players in the country.
They're very well coached. They're quick getting up and upanddown the floor in
transition. They've got a young point guard that's very good that's doing a
great job of leading their team, and I think they're one of the best
rebounding teams in the country. It's going to be a battle of wills on the
boards because I think both our team and Maryland are athletic and they rely a
lot on second‑chance points. They follow a game plan. They're very well
coached.  
  
Q. As a follow ‑up, is Thomas probably the most physical rebounder that
you've seen? Can you compare her to some of the SEC teams?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Yeah, I think she is. I think she goes to the boards hard, and
I think that's from her athleticism and just‑‑ that's how she plays the game.
She has a knack. There's kids that just have a knack to go to the boards and
they're always around the ball and rebounding. She's one of those kids. So
yeah, I think she does‑‑ the SEC for us, it's physical, it's strong. We rely a
lot on our rebounding opportunities, and I think she fits that bill.  
  
Q. Going back to the SEC Tournament, the two games in Knoxville, you guys
are 5 ‑0, but slow starts. Competition is going to get tougher. How much of a
concern are the slow starts, and if it is a concern how much is it addressed
with the team?   
HOLLY WARLICK: Yeah, we talk a lot about not quick‑shooting the basketball,
and this team seems to be a slow‑starting team. It's been that way all year.
But I'm more concerned how we end it. You know, I think we had to get a little
settled down. It seems to be once we get settled in, we play our game, and I
don't have an answer to why we're getting off to a slow start just as a matter
of quick‑shooting the basketball and giving up quick scores from the other
team.  
But they've got a resilience about them, and they don't panic. Now, I'd love
for us to get out to a good lead and keep it. That would help my nerves a lot.
But you've just got to go with it, and hopefully their focus will be early and
get off to a better start here.  
  
Q. Holly, Thomas is probably one of the most versatile players you've
coached against. Who is going to match up? Who will draw the defensive
assignment on her?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, I think starting off with our starters, it would probably
be Cierra, it may be Andrea, Jasmine Jones, Jordan Reynolds. We're going to
put a variety of people on her, Bashaara Graves. I just don't think one person
can guard her the whole game, and so we're going to mix it up and put
different people on her, obviously put our best defenders on her.  
  
Q. With Meighan Simmons, who is she as a basketball player now compared to
the kid who first came to Knoxville four years ago?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Yeah, well, we were just talking, Meighan started her career
here. She was a freshman and had a start, and we opened up the Yum! Center
against Louisville and she had a great game. I will say this: I think we all
know Meighan came in from high school as a scorer and known to shoot the
basketball. I've watched her game develop and grow, and I think she has come
to understand and learn the game of basketball, and she's getting so much
better on the defensive end. She's become a really good passer, and I think
Meighan now has a lot of trust in this basketball team. I think Meighan in
particular this year, at the beginning of the year, felt she was the lone
senior, felt like she had to do everything, had to do it all, and I think now
she understands that there's some ladies on the basketball team that want to
help her, and it's changed her kind of whole demeanor or outlook of this team
and her play, and so I think I can say now that Meighan is becoming a complete
player.  
  
Q. Did you talk to Nikki? Have you talked to her since she made the
tournament, too? Have you guys had a chance to talk or have you been too
busy?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, we played phone tag last night a couple times, and then
she called me with 10 seconds left during the game, the Tennessee game, so I
didn't take her call. What is she doing? Is she not watching the game? But
we've gone back and forth, and I talked to her before the first and second
round. I know I'll kind of hook up with her today. Proud of her. She's taken a
team that's depleted and injured and has done a great job. I know this is a
tough place to play.  
  
Q. You were talking about Meighan's maturation. Your team in general, this
is familiar territory for you. Where do you feel like they are now compared to
last year's tournament team? Where do you feel like they're growing, and maybe
with having those two tough games, where do they kind of grow from that?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, you know, we're a year older, and we're still young as
far as playing time. Isabelle Harrison was‑‑ she's a junior, but this is
really her first year of being healthy and getting an opportunity to play.
We've got freshman point guards and Cierra Burdick is now getting playing
time, and Meighan is probably our most‑seasoned player. Bashaara Graves is a
sophomore. I think we're more mature. I think we understand that we've got to
do. We're a more focused team. We're a together team. We've spent a lot of
time together off the court getting to know each other and understanding that
we have obviously different personalities, but we've got to trust each other
on the basketball court, and I think what we've done off the court has helped
us tremendously in our success on the court.  
I think that the SEC has prepared us and has challenged us in just about every
aspect of the game as far as it being athletic up and down, physical, going
against zones, going against mans, getting pressed. I just think that we're at
a better place, and we feel a lot better about each other.  
You know, and I probably‑‑ they're more comfortable with me. I mean, last year
is the first year as the coach, and maybe I'm more comfortable. I've been
there but haven't coached in NCAA Tournament games. I think I've evolved, as
well, just along with the team.  
  
Q. You mentioned watching a men's game last night and the last 10 seconds,
and I saw that you guys posted some video of the girls watching it. What has
this run been like for both of you guys? How have you fed off of each other?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, our team, the men's and women's teams are very close
teams, and I personally have a lot of respect for Cuonzo and what he's done
and how hard he works and what he makes his guys do. We feed a lot off of each
other, and the whole community is excited when both teams are playing well. It
gets our fans fired up when the guys do well and vice versa. I was hoping they
could move forward, but just really proud of them, and we ask our group if we
wanted to watch the game together, and we didn't hesitate. We spend a time of
lot with them, and I know our players spend a lot of time with the guys, as
well. Great run.  
  
Q. Going back to what you were saying before about spending time off the
court, anything specific? Is it like movies, more dinners together, just
taking in activities like that to kind of bring them together?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Absolutely. Well, I had said this earlier. We made a decision
last year to move everybody back on campus, number one. That was the biggest
thing for us. We moved everybody back on campus. We put them in the same dorm.
You know, they were spending time together on the court, but when they left,
they were going different directions and staying in different places, so we
thought it was important for them to live with each other and be around each
other, and so that was probably our first step. We've done a lot of team
building. We've stayed up in the mountains and did a ropes course. We do a lot
of dinners together. Especially when we're on the road, we eat every meal and
we do everything together. You just get to know a kid and they get to know you
away from the basketball court, and I think that's where we've changed our
philosophy as far as we want to be around our kids as much as possible.  
I want to know what's going on with them outside of basketball, and I want to
have them in an environment where they can actually sit down and we can have a
conversation, and it's not a‑‑ there's no pressure. We're just sitting around
talking. That's the environment we've created, and I think it's paid dividends
for us.  
  
Q. Cierra has been such a consistent player for you rebounding. Her offense
has been kind of up and down. What is her role right now in your offense,
because she just came up with a big game against St. John's. How do you see
her role?  
HOLLY WARLICK: I just want Cierra, like you said, she's so consistent, and
she's one of our best rebounders. We talk a lot about her, getting rebounds
and controlling the boards. Cierra has a beautiful shot, and when it's going
in, Cierra is the type of player that you think, man, I don't really see her
playing, and she has, whatever she had, 12 points, 10 rebounds, five assists,
and you're like, really? So she's that type of player. She's just kind of a
utility player for us, and when we need something big she seems to come up
with a big lay‑up, a big rebound. She's been very consistent for us.  
  
Q. Cierra, Alyssa Thomas for Maryland is probably one of the most versatile
players you've ever played against, and Holly said you would start out on her
defensively. Did you draw the short straw or how did you get that
assignment?  
CIERRA BURDICK: Well, I think we both play the same position. We play similar.
She's a great player. I have a lot of respect for her. But I think my
teammates and my coaches have done a great job of preparing me for the
assignment that I'll have at hand. I've watched some film on her. I know her
tendencies. Our practice players have done a great job of playing similar to
her. So I'm looking forward to the challenge that lies ahead of me.  
I think I'm prepared. I think my teammates will have my back and will be able
to limit her touches like we want.  
  
Q. Obviously the Final Four is the goal, and I'll say for any of you to
answer this question, you all really need to kind of just get over that hump,
what thing did you look back on last year or past trips here and think if you
can do that we can get over that hump and get to the Final Four?  
CIERRA BURDICK: Just looking back at last year when we were defeated by
Louisville in that Elite 8, the feeling we had, I still remember it to this
day. It was an awful feeling because we were so close. I think we should have
won that game.  
From the day after that, 360 days from yesterday is when we got knocked out by
Louisville, so these past 361 days we've been working for this moment, for
these next two games, to get over the hump, to get to Nashville. That's been
our goal, that's been our dream, and I think we've put in the time. I think
we've done what we needed to do, and now it's just a matter of executing and
playing our ball.  
MEIGHAN SIMMONS: I think it's just, like Cierra said, that feeling, that gut
feeling of knowing that we were doing everything that we could. We fought
back. Our huddles were so tight. We were communicating with each other. We
never one time got negative in the game. We stuck together. I think it's just
one of those things where we just have to continue to tell each other to never
give up, to push for 40 minutes straight until that clock hits 0:00 and not
letting up if we do get a lead, not letting up, and just continuing to have
that fight, and this team is completely different from last year's, and I
think we just need to just go out and give 110 percent if we want to get to a
Final Four. That's what we need to do, each and every one of us have to give
110 percent.  
ISABELLE HARRISON: I think we just need to focus on our next game. We can't
get to where we want to go if we don't focus on the game at hand right now. I
think in years before, we've to the Final Four, but we can't overlook who
we're going to play next, and I think if you take every game as a full 40
minutes and take advantage of that and know that they have to play Tennessee,
and once we get that confidence about ourselves and know that we're coming to
the gym to play and play our hardest game, I think it's going to be the
turning point for us, and definitely last year was a terrible feeling. I
remember thinking this time next year, remember how it felt, and you don't
want to lose again, so we've been having that bitter feeling on our shoulders
for a while. Now is the time, and we can't back down from it.  
  
Q. Isabelle, Holly said you guys watched the men's game together last night.
That must have been an emotionally exhausting experience for you the way the
game went?  
ISABELLE HARRISON: Yeah, it was a terrible turnout because I know how hard
those guys work and how much it would have meant for them to go even further
in the tournament. You just don't want to see it happen to a group of guys
like that. You don't ever want the refs to call a game for you, especially
when it comes down to the last play like that. That's why it's important to
play the full 40 minutes and kind of dictate where you're going to go, don't
let it be in the hands of the refs. I think the guys did a great job this year
with Cuonzo and the rest of the team.  
  
Q. Meighan, Holly was talking about your first game as a freshman was in
this arena. Can you maybe think back to then, that day, and just the
transition from freshman to senior year and maybe your emotions then versus
maybe your emotions tomorrow?  
MEIGHAN SIMMONS: Oh, man. My adrenaline is still‑‑ is flowing like from
walking into the arena and just having flashbacks of where we were sitting to
the locker room that we were in to the hotel we're staying in. I mean,
everything is just coming back to me.  
I just remember being very, very nervous. I didn't know whether or not I was
going to play. I didn't‑‑ I had so many different emotions, but I knew I was
confident enough that if I did get out there and play, I would give my 110
percent. Just now the feelings are a little bit different because there's
something else that's at stake. I want to finish my career trying to get to a
Final Four and just take it one game at a time. I'm just trying to enjoy this
moment and just that feeling of being here, and this is the first time opening
in the gym, this is their first game, as well, but I remember Pat telling me
be confident in you, and everything else will fall into place. When I put you
out there, I expect you to give me your 110 percent. I will never forget that
that game was just something I will never forget, and I just played my
hardest, and I didn't want to lose that game. I didn't want to let her down,
and for my teammates, for Cierra and Izzy, just for speak for them, I don't
want to not give my 110 percent. Being the only senior that's what I have to
do, and I want to take them to a Final Four just as much as they want to take
me to a Final Four.  
  
Q. Meighan, when you look at the teams, you've got Maryland, yourself,
Louisville, we're talking about teams that can score. How do you kind of ‑‑
when you face a similar team that can score, what has to give? What kind of
things do you have to do on defense to really kind of negate that, especially
with Maryland being a top 20 team in scoring?   
MEIGHAN SIMMONS: I think just for us, I think it's just playing as if we're
playing against us. Everybody on our team can score at any point in time. I
think it's just a matter of who's going to want it more, who's going to play
harder, who's going to get the 50/50 balls, who's going to be more gritty,
have more of a swag and attitude about them that when they do get out there on
the floor everybody is on point and everybody is clicking together. Like I
said, it's just a matter of‑‑ everybody is going to try to score, it's just a
matter of who's going to want it more and who's going to do the dirty work
besides just scoring, like getting the rebounds because we have excellent
rebounders, getting to the free‑throw line and just continuing to attack out
there on the floor.

_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  
BRENDA FRESE: Obviously excited to be here in the great state of Kentucky. I
think it's really interesting obviously to be here in Louisville with us
exiting the ACC and as Louisville enters. However it shakes out, obviously we
are going to hand off our ACC banner to the Louisville folks.  
Even though this is our third‑straight year in the Sweet 16, it's something
that we never take for granted. Obviously it's extremely hard to be able to
get here. When you look at the four teams that are here, what you see is a lot
of programs in women's basketball with a ton of history and a lot of success.  
Tennessee being our next opponent is right there at the top tied with
Connecticut with the most national championships, a program with incredible
tradition. We haven't played them since 2005, but we've seen many of their
players out on the recruiting trails.  
Holly has done a terrific job. I can't say enough, in terms of the right
person for the job. Tennessee is really an extremely athletic team with a ton
of depth.  
I think you'll see with both teams a lot of similar tendencies. Both teams
want to rebound extremely hard. Both teams are very up‑tempo and have a lot of
depth. Both teams are led, I think it's ironic, by the ACC/SEC Player of the
Year and both have freshmen point guards leading the way. As far as I know I
don't think anyone is picking us to be able to win this game, so we're just
going to come out and obviously play extremely loose. I love where our team is
at, how we're playing, playing some of our best basketball at the moment.  
  
Q. Is there anything you take from the last two appearances in the Sweet 16
that you can apply to this time, particularly being able to beat A &M two
years ago?   
BRENDA FRESE: You know, first and foremost, I think it's important for your
team, especially when you talk about your young players that we have on our
squad in terms of being able to experience these moments and to be able to get
to a Sweet 16, and if you're fortunate to be able to advance. I think the
biggest thing we've talked about to our team is minimizing distractions. You
have a lot going on, a lot more media requests, and so for us just really
narrowing the focus to us and really preparing for our moment and what we can
do.  
  
Q. Holly, when asked about who would guard Alyssa Thomas, named five
different players, two point guards, a post, a couple of forwards. Just how
varied have defenses been against her, and what gimmicks, if any, have teams
tried?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, obviously I'm sure it's by committee. It's a whole team.
You can imagine with Alyssa in her four years, she's seen everything. She's
seen man, zone, box‑and‑one, two players running at her, teams game plan to be
ultra‑physical, just anything and everything you can expect in her career
she's seen. Hopefully I would think at this stage that she would be ready for
it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how your freshmen have developed this year and how
much of a contribution, how helpful that's been for you?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know, I think when they came in in the summer, we saw
really special group in terms of the freshmen, how quickly they were able to
pick up on our plays and different things out there. But when you talk about
Lexie and Brionna starting for us as freshmen and giving us an inside‑outside
presence, and then you talk about Shatori Walker‑Kimbrough coming off the
bench and being second in scoring on our team. So all three are really
dynamic, have had a huge impact on this team, and obviously we're thrilled for
their future, what they're going to be able to be asked after Alyssa
graduates, to be able to bring to the table.  
  
Q. Having been both a favorite and an underdog, is there a different
approach depending on what side of the ledger you fall ongoing into any
particular game?  
BRENDA FRESE: There really isn't. I think it's more based on your team's
mentality in terms of how do they handle being the underdog, how do they
handle it in terms of the different seeds. You know, I think really every team
is unique, and it's really in terms of how they are able to handle what
expectations are placed on them.  
  
Q. Certainly this game is more than just about two players, but can you talk
about the appreciation of seeing Simmons and Thomas on the floor at the same
time tomorrow?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know, like I spoke of earlier, pretty neat dynamic
when you talk about the ACC Player of the Year and the SEC Player of the Year
in two powerful conferences. Obviously what each one of them has meant to
their respective programs, what they've brought to the table in their four
years, obviously from both ends their ability to score the basketball, the
ability to be able to get others involved, and I mean, obviously two
incredible players that are seniors, that one is going to be able to advance
and the other one's senior season will be complete.  
  
Q. Of course you already know they're probably going to be a lot of
Tennessee fans here tomorrow. How have you prepared them for that? They've
been in hostile environments such as Duke and Carolina, but your familiarity
with Tennessee from years ago, what's the biggest challenge when you go into
an environment like that when you face a team like Tennessee with a big
following?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you think there will be a few fans here? No, we're excited
about it. You embrace it. You want to play in front of fans instead of an
empty arena. From our end, yesterday we piped in "Rocky Top" and allowed our
players to‑‑ some of them hadn't even heard "Rocky Top", so to be able to get
used to it, and then of course our Maryland fight song so they would know back
and forth what this is going to look like.  
Our conference prepares us for tough environments. Our staff I think does a
really good job in terms of just preparing them for what this is going to be
like, and obviously if you're in the Sweet 16 and you're not prepared for this
moment, then you'll probably be going home. Our kids fully know what it's
going to look like and feel like.  
  
Q. Did you have it on a continuous loop or did you have to stop and explain
what the song meant to them?  
BRENDA FRESE: It was on a loop, but I heard later through some quotes that I
saw that even our senior Alicia DeVaughn wasn't even sure. But she was used
to‑‑ we've done this before in terms of different teams that we face.  
But I guess you liken it, as well, to last year when we played UConn up in
Bridgeport, and that was definitely filled with a lot of Connecticut fans. So
the fact that our team has experienced this before I think is key.  
  
Q. When you were recruiting Thomas, did you envision her becoming this
versatile and this great a player?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, you know, it's one of the best recruiting stories,
probably one of the best decisions I've ever made in recruiting. A lot of
staffs went out to USA Basketball and followed a lot of players, and I decided
to go up to a local Battle of the Baltimore Tournament to be able to go check
out this Alyssa Thomas that we had heard great things about. You know, from
the minute I saw her in the lay‑up line and you saw those big shoulders and
her size and her strength and her speed, we did envision one day her name and
her number being up in the rafters.  
I think kind of the greatest thing about Alyssa, though, is how humble she has
stayed throughout all of it and just how she's never satisfied with her game.
She's always wanting to get better, wanting to improve, and really the
versatility that she has, has played every single position in her four years
and has done anything that we've asked her to for this program.  
  
Q. As a follow ‑up, what things do you see her do that reinforce your belief
or your feeling that I'm glad she's on our side? Is there any one thing that
really stands out that continues to improve you?   
BRENDA FRESE: Well, first of all, I'm going to petition the NCAA to get her a
fifth year and to be able to bring her back. You know, I mean, when you see
plays we'll see in practice and then in games where she'll rebound the ball
and throw it the length of the floor on a dime, like the basketball is like a
dime‑‑ a nickel or a dime in her hand, she's just so strong. You saw her get
it off the glass, and I liken her in our transition game to LeBron. Like who
would want to step in and take a charge off of that, and with her speed and
power coming down the floor in transition, I'm not sure there's another player
in the country that can come at that pace that she's able to do.  
Just so many things that she's able to do that you have to appreciate that
we've been given in these last four years.  
  
Q. You had alluded to your team's mentality a little earlier. What is the
mentality of this team given the particular makeup of veterans and freshmen?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, you know, I'm excited by the fact that I really feel like
we are playing some of our best basketball, and I think it's a group that is
really confident and really believes in each other, and I think when you look
at our last game with Texas and you see Alyssa scoreless in the first half,
which I can't ever remember happening in her career, our team didn't miss a
beat. They weren't concerned. There wasn't any kind of anxiety. Earlier in the
season there would have been that case.  
I do like the fact that I feel like we are peaking at the right time, and
we're really playing for each other.  
  
Q. Alyssa, your take on the number of people in any one game that can cover
you; how have you adapted to that and sometimes being double ‑ or
triple‑teamed?   
ALYSSA THOMAS: I expect it. But with the team that we have and the scorers
that we have, it takes it hard to just focus on one person.  
  
Q. Any of the players, your coach was just in here saying that she was
playing "Rocky Top" I guess at practice this week. What was that experience
like? Did there have to be some explanation as to what was going on there?   
LEXIE BROWN: Well, yeah, of course I was the first one to be like why is this
music playing? She was just trying to simulate the type of environment we're
going to be in tomorrow just with a lot of noise and a lot of Tennessee fans.  
LAURIN MINCY: To piggyback on Lexie, it was obviously very different. But
Coach B was just getting us prepared. Tennessee is going to have a lot of fans
here, so we just have to be ready and keep the noise off.  
ALYSSA THOMAS: I think it was the first time any of us heard that song, and
just like they said, they were just simulating what it's going to be like.  
  
Q. Alyssa, is there anything you can take from the last two Sweet 16 trips
that you can apply this time around, particularly being able to beat A &M two
years ago?   
ALYSSA THOMAS: Yeah, it takes a team effort. You've got to come out from the
start and play your best game, and most importantly stick together. Hopefully
good things come out of it.  
  
Q. Alyssa, as the season has gone along, have teams tried to be more
physical with you?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: Absolutely. They try to be extremely physical, try to take me
out of my game, and just really eliminate me from moving around out there.  
  
Q. Alyssa, what was your familiarity with SEC ‑style ball before this, and
can you talk a little bit about what the addition of Syracuse and Pittsburgh
in the ACC, what they brought there, speaking of physicality, how much that
has helped you or how you've adjusted to that?   
ALYSSA THOMAS: Yeah, SEC, just what I've seen, very physical teams, very
high‑energy teams, a lot of great players come out of the SEC. And then as far
as Syracuse and Pitt, they've just elevated the ACC. They're both teams that
have really come in and played hard and just added to the ACC.  
  
Q. Laurin, we've seen you shoot the three, score a bunch of points in many
different games, but just your thoughts on defense and how important that is
to you and where that stands in terms of how you like to approach the game.  
LAURIN MINCY: I think just defense is ‑‑ just play your part. I always look
forward to guarding the best player on the team, and I think we're just going
to come out and it's going to be a team effort on defense and also on the
rebounding battle.  
  
Q. Laurin and Lexie, Coach Frese talked about how fast and strong Alyssa is
and how she didn't think anybody would want to take a charge from her. Have
you ever taken a charge from her in practice?  
LAURIN MINCY: No.  
LEXIE BROWN: No. We know better. We save that for the opponents. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Have any of you tried to charge against her in practice, and what's that
like?  
LEXIE BROWN: Like hitting a brick wall.  
LAURIN MINCY: She'll try and block you before she takes a charge.

_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  
NIKKI CALDWELL: They had a really nice crowd the last time we were here, and I
know they had a beer promotion going on, too, during that time. But I know
we're not going to have any this time.  
I think the one thing about playing a team like Louisville, they're an
exciting team to watch. Their transition game is very explosive. Schimmel is a
fun player to watch. I've followed her career for a long time, and they do a
very nice job of distributing the basketball and having a balanced attack.  
Yes, we are familiar with playing them earlier on in the season, and this team
has grown from that experience and we've gone on to play other difficult
teams, as well. And we're just going to make sure that we come in prepared and
stick to our game plan.  
  
Q. Coach Walz was talking about Danielle and he said that the fact that
you'll have fewer numbers allowed her to be a little freer, allowed her to
have a little more feeling of I need to take over this game because there's no
one else to do that. Do you feel that's helped her with her progression
because clearly she's playing some of her best basketball of the season?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: We were joking about the fact that our numbers are low and
they can do pretty much whatever they want. What am I going to do, sub them
out? They're in a good spot right now, and Ballard has really elevated her
play as of late. But Ballard has been that player all along for us. I can
recall playing at Tennessee and her really taking that responsibility of
putting the team on her back and being aggressive, so she's had numerous games
where she's done that for us, so just proud of her play and proud of the play
of all of our players at this point. Our freshmen came in and gave us valuable
minutes. Shanece McKinney is playing bigger, stronger, more dominant than
ever, and Theresa Plaisance has just been very, very solid for us.  
Again, we're in a good place even with our numbers being as low as they are.  
  
Q. What lessons did you guys learn from the first time you all played them?
I guess it ended up being a loss for you guys. Do you put that out of your
mind? Does that have an impact on this game at all, that outcome? Anything
that you took away from the game the first time?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: You take a lot away from the game as a coach. I think players
take‑‑ it's a little different for the players because they know they have
another game, and so they move on and they continue their season. But as a
coach you go back and you watch the play action that you ran and you watch
what they did, and then obviously you're watching what they're doing now
because they're not the same team that they were when we played them early in
the season, and neither are we.  
We know that there were areas that challenged us, and obviously taking care of
the basketball was one of them. They did a nice job of capitalizing off our
turnovers. So have many teams. So we know that that is an area that we've got
to be solid in, and then obviously I'm a firm believer that you've got to get
on the boards and you've got to control the boards. You control the boards,
you control the tempo of the game.  
  
Q. How do you view them as being different since that first meeting? What's
been something that stood out about their team.  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, I think the one thing that when you watch, they've had
different looks thrown at them where people have tried to really tried to
disrupt Shoni Schimmel, and I think she's been exposed to a lot of different
defensive looks, and she's figured them out. I think early in the year, your
team is a team that, as far as Louisville and a lot of teams, everybody's role
is being defined and everybody knows exactly at this time of year what's
expected of them when you get late in the season.  
There's a difference in urgency that you're playing with, and that's what
you're seeing with a lot of these teams.  
  
Q. You're giving up 72 points a game, so I don't know if you're ever truly
pleased with your defense, but it seems like ‑‑ are you more pleased with the
commitment they've made to defense in the tournament? Seems like you're
pursuing more, rotating more to the ball, you're showing a little more
intensity on that end compared to the regular season.   
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, we're not the best defensive team in the country as far
as statistics. We're just finding our way to get it done. As long as they're
playing hard and they're supporting their teammates, whether it's rotating
over, taking a charge or dropping down to help on the weak side for board
play, that's all we can ask of our team. We've got a group of young ladies
that have made the commitment to really play together and lay it on the line,
and that's all you can ask for in your team is for them to go out and give you
those effort plays.  
We had a lot of effort plays, positive‑effort plays, if you will, over the
last two games in the tournament, and the plays that you make may be unspoken
and they may not show up on the stat sheet, and you may not be written about.
But there are plays that you know as a competitor that you've played to help
your team win.  
  
Q. How much does this help that it to some degree is old hat? You faced
limited numbers last game out but also last year, so this team has some
experience with dealing with that.  
NIKKI CALDWELL: We've got some experience with it. No coach wants to go into
the season or go into postseason play with a limited roster. It is what it is,
and our team, their attitude towards it has been very, very positive and very
focused. They know we've got to play extremely smart but we've also got to
play as a unit. No one can hide. Your numbers is going to be called, and it's
just a matter of going in there and answering the call. And the way that
they're going to do it and the way that they have prepared for this weekend
has been very, I would say, focused, and that's what you want this time of
year. No matter if you've got eight, nine, 10, 11 kids on your roster, you
want them to have a sense of focus about them.  
  
Q. The first meeting Asia Taylor who had missed all of last year for them
had kind of a breakout game. What have you made of her, and is that something
you guys are now maybe focusing on more as sort of being more aware that she's
come on as one of their premier players?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, she's done a really nice job of being just everywhere.
You can watch film and her name is going to be called. But you can't just
focus in on one player on their roster. They have so many different weapons
and so many players have stepped up at different times of the year for their
team, and that's a mature team.  
There's times where a lot of the notoriety and the recognition goes to
Schimmel, but you can't lose where Slaughter is. When Jude comes in she makes
positive plays. You've just got to have a team balanced ‑‑ a sense of effort
against their team, because you can't just focus in on one player.  
  
Q. Do you plan on starting Hill in place of Kenney?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: No, we're going to go with Jasmine Rhodes, and a lot of times
when you look at your potential starters, Rina Hill has started for us, she's
going to see valuable time, and so is Sheila Boykin and Anne Pederson.  
  
Q. Has Coach Kenney made her contribution yet so far? Are there ways she's
tried to school the other players, or you, in what they should do strategy
‑wise in this game?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, she's definitely aware. She knows the scout. She's
always been a student of the game, and she's been very helpful to her
teammates, and that's what we need from her. Her voice still will be heard and
her leadership is still going to be needed, although she's going to be
sidelined.  
  
Q. Your last presser you talked about the drama that is inherent with a team
like yours, I guess. Do you want them to feed on that? Do you want them to
play to that emotion of maybe not having Jeanne, or is that something you
would prefer them to be very businesslike with?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: No, you want your kids to feel whatever it is, and there's a
different relationship that each of the kids have with Jeanne, and obviously
Theresa Plaisance and Jeanne Kenney have been playing ball for a long, long
time, so Theresa is going to have a different feeling toward not having Jeanne
out there. Danielle Ballard and Jeanne have been a great combination so they
have a different relationship. But I know that the upperclassmen have
developed unique relationships with all of our underclassmen, so there's this
feeling of we don't want it to end for them, and so that's a positive thing.
If we can continue to just be of service to each other in that way, then it
takes a lot of pressure off of you as the individual to have to go out there
and perform when you're saying I'm doing this for someone else or something
bigger than myself.  
  
Q. Danielle, Louisville has been playing very good defense in the NCAA
Tournament. I think they're leading the tournament in points allowed.
Obviously you'll be a key for their defense tomorrow. Do you feel like you
have to try to do some things differently from what you've been doing or just
try to do those things better?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: No, we're just going to do what Coach has planned for us,
just run plays, do everything right and don't force anything, don't try to do
too much, just play our game and play the way how we've been playing.  
  
Q. Danielle, what are your thoughts about their pressure and how much
pressure will be on you with Jeanne out of the game?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: We have other guards that can handle the ball, too, just not
me that can handle the ball. We have other guards that are good at handling
the ball, so if I get pressure I have a way to kick it out to one of my other
players, or even the post players, they can handle the ball, too. We have a
lot of guards that can handle the ball, too.  
  
Q. For all three of the girls, could you talk about your previous experience
with this team, does that help or hinder in any way?  
SHANECE McKINNEY: Playing this team before, we definitely know what they're
going to bring to the game on Sunday. We just use that past experience as
motivation to go out there and play harder. We're definitely not the team that
we were before when we played them. We just try to think of the ways to play a
lot better than we did before and what were our weaknesses in that game and
our strengths, and we just try to play into those.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Yeah, just to piggyback off of what Shanece said, we're not
the same team that we were in November. We've matured so much and we've grown
so much since we last played them, I really don't think it's going to be a
similar game. We're familiar with each other in that sense, but as far as
knowing what each other is going to do, I feel like both teams have grown, and
we've had a lot more experience, have a lot more games under our belt now at
this point. I feel like the game is going to be a pretty good game, and it's
unexpected what's going to happen.  
DANIELLE BALLARD: Yeah, exactly what they were saying. We're a better team,
being in the gym, putting in work, just improving on our game and on our
defense, too, and we've just been studying Louisville for this past week, so
we're just prepared for this team. We know they're going to bring it, but we
just have been preparing for this team. What happened in November, that's not
the team that y'all are seeing now. We're a way better team than we were in
November. We've got a better IQ now than we did in November. We're just going
to play harder. We're going to play hard this game.  
  
Q. Theresa, from the first game, basically the game was tied and very close
and they had a 20 ‑0 run or something along those lines. What do you recall
about that? What does that kind of tell you about the ability that they have
to go on a run like that, what you guys need to do to stop a run like that?
Just kind of reflect on that a little bit and anything that you learned from
it.   
THERESA PLAISANCE: Louisville has a great team, and they have great pressure
defense. At halftime we came in the locker room, came back out, and they went
on that 20‑0 run. We had a lot of trouble with their pressure and we were
coughing up the ball, turning it over left and right. Now we're a little more
prepared. I feel like in the tournament we experienced teams that bring the
same kind of pressure defense. Georgia Tech did a great job with their
pressure defense, and same with West Virginia. So I think we've done a better
job of settling and really staying patient with the ball in our hands, and I
feel like now we're better prepared for the pressure defense that they're
going to bring. Hopefully that won't happen again, that 20‑0 run, because once
that happened we really had no chance of coming back.  
  
Q. Shanece, it seems like you guys are playing better defense in these first
two games, but how important is it for you and Theresa to play without fouling
because the only person you can go to is Sheila can come off the bench and
that's it. Everyone saw against West Virginia it was her and four guards for a
long time in the second half.  
SHANECE McKINNEY: Well, I mean, it's definitely important that we don't get in
foul trouble this game because they do have decent‑size post players, and we
wouldn't want to put our guards or Sheila in that situation of having to guard
their post players, and it would be a disadvantage. I think if we can try to
be sweet to the refs a little bit, maybe we can get a couple bumps (laughing),
because definitely against West Virginia we couldn't do anything right as far
as trying to block the shots without getting fouls. We've just got to play a
little bit smarter.  
  
Q. Theresa, last year when they played Baylor, very similar spot to where
you guys are, no one thought they had much of a chance. Baylor was this huge
favorite not only to win the game but to win the tournament, and they pulled
the upset of the tournament really. You guys are in a similar spot this year.
Do you take some encouragement or inspiration from what they did last year?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: I really haven't thought about that much. Louisville is a
great team led by Shoni Schimmel, a good friend of mine. I know they have a
lot of weapons. I feel like we match up well against them, because we also
have a lot of weapons. We're down a few players, but we have other players
that can step up and fill their spots and do a great job for us.  
I don't think anybody really expected us to actually come in the tournament
and win our first two games. A lot of people were counting us out in the first
round, and right now I feel like our hope is alive and we're feeling extremely
proud of ourselves for making it this far, and I think we like playing against
the odds. When you don't have anybody on your side, then there's not much that
can go wrong, like what do you have to lose kind of thing. But we're going to
fight tooth and nail for this, and we want this more than anything. We believe
in each other, and that's all that really matters. We're just looking to come
out here and play our game and stick to our game plan, and if that happens,
then I feel like the odds are in our favor.  
  
Q. Theresa, can you talk about your friendship with Shoni from playing with
her over in Russia and just kind of being a teammate with her and getting to
know her over the summer? Do you guys stay in touch and anything about y'all's
relationship?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, Shoni was super shy at first, and I was a more
outgoing personality on the team. But once we got to Russia, we had a great
time. Shoni is one of my closest friends on that team, and yeah, we still keep
in touch. We have a lot of inside stories, a lot of inside jokes, and just
playing with her, she's an amazing, amazing player, just her ability to score
and her passing ability.  
I remember this one play, I spun and I knew I was about to be wide open, and I
missed the pass because she already saw it like two seconds before I did, the
ball went right by my head and I was sitting there waiting for the ball and
she already passed it. She's just a great player, and she's an even better
person. I really enjoyed spending the time with her in Russia. There's so many
stories that I probably shouldn't even share. We just had a great time. We
just had a great time.  
  
Q. Just going back there to the locker room at LSU and talking to some of
the girls, just about the last time that you all played Louisville here, what
do you feel like coming back here? Do you feel intimidated by the crowd at all
or are you used to that? I heard some of the girls talking about Tennessee and
being in that crowd situation. Does that not intimidate you at all, the
crowd?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: You know, the crowd here the first time we came, the
support, the fan base here is outstanding. Louisville has great fan turnout,
and I don't expect anything less for a tournament game. But we've been up
against crowds like this, and we have to do what we can to control what we can
control. We can't control the crowd, we can't control the refs. We can't
control a lot of things. If we just stick with each other and not let other
things, outside things affect us, then we should be fine. That crowd is
roaring at times, and we need to do the best we can to try to keep the crowd
out of it because they really have a great turnout here.  
  
Q. Shanece, Nikki mentioned what am I going to do, take them out if they
make a mistake? Kidding aside, is there a little freedom to that, knowing
that, hey, I just have to keep playing and just got to make it work whatever
the situation is?  
SHANECE McKINNEY: Yeah, we were even talking about that off the court. In the
beginning of the season we weren't allowed‑‑ like we're not allowed on social
media until the season is over, so at this point she was like, well, y'all can
probably post on Instagram or Twitter or something. What am I going to do,
suspend you guys? It's definitely a little more freedom, I guess, but we
wouldn't take advantage of it in a bad way.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Yeah, I wouldn't try it.  
SHANECE McKINNEY: Because you never know.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: We can read Tweets, just no actual Tweets.  
  
Q. Theresa, one more question about Shoni. Did you know that she had kind of
gained this fame in the Native American community or have you learned about
that since and read about that?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, when we were up there, Coach Coale talked a lot about
our podium, and the podium that we're on right now is probably the biggest
podium that we're going to be on in our entire lives. Even if you go pro, your
podium really isn't as big, the fan base of pro leagues aren't as strong as
women's college basketball, and she was just like using Shoni as an example,
like not only is she on the podium for women's college basketball but she's
also on the podium for Native Americans, and everything that she's done and
the support that she has, and I think that's great. Her and her sister do a
great job, and they earned it. They came out and they showed what they can do,
and they made believers out of everyone. I feel like they deserve everything
that they're getting.

_STANFORD, CALIFORNIA_  
  

STANFORD  74  
NORTH CAROLINA - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Stanford University Head Coach, Tara
VanDerveer, student‑athletes, Chiney Ogwumike and Mikaela Ruef. Coach, can we
start with an opening statement from you?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, if a game was like five minutes long, we would not be
sitting up here and be in a good mood. If the game was even ten minutes long,
we'd probably not be excited. But in 40 minutes our team, I thought, really
showed great resilience, figured out things that were working, worked really
hard together, and beat an excellent UNC team, and I want to congratulate
Andrew and the NorthCarolina team on a great season. They just really are a
young team, and they're going to be really good. But we're going to Nashville,
and we're very excited about that.  
I think our leadership with Chiney and Mikaela and for Mikaela to be knocking
down her threes, that was absolutely huge. Her free throws, her defense was
great. Chiney with a double‑double, and not playing maybe as relaxed as she
usually does, but a lot of different people helped us win. Bonnie had big
shots, Lili had great defense and big shots, and Amber, I thought, really kept
us in the first half.  
  
Q. Chiney, why are you guys going to Nashville?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Heart, heart. People were making plays based on heart. It
wasn't like the perfectly executed play. It was the play you wanted to make
because you played with your heart, and that was from the tip. Obviously, I
struggled quite a bit. But Amber, whenever we need her, she steps up big.
Mikaela, those shots were from her heart. She shoots a lot in the gym, but I
mean, it was just a heart game. This is a fifth‑year senior playing in Maples.
I mean, it just came down to heart.  
  
Q. Mikaela, Chiney kind of touched on it a bit, but where did that three
ball come from?  
MIKAELA RUEF: I'm trying really hard not to say something stupid. I told
Chiney I'm going to say something stupid when I'm up here. You know what, I
don't have a voice right now either, so that's always good. I used to be a
three‑point shooter back in the day, and then I came here and it wasn't my
thing so much anymore.  
But they were literally standing in the paint, and I was like, well, you know
what? I'm either going to turn it over or this is going to go in, so I shot
it, and it went in. Then I just kept shooting it. I was like, hey, why not,
and it had to be three because that's the magic number.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: That's her favorite number.  
  
Q. Chiney, can you talk about the defense that you faced and how they draped
on you like ornaments? Was it difficult to allow your teammates to do their
thing to free it up for you or did you want to force it?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Absolutely not difficult at all. Yeah, we had a lot of people
in double figures. Like they were just talking five. I think it was a very
difficult game. For me, the physicality was a lot. They were sagging in a lot,
and that changes the perspective. But I've talked about it, and talked about
it, and talked about it, I have the utmost faith in my teammates. If I score
zero points and we win, I'll be the happiest camper on the team. If we have so
many people‑‑ that's when we play at our best is when we have more people in
double figures. When Amber was doing it in the beginning and Mikaela
consistently through the second half, and Lili coming up with big plays off
the dribble, those are the things that make us a better team. So I say I like
to be an afterthought sometimes, and I think tonight I had to be an
afterthought a little bit, which was good because other people were being
aggressive.  
  
Q. Chiney, halftime, four points, things not going that well. What did your
big sister say to you in the hallway?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: She told me to relax. I've seen a lot of different defenses,
and this one was different in the sense that it was an NCAA Tournament
defense. It was will, and it was just banging in the paint. Like throwback
basketball. She just told me to relax. And Coach Tara told me the exact same
thing. That's why Nnemkadi and Coach Tara are soul sisters in a way. She told
me to relax and play basketball. The game will come to you. She told me just
be aggressive and push through. That's exactly what Mikaela told me, and
exactly what my bench teammates were telling me. So I was just relaxing and I
was like, okay, I'm going to be aggressive, and hopefully I'll finish a couple
of shots. Hopefully, I can do that for my team.  
It's not hard to finish when you have someone giving you dime pieces, and
that's Mikaela Ruef and Amber Orrange and stuff like that.  
  
Q. Chiney, you've been in a lot of big games. Why were you not relaxed
tonight in the first half? What was the difference in the second half that was
Mikaela's outside shooting and your other teammates, did that loosen things up
inside for you?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Mentally, I thought I was relaxed. I feel like I was playing
relaxed. It's just that things weren't coming the same way they usually were.
It's sort of like you just have to step back and be like, okay, just keep
playing the game. So I was relaxed, but it was just different. It was just
different.  
I honestly don't know how to answer that question. It's a 40‑minute game. It's
not going to go the way you want the first 20 minutes, but if you just keep
pushing through, that's what good teams do. You keep pushing through.  
  
Q. Mikaela and Chiney, the NorthCarolina players were in here and the coach,
and they talked about how the game could have been even more physical. They
wanted to make it physical, and they wished it had been even more physical. It
looked pretty physical for me from the outside. Do you think you guys are
underrated as a physical team? Do you think some of that is because of the
whole Stanford business?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I don't think it's fair for the game to be more physical than
it was today. I usually get physical games from a lot of people and so does
Mikaela down low. It's different, so I think anymore physicality should have,
would have, could have, it's like that. I don't think that's fair to the
players, honestly, that kind of phrasing.  
At Stanford, we pushed through that. It was physical, and we found a way to
win. I mean, if that's what people want to do, we're going to just try to keep
pushing through. That's what we did tonight and that's what we'll continue to
do is pushing through.  
MIKAELA RUEF: I think our team did a good job of not letting it bother us. It
was a physical game. I thought the rule changes this year were to try to get
it away from the physicality. But if it's going to be physical, our team can
handle that. I think we did a decent job of it tonight.  
  
Q. Mikaela, can you talk about what Lili did tonight? What Bonnie did
tonight? There were some big plays by some various people tonight.  
MIKAELA RUEF: Lili played amazing defense the entire night on Diamond
DeShields. She had two back‑to‑back tough match‑ups, and she's played like
she's been here forever. She's only a freshman, but you know, we trust her and
we expect her to play well because she's a great player and played some
amazing defense today. And Bonnie is more than just a shooter. She had a nice
pull‑up today. I was like, nice Bonnie. And she was boxing out really well on
the defensive end too.  
I mean, these are things that these kids do it in practice. It's not like
surprising and I'm just happy they were able to do it in the game too.  
  
Q. You have talked about the heart being the difference in this game. How
much was your experience edge a difference in this game?  
MIKAELA RUEF: I thought before the game that experience doesn't really mean
anything. They kind of came out here and you could tell that they were playing
super, super loose, and we were tight. Tara told us we were tight. I think the
crowd could tell that we were tight. It doesn't matter how much experience you
have, if you're playing tight, that's not good.  
They came out and they played well. They shot well, and I don't think that has
anything to do with experience. But at this time they're not freshmen anymore.
They've been playing a whole year, so they're basically sophomores. Maybe
we've been here a little longer, but I don't think really experience‑‑ it was
heart in this game, not experience.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Yeah, I'm on the same page. It was heart, not experience. I
think that will be something that they'll learn from this experience because
they're a very talented team. I think that also we've played a lot of games
where we haven't necessarily played our best game, but we've pushed through
coming from behind and not playing as well as we'd hoped. I think those
experiences helped us stay steady and positive. You make a turnover, and you
don't hang your head. It's great to have Mikaela say, Chiney, don't worry
about that, or Lili say, Chiney, don't worry about that also. I think that
experience helped us.  
  
Q. When they went up 22 ‑9 in the first half, still a lot of game left to be
played but they simply weren't missing. I think Allisha Gray had three
three‑pointers in a row or something. Was there any sense of, uh‑oh, these are
freshmen, and they're not even thinking and they're just going to be able to
keep this up? Or was there more of a sense that just take a deep breath and
play your game, and it will all come back?   
MIKAELA RUEF: I think it was probably the second. The entire time they just
kept making shots, and I kept telling our team, it's all right. They're going
to miss. They're going to miss. Keep playing hard. Make them make tougher
shots. Get up there and contest their shots. And they're going to miss, and
we're going to start making our shots. I think our team did a really good job
of not being discouraged. Basketball is a game of runs. They had a run in the
beginning of the game, and we got our run right before halftime to give us a
chance in the second half. I don't think our team ever thought‑‑ maybe we did
panic, but nobody showed it. I think that's something that our team did really
well.  
  
Q. I don't want to make you guys cry, but this is the last time you'll play
on this court. What is going through your minds right now?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Wow, I mean, if there is any way to win at Maples in front of
your fans and family and everything, it's a win with heart. Honestly it's
unreal what just happened. Just to push through when you're not necessarily
playing well and you have people like Mikaela playing out of her mind because
we're at home and there are so many people. She's come so far, and we've had
so many people that just really wanted to keep this year going, and that
started with everyone, not necessarily people who were out there, but like
Erica Payne, Jasmine Camp preparing us. I guess that's like the only thing.  
We have so much heart this team. Sometimes people say heart, you can't win
only on heart, but tonight, I think we did.  
MIKAELA RUEF: At the beginning of the year when the regional sites came out
and I saw there was one at Stanford I was determined to play here, to win
here, to go to the Final Four. This was our goal all year to win here and go
to the Final Four. We have higher goals, but to be able to do it in front of
our home crowd, in front of my grandparents who have been coming to games for
five years.  
My freshman year I would sit at the very end of the bench, and as Tara would
say, hug the water cooler. They've been great supporters. My grandparents are
the reason why I started playing basketball to begin with. To be able to play
the regional championship, to go to the Final Four in front of them with them
cheering is the most amazing feeling ever. In front of all of our fans, there
is no greater feeling that I've had here in my entire time, and I just am so
happy and words honestly can't describe it. Happy is not happy enough. It's
more than that. I'm so‑‑  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Extremely elated.  
MIKAELA RUEF: To make fun of Kayla, extremely elated.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now open it up for questions for Coach VanDerveer.  
  
Q. Tara, was this the game of Mikaela's life?  
COACH VANDERVEER: It was by far her best game ever putting on a Stanford
uniform. You know, but Mikaela downplays how much work she put into doing what
she did tonight. You know, she's one of those early risers and she was in the
gym getting her shot up. People have played soft on her because of Chiney's
incredible ability, and she was ready for it. It was really exciting to see
her play so well. For us to have five people in double figures, and Chiney
struggled. I know Chiney had a double‑double. But she really‑‑ you know, you
kind of asked about it, but when you come out, and she was a little bit like a
circuit overloaded, which is what happened right here? She wasn't herself. She
was missing defensive assignments. She was trying so hard. She might have said
it wasn't panic, but it looked like it. Not just her, but she wanted to do it
so badly for her team, her fans, all that she represents at Stanford so it's
great that Mikaela could kind of be her Robin tonight.  
  
Q. Tara, can you talk about the first ten minutes? You said it's good the
game doesn't end there. But those first ten minutes you guys are hitting
threes and you're in a bit of a hole, what were you thinking at that point?  
COACH VANDERVEER: There were a couple plays where Amber went for a steal and
the girls open with the three. They came out, and first of all, they're a very
talented team and an athletic team. For us to only have 13 turnovers and them
having 13 turnovers, that was a really good thing for us to take care of the
ball. The game was plenty physical. Should people be allowed to hack and foul
each other? I don't think so. I mean, we can do that too. But I think
adjusting to the size, they're a very big team, and to figure out‑‑ it took us
a little while to say what should we be doing offensively to help our team get
the shot that's we need? And I thought we got some great shots in the first
half.  
Bonnie had some wonderful looks, Lili was wide open. Mikaela, they're leaving
people. They had three people on Chiney, and I told our team, we're not going
anywhere without other people. This is not going to be‑‑ this is other
people's time to step up. They're giving us what we like. We like to shoot.
Bonnie, that's what you were recruited for. Lili, this is a shooting game.
This is up our alley. Let's go get our shots up, and we did such a good job in
the second half shooting like 58%.  
  
Q. Obviously, they thought by banging you and doing all that stuff was the
way to beat you. Do you think you guys proved something tonight by overcoming
that? You mentioned you didn't think they'd be able to hack, is it an insult
for them to try to do that? Give me your feeling about that.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that you look at Chiney and what else can you do?
You've got to body her. She gets that every single game. But other people, you
have to draw‑‑ she'll draw them in and other people have to draw them out. So
the fact that Bonnie hit shots, Amber, I thought Amber kept us in the game in
the first half offensively. Then defensively, we had some slip‑ups, but once
we got on track defensively, and I like it when we have the whole week to get
ready, but we only had a day for people to learn a lot of stuff, and they
learned it very well. You know, we opened it up for Chiney by hitting outside
shots.  
  
Q. Looking ahead, now six out of the last seven Final Fours, it's a
remarkable record. But you haven't pushed through to win one. What is the best
word in your mind to describe your feelings about all of that? Is it
frustrated, angry? You haven't been able to do it, looking ahead, how do you
see it?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I am so excited for our team to be up here tonight and be
happy. I'm so proud of how we battled. You know, we didn't go anywhere last
year, and we had some kind of dips in the road this year that I think really
have helped us be who we are.  
We'll be ready. We're excited. We're looking forward to playing Connecticut.
We're looking forward to going to Nashville. But tonight we're going to enjoy
being a regional champion and representing the West. We have great basketball
on the west coast.  
  
Q. Was that the best defense you've seen from Chiney? And it was 24 minutes
into the game before you got a pass to her on the low post. Were you thinking
man, as a coach, I've got to find a way to get the ball down to her?  
COACH VANDERVEER: When she had three people on her, I was like look, you guys,
other people are going to have to knock down some shots. You know? It did take
us a while to get her on the move, but as soon as we had some people open it
up with some perimeter shots, and I think that was good for her.  
You know, I think it was a good scheme. We've played against it a lot, and
they made it a really good scheme because they're so big and their whole team
is so athletic. But I think that I personally thought that for us we could
handle it. It just took us a while to get some traction.  
  
Q. I'm sure in Nashville a lot of people are going to be expecting the final
of Connecticut and Notre Dame. But I'm just wondering what you think or how
you think your team is different than the first time you played Connecticut
earlier this year?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think our team can‑‑ the fact that we've played them
already helps us. Everyone will understand this is what we need to do. They're
a very big team. They're a very talented team. But our team will be very
focused, and the fact that we've played them has played to our advantage.  
If they just wanted a Connecticut‑Notre Dame showdown, what did they make us
do this for? If they wanted from the selection show just to have these two
teams and show up in Nashville, then where's the excitement? I think everyone
last year thought Baylor was going to win. Obviously, they didn't.  
So we're excited. We're looking forward to it, and our coaches and team will
work really hard to play better than we did last time at Connecticut in the
opening game. I think we're much improved.  
  
Q. Coach, when other teams are preparing for you guys, do you think that the
opposing coach sits down and tells his team, hey, Chiney's going to make plays
for 35 minutes? She's in great shape. She will make plays in the last couple
minutes of the game, or does it sneak up on them in terms of just how
consistent she is throughout the whole game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that Chiney's played against everything that she's
going to see. She's played against doubles and triples and banging and
fronting. She's a player. In some ways I think she'll be excited not to have
three people hanging on her. But she's ready for anything that they throw at
her.  
  
Q. You play any country music?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I'm going to listen to some country music. I'm going to be
ready. I'm going to get some cowboy boots and be ready for it. I'm excited.

_STANFORD, CALIFORNIA_  
  

STANFORD  74  
NORTH CAROLINA - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by University of NorthCarolina Associate Head
Coach, Andrew Calder, student‑athletes, Diamond DeShields, Allisha Gray, and
Xylina McDaniel. Coach, can you start us with an opening statement?  
COACH CALDER: Yes, I said this to the players and I will say it to you. I want
to first thank Coach Hatchell for the respect she gave me for trusting me with
her team. Thank you, Coach Hatchell. I want to thank the players for the
respect you gave me to lead you. I thank the Athletic Director and Associate
Athletic Director for the respect you gave me for trusting me with the team
this year.  
We had the talent to get to the Final Four, and I didn't get us there, for
that, I'm sorry. We had some outstanding players and we battled extremely
hard. But next year we have a lot of players coming back, and we have a Hall
of Fame coach that's going to work with them every day.  
Congratulations to Coach VanDerveer, an outstanding coach. I respect her so
much, an outstanding woman and Stanford University women's basketball team,
and Stanford University, it's a beautiful campus, and you did a great job
hosting this tournament. Thank you.  
  
Q. You guys did a good job of balling up Chiney in the first half in
particular, and they managed to get her loose. Could you just talk about what
changed there and what happened that sort of shifted in their direction?  
XYLINA McDANIEL: I mean, the second half we couldn't play as hard as we wanted
to in the post because I mean we did have‑‑ I had two fouls in the first half.
I believe Stephanie ended up having two fouls in the first half. I mean, we're
not going to be able to battle as hard as we wanted to, and that's what we do.
We battle hard in the post to stop the post players so I mean, that helped
them out a lot.  
  
Q. Diamond, can you just tell us how you were feeling when it was touch and
go. I know it was really painful, but you were going to give it your all and
you did.  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Yeah, definitely. I played to the best of my abilities. I
refuse to make excuses for myself. My legs felt good and I felt able enough to
go out there and give it a hundred percent, which I did. Yeah, I mean,
everything felt good. You have adrenaline and you're warmed up. Warm‑ups were
a little tough just because I was stiff and cold, but once the game started
and my body got heated up, I was just fine.  
  
Q. Allisha, you were hot in the first half, 17 points going into halftime
feeling really good. What went on in the second half with you?  
ALLISHA GRAY: I don't think nothing happened in the second half. I think I
kept my intensity in my play.  
COACH CALDER: I need to do a better job getting her the basketball. We ran
some plays for her, we just didn't set good screens. We need to set better
screens. In the first half we were able to move on our screens a little bit
and we weren't in the second half. So we've still got to set better screens
and come off those screens. So that's my responsibility to get her a shot.  
  
Q. Xylina, you did a great job and the rest of the team did on Chiney in the
first half. What were you guys doing in particular, technically or whatever
trying to defend her?  
XYLINA McDANIEL: Honestly, I was just playing. My whole mindset was don't let
her get the ball. Don't let her get offensive rebounds, so I was just using my
strength to my advantage. I'm very strong in the post, so why not use it? I
mean, it was working.  
  
Q. Allisha, can you talk about defensively they had five players in double
figures, they were kind of scoring from everywhere. Was that making it
difficult for you guys to figure out what you were going to be defending?  
ALLISHA GRAY: No, I mean, it was basically because we were in foul trouble we
couldn't play as hard as we wanted to because we were going to get a foul
called on us. So I don't think we had the defense (Indiscernible) most players
were in foul trouble.  
  
Q. Can you guys just talk about Jessica? She really played great and made
some big shots in the second half. Obviously, she's as young as you, Allisha
and Diamond, just talk about how she kind of grew in this tournament?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Jess has struggled with her confidence as far as taking
shots. I don't know why, because she's very able, as you see out there. And
tonight I recognized that I wasn't able to get open shots in the second half,
Allisha wasn't able to get open shots. So I told Jess at the timeout, you've
got to take it. You've got to take the shot for us, and she did. Like I said,
she's very capable. So I mean, those are shots she should always take. She
should have been taking them all year. Something in her was telling her no,
but I gave her the okay about it, and I think that made her more confident.  
  
Q. Diamond, you guys came out just on fire in a hostile environment. You
guys got to be proud of the way you came out, especially in a tough situation
to play?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Of course, of course. You can't help but be proud
especially with such a young group. We never really were affected by the
crowd, I don't think. I know it's just easy to ignore them, basically. But
they did do a good job supporting their team. They had great attendance
tonight and great energy, and that really fuelled the intensity of the game.  
  
Q. Diamond, is it fair to say that you guys feel like you should have won
this game?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Yes.  
  
Q. Xylina, twice fouls have been mentioned as sort of the culprit tonight.
Is there a suggestion that the officiating was a little too tough on you
guys?  
XYLINA McDANIEL: Officiating to me was just inconsistent. Sometimes they let
us battle in there and sometimes they'd call a foul. So you really didn't know
when and where you could be physical. I mean, yeah, in my eyes it was just
inconsistent.  
  
Q. It looked from where I was watching that it was a really physical game
tonight. Was it more physical than other games you've played this year? Was it
not physical enough then, and what do you think about Stanford moving ahead in
all of that?  
XYLINA McDANIEL: We play in the ACC. The ACC is a very physical conference. A
lot of people don't like to say it, but it is really physical. It wasn't
really a physical game to us. It might have been to them, but not to us. We're
used to it.  
I mean, yes, we should have won, but, hey, we're coming back with the same
team next year, and then Megan Buckland will be well, so we'll have her as
well. I mean, we're just going to move forward with this. I mean, it's a loss,
but we're going to learn from it, and come back harder next year.  
  
Q. Diamond, your teammate just said that you guys should have won. What
tangible factor leads you to say that?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Well, there were moments where there could have been
momentum shifts for us. I know the free throw that Allisha
uncharacteristically missed, not to blame her for anything, but there were
just moments in time. I know Danielle missed a lay‑up under the basket that
could have been a big play. There were a couple of iffy foul calls, and just a
lot of stuff that could have really changed the game around.  
I'm not going to blame officiating. The game is over with. But I do believe
that there were some specific moments in times that we could have really taken
the lead back, and it just didn't go our way.  
  
Q. Assuming you guys were right with Stanford in the whole game. The last
four minutes things kind of fell apart, could you put your finger on what
happened there at the end?  
COACH CALDER: Well, obviously, they're very good. They played well together
for more than one year. They executed on the week down the stretch. Got some
looks. I tell you, I thought we got plenty of good looks to start the second
half that went in the first half. I thought we got what we wanted. They did a
pretty good job on Diamond, but Diamond's going to be, you know, she was‑‑ I'm
not going to say injured, because we're a no‑excuse team. We don't get any
excuses, but Diamond wasn't quite‑‑ I don't want to say that, no.  
I don't know. I thought the game could have been more physical than it was
actually played. We wanted to bang her more down inside. We banged her in the
first half and they allowed us to do that, and we wanted to bang her more in
the second half. But we're talented and we should have won this game. We
didn't execute down the stretch, and they executed down the stretch. Bottom
line.  
  
Q. Coach, can you address the balance they ended up having? They scored from
a lot of different places. Was that a problem for your defense?  
COACH CALDER: Well, we play the percentages. You're going to have to look at
it. I think Ruef made two threes all year. Is that right? Do you know? She
made two all year and she made three tonight. We played the percentages. We
backed off her in the first half and they were able to put somebody in front
and behind Ogwumike, and that gave us a lot of confidence. Then she made a
couple of threes, and that obviously changed the game when she was able to
make those threes. So I thought that was big.  
Then that left single coverage down inside on Ogwumike, and we weren't able to
handle her like we had wanted to in the second half. We thought we could play
her one‑on‑one though on the inside.  
  
Q. Do you think Ruef was the X ‑factor tonight?   
COACH CALDER: Ruef was no question the X‑factor, because she doesn't make
those threes and we're still right on top of her. We're on top of Ogwumike,
they're still struggling to score. We went off the handoffs outside. She was
an X‑factor obviously in the game. She was the difference in the game for
them. For their ability to score.  
  
Q. Just to clarify, you said you wanted to bang her or you thought you
banged her in the first half or in the second half. You're talking about
Ogwumike, right?  
COACH CALDER: Yeah, we thought we could have banged her more.  
  
Q. Is it in your mind being physical with her the key to beating the
Stanford team? How do you think they'll do moving ahead against the
competition next week?  
COACH CALDER: I don't know. That's hard to say. UCONN's got the best team in
America, great coach, great talent. I mean, they're clicking. You take
something away from them, and they've got counters left and right. That will
be a difficult game. I don't want to say Ogwumike with her talent is a great
enough talent to win a game, but Connecticut's just unbelievable. They defend.
They move the ball like you can't imagine. They're really skilled, really
impressive.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
COACH CALDER: Oh, yeah. No question. You've got to be physical with her. She's
too athletic. She's too athletic. You can't put your body on her. She just
drives around you. You've got to be able to put your body on her. Try to get
her away from the basket. She's not as good the further away she gets from the
basket. She's outstanding down in there low. Outstanding down around the
basket. So you try to bump her and move her away from the basket as much as
possible, and that's what our game plan was.  
  
Q. Coach, you apologized to Tar Heel Nation earlier saying that you
apologize for losing. But do you guys overachieve being that you beat the No.
1 seed here and you beat the No. 2 seed which is actually the home team? Do
you think you're being too hard on yourself?  
COACH CALDER: I think we had the talent to get to the Final Four. I don't
think there is any question. That was my job, my responsibility to get us
there. If we're not there and we've got that talent, then I take that
responsibility for UNC, and I am sorry.  
But we'll continue to work. We have a Hall of Fame coach coming back next
year, so that will help us out, and we'll roll from there.  
  
Q. Coach, I've got to commend you guys. You guys played great tonight and
throughout the tournament, your group is very confident. Do you think when
they go home they'll at least acknowledge the fact that Chiney is probably in
better shape than anybody in the country in terms of her physical conditioning
and got them late. Up here they're going to be very confident and feel that
they could have overcome anything, but that's part of their maturation, right,
that they have to see how great players get it done and kind of incorporate
that into their own game.  
COACH CALDER: Yeah, but if you talk about‑‑ Diamond knows how to get it done,
trust me. She's an unbelievable basketball IQ. She knows what to do. She
studies great players, studies Michael Jordan. She studies those players and
she knows how to get it done.  
  
Q. Andrew, yesterday we talked about experience and maybe having a little
bit more veteran experience than you guys did in games of this magnitude. Did
you feel like that played in your world tonight?  
COACH CALDER: Maybe more Coach Hatchell experience than Coach Calder
experience, how about that experience right there? We did some things at the
end that I wish I could replay, but I can't. I don't ever look back and say at
that time and moment, you know what, this is the decision we're going with.
This is what we're going to do right now, and I'm not going to look back.  
But obviously, having a Hall of Fame coach on the bench could have made the
difference in the game. We'll never know.  
Let me say it's a really tough day to lose. But Tiger Woods is not playing in
the Masters, and that's bad too.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach Calder.

_STANFORD, CALIFORNIA_  
  

STANFORD  82  
PENN STATE - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Tara VanDerveer, Chiney Ogwumike, Amber Orrange
and Lili Thompson. Coach, can we get an opening statement?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I'm really excited for our team. I thought we played really
smart. We worked really hard, and I want to compliment Penn State. First, I
think Coquese and her staff do a fabulous job. They're really talented.
They're really big, and we had to work really hard to win. I especially think
that the defense that Lili played on Maggie Lucas was a real positive reason
why we won. But we had great contributions from a lot of people, and we're
really excited to be playing on Tuesday night.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Lili, can you talk a little about what your plan was against Maggie, and
how it worked during the course of the game?  
LILI THOMPSON: Coach provided me with a lot of film to watch on her, and I
kind of studied her game and just decided that I wanted to shut her down and
make other people score for them, and that would be the best way I could
contribute to the win. So just playing hard and trying not to let her get as
many touches as she usually does was pretty much my number one plan.  
  
Q. Chiney, can you talk about that run that you guys had in the first half?
You were down by 4. They had scored 7 in a row, I think, and then you guys
went up on a 14 ‑0 run. What changed there for you guys? Was it a scheme thing
or was it just sort of an energy?   
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I don't think our team is really conscious about runs. We
just go out there and try to do our jobs. If that amounts in them not being
able to‑‑ us bringing the defensive energy and us scoring, that's what we
expect. I think we have high expectations and that starts with Coach Tara. She
pushes us every day, and sets huge goals. Like Lili will really work hard and
Mikaela and I to O‑board and rebound, and those goals are what we try to
attain as many possessions in the game as possible. So we're not really
conscious of runs, so it sort of surprises us when people tell us the stats
after games like that.  
  
Q. Amber and Chiney and Lili, what did Mikaela show you on both ends of the
floor early on, just making plays and with the energy she brought? Also, just
the balance you guys were able to produce today?  
AMBER ORRANGE: I think defensively Mikaela's rebounding was really essential
for us. Like in the beginning of the game they were getting a lot of offensive
rebounds, but as we focused on it and Mikaela just boxed out and got more
rebounds, and I think that made the difference, like you said, in the run that
we had.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: In some ways Mikaela's our rock out there. She sees the game
so well, and she knows what defense the other you team is running and she
usually calls out and echos what Amber says for our offense. She's our rock
and she does a lot of the grunt work, like getting rebounds, blocking out
every time and making the extra pass and things like that, finding the open
person. So we're just so fortunate to have someone and she's so passionate. I
don't know if you can tell, but she wants to win. This is her fifth year.
Playing at home, playing in general means a lot to her, so she just brings
that and it's contagious to our team.  
  
Q. Lili, you guys got off to a good start today instead of the slow start
you guys had gotten off to in the first games in this tournament. What was the
difference between today and maybe the first two games?  
LILI THOMPSON: I just remember Chiney telling us before the game if we took
care of the energy, the start would take care of itself. We wouldn't have to
focus on not so much the scoreboard telling us how we were playing, but how we
felt out there. We came out, the energy was there on both offense and defense,
so I think that contributed to the better start that we had today.  
  
Q. Chiney, I'll let you look at the stats. Tell me when you're ready.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Oh, we're good.  
  
Q. All season you've been trying to act like you don't really do much and
you've talked so much about all your other teammates. Was the game today ‑‑ I
mean, really, everybody that came in contributed something important. I'm
wondering if that is what you envisioned when we talked back in October and
November about what you saw?   
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Yeah, I completely agree. I think today was an ideal day for
Stanford basketball. I think we had so many contributions. I'm looking at
defense, looking at offense, and I told my team, you guys, we are great
players collectively and individually. I want to be an afterthought. I want
people to be aggressive, and I think that's what we saw. There was a point
where Amber drove into the paint and it was basically 1 on 5, and she shot it
over one of their big posts. I was just like, wow, this is the kind of energy
and intensity we want. Lili was ferocious on the defensive end. Mikaela's
always doing the grunt work, and Sara James is a huge leader for us. Having
that aggressive mindset, and that's what Coach Tara said, one of our big goals
for the game was have the aggressive mindset. We know they have the size
advantage, but we want to have the heart advantage.  
  
Q. Amber, talk about your third year and how you've controlled the offense
and just the patience you guys have within your offense and don't panic and
the shot clock situations? What kind of drills Tara has taught you along the
way?  
AMBER ORRANGE: I would say we've done a lot of triangle offense drills. But
for me personally, it's just focusing on being vocal and making sure we have
everyone's attention, so when we run a play, everyone knows what we're running
and everyone's in the right position so that we can run it smoothly.  
  
Q. Chiney, can you just talk about four years ago I remember seeing you play
San Francisco in the summer league, and it was obvious that you were just
going to be the type of player that was going to offensive rebound. Now here
it is four years later, and I've got a half a page of list of different places
on the floor where you hit the ball, and plays were being run. Just talk about
that transition of being a player who is kind of floating around and now
you're an integral part of the offense with all these different plays being
run for you and through you?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I think first of all, it's the utmost honor of being the
recipient of so many passes on my team. And the way I approach everything is I
don't want to let my teammates down. If Mikaela gives me a great pass, I want
to finish for her. If I'm open on the perimeter, I want to make the best play.
I need to find the shooters if I'm double teamed. I think it's cool to see how
far we've come, but at the same time whatever I do it's for my team, and I'm
just so fortunate to have such unselfish teammates that pass it to me all the
time. But I just try to make the best play for everyone, and if it's kicking
it out to get our shooters going and being aggressive and not being afraid to
get blocks like I was multiple times today.  
  
Q. Chiney, what happened when you landed on your face in that rebound
there?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: In the last minutes? I'm just old. Takes me a while to get
up. Yeah, I was sort of undercut, but it happens. I don't know. It just takes
me a while to get up. I'm fine.  
  
Q. Chiney, do you think this was on both ends of the floor as well as you
guys have played in a while? It looked that way.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I think it feels good. I think as a team, like Coach said,
the past month or two months we've sort of been stagnant and we were just
fighting to get out of that. We want to play with energy and confidence, and
that's the number one thing, confidence. I think our team is so deep. It's
understated how many people come into the game. Coach says it's by committee.
Someone has to guard Lucas. Just happens to be the person that started on her,
which is Lili, was great.  
We have so much faith that someone else can come in and do like for one play
or two plays, make that play. So I think we just want to play where we feel
good about how we're playing. I think today was a great moment for us. I think
this tournament has been building that for us as well.  
  
Q. You guys are one win away from making the Final Four. What's it going to
take for this team to get there?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Just aggressiveness. That is the number one thing we talk
about, aggressiveness. It doesn't matter who we play, we just want to play
Stanford basketball. Coach says that all the time. So I think it's just coming
out, being assertive and leaving it all on the court. It's weird, we talk a
lot about intangibles and, I think that helps us.  
  
Q. Chiney, there was talk from Penn State about playing here. The band even
did a neutral site, neutral site chant late in the game when they were down by
20. Could you having been exiled to Iowa for the first two rounds, could you
talk about the environment today and what that meant to you in terms of the
energy?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I think we had to earn the right to play at home, and that
started in the first and second round. We had two tough games, SouthDakota was
great and Florida State was great. So I think we had to earn the right to play
at home. The crowd was great. We love nerd nation, but it comes down to doing
our jobs on the court. The energy was great, but people in the stands can't
make the plays. So I think that's what we focused on, just controlling what we
can control. It's nice to have cheers behind us, but I think it just comes
down to just playing basketball.  
LILI THOMPSON: I think Chiney's right. We had to go to Iowa first and fight
through those two really good teams to come back here. It makes it more
special, but if we're not doing what we need to do, our fans are going to be
quiet anyway. So allowing us to get off to a good start and keeping the energy
high is something that we have to bring as a team.  
AMBER ORRANGE: I agree with them both. I would say the energy helps us more.
The energy from the crowd gave us energy. I think we just fed off of it, and
it really helped us.  
  
Q. Amber, Lili, where was it when Chiney told you guys today that she wanted
to be an after thought? Was that your final hug, team group meeting before you
hit the floor or?  
AMBER ORRANGE: This whole season Chiney has been really unselfish. Even though
she's the most dominant player on the court, it's never about Chiney. She
always puts us first. Tells us to be aggressive and score and shoot the ball
and she'll get the rebound for us. So she's really unselfish.  
LILI THOMPSON: Yeah, the same. It wasn't something that was just said once,
but we know that Chiney's going to get doubled. So if we're being aggressive,
it kind of hurts the other team when they double her. So it's kind of
something that she's advised us about all season, just unselfishness.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Congratulations. Questions for Coach
VanDerveer.  
  
Q. Tara, can you talk about the game in terms of you guys being down a
little bit, and then they were playing the zone, you guys hit a couple of
threes in transition. But what was the key to that today?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, we switched things up offensively a little bit. We
went kind of more of a 1‑4 high and tried to spread out a little bit more. We
never really know exactly how teams are going to play us, so kind of in the
beginning it's kind of just like figuring out what are they trying to do. Penn
State came out and they were really extended defensively on us, getting out,
getting in passing lanes. I think that's why we had some really nice backdoor
plays.  
Amber had a really nice play where she got a lay‑up, and I think that was in
that run. Bonnie hit some shots. Taylor got her three‑point shooting going.
But Mikaela had some great plays in the beginning of the game. She led her
team in D‑boards, and I thought she rebounded really well. She had five
assists. She played really well in the beginning of the game.  
We got some stuff‑‑ we're not like a big kind of turn the ball over team, but
we did get some turnovers and we were able to push it in transition, and
Amber, I thought had a great game.  
  
Q. Tara, has Lili Thompson taken over the defensive back court job that Toni
Kokeni used to have? Can you talk a little bit about exactly how she did this
in today's game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I think one of the things is that we have played
against great teams during the year. She played against Meighan Simmons who is
really super athletic and quick. Crook at USC, very tough match‑up, Boyd at
Cal. I could go through kind of the list of guarding Fields. I kind of had to
take Lili out a couple times like you're not guarding that girl. So I think
that Lili really understood that this was her job, and for us to be
successful, she had to do it. And I thought she did a fabulous job. Maggie
Lucas hasn't had six points since third grade. That girl can flat out score.
We've seen her light up teams. She's in a great league and she's a great
player.  
We had to not only have Lili, but other people had to help on her and make
them have someone else score besides her.  
  
Q. Tara, can you talk a little bit more about your back court? You only had
one turnover in that first half, and certainly that helped get the runs going
too.  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, they talk about the tournament having good guard
play. We have some guards that are really stepping up. I thought Amber had a
fabulous game. She scored well for us, and Amber is a great defender. We can
put her on somebody if we need to work hard on them. But Lili and Amber have
really good communication out on the court. They play really well together.
They're very unselfish. None of them care about their own points. They just
want to do whatever the situation is dictating. If they're open, they'll take
shots.  
I thought Amber had a big three. She had a nice pull‑up, she went to the
basket very well. I thought this was one of her very best games of her career
at Stanford.  
  
Q. Tara, was this the most complete game you guys have played maybe this
season, but in a while? Do you feel like maybe the team is hitting the stride
at the right time?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Yeah, I think people‑‑ I think different things happened in
the season. For us probably come back to the Pac‑12 tournament where we stunk
it up, and we got sent home. I think that got everybody's attention. You know,
if you want to play, you've got to do the right thing. Our team really focused
a lot in practice, and to have‑‑ I thought everyone did something valuable for
our team to be successful. Mikaela played well, Chiney played well, Amber,
Lili. Sara James started us out but then Bonnie came in and did a good job,
and Taylor did a good job.  
We're going to need more to be successful Tuesday night. We'll need more from
more people.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I'm not sure where that ever came in. You could hear them
say well, Coach Tara says this. I've never said that. You know, Chiney is a
star, and she is‑‑ she does amazing things for us. I thought that she was up
against some really big, physical kids. It's not going to get any easier. But
I think that sometimes she needs other people to make plays so she doesn't
have to feel like she has to do it all. And other people made plays today, and
that was great.  
  
Q. Along that line, Chiney said this felt really good today. Did it feel
good to you? Is it important that it feels good to them at this point in the
season?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Definitely, it was a very happy locker room. I didn't
recognize the dance moves, but they were really happy. This is a team that,
through even not winning, they don't turn on themselves at all. They are
really a tight group. I think that's because there is great leadership with
Chiney and Sara and Mikaela Ruef. Kids are very unselfish.  
But they have fun, and they know they've played well. I mean, like one
turnover, nine turnovers, I thought we did a really nice job. We did things
that we needed to do.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about do you run more sets for Chiney than you
did with Jane when Jane was here? And second part of that would be if not
maybe was that one set that you ran in the first half where Chiney got a full
run at the basket from the top of the key, got Bonnie on the left.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Yeah, we were not running anything for Chiney. We don't
really run anything for Chiney because she gets so much out of just our
transition and our regular offense. So basically all the sets, there might be
an occasional one, but we don't run stuff for her. We want other people kind
of to‑‑ we don't want to come down and think about going into Chiney. In fact,
I say other people have to touch the ball, other people need to do things.  
  
Q. In the first half you had a nine ‑minute run of only allowing two field
goals. Can you comment on that?   
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think that our team, one thing they do is I think
actually one of my favorites, Charles Barkley talked about this yesterday and
I told our team this. You know, we had a week to get ready, and our team can
really absorb. There is no finals, there is no studying. They're watching
video and they're absorbing what we're asking them to do. I think they were
really able to absorb the scouting report. Now it's easier when we have a week
and we obviously have only a day. But they were really able to take the
scouting report and really focus on what we were planning to do. Take away
people's favorite moves. Not have the key people beat you. Make other people.
I thought Ariel Edwards did a nice job in the first half of the game for them,
but that wasn't Maggie Lucas.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think we had a great crowd, and I hope everybody will come
back on Tuesday.

_STANFORD, CALIFORNIA_  
  

STANFORD  82  
PENN STATE - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Penn State head coach Coquese Washington and
student‑athletes, Talia East and Ariel Edwards. Coach Washington has chosen
not to make an opening statement, so we'll take questions for the
student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Ariel, will you talk about the run that Stanford had in the first half? I
think it ended up being 14 ‑0\. You guys were up at that point and things
turned really quickly. What happened there?   
ARIEL EDWARDS: They got out in transition a good amount. Chiney was running
the floor very well, and they found her a lot in transition and they did a
good job of crashing the offensive boards. Yeah, they did a very good job of
that.  
  
Q. Talia, how was it playing against Chiney? Was she what you expected?  
TALIA EAST: She's a great player, I think. She did a good job with what her
teammates gave her. I mean, my main goal was to make it physical and difficult
for her, and I think I did that. She made some tough shots, but I was just
trying to make it difficult for her.  
  
Q. You guys were able to start out the game getting some things going
inside, and it seemed to dry up a little bit. Did they change something
defensively that made it harder for you guys to get going?  
TALIA EAST: I'm not sure if they started doubling a little bit, but the paint
got a little bit crowded.  
  
Q. Ariel, can you talk a little bit about being aggressive, especially
toward the end of the first half and in the second half trying to get your
offense going?  
ARIEL EDWARDS: Well, my coaches kept telling me that they needed me to be
aggressive this game. After I got a little bit of the jitters out, I felt like
I settled in a little bit and was able to be more aggressive. My teammates
definitely helped me out. They found me when I was open and they played great
today, so all the credit goes to them.  
  
Q. Talia, had you seen Maggie get frustrated like that at any time this
season?  
TALIA EAST: I don't think she was necessarily frustrated. We all kind of‑‑ I
think it was jitters. We all were a little bit jittery, but I don't think she
was necessarily frustrated.  
  
Q. Ariel, will you talk a little bit in the second half trying to get back
in the game? You guys couldn't get it under double digits. Was it a matter of
just not being able to put enough shots together to get some momentum and
stops at the other end?  
ARIEL EDWARDS: I would say shots more than defensive end. They did a great job
of executing their game plan and running their offense all the way through. We
were trading baskets for a while, and we know that's not the recipe to win a
game. So that's what I would say.  
  
Q. Talia, can you just talk about what you guys, what the game plan was to
disrupt their triangle offense? It looked like you guys were doing a lot of
bumping in the second half and the refs didn't help you. But it looked like
you wanted to be physical with them in terms of your cutting.  
TALIA EAST: That was part of it, to be physical and kind of disrupt them a
little bit. But sometimes calls don't go your way and that's okay. That's the
way it works. But they did a good job of executing their game plan. It didn't
really fluster them at all. They came out and played well.  
  
Q. Ariel, Talia, talk about how difficult it was to come in and play on
Stanford's home court and try to take the crowd out of it?  
TALIA EAST: I think Stanford, you know, it wasn't‑‑ I don't think the crowd
was swaying any point in the game. They were loud, but we've experienced
things like that throughout playing in the Big Ten.  
ARIEL EDWARDS: This is definitely a difficult place to play. We knew they were
going to use that energy from the crowd and come out hard and they did. They
used that energy throughout the whole game. As I said before, they played very
well today, and all the credit goes to them.  
  
Q. Talia, you guys talked a lot about defense before the game. How tough was
it to come out and give up 44 in the first half?  
TALIA EAST: I mean, I agree with what Ariel said, we were trading baskets. You
know, I think both teams getting the jitters out in the beginning of the game
and they kind of got a stretch in the beginning of the first half, but you
can't do that. We tweaked some things in the second half, but it was a hard
deficit to come back from.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. We'll open it up for questions for
Coach Washington.  
  
Q. Coach, will you talk about the defensive job that you thought they did on
Maggie, and how much it had to do with what they did defensively, and how much
had to do with Maggie?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I thought they did an outstanding job on her. She didn't get
very many clean, open looks. She put the ball on the floor. They ran secondary
and tough defenders at her. Then they just made her take tough shots all
night.  
  
Q. Coach, aside from the defense on Maggie, what went wrong for your team?
If you could sum up.  
COACH WASHINGTON: I thought offensively we didn't exhibit enough patience.
Once we got down a little bit, I thought we shot too quickly and we didn't
really make them work enough on the defensive end of the floor. That allowed
them to get out in transition a little bit to get some easy baskets and go on
a couple of the runs that they went on.  
  
Q. Coach, did Mikaela Ruef show you anything on both ends of the floor that
maybe were a step up from what you'd seen on tape from this woman?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I wouldn't say she showed anything that was a step up. But I
thought she played well off of Ogwumike today. She was very aggressive. I
mean, she's always aggressive on the backboard, but she was really aggressive
on the offensive end in terms of looking for a shot. As we knew coming into
the game, she's a fantastic passer, and she did some things that way. I just
thought she was pretty aggressive.  
  
Q. You probably saw what you were expecting from Ogwumike, but how much did
the other kids in their lineup hurt you guys today?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, I thought we led Orrange get loose too much. She's a
really good, 15‑foot jump shooter, and I thought she got in the paint a little
bit too much for our liking. Some of that was because of transition. Some of
that was some defensive breakdowns in our help rotation. But coming to the
game, we knew that. That's why they're an outstanding team and they've won
30‑plus games. It's not just Chiney Ogwumike; they've got other players that
are capable of stepping up and making big plays. I thought Orrange did that. I
thought Mikaela did that. I thought Thompson hit some big and timely shots.
When you've got contributions coming from a number of different people it's
tough to stop a run and make a run of your own.  
  
Q. Is Ogwumike the best player you've played against all year? Do you like
her as a player?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I love her as a player. But we've played against quite a few
good teams this year, and we've played against some really good players. I'll
leave that up to other people to rank where she is. I know she's outstanding
and she's an All American for a reason.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about that first half Stanford run. You went on a 7
‑0 run and they answered immediately, and obviously pushed it out even
further? What was going on? You guys went to the zone?   
COACH WASHINGTON: Yeah, we had a couple of defensive breakdowns. They got two
breakaway lay‑ups, got some uncontested shots and then they hit the three in
the corner. I think those plays were somewhat deflating. You know, we seemed
to never really recover from those three plays in particular. I think they got
a lot of confidence once they went on that run. Or I think they settled down
and settled into the game and played with a lot of confidence from then on
out.  
  
Q. What did you think of Edwards play in this ballgame?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I think she played like she's been playing the last ten, 12
games of the season. When she's really aggressive and attacking the basket,
you know, and her mid‑range game. You know, she's a tough cover, and I thought
she played really well on the offensive end and gave us some big shots.  
  
Q. You won't get out of here without us asking about playing on Stanford's
home floor. What impact do you think it had on what you did and what they
did?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I'm not in favor of it. I think it's an extremely difficult
task to act. I'm glad the NCAA has gone back to neutral sites in the regional
next year moving forward. I think that's important for our game. But that's
the path that we had at hand today, and I think it's on one hand a good
experience for our kids to come out and play in Maples Pavilion and play on
this campus and have this kind of game. But in terms of the competitive equity
for the NCAA Tournament, I'm glad we're going back to neutral sites for the
regionals.

_STANFORD, CALIFORNIA_  
  

North Carolina  65  
South Carolina  58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by University of South Carolina head coach Dawn
Staley and student‑athletes Alaina Coates and Tiffany Mitchell.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH STALEY: I'm just disappointed that our season ends tonight, but truly
proud of the team we put on the floor, just proud of the effort that we gave,
proud of the season that we had.  
I think our players did probably what most people didn't think was possible.
I'll say this and then you can open it up for questions. This probably won't
be the last time you see a South Carolina women's basketball team at this late
stage of the NCAA tournament. So we're going to look forward to our future.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Tiffany, just seemed like very early in the game North Carolina was
really shutting off the passing lanes, not letting you get inside. What were
they doing to keep you from the rim?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: They were just clogging. They were sagging off a lot,
clogging up the paint, making it difficult for us to drive in the lane.  
  
Q. Alaina, what advantage did you see when you were able to get things going
inside there for the team?  
ALAINA COATES: I was able to take advantage of the fact that their post
players were in foul trouble and they weren't trying to go as hard as they
wanted to because they were in foul trouble.  
I saw that as an opportunity to get really physical, knock down the shots,
make sure I was open for my teammates to see me.  
  
Q. Alaina, with that, you started out a little rough with your teammates.
The layups would not fall. Was it just the rim, strange gym, North Carolina
bumping you a little?  
ALAINA COATES: We just weren't able to execute shots. We know how to hit those
shots and we just weren't making them today.  
  
Q. Tiffany, can you talk about at one point you were down 11, what Coach
Staley said to you at halftime to bring you back?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: She just told us we're still in this game, not to put our
heads down or anything. We still have a lot of time to play and come back.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you.  
We'll open it up for questions for Coach Staley.  
  
Q. You have been inside all year. That's been the preferred game plan. How
frustrating is it to see you get the entry lanes but they wouldn't fall that
early?  
COACH STALEY: A little frustrating. But anytime you can get a high‑percentage
shot like that... A little bit disappointing is us taking outside shots. I
think we got lured into taking them. If we can pound them, penetrate into the
paint, drawing fouls, when we started doing that, we started decreasing the
lead.  
  
Q. What effect did it have when Aleighsa had to sit down with two fouls in
the first half?  
COACH STALEY: Well, unfortunately for us it was Lisa and Tiffany Mitchell that
had to sit a few minutes in the first half.  
It's hard, but it wasn't a place which we've never been. I think Mississippi
State was one in which both of them had to sit.  
I thought we had enough to keep the game close. If we can hit some of those
easy shots in the paint, I don't think we would have felt it as much. Since we
didn't, your leading scorer and second leading scorer out, you feel that.  
  
Q. You mentioned this in your opening address, but how bright is the future
for this program?  
COACH STALEY: I feel really good about the future of our program. We're
probably a little bit ahead of schedule with what we're trying to do as far as
continuing to play on the second weekend and the third weekend of the NCAA
tournament.  
I just hope our players feel really disappointed that our season ends today
and hopefully they'll go back and work on their individual games, watch a lot
of film, watch the rest of the tournament, hopefully get motivated not being
at home at this time of the season.  
  
Q. What did you see from North Carolina? You saw them in December. What did
you see different? What type of growth did you notice from them?  
COACH STALEY: Well, probably North Carolina is a little more patient. They
seemed to be a lot more patient with us than most of the games that I've
watched them. They were really selective in the type of shots that they
wanted. I thought they did a good job of working inside‑out and keeping our
post players on the move. Also getting us in foul trouble.  
I thought they just put us back on our heels and forced us into some foul
trouble that you don't want to anticipate coming into a game like this.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH STALEY: Thank you.

_STANFORD, CALIFORNIA_  
  

North Carolina  65  
South Carolina  58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the University of North Carolina associate head
coach Andrew Calder, Diamond DeShields and Stephanie Mavunga.  
Coach, an opening statement, please.  
COACH CALDER: As always, I want to thank Coach Hatchell with the game plan,
the motivation to the players, gave them a great speech before we left, as did
the women's soccer coach, Coach Anson Dorrance.  
I want to say to South Carolina, Dawn Staley is a very, very good coach.
They're a talented team. Today we were successful against a very talented
team. I thought we battled hard, very hard. I thought it was a physical game,
the way we wanted to play it.  
Diamond, definitely an All‑American. Slightly injured, but she's a competitor
like you can't believe. You're not going to hold her back from being out there
and she'll be out there on Tuesday night.  
But congratulations to the Tar Heels, Mavunga, Xylina, Brittany. Their
defensive effort was tremendous. I thought defensively we were very good.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Diamond, what happened to you in the first half? Looked like it was a
knee and ankle?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: It was an ankle, then a knee. The first one was when Welch
was dribbling the ball in transition. I'm not really sure, but I twisted my
ankle. Went back and got it taped up super tight. Came back out. Then I
reinjured a preexisting knee injury that I had had earlier in the season. That
was it.  
But coach wanted to sit me for the half. Like I told him, I was ready to play.
I didn't want to have that burden on my shoulders of not having done
everything that I could to contribute to the team win.  
I think I didn't hold the team back with my injuries; I think I was still a
contributor and I was still able to produce. So coach trusted me, trusted my
instincts, I guess you could say. He put me out there and gave me a chance. I
did the best I could with it.  
  
Q. Stephanie, they got to within 2 with about five minutes left, then two
plays inside. Did you feel like that pushing it back out to 8, that was a key
point in the game?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: I guess I didn't really think about it till you just
mentioned it. Now that I look back, I'd say probably yes.  
But anytime we came back and fought back, every time they made a run at us, we
fought back, I felt like all those times were key points. Even Diamond's
injuries, those were key points. Me getting into foul trouble, those are key
points, things like that.  
So I'd say yeah because then that took the lead to 8. I mean, I'm just excited
that I could do that.  
  
Q. Stephanie, that was a back ‑and‑forth battle. Tough to have a game like
that. I think you are probably battle‑ready at this point. How difficult will
it be to have one day for the Elite 8?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: I feel like we've practiced so hard this whole year, this
is what we've been waiting for. We've gone hard during the off‑season and
during the season. I think having just one day won't really hurt us.  
Yes, it's a quick turnaround, but there's things that we've done previously,
so I think that will help. It's not really going to change too much. Having a
quick turnaround won't really hurt us, I believe.  
  
Q. Talk about how important you thought it was in the first half, the
defense you played.  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Definitely did set a tone. I believe it gave the coaching
staff of South Carolina something to think about going into the second half
because we were so successful defensively against their offense.  
It was new for us. We had barely practiced it in practice last night I think
it was. So it was new for us. We did a good job of adjusting to it. I know I
did. I think I had one of the toughest mental parts in the defense. I think
that I did a good job of adjusting.  
If I did make any mistakes, my teammates backed me up. So, yeah, like I said,
I believe our defense was extremely important in the first half.  
  
Q. You finished fifth in the ACC. Here you are trying to go to the Final
Four. As freshmen, it's unusual to see guys do as much as you do. Tell us,
what part of the season this year was the biggest part for your growth as a
player?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: I can't really pinpoint any one specific moment in time
that was important for our growth. I just feel like as time has gone on, we've
grown exponentially. We've grown faster as time has gone on.  
At the beginning, it was a little bit slow. We were making typical freshmen
mistakes, I guess you could say. At this point in the game we're growing every
day, two times faster, three times faster than we were.  
I can't name a specific point. But as time goes on, as we continue on in this
tournament, we are growing faster ‑ only because we have to.  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: I agree every day we're getting better and better on the
court, off the court. We do a better job of feeding off of one another,
whether it's an upperclassman or underclassman. I can't think of a time in my
freshman year that I can say, Oh, my goodness, this is where I've gotten
better, this is where I've grown.  
I can just say in the off‑season, that was a lot of it. Then during season
every day, like I said, in every way we're just getting better and better.
Just the little things, the big things, rebounding, communication, just
everything I believe.  
  
Q. What are your first thoughts about playing Stanford?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: They're a great team. Phenomenal team. Great coach. Chiney
Ogwumike in the paint. USA Basketball player that is just dominating. Averages
over 25‑ish points a game. I watched her play many times on TV. Phenomenal
player. From the motherland, just like me, so I think that's cool.  
It's going to be a great game, a tough battle. Have one of my best friends,
Erica McCall, that plays on the team, so that will be fun.  
I feel once we get on the court it will be time to play. It's about who wants
it more. I think it will be a great battle. Up‑and‑down game. At the end of
the day it's who battles more and who wants it more that night.  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Similar to what Stephanie said, you've got to play
attention to Chiney down low. I had the opportunity to play with her on a USA
Basketball team. It will be nice to reunite on opposite teams. She's the focal
point in their offense and in their defense.  
We're definitely going to do some things, figure some things out how to get
around her, how to find a weakness in their defense.  
Amber did a great job this year. Just Coach VanDerveer and their staff,
extremely smart coaches. We just got to be ready. Mentally it's about who's
better that night. We have to make sure we don't have any lapses and come out
with a lack of focus.  
They are at home so we're going to have to be on our toes.  
  
Q. Diamond, I'm sure this is a question you've answered before, but with
your father having played so many years for baseball, what advice does he give
you before a game like this, if any? Do you think having a father that played
at that level naturally trickles down to you?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Well, he's pretty simple before games. He doesn't try to
coach me or be that dad that's just annoying basically.  
All he told me was, You need to stay on the floor, you can't get in foul
trouble. I love you, good luck. That was that.  
Even when I got hurt, I need to stay on the floor. I got his voice in the back
of my head, I need to stay on the floor.  
Just having a father that's played professional, I don't think it's really
affected me. Maybe it has in an indirect way. He's a baseball player. Baseball
is a whole different culture. I understand that. As far as basketball goes,
you have to compete play by play by play. I think I have that naturally.  
Having athletic members of the family, it helps, because they understand. I
think as far as what I do on the basketball court, I think it's something that
God has blessed me with individually aside from any of my family members.  
  
Q. Can you both comment on what Coach Hatchell said to you before.  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: She texted me and said, I have faith in you, I'm proud of
you, go out there and play hard. Words like that are encouraging, especially
at times you may forget. Sometimes you forget she's not here with us. I know I
have. Partially because she hasn't coached me. We've had Coach Calder with us
all year. Have that reminder play back in my head helped motivate me as far as
getting ready for the game.  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: Similar to what Diamond said, just like the little things
she said will get to you. She texted me also before the game. She's just like,
I'm really proud of you, so go out there and get 'em. I was smiling, Oh, my
gosh, coach just texted me.  
Just things like that make me smile, get me motivated. I know she's going to
be at the Final Four game in Nashville if we get there. God willing, we'll get
there. That keeps us going. Before we left, she kept saying, Well, Nashville,
there's the Final Four, there's Elite 8, all these games, why not us, why not
us? Why not Carolina? That always plays back in my head.  
Next play, next play. She's always saying that. Next play, forget about it.
Say I miss a shot, Next play. Not always immediately because sometimes I get
frustrated, then I have to be reminded, Next play. Just things like that.  
Oh, my goodness, we're going to the Elite 8, Final Four is next, why not us?  
  
Q. Stephanie, you're really familiar with South Carolina. I think some of
the players were teammates in high school if I have that right. You said you
know McCall. Now you're playing a team the other side of the country you don't
know. What does that present as far as an obstacle?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: Like you said, I know McCall. We were teammates. Other than
that, I don't know any of the players or the way they play.  
I played against Samuelson. Other than that, I mean‑‑ oh, yeah, Kailee
Johnson, I played against her. McDonald's All‑American games, AAU tournaments,
things like that. Other than that, I haven't played their upperclassmen.
Chiney, it would have been nice to have a battle with her previously.  
I feel like our coaches do a really good job of scouting and helping us out
with the things we need to do. So tomorrow getting into practice, the
intensity we have to have is going to be great. I feel like practice tomorrow
will get me ready for it and I have to also mentally prepare and have a
mentality that, Okay, I'm not going to be stopped, I'm going to have to stop
the other opponent.  
I think the mentality is going to help, so that's that.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Calder.  
  
Q. What was the new defensive plan?  
COACH CALDER: I'd rather keep that a little bit to ourselves personally. For
us to not have practiced it very much at all, Diamond and them did a
tremendous job adjusting. Brittany was also one of them. Latifah did the
adjustments we needed for our defense.  
It did help us with their post players down inside.  
  
Q. Was there a turning point during the season as far as a loss and how much
has Ivory contributed with the players?  
COACH CALDER: I think when we went to Duke and won at Duke. Diamond and
Allisha had tremendous games. I thought that was a tremendous turning point
for them to realize that we can beat anybody. We followed that up with a win
the very next week at NC State with seven thousand something people. Coach
Hatchell always gives them a great speech about playing on someone else's home
court.  
I think when we played and won at Duke, played and won at State, will have us
ready to play here at Stanford.  
Ivory has been tremendous. She knows all the tricks of the trade from the
WNBA. She had had a tremendous coach this past year. One of the best things
that Ivory brings is her competitive fire, her enthusiasm. Also I think she
made the most threes in the WNBA this year. She shot over 40% at Carolina. I
think she's helped us tremendously with our shooting.  
  
Q. When Diamond went down twice, slams into the bottom of the basket, were
you wondering, Why did I let her talk me into this?  
COACH CALDER: She's a competitor, like I said. No, I don't second guess that.
I don't second guess anything, any decisions I make during the game, because
if you do that, you'll beat yourself up all the time. I'm not interested in
beating myself up.  
We made a decision, me and the other staff members. I also talked to the
players. I'll communicate with Diamond. Where do you want the ball on the
floor? We do a lot of communicating.  
I'm not going to second guess myself in any of those situations. I knew
Diamond was a competitor and she'd continue to play and she'd be out there on
Tuesday.  
  
Q. You mentioned Brittany. Did you plan to put the ball in her hands at the
end of the game?  
COACH CALDER: That answer is a yes. We were up one. Her freshman year we were
up two at Maryland and she missed a one and one. They came back and tied it,
won it in overtime. Then we played Maryland in the ACC tournament and were up
one. I put her in the game. Brittany knocked down two free throws, we got up
three. We got the rebound, beat Maryland.  
So tonight the emphasis was to get the ball to Brittany at the end of the
game.  
  
Q. What is it about this system that allows young players to flourish so
quickly?  
COACH CALDER: Well, I think we don't try to tie them down as much when they
first get there. We want to play a style of play where you can play and read
and react without us saying going from PointA to PointB. We have some set
plays, don't get me wrong, that we do that. But we give them a reasonable
amount of freedom, give them the good shot rules, we and try to play out of
that. We want a fast break. We want to give them a certain amount of freedom
to read a certain screen, et cetera, to make plays. I think that freedom they
get helps them to continue to develop and they want to play at Carolina
because of that.  
This is about the program. I'm just following the blueprint from Coach
Hatchell from the beginning of the year. That's what I'm doing. It is the
program. She helped build that program. It's a tremendous program. I'm just
kind of following it along.  
  
Q. Will you give us your first thoughts on Stanford.  
COACH CALDER: Well, other than I need to watch 'em actually. I was so into
South Carolina. Obviously Coach VanDerveer, outstanding coach. Olympic gold
medal, won that. Won two national championships. They're very talented.  
We'll come up with a game plan. We'll put our heads together with Coach
Hatchell and come up with a game plan and go from there.  
I can answer more tomorrow about Stanford. I know‑‑ I can't pronounce her
name. I need to buy some vowels. Ogwumike is a tremendous player, as is
Samuelson, et cetera. Talented and well‑coached.  
  
Q. What's the challenge with playing defense against a triangle offense?  
COACH CALDER: Well, that's why Phil Jackson runs it. It keeps the floor
spread. It's a team offense. Everybody is touching the basketball. It has
post‑ups. It has down screens, double down screens for open threes. It has
also a backdoor offense in it. It's a complete combination. It's just a great
offense. It's a very, very good offense. I think it has everything in it that
you want so you can go against a team that pressures you, you can go against a
team that plays sagging man, and you also have a post player that can take
advantage of that. Again, I think that's why Phil Jackson runs it.  
  
Q. Why do you think you don't see more of it in the women's game or the
men's game, pros or college?  
COACH CALDER: Well, I think with the rules of driving and hand checking, et
cetera, I think if you're playing a lot of sagging man, and you see more of
that in women's college basketball especially, but men's college basketball a
certain amount, too, if you play sagging man, you got everything clogged up.
If everybody sagged inside to three, it has a tendency to clog it up. NBA, you
have illegal defensive rules. The floor stays spread all the time. If your
pressuring people, the floor is going to stay spread all the time. I think
it's a great offense for that. Coach VanDerveer does a tremendous job with it
really.  
  
Q. You played against Stanford with different players, but in Spokane you
did have that slugfest of a game. You've seen the triangle there. I'm
wondering if something that can help you as you get into this tonight and
tomorrow?  
COACH CALDER: Yes, I do. I believe it will. Latifah Coleman played in that
game. We have a player on our team that did play in that game. Hopefully that
will help us. We have a copy of that tape so we'll be watching it, see some of
the things that we were successful with.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very.  
COACH CALDER: Thank you.
