_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

Tennessee  78  
Iowa  65

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll be joined by Coach Martin, student‑athletes Jarnell
Stokes, Jordan McRae and Josh Richardson. We'll start with an opening
statement and then questions for the student‑athletes only.  
Coach Martin.  
COACH MARTIN: Tremendous effort by both teams. Proud of the way our guys
fought all season, the way they competed as a team. They've grown as a team.  
I'm just so happy for those guys, the way they played, battled. We've been
through a lot, and they've shown it. And they've done a tremendous job as a
unit, bonding, competing, playing together, having fun. And it's just fun to
watch. I'm so proud of their growth as young men.  
But, again, two teams that fought hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes only at this time.  
  
Q. Jarnell and Jordan, certainly you guys wanted to win a tournament game
for yourselves, but I would have to think you've been aware, some of the
criticism that Cuonzo has faced this year. Does it mean anything to get a win
for your coach?  
JARNELL STOKES: Yeah, we tried to stay away from all the criticism that this
team has been receiving throughout the year. If that's our motivation, then
we're in it for the wrong reason. We're in it to win for Tennessee, keep
things positive, and just looking forward to UMass right now.  
JORDAN MCRAE: Coach Martin does a great job keeping us as a family. So like
Jarnell said, we don't let outside influences affect anything like that we're
doing.  
  
Q. Josh, talk a little bit about guarding Marble and took him out of his
rhythm. Did you feel you could pressure him as you did?  
JOSH RICHARDSON: Devyn Marble is a great player. Watching film on him, I
noticed that he likes to be real comfortable with the ball, and so I tried to
just take him out full court, trying to get him uncomfortable and get him out
of his rhythm. He did a good job down the stretch, making his shots and
getting points. I was just trying to keep his points low.  
  
Q. What was it like after all that fighting going on in the game to finally
get the lead there, and what did that do for you guys from an uplifting
standpoint?  
JORDAN MCRAE: We were fighting the whole game. We were just thinking of the
lead. We didn't want to get too comfortable.  
  
Q. When Cuonzo was hired, he talked so much about the defense and the
toughness he wanted his program to play with. Is tonight the best embodiment
of that or the closest you guys have been to what he wants, do you think?  
JORDAN MCRAE: I think we did a tremendous job towards the end of fighting
back. Just like you said, we did a great job on defense. This is a team that
scores 82 points a game, and for us to hold them like we did, it was a great
job.  
  
Q. Jordan, how big was that shot you had at the end of the first half to cap
that 7 ‑0 run?  
JORDAN MCRAE: It was a big shot for us. Like I said, we've been fighting to
get back the whole time. I think Jeronne and Jarnell, they hit it out. I don't
know which one of them, but just like I said, we've been fighting the whole
game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Martin.  
  
Q. Follow ‑up what I asked Jordan, looking back, what the team did tonight,
played a lot of games, but is this what you envisioned all along from your
program?  
COACH MARTIN: Really the last seven games we played defense at a high level.
And I think in my previous two years you look at the numbers, the numbers were
good. I think we might have been second in the league each year as far as the
defensive numbers, but it wasn't quite where I wanted it to be.  
I think this year we were up and down with it. And the guys just made a
commitment down the stretch of things we need to do to be successful as a
team. We didn't change anything as a team. Their approach changed a little
bit. They understand the importance, if you want to be successful, these are
the things you have to do.  
I think also playing against Florida at our place, the way they defend, guys,
we can do these things. And the guys understood, embraced it, accepted it.  
But I think like I said the last seven games we've been really good, the last
five we're holding our opponents to 47 points a game. And tonight you're
talking about a team that scores at a high level to hold them to 65 points in
an overtime game. Just a tremendous effort.  
  
Q. I know you were worried about Iowa's transition offense, and right away
at the start get two to three baskets. Did you change anything or did the kids
finally believe that's how Iowa tries to score?  
COACH MARTIN: I think what happens in talking to the guys Josh, Jarnell, just
the nerves of the game, NCAA Tournament game, one and done, so to speak. Once
those guys settled down at the end of the first and into the second half, they
start to play basketball.  
But they're a very talented team. They get it out so quick and they get it up
the court, not just the guards but the bigs do a great job of running. So we
need five guys to corral that ball.  
This time you can't go over it as much because you want fresh legs. Just
talking about it, let's settle down, let's guard the ball. And in the second
half Josh did a tremendous job really pressuring the ball, slowing them down,
making Marble use his legs, forcing him to make plays off the bounce.  
And I think once we forced those guys to start making individual plays, we
feel like we had an advantage.  
  
Q. You showed a little bit of emotion there in the last few minutes, kind of
looked up at the administration, celebrating with the guys. Not something I
think you usually do. What does this night mean, especially with maybe
criticism you faced for the last few months?  
COACH MARTIN: I don't deal with criticism. That's time and energy wasted. What
was said? I don't know. Because I don't have the time and energy. Where I'm
from, the way I was raised, I just can't waste time on it. I'm consumed with
our players to be successful on and off the basketball court. All the seniors
are graduating. Our guys have done a great job in the classroom. Winning ball
games.  
I don't have that kind of time or energy. I'm consumed with success.  
  
Q. You have a chance to talk to Coach McCaffery dealing with his son?  
COACH MARTIN: Briefly before the game. I guess I'm not sure‑‑ something was
said in the paper. He said I just want to thank you for the words you said. It
was just an emotional day for not only him but his players. Because, again, as
players you take on your coach's identity. Coach going through something, it's
a family, tough thing to deal. And those guys came out, you saw the adrenaline
and emotion that they played with in the first half.  
I told the guys: We've got to lock in, tighten the screws because they'll come
out with energy and passion.  
But, again, first and foremost you're a father, and this is what we do for a
living. So it's got to be very, very tough for him. Like I said, I said
prayers, I prayed for him last night and even before the game.  
  
Q. Coach, over the course of the season have had tough times when games came
down to the wire. You feel like you broke through a wall, feel like luck was
finally on your side? Or what made the difference than some of the other ones
you played?  
COACH MARTIN: I think more than anything just going through it. In order to
get where you are trying to go, you have to go through some things, guys being
in those games, in those situations.  
But we're a better team than the last eight games that we've played. Much
better team. The guys stepped up, made plays. We defend the way we defend
because it was one of those deals we felt we can get stops, get a couple of
shots to go, because the way we were playing defense, the way we feel about
our defense: We're solid there, guys, let's just get a basket or get a shot to
fall, loosen it up and make plays.  
  
Q. Can you comment on the play of Josh, specifically the points in the first
half, also guarding Devyn? What kind of game did he have?  
COACH MARTIN: Defensively, as I said, the last five or six games, probably the
last seven, he turned into an elite defender. Marble is going to be playing in
the NBA no doubt with his size, his athleticism and skill level, handles the
ball, 6'7", makes plays.  
Josh just accepted the challenge. Not only that, but he picked him up full
court and tried to wear his legs down to take his legs out from under him to
force him to make one‑on‑one plays and allow our big guys to give us help,
because forcing him to make one‑and‑one plays, now the shooters are not
running off screens, catching and shooting. I thought they did a good job with
that the first half.  
Josh has really stepped up. Even on offense, he just had his mind made up I'm
going to score and I'm going to make plays. When you have two of the better
offensive rebounders in college basketball, it's hard to help up or to help
off those guys. If our guards, if you can turn the corner and get in the lane,
we can make something happen.  
THE MODERATOR: Time for one more question. Coach Martin, thank you. Good luck
against UMass.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

Tennessee  78  
Iowa  65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're being joined by the head coach of Iowa, Fran McCaffery,
student‑athletes Adam Woodbury and Peter Jok. Questions for the
student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Adam, I'm sure you know what Coach is going through. What are you guys
thinking as players, his players, trying to support him, as you're trying to
win this big game?  
ADAM WOODBURY: We're a big family. And we were trying to rally around him, get
the win for him and his family and came up just a little short tonight.  
  
Q. Adam, you were able to get a lot of points inside tonight. What was it
you were able to do to get open and get the points that you got?  
ADAM WOODBURY: They got a great big man combo, tandem down there. And I was
fortunate enough to get the shots to go early and kind of stayed through it
the whole game.  
My teammates really looked for me. I was very fortunate in that sense. And I
was able to put it in the hole a couple times.  
Peter, what was this like for you tonight to be in an NCAA Tournament game?
You didn't seem to be afraid at all, how big was it to hit a couple of early
shots and how much confidence did you get from that?  
PETER JOK: It was big. Devyn was sick all week. So my mindset was come in, try
to help out on offense. And I felt comfortable in the beginning. So I just
kept shooting.  
  
Q. For either player, just sort of ran out of gas there in overtime. Explain
from your vantage point.  
PETER JOK: I‑‑ I‑‑  
ADAM WOODBURY: I don't think we ran out of gas. I think we made some key
mistakes down the stretch to hurt us. And they put the ball in the hoop.  
I felt we played hard throughout the whole game. Started out really good,
rebounding on both ends.  
And they're a good team, very good, talented team, and just came up short
tonight. Feel terrible for the seniors. Couldn't get them a win but we'll be
ready next year.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up the floor for questions for Coach McCaffery.  
  
Q. How important was it to get off to a good start tonight after the last
few games and get that energy going?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Well, I thought it was important on both ends. I think when
you think of good start, you think, well, we got a lead, and we did. But our
defense was very much a part of our ability to get that lead.  
I thought our energy level, our rebounding, our transition, our execution, it
was really good. Our execution was good all night.  
We only had six turnovers. Three of them were offensive fouls. So we gave
ourselves a chance.  
But in the second half they got us on the glass, which is always your concern
when you play this team, in particular, with how they rebound the ball.  
  
Q. Fran, what is this like for you? How was your focus during the game?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Focus during the game was fine. It was a day that, needless
to say, has been very difficult. You know, I got up at 5:00a.m. and we had
Patrick at the hospital at 6:00.  
He's getting prepped for surgery on his neck to remove a tumor, and you're
talking about potential malignancy and things of that nature and you're saying
to yourself: Wow, it puts wins and losses in perspective.  
Once he came out of surgery and he was in good shape, I talked with the
physician. He was great. We felt really good. I got on a plane, and at that
point my job was to focus on the game and to be there in every way that I
could be for my guys.  
So I don't think at any point in time‑‑ I think we were locked in with our
play sets when we ran them, our defensive game plan was good. We were changing
defenses.  
They're a hard team to guard, especially when they start making jumpers.
Because now they've got you spread out a little bit more. McRae's a handful,
but he's not the only one. And, of course, in the post they're as physical as
strong a team as we've played. And that says a lot when you think of the
league we play in.  
So I just want to say this: I want to congratulate Tennessee on a great
season, a great game. And Cuonzo has exhibited an unbelievable amount of
class. I know him‑‑ I don't know him that well, but the way he responded to my
personal situation and then after the game to have the Tennessee players hug
me and tell me that they're thinking about me, you know, most kids, they just
want to run and jump on top of each other in the locker room. I was really
impressed with those guys and the program that Cuonzo has built there.  
  
Q. Fran, maybe comment on Peter and Adam's play, in terms of your
outstanding scorers tonight, and neither of them have been in that position
much during the year.  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Starting with Peter, he's been coming. And I've wanted to
give him a few more minutes as the season came down to the second part of the
Big Ten season and obviously postseason play, and he's responded.  
When you go from playing a lot to not playing, there's two ways to go. You can
keep working. You can lock in and get better and force me to play you or you
can finger point and blame and go in the other direction.  
And he's a young man with great character. He worked, and he made me play him.
And he kept producing. And obviously a key component of our program as we move
forward.  
With regard to Adam Woodbury, he's been great all year long. To see him do it
offensively tonight with that level of comfortability, his ability to finish
and his ability to create angles and recognize when he didn't have angles and
get rid of it, and to offensive rebound the way he did and post defend the way
he did, I mean, here's a guy that I think we all recognize had a chance to be
special when he came to Iowa, and we're seeing that now.  
  
Q. When does Patrick go home? Is he home?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: He's not home. He'll spend tonight in the hospital. He has a
drain in his neck. We'll see how he gets through the night, see how he feels
in the morning.  
And if there's not too much fluid build up and they can take the drain out, he
will go home tomorrow.  
If there's still some issues with regard to pain and nausea and fluid buildup,
he'll probably stay another night. But I would think either tomorrow afternoon
or Friday morning he'll be heading home.  
  
Q. Any idea when you'll know the test results?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: We're hoping by Friday. But the schedule says Monday. By
Monday for sure. But it might be Friday.  
THE MODERATOR: Fran, thank you.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

Cal Poly  81  
Texas Southern  69

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Mike Davis and student‑athletes Jose Rodriguez
and Aaric Murray.  
COACH DAVIS: I'm proud of my basketball team. We had a really good season. We
were 6 and 6 at one time in the conference.  
We started to play really good basketball down the stretch. We won nine
straight games, six games in the conference and three games in the tournament.
I thought we played a really good basketball team tonight, well‑coached.  
They took advantage of our mistakes defensively. They shared the ball well.
They didn't turn their basket‑‑ I think they had one turnover in the first
half. It's hard to beat a basketball team that has one turnover.  
But really, really proud of this team. Appreciate the opportunity. The NCAA
put on a really, really good event here. I was here four years ago, and it was
really nice then, but now it's gone to a different level as an event.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student‑athletes only.  
  
Q. Aaric, early on, in particular, seemed like they had you hemmed; they had
people, guards dropping on top of you, in addition to people fronting you
underneath the basket. What did you think about their defense tonight?  
AARIC MURRAY: I think their defense was pretty good. And they didn't let me
catch the ball one‑on‑one; they didn't let me go against their big one‑on‑one.
And they just played some good defense. Tough defense.  
Aaric and Jose, can you sum up the disappointment of getting to this point and
not being able to pull it out?  
AARIC MURRAY: At first I was disappointed and then I started talking to Coach,
and he let us know there was nothing to be disappointed about. We made it to
the tournament. We had a great season. We went on like a 9‑0 winning streak at
the end of our season.  
We won our conference. So he just told us to hold our heads up and don't be
pouting about losing because there were a lot of teams who weren't playing at
all today.  
JOSE RODRIGUEZ: I feel the same way Aaric does. At first I was down. I was
sad, but Coach talked to us, told us how great of a year we had. And a lot of
teams don't get this opportunity to play in the NCAA Tournament.  
A lot of people are home right now watching us. So it was a great opportunity.
They just played their heart out today. They played better than us. And I'm
good.  
  
Q. For either one of you guys, could you tell that their depth, they played
like 11 guys in the first half, how much did that pay off for them as the game
wore on?  
JOSE RODRIGUEZ: I guess it helped them a lot because they played really hard,
they played physical defense. They played aggressively. And I just felt like
they played together and played really good, played really hard overall.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? We'll open up the floor now for Coach
Davis.  
  
Q. Was there a point where you thought maybe it wasn't going to be your
night? It looked like they were throwing in everything in the first half. At
one point they were 60percent midway through the first half.  
COACH DAVIS: Very well coached. They do a fantastic job coaching the
basketball team. We were a step slow, late on the plays they made. And they
made really good shots.  
I thought we could get it back in the second half. I was trying to get it to
five or six with five minutes to go in the game. They cut it to eight, and
they caught a couple of timeouts.  
We had the ball trapped. But they made really big shots. Went 35, drove
baseline, pulled up made a shot. Big guy, the baseline jump shot. They missed
two shots. We didn't come up with a loose ball. They got the loose ball.  
But it was‑‑ I told my guys: We lost 81‑69, but we had a stretch where we
could have closed the gap, gave them a good game at the end, but we didn't.  
  
Q. How big was that stretch early? It was probably midway through the first
half, they went on a little run. I think Aaric went to the bench. Not sure you
were just giving him a breather or he had a foul there. That's kind of where
they took off on their run right there in the first half.  
COACH DAVIS: I think he picked up his second foul, hurt us a lot. Aaric is a
really, really good basketball player. The whole country got a chance to
witness how talented he is as a basketball player.  
But they made shots. They made tough shots. They got a rebound I think once on
a missed free throw. Seemed like we couldn't come up with the big plays to
close the gap.  
But I felt‑‑ as a coach, sometimes you feel like you just know‑‑ they've got
the rhythm. They got the momentum.  
And no matter what we did offensively or defensively I never felt like they
lost their momentum. Their guards really handled the ball well. The shooters
were making shots.  
No. 0 was just unbelievable getting the ball to the basket. We were late in
rotation. Help side wasn't there quick enough. But, again, I thought we had a
really good season.  
Our guys made history today. Anytime you make the NCAA Tournament, that's
supportive history. Your name will go down as the team who made it to the NCAA
Tournament.  
So my speech to our boys was just be down and disappointed tonight, but when
you walk out of the locker room, the hotel tomorrow, feel proud and feel a
sense of accomplishments because there's a lot of teams not playing. And we
played in the NCAA Tournament this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Mike, thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST ROUND:
DAYTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+ROUND%3A+DAYTON)

  

## March 19, 2014

  

### [Joe Callero](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26769)

### [Chris Eversley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26770)

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

Cal Poly  81  
Texas Southern  69

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement by Coach Callero, and
then we'll open up the floor to questions for the student‑athletes only.  
COACH CALLERO: Great honor to be here at Dayton and a great honor to be at the
First Four. Obviously those who haven't followed very closely, it's our
first‑ever NCAA appearance, which we got a lot of letters and text messages
congratulating us saying, hey, you made it.  
Great thing for these guys. It's great to make it, but it's a little better to
do something once you get there and get a victory.  
And I think our conference commissioner is quite pleased with that.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes only. Here back left.  
  
Q. Chris, could you explain this run you guys suddenly are on? Where does it
come from?  
CHRIS EVERSLEY: To be honest with you, it only comes from the heart. Before
every game, that's what we focus in on and believe in each other and trust in
our coaching staff and ourselves as players and just executing the game plan
that the coaches put in front of us.  
Go out there playing with heart and intensity, the same thing that got us to
the Big West Tournament, it's the same reason we won tonight, just making sure
we were out there being the five hardest guys playing from a mental standpoint
and from a physical standpoint.  
  
Q. You shot about 41percent on the season and then came out tonight and shot
56percent. What were you guys doing offensively to get open for those shots
and hit them. Chris?  
CHRIS EVERSLEY: Just again executing the game plan. We are one of the teams if
you move the ball side to side, that's one of the best things you can do as an
offense because it makes the defense shift and it negates length and
athleticism.  
If you can move side to side and have guys like Dave driving on one wing and
Kyle shooting on the other, one, it makes life a lot easier because you have
guys on top like Jamal facilitating and then you have Zach Gordon and Joel
always down there rebounding.  
So it makes our offense look like a well‑trained orchestra, because everyone
has their job and everybody is playing their own individual instrument, but
together we sound great.  
So the shots just happened to fall because we're putting everyone in the right
position.  
  
Q. Dave, Reese Morgan has been hurt all year, came in and knocked down three
big 3 ‑pointers. Can you talk about what it's like having Reese back?  
DAVID NWABA: Yeah, it's good to have Reese back, just another shooter on the
floor and just us spacing out and just playing his role, just spotting up and
shooting. I'm glad to have him back. Just battling through injuries this whole
year, so it's great.  
  
Q. Chris or David, Aaric Murray's gotten his points throughout the year, got
off to a pretty hot start. What was the game plan there? Because it didn't
seem like other than him needing to get much help today. So was it to make the
other guys beat you?  
DAVID NWABA: We knew he was going to get his points either way, so we knew he
would just need to take the other players out of the game. That was our plan
going in. And our bigs still played aggressive and just did their best to take
him out of his game just playing aggressive as much as we could.  
CHRIS EVERSLEY: Just to second that, hats off to the team we played tonight,
Coach Davis, great coach with great players, and Murray's a great player with
a great supporting cast. They wouldn't be here if they didn't play well with
each other throughout the year either.  
Hats off to them. They came out here and played a great game. They won their
conference just like we did, and it was a great‑fought First Round game for
the First Four.  
  
Q. Both players, does Wichita State have reason to be worried?  
CHRIS EVERSLEY: Wichita State is a great team. They're a national favorite.
They've been undefeated all season. But one thing we like to focus on is just
ourselves. That's all we can handle. We're going to let everything else take
care of itself, let everything just fall where it may.  
We're going to get on a plane tonight, get to St. Louis, Missouri, and just go
start on a scouting report and make sure we're ready for Wichita State and go
out there keep playing the way we've been playing.  
DAVID NWABA: Like Chris said, just playing our game and going out there and
being aggressive and just seeing what we can pull off.  
  
Q. For either player, Chris, you were talking to Reggie Miller before the
game. Has it sunk in how much fun this is? I know it's a simple question, but
has it sunk in how much fun this is compared to where you were probably seven
days ago?  
CHRIS EVERSLEY: Yeah, obviously being here for the First Four is a lot better
than being in Anaheim from a national standpoint. But I still have love for my
native California.  
But, yeah, Reggie just said: Go out play a great game. Great words of wisdom
from an NBA legend I respect a lot because I grew up in Chicago, I saw the
battles with him and Mike. For him to say those words to me before the game,
it was big for me.  
And then the confidence he conveyed to me I conveyed to my teammates, and we
were able to go out tonight and play with that energy and enthusiasm that got
us here.  
  
Q. Chris, perhaps the biggest stage you've played on. What were you able to
do down the stretch to keep nerves out of it, to stay strong?  
CHRIS EVERSLEY: Just concentration. A lot of times throughout the season we
had lapses in concentration and we would play about 32 to 35 minutes a game
and then we would lose games in that five‑minute stretch in which we lost the
ball here or got a defense lapse there.  
So just sustaining that concentration for 40 minutes is huge for us. And
that's one thing we've done over the past two weeks is just making sure we're
all on the same page and understanding if we want to win, it has to be a
full‑focused effort from everybody on that bench and everybody in the locker
room has to work for 40 minutes.  
We have time to celebrate after. We take care of business first and have fun
playing after.  
  
Q. David, Coach has talked about how you improved your game throughout this
year, but I want to hear from you directly how would you put in words how your
game has improved?  
DAVID NWABA: I guess I would say I'm being a little more aggressive, just
trying to get my teammates involved as much as I could, just trying to get the
best shots on the floor at the same time.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. David and Chris, thank you and good luck in the
Second Round against Wichita State.  
We'll open the floor for questions for Coach Callero.  
  
Q. Coach, for a team that hadn't been in the NCAA Tournament, I don't think
you guys had a turnover the first 18 minutes or so. Could you talk about what
you were able to do that way? And I think you turned several of their
turnovers into points and then kind of took control there in the first half?  
COACH CALLERO: Well, in the last three, four years, Cal Poly has been
nationally ranked in assist‑to‑turnover ratio. I think we were top 10 last
year, even higher, right up there with Wisconsin.  
We make a daily habit of taking care of the basketball. I think at half we had
ten assists and one turnover, and one came at the very end. I remember that
one the most. It was like that was a fastbreak. We didn't need to hand the
ball off.  
Our kids know it's something we emphasize from day one in practice. Assists
are great, but taking care of the ball ‑‑ most important thing on defense is
taking care of the ball on offense.  
So we start from day one talking about passing and catching. Meet the pass,
two‑hand passes, shortening up the passing lanes and I think that's been one‑‑
we've talked all year about how I thought our team has done a very good job of
taking care of the ball, but we weren't very efficient offensively. Our shot
selection, our shot momentum, the rhythm, the people, the places. So I've been
pleased all year.  
We've reiterated that to our guys over and over that we have a chance to be
really good if we can get the offense going.  
Our defense has been very good and our offense‑‑ our ball control has been
very good. Our shooting percentage has been poor. In this last four games it's
been much better.  
  
Q. A week ago today I think you were on a tear where you were 2 ‑9 in your
previous 11 games. Going into the tournament, did you have any earthly idea
that this could possibly be imaginable where you are right now?  
COACH CALLERO: Maybe sounds arrogant, but I did. I completely believed in our
players the entire time. I think you can ask any of our guys. We said we had
had injuries, but we were 3‑0 in conference play. We were 4‑2 at one time with
two losses at the buzzer. Could have been 6‑0 at conference play. We lost Kyle
Odister, our best 3‑point shooter; Reese Morgan, who hit ten points tonight,
wasn't even in the lineup. He's been out all year with knee injury.  
We just that we had all the right components. We had point guard play, we had
some athletic wings, we had a power forward in Chris Eversley, our centers
were rotating, but they were sophomores. We had three sophomore centers that
were learning how to play post D or learning how to score. They were babies.
They only had a little freshman experience. And we needed that season for
other guys to step up.  
Kyle was out with a broken foot. We put him on ice for about four to five
weeks where he practiced one day a week and played once every two weeks.  
So we had a lot of different lineups. We lacked a lot of rhythm and chemistry
and coordination with one another. We felt if we could just get about a week
before the tournament together and we played Senior Night, we started Kyle
again‑‑ and the kid's playing with a broken foot. He's got a stress fracture.
And he's stayed off it enough to stay in shape and not lose his rhythm. But
doctors cleared him to play simply based on pain. It's always going to hurt
him. We felt if we got him and maybe got Reese back, we'd have our two
shooters, and all of us believed we could go to the tournament and win the
tournament.  
We had beaten teams. We played well. We played a great preseason. We felt like
we came here. And I was celebrating a 16 seed. I said back in Anaheim give me
a 16 seed; send us to Dayton. This gives us a great opportunity to get under
the big lights, get onto the court, get a win under our belt.  
And now go play a No. 1 seed and get more national recognition for Cal Poly,
get more national recognition for San Luis Obispo in our county, entire
central coast, our kids deserve it. This is special because of the
institution. Such a high academic institution. And sometimes people look like,
oh, you just got a bunch of smart kids out there; you can't get to the
tournament. It's been 20 years. Cal Poly has been DivisionI for 20 years. Some
great Division II teams. But now DivisionI. We finally ‑‑ we've kind of raised
our head and got a little national attention, and now we will have two more
days of national exposure for Cal Poly.  
I think our website will be a little more active in the next 48 hours trying
to figure out who is Cal Poly. And it's pronounced San Luis Obispo. Not San
Louie. But we'd like to go to St. Louis next. That will work.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys played a non ‑conference schedule that sent you to a lot
of Pac‑12 arenas, a lot of big places. Can you talk about how you kept your
kids loose tonight for a game under the spotlight?  
COACH CALLERO: Well, part of our so‑called master plan the last two years
prior to this season, of course, we were in the Big West semifinals and we
felt like we lost at the buzzer last year. Liked playing at the Honda Center.
We had a challenge. Asked the seniors if they wanted to play a schedule that
we could win or a schedule that would challenge us and maybe have a losing
record. Every one of them said play as big, as best as we can.  
We played Pittsburgh in the tournament. We opened the season up with Arizona,
a No. 1 seed. We went to Stanford at Christmas break. We played in Oregon's
tournament who is in the tournament. We went back to New York City and drove
up to Delaware, who won their conference title. Against five teams in the
Dance. We lost all five games. We learned a ton about ourselves. We learned a
ton about basketball. We learned how to compete, keep your heads up. And we
haven't changed. Not a guy on the team has changed character all season long.  
We asked for so‑‑ who wants to come and play DivisionI and try to hide. I said
we're going to play the biggest and the best. How many teams were raising
their hands saying, hey, all players on opening night, the preseason ranked
top 5, we said, let's go play them.  
And that's the way we play about Wichita State. They're a No. 1 seed and
they're undefeated. Okay. That's a great team. That's a great coach. That's a
great program.  
But if we're ever going to be that program that has any national recognition,
you have to go play those programs. So we haven't hid from anybody. And when
we got to conference play, we felt like we are prepared and now we feel like
we're prepared to make this next step. We're prepared for the big lights and
the great teams, and we look forward to it.  
Coach, last week we were talking about how you like to think "weird" when it
comes to big games. Can you explain your "weird" thinking when it comes to
this No. 1 matchup with Wichita State?  
COACH CALLERO: Yeah, I was so weird that I was cheering for the last five
years that a 16 never upsets a 1 because I said, well, that would be great if
we could ever get a bid; we'd probably be a 16 seed, and then we'd have a
chance to make real history there.  
So my weird thinking is, you know, the more obtuse this is, you've got a team
completely undefeated and you've got a team with the worst record in the
tournament.  
And, heck, we've got our warm‑up game in now, too. We've got the sweat, we've
got the bright lights, we're going to get on a plane tonight. And I look at
that as if you're going to have a chance against an undefeated team, you
probably need to be in a weird circumstance where you get a play‑in game. Here
we are in a play‑in game. I think it helps us right now that we're not going
to have time to think about how great Wichita State is. We'll get on a plane,
we'll land and do some interviews, going to shoot‑around, put a scouting
report together, and within 48 hours we're going to play in a game.  
Sometimes you give yourself four five, six, seven days, everybody gets in your
head, oh, they're great, you're a 48‑point underdog. What are you going to do?
Everyone tells you how you're not going to win.  
We're not going to worry about that. We're going to worry about ourselves and
move on from there.  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck, Coach, in the Second Round.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST ROUND:

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

### [Matt Stainbrook](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26765)

  
_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

NC State  74  
Xavier  59

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Xavier head coach Chris Mack and
student‑athlete Matt Stainbrook.  
Coach, an opening statement, and then we'll open up the floor for questions
for Matt only at that point.  
COACH MACK: We picked the wrong night to play bad. First off, hats off to NC
State. I thought they played really well. They've been playing their best
basketball of the year here as of late.  
And I thought the biggest difference for us not being able to get over the
hump in the second half was just our inability to take care of the basketball.  
We turned the ball over way too many times. And those turnovers resulted in
baskets in the other direction. They weren't dead ball turnovers. And that
just crushed our team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Matt Stainbrook. Here on the right.  
  
Q. Matt, you talked about having some treatment on your knee. Did you feel
good out there tonight? Played one of your best games in a Xavier uniform.
Didn't like you were moving in any way where you were hobbled.  
MATT STAINBROOK: No, I was fine. I just tried to feed off all the energy
everyone brought. I know going into the game I was definitely excited for it
and definitely wish for a better outcome.  
  
Q. To kind of go with what Coach just said, what do you feel like the
difference was in this game and you guys got so close so many times, just were
never able to get over that hump?  
MATT STAINBROOK: We weren't ourselves today on defense. Obviously offensively
we struggled a little bit. But we have to try to build ourselves an identity
with defense. When you can't get stops, it sort of ruins everything else.  
We had a lot of turnovers that led to easy baskets for them, a lot of
transition points, overall just a shambles.  
  
Q. One more question, I know it's probably hard to sum up the season right
now, but can you look back at all and just talk about what the season has been
like for you guys?  
MATT STAINBROOK: It's been a true roller coaster. Ups and downs. Had low
points in the Bahamas. High points on six‑, seven‑, eight‑game winning
streaks.  
But I wouldn't have had it with any other guys. I'm proud of all my teammates.
I'm disappointed in myself for letting down the seniors.  
  
Q. Matt, you played an incredible game today, and especially coming back
from injury so soon. Can you just talk about what your motivation was for
today and how much this school, this team means to you?  
MATT STAINBROOK: It means a lot. We have some of the greatest fans, people who
travel. You saw hundreds of people come out and support us. And my motivation
was definitely my teammates, my family, Xavier University.  
Came down to it, I just wanted to try to reward all the people who supported
me, supported the team throughout the year. And obviously we didn't get that
done. But next year is going to be fun.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for Matt? All right, Matt. Thanks for
your time. Congratulations on your season.  
We'll open the floor for questions for Coach Mack at this time.  
  
Q. Coach, did you envision last year or anytime for Justin Martin's career
that he would be a guy who would come out and play with this focused defense
against some of the top scorers in the nation the way he's done the past
couple games against Creighton and now T.J. Warren?  
COACH MACK: Justin, he wanted those challenges. And I think the next step for
Justin is‑‑ Matt mentioned the roller coaster‑type season. Justin's had a
great year. But guys that really win at a very, very high level, they get up
for every challenge every single night. It doesn't have to be a Doug
McDermott, T.J. Warren to get your juices flowing, because you play for
yourself, you play for your teammates, you play for pride.  
And I think Justin's gotten better, but we need that fire every single night
on the defensive end. He could be guarding a guy that's four points a game,
but if he's locked in, he can help other guys that maybe have tougher
challenges on the defensive end.  
So our team as a whole didn't get it done this year defensively. That's why
we're going home early. That's why we're rolling down 75 early, because we
needed to be a better defensive team than we were. And that's about it.  
  
Q. Can you speak to the overall inconsistency of this season and how much of
it do you think was a factor or a function of a relatively young team?  
COACH MACK: It's very evident that over the last eight to ten games I didn't
play our bench a whole lot. And our bench was mostly freshmen, mostly
inexperienced guys that haven't played a whole lot.  
And I told them that we need them and they have to get better. NC State had a
lot more bench minutes than we did tonight, and Coach Prosser used to say all
the time‑‑ my mentor‑‑ that playing time is not like Halloween candy. Just
because you have a uniform on doesn't mean you automatically get some.  
And our bench did not play well in the last eight to ten games, and I think
teams who advance deep in the tournament, teams that play on consecutive
nights, whether it's your conference tournament, NCAA Tournament, you have
quick turnarounds, it's hard to play players 38, 40 minutes a game and have a
consistency to it.  
Our starters need to play better, too. But, like I said before, we picked the
wrong night to play a bad game. But that's where we have to get better, in my
opinion.  
  
Q. Coach, did you feel like you guys were getting the looks you wanted from
the perimeter tonight?  
COACH MACK: I can say it now. We're not a very good shooting team. Teams that
have played off of us, teams that have big size, good size around the basket,
we try to manufacture as many layups‑‑ we have more layup plays than any team
in the country.  
But give NC credit. They have a lot of size. And when Justin's not hitting 3s,
you know, it really makes it tough to score for us. And it would be one thing
if we were taking better care of the basketball. We may have been able to
manufacture some more points.  
But combine the fact that we didn't shoot it well, didn't draw enough fouls to
get to the free‑throw line and we turned the ball over, we were just‑‑ we
weren't good enough on the offensive end to win.  
  
Q. You mentioned it not being your night. What was the play or the
possession where it really hit you like this really isn't our night?  
COACH MACK: Well, you know, not that we waved the white flag. I thought our
guys continued to battle. Just NC State was a better team. But I thought we
seemed like the first five or six minutes of the second half we'd cut it to 2,
push it up to 8, cut it to 3, push it up to 9.  
And we got a corner 3 from Justin that would have put us up, hits the back of
the rim, goes long, becomes a transition layup. So we tried to run a set play
the next time down. We don't do a good enough job holding our man off. Steal.
That becomes a huge swing.  
And it just seemed like we were fighting that uphill battle the whole game.
Maybe that was just one of the times that stood out.  
  
Q. Chris, it was 43 ‑40 and Warren scored 14 from there. Did he start
getting the ball in better spots, or that's just kind of the explosive type of
scorer he is?  
COACH MACK: A little bit of both. I think for the most part in the half court
we did a good job. We tried to crowd him, surround him. Couple times Justin
Martin I thought did a great job chesting him in the lane.  
He's a great player. He knows how to use his body and keep his body under
control through contact. He had a couple of tough floaters that not many kids
at this level can do. That's why he's going to be an excellent player at the
next level.  
But I thought in the second half he got a little bit more aggressive. It
seemed like when he caught it, he went into his move quicker than the first
half.  
I thought the first half he held the ball a little bit too long, allowed us to
fill the gaps quicker. In the second half I thought he caught it and ripped it
and got where he wanted.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, Coach, thank you. Congratulations on your season.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST ROUND:
DAYTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+ROUND%3A+DAYTON)

  

## March 18, 2014

  

### [Mark Gottfried](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13796)

### [Tyler Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25965)

### [T.J. Warren](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25964)

  
_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

NC State  74  
Xavier  59

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Gottfried, if you like, we'll start with an opening
statement by yourself, and then we'll open up the floor for questions for the
student‑athletes.  
COACH GOTTFRIED: We're excited. I think as we watched tape on Xavier, I gained
a lot of respect for them. I like how they play. They're terrific defensively.
They made it hard at times for us to score.  
But in the second half I thought we came out and did a much better job
defending them and we executed our offense. T.J. hit some big ones. Tyler was
terrific tonight. He played a lot of minutes and was great. Ralston hit some
big shots for us. We just kind of had a combination there.  
But execution of our offense in the second half and defensively second half I
thought we were much better than we were in the first half.  
So ends up being a really good win for our team, and we're excited about the
opportunity to go to Orlando.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for T.J. and Tyler.  
  
Q. Tyler, it seemed like maybe it took a little bit of time for T.J. to get
going, but you guys got contributions from several different guys in the first
eight minutes to build a lead. How important is that effort from the rest of
you guys to kind of pick up the slack when he is struggling a little bit?  
TYLER LEWIS: T.J. is a terrific player. We know sometimes it's not going to be
his best game, and we know that everybody can step up and make plays.  
I thought in the second half that T.J. did a tremendous job getting going and
hitting some shots.  
  
Q. This is for Tyler. Earlier in the year you guys ‑‑ maybe T.J. goes out
with foul trouble and kind of maybe struggled a little bit, but lately in the
last month and a half so much it seems if he comes out like you're saying, the
team's able to really rally and pull together without him. Have you noticed a
change in that in the last few weeks?  
TYLER LEWIS: I definitely do. Earlier in the year we were a pretty young team,
and it took some time for us all to get used to each other. And now we're
getting used to each other making big plays.  
  
Q. T.J., only nine points at halftime. Finished with 25. Did you feel like
it was on your shoulders to have a good second half for your team?  
T.J. WARREN: I just wanted to come out more aggressive, understood the shots
wasn't falling for me the first half, but thought I did a good job moving
without the basketball, just trying to get open. My teammates did a great job
finding me.  
  
Q. Tyler, I want to ask you, there was a point where it looked like you kind
of hurt your ankle, but you continued to play. I wanted to ask about that, if
you're all right. And the other question was there was a critical play where
you came down the lane and everybody seemed to be kind of looking for someone
to match up with, and you just took it right to the hole. Do you remember that
play and how important it was?  
TYLER LEWIS: First off, healthy, my ankle. I twisted it a little bit, but I'm
fine. And, yes, I remember the play. It was critical, late in the game and
dropped it off to Jordan and he finished with a dunk.  
  
Q. For both the players, there were a number of national pundits questioning
your inclusion into this tournament. What do you have to say to those critics
after this game?  
TYLER LEWIS: Say it again?  
  
Q. There were a number of national pundits who were criticizing the
selection committee for including you and saying maybe some other teams
deserved the bid instead of you. What do you have to say to some of those
critics after tonight's performance?  
TYLER LEWIS: I think we showed that we should be in the tournament. And after
this game, and here on out, we've just gotta keep proving them wrong.  
T.J. WARREN: We definitely belong here. We're not going to worry about too
much what they're saying. Continue to play our game and rack up wins.  
  
Q. T.J., when you're having trouble getting going, do you sense that whether
it's running the floor hard and getting out in transition, you guys got some
fastbreak points, that maybe that can get you going a little bit?  
T.J. WARREN: No, just keep moving up the basketball really, stay aggressive.
Eventually shots are going to fall. My teammates do a great job at finding me
in my sweet spot. So just aggressiveness, stay at it.  
  
Q. Tyler, just the way they were guarding T.J., seemed like there were a few
more openings where they might sag off passes. Did you feel there would be
opportunities to find other guys and maybe be a little bit more open
tonight?  
TYLER LEWIS: Yes, earlier in the game I recognized they were throwing a couple
of guys at T.J., and it helped me out because Ralston stepped up and hit some
big shots and found Jordan and Kyle early in the game, and they stepped up.  
THE MODERATOR: T.J. and Tyler, thank you for your time. Good luck in the
second round.  
We'll open up the floor for questions for Coach Gottfried. Right here.  
  
Q. Mark, maybe it's not fair to stay that it's an off night for a guy who
scores 25 points. But in the early going, it seemed like it was invaluable
what you got from the rest of the supporting cast, so to speak. Did this maybe
send a message maybe there's more to this team than just T.J.?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I think when we got other guys step up and score and
everybody's chipping in a little bit we're much better, and that's kind of
been the case with our team. I don't think our guys‑‑ I mean, our players
understand that T.J.'s a great scorer. And he is. They watch him every day in
practice. But they also know we need some different things. We need Ralston to
make some shots from the perimeter, if Tyler can hit a few, Jordan gives us a
little bit, BeeJay had a dunk, Lennard, Kyle, all those guys.  
And as everybody contributes, it makes us better. Because eventually in a
40‑minute game‑‑ I've not seen T.J. go very many times where at some point
he's going to find‑‑ he's going to find a way. And when those other guys step
up and score, we've played really well. And we had that tonight. A lot of
different guys made some key baskets for us.  
  
Q. T.J. mentioned that you really don't listen to pundits or whatever, but
is there a psychological push you can get when some folks are saying maybe you
shouldn't have been in the field?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: You know, to be honest, I've not talked about it one time
with our team, whether or not anybody else felt like we should or shouldn't be
in. We believed in our hearts we deserved to be in. That's really all that
matters. We believe that. Our players believe that. They played their way in.
They earned the right.  
We played a great schedule. We beat good teams on the road. So, really, it's
not something that we've made a big point of emphasis with our team. We got a
golden opportunity, and we need to go play, and tonight was the first chance
to do that.  
  
Q. Mark, I asked T.J. the same thing. When he got going, seemed like some
long rebounds led to some runouts and some steals. Do you guys sense that you
can see his confidence rising and maybe it takes something like that?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I thought, first of all, they did a nice job. They really
swarmed him in the post. They kind of were physical with him coming off
screens. It got hard for him to catch the ball and those type of things.  
I did think a couple of times in the break Tyler pushed it ahead to him right
around half court. And he gets that ball one or two steps across half court
and he's tough right there to slow down to the rim. And I thought that
probably helped him get going, a couple of those open court passes to him and
some baskets.  
So I want to mention the other thing. I thought Tyler tonight‑‑ we were at the
hotel today, Cat was pushing a fever of over 100. He was throwing up this
morning, all day long. He played a little bit in the first half. I thought he
actually did a really nice job. We came back in at halftime. He was throwing
up at halftime. So we gotta try to get fluids in Cat and get him rested.  
But Tyler I thought played ‑‑ just played with a lot of courage. He got tired.
He knew Cat wasn't going to come in the second half, and he just kept making
tough plays. He ends up with eight assists, one turnover and really, really
played through some fatigue. I thought he did a great job.  
  
Q. Did you get the sense that your team was playing like it was a second
chance, like a new lease, being in the tournament and not having to worry
about playing your way in there and just being here?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Not really. Here's the way we approached this thing. We've
basically been in a tournament mode here for about two or three weeks, the
last couple of weeks of the year.  
We're one of those teams, our backs were pressed up against the wall pretty
hard. We knew that going to Pittsburgh. We knew that playing Boston College.
We knew that playing Miami, playing Syracuse. We've kind of been in that mode
here for a while.  
So, for us, it's just continue on. Just continue on with what we've been
doing. We're getting better at some things.  
I think the one thing that's really nice to see is our young players are
really learning how to play at this level, learning how to execute and defend.
And that's what you want as a coach. You want your team to keep getting
better, and I think we are getting better still. So for us it's just let's
keep on doing what we're doing.  
  
Q. Your bigs in the middle, talk aboutyou were happy with the defensive
play. BeeJay and Jordan, I think they had combined seven blocks in the paint.
Just moving forward defensively, what does that do for your team?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Well, it helps us, and here was the decision tonight.
Stainbrook, I thought, really played great. And we had trouble. Jordan had a
little trouble stopping him. BeeJay did a nice job stopping him, then he got
in foul trouble. We talked about doubling him, sending somebody down there,
but then my thought was if he can get 20, 25, I'm going to live with that.  
But I don't want to start doubling him and opening up everything else for
everybody else especially for Christon and the good 3‑point shooters. As the
game wore on, I thought Jordan got a little better guarding him.  
But when our big guys block a shot, get some rebounds, and then score here and
there, BeeJay had tip dunk, Lennard had a nice putback, Jordan made a couple
plays there offensively, that's great for our team because we need a little
bit from them on both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. Coach, there was a point early in the second half, it was a two ‑point
game, and a span of 30seconds they missed a 3, led to a layup by T.J. and a
steal and a layup by Tyler. How big of a turning point was that early to kind
of reestablish control of the game?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Well, it was really big. And I think, if I could remember
right, we had a little stretch and I looked out there and T.J. was about dead.
He was dying.  
That's one of those as a coach you're thinking, man, we're making a little run
here. But I thought he was exhausted. We took him out and we kept scoring. We
scored a couple more baskets with him on the bench, which was also big for our
team. And then he was able to get a blow and get back in there and kind of
continue on.  
But that stretch was important for us. Especially playing when T.J. went on
the bench, it helped us.  
  
Q. Did any of your crash course starting Sunday night at 6:00 include even a
little peek at St. Louis, or did that not start until tonight?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: What happens is my staff has. They've watched them. And I
have not. I've not watched them. I did watch them a couple times this year. I
really liked how they play. They're good defensively. The point guard is
really good. I think I watched most of their game when they played at Andy. I
just watched it live.  
We'll get on the plane tonight and I'm going to start watching them as soon as
I sit down on the plane, and we'll get ourselves ready the best we can to play
them.  
But I think they've had a phenomenal year. So we've gotta get ready to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Gottfried, thank you for your time. Good luck in the
second round against St. Louis.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST ROUND:
DAYTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+ROUND%3A+DAYTON)

  

## March 18, 2014

  

### [Mike Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14123)

### [Aaric Murray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26768)

### [Jose Rodriguez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26767)

  
_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by our Texas Southern student‑athletes Aaric
Murray and Jose Rodriguez as well as the head coach of Texas Southern, Mike
Davis.  
We'll open up the floor for questions for Aaric and Jose.  
  
Q. Jose and Aaric, can you just talk about what Coach Davis has brought to
the program since he's been here in terms of kind of turning around the
mentality and some of the problems that had gone on in the past?  
JOSE RODRIGUEZ: Number one, I think Coach has brought like a lot of intensity,
a lot of discipline. He makes his players listen and, like, he pushes us to
our highest limits and just learn how to respect the game and love the game.  
  
Q. The same for you Aaric, you've only been here for one year?  
AARIC MURRAY: Yeah, I think Coach like for me personally, like Coach just
helped me like on and off the court with my personality and like my attitude
and stuff.  
But like as far as TSU, I think he brings like just like a winning attitude.
Like he played for it all once, and he knows how to coach. And he knows how to
win games. So he brings that to TSU.  
  
Q. Aaric, how appreciative are you of the opportunity to play in the
tournament, and are you more so than a lot of people? You can't speak for
everyone else, but from your journey do you think you're more appreciative
than a lot of people in this tournament?  
AARIC MURRAY: Yes, because like a year ago I was like facing a lot of like bad
stuff, difficult times, getting dismissed from West Virginia, not knowing
where I was going to end up. But then I got to Texas Southern and Coach told
me about‑‑ I listened to him and let him guide me that like the future is like
promising. And I have just been listening and doing what he says to do, and
now we're here at the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Does Coach Davis' experience, because he's been at the NCAA Tournament a
number of times, been to the championship game, do you think that's a little
bit of an advantage for you, particularly against a team that's making its
NCAA debut?  
JOSE RODRIGUEZ: Yes, I believe it's a good thing for us, because it helps the
whole team buy in and listen to him. You don't have no doubts. You know he's
been to the biggest game in college, the National Championship game. He fell
short, but his offense, his defense, his whole approach to the game makes the
whole team buy in, and that's how we are here now.  
AARIC MURRAY: Yeah, just like to hit on what he said, Coach Davis, when you
ask about‑‑ when you hear about Mike Davis, it's, oh, that's the Indiana
coach. For us players it's the same way. It's like how can you not listen to a
man that like played for it all and knows what it takes to get there, you
know.  
  
Q. Jose, how much does conference pride kick in here? The SWAC had a few
teams disqualified and underdog going into tomorrow according to the line and
stuff like that. How much does conference pride kick in tomorrow?  
JOSE RODRIGUEZ: I mean, people can talk down the SWAC, but I feel every team
in the SWAC plays hard and they gave us a good challenge and helped us to get
ready for tomorrow's game.  
AARIC MURRAY: I mean, a lot of people before coming to this conference a lot
of people told me I would go there dominate, I would go there destroy the
conference, but like now that like the game's been going on, I think I like
had an easier season non‑conference than conference. I was averaging more in
non‑conference than I was in conference.  
So like for all the people who say ‑‑ talk down towards the SWAC, SWAC is a
great conference and has great players in it.  
  
Q. When you guys were 10 ‑14 and finish 9‑0, what's the biggest difference
between those two teams, the one that was 10‑14 and the one that's gone 9‑0?  
JOSE RODRIGUEZ: First, I feel like we all bought in. And also we started
sharing the ball and playing as a team and just playing defense, playing with
a lot of intensity and just listening to Coach and everybody being a family
and clicking together, hanging around each other, just being a big family and
bonding.  
AARIC MURRAY: I feel like when we were like losing those games, we had a bunch
of talent but we didn't like know what to do with it or we didn't know how
good we were. And then like after losing games and everyone's like getting on
you Coach getting on you, like what is the problem, we had to talk to each
other, like what is our problem?  
And it was defense, and we picked up our defense and we support each other
more now. And everything's starting to like come around, come together.  
  
Q. Aaric, your tattoo says No Worries, but I'm curious where you are in life
with worries, priorities, things in and out of basketball.  
AARIC MURRAY: When I first got the tattoo, it was because I was like coming
into LaSalle as one of the highest recruits, and they were talking about me
going to the NBA after one year. So like during that time I had no worries. It
was like why should I worry? I'm going to get drafted, stuff like that.  
But then I started like making bad decisions. It was now like I do need to be
worried.  
And it's like now I look at the tattoo as like motivation to always be
worried, to always like know people are watching me and I need to do the right
things.  
  
Q. Was wondering if both of you had an example of kind of the team's
relationship with Coach Davis. Talked to some of your players, and they talk
about how he can be tough on the court and then right afterwards he's hamming
it up and joking with you guys. Is there anything that sticks out about his
style and how he has a relationship with each of you?  
JOSE RODRIGUEZ: Honestly, he's like a father figure to all the players, I feel
like. In the locker room, his door's always open. If you want to come and talk
to him, he'll talk to you about anything you want to talk about, your family
back home, teachers, class. He will talk to you about anything.  
And he just wants to win. He's not a mean coach. He's a hard coach, hard‑nosed
coach, but he just wants to win overall. He'll do whatever it takes. If it's
get on you, scream at you, curse at you, whatever it takes, he'll do it. Just
know after the game he welcomes you in with open arms and he'll like hug you,
he'll love you, he'll love you like his own son. So I love Coach for that.  
AARIC MURRAY: I mean, Jose pretty much like touched it all. But for me,
personally, like I never had a coach that I could‑‑ not to downplay any coach
I played for, but I never had a coach that I can take a bad shot or make a bad
play and then look over at the bench and he's just winking his eye at me, just
making me feel comfortable and like continue to go on playing and not like
always having to look over your shoulder if you hear the buzzer, you don't
know if you're coming out or not. Just.  
A great guy to play for.  
  
Q. Aaric, is the NBA still in your future?  
AARIC MURRAY: It's still in my head, but I don't want to worry about that
right now. I just want to play our next college game.  
  
Q. A week ago Cal Poly was 10 ‑19 and probably making tee times, I think,
instead of NCAA plans. Do you look over at them and kind of go: That's a
pretty cool story, that here they are 13‑19 in the NCAA Tournament, they've
never played in the tournament before, and here they are all of a sudden
because they pieced it together at the right time. Do you see there's
similarities between the two of you, too?   
JOSE RODRIGUEZ: Yeah, there's a lot of similarities. I feel like a lot of
schools look at us like underdogs and like don't expect us to be here. But
it's great for them, great for us.  
I feel it's going to be a hard game. Both teams are going to play really hard.
And I'm just looking forward to it.  
AARIC MURRAY: I didn't really know too much about them until just now. You
just basically gave me some info on them. I mean, I'm excited for them just as
much my team, like people doubting us.  
Congrats to them and congrats to us, both.  
  
Q. Aaric, Morgantown is not too far from here. Did that sink in coming here
at all? Or when you get on planes, do they all look the same? When you get off
the plane, it's all the same?  
AARIC MURRAY: I mean, I don't think it's a day that goes by that I don't think
about Morgantown. So no matter if I'm 900 miles away or three miles away, I'm
always thinking about Morgantown and my friends back there.  
  
Q. Aaric, do you know how many tattoos you have and do any of the other ones
have meaning like the No Worries one?  
AARIC MURRAY: I lost count at like 67. But I do have other ones with meaning.
I can go on all day. But if you just‑‑  
  
Q. One or two that mean the most?  
AARIC MURRAY: Yeah, or three. I got a picture of Jesus Christ on my back and
then a picture of my daughter's baby picture on my back, and then this No
Worries one.  
  
Q. Either of you, do you know the history of your school? Probably around
the time you were born, maybe a little bit after, TSU nearly upset Arkansas in
the NCAA Tournament. But they've come close but never had a win, what that
would mean to get that first win in program history and maybe put something
together off of this small history that you guys have had?  
JOSE RODRIGUEZ: I didn't really know much about TSU history or them upsetting
them. But, I mean, we're just going to go play hard and worry about Cal Poly
first and then go on from there.  
AARIC MURRAY: Yeah, I never really looked too far into TSU's history,
basketball history.  
But like for us, just winning the game, our first game period and moving on is
exciting and we can't wait to have the opportunity.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for our student‑athletes? All right, Aaric
and Jose. Good luck tomorrow night.  
We're now being joined by the head coach of Texas Southern, Mike Davis.  
Coach, an opening statement and then we'll open up the floor for questions.  
COACH DAVIS: We're excited to be here. We feel like we have an opportunity
coming to play in the First Four. We had an up‑and‑down season. But we're
playing really good basketball right now, and right now is the time to play
well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Davis.  
  
Q. You were here the first year, the First Four, right? What do you remember
and what do you think about the concept?  
COACH DAVIS: Well, the first year we were here I was at UAB, and we played a
really good team in Clemson. It was first class. They flew us in, we got an
opportunity to play in the NCAA Tournament.  
This year I was telling my team and some of my staff members that it is really
big time. It's really first class. They flew the band and cheerleaders down
and some staff members as well.  
So I think it's really upgraded a whole lot since the first time we've played.
And our guys‑‑ I was so excited. I'm trying to downplay it with them. But they
have opportunity to play in the NCAA Tournament, and that's a lifetime memory
for them.  
The band has an opportunity to come and participate, and the cheerleaders. So
there's a lot of opportunity in this event.  
  
Q. Coach, the experience that you have, that you just talked a little bit
about, is that an advantage, do you think, that you can impart to your
players, particularly when you're playing against a team that's never been
here?  
COACH DAVIS: We played really nervous in our conference championship game. And
I think being in the NCAA Tournament, if you focus on the event, you will have
some nerves. But if you focus on it's just another game that you're trying to
get better‑‑ what I try to give my basketball team, get them to understand, is
it's about getting better every game. You want to play your best basketball in
conference tournament play. That's where you want to be at your best.  
So right now that's our same focus, is to get better as a basketball team,
play to our strengths, not our weakness, and try to take away the opposing
team's strengths. If you play to your strength in games like this, if you win,
great; if you lose, at least you play to your strengths. And that's my focus.  
  
Q. Mike, Charles was saying that when you took the job, it was strictly
going to be coaching and not having to worry about the business side of
things. But when you took over a program that had some things that it had to
turn around, did you do anything differently in terms of setting some rules,
some guidelines for your players, especially with the APR and stuff, to get
them on track to where you guys are now?  
COACH DAVIS: Coach was always‑‑ coach was more important than strategy. What I
try to do is be their father figure for all our players on and off the court.  
On the court, I'm very demanding; off the court, I'm like a father figure to
them. I try to treat them all like they're my boys, that they're my sons. And
as parents we're very demanding of our children, but we still love them. And
not loving them never crosses your mind no matter how tough you have to be on
them.  
So with this group and last year's group, we went 1‑12‑‑ 1‑12, and I never
changed off the court, on the court. The next day in practice I'm going to be
very demanding. But to be 1‑12 is very difficult.  
So they never saw a change in me in my approach, and I think that helped them.
And as I say, you have to change the culture first and they have to believe in
you and trust you. Young people, it's easy to lose trust in adults and it's
very hard for adults to get that trust back once you cross that line.  
So going 1‑12 showed them they can trust me, they can depend on me to be that
person off the court, outside of basketball.  
So I was really on the same page, the same level every single day. It was
tough going 1‑12\. And the SWAC, if you ‑‑ kind of like Cal Poly, 13‑19\. And
what people don't understand is you go into a lot of bye games and it's going
to be very difficult to win those bye games, so you're always going to have a
poor record coming out of non‑conference play. Once you get into conference,
it's a mindset, changing their mindset, trying to get them to focus on not
what happened in non‑conference but focus on what happens in the conference
play.  
I always say this. I think that every student‑athlete should work first before
they go to college. They should pay their own rent, whatever they may have,
buy their own clothes, and then you'll have an appreciation of college and
that experience.  
So now when you go to the cafeteria the food tastes really well because when
you pay for it you don't waste it. And so I think in coaching, it's the same
thing.  
Coaching in the SWAC has been a great experience for me. If you win 14, 15
games in the SWAC, you've done a great job because you have to overcome so
much in non‑conference to get to conference play.  
So with these young men at Texas Southern, what we went through, them being
put on probation in September, the mindset was just off the charts. Some of
them wanted to leave. Some wanted to stay. But I think by me playing for a
National Championship it gave me an opportunity for them to trust me as a
basketball coach.  
  
Q. You talked about flying up here. Is it a lot of bus trips in SWAC?  
COACH DAVIS: Like I said, you should coach in the SWAC before you coach
anywhere else. I enjoy bus rides. We play in Montgomery, Alabama, at 7:30,
8:00, whatever time the game starts. The game is over at 11:00. We get on the
bus, drive all night back to Houston, Texas. So sometimes we get back at 7:00,
8:00, 9:00 in the morning and you have to go to class the next day.  
So it's difficult. There's some very good coaches in the SWAC. It's really
hard. You're dealing with a lot of student‑athletes that is not used to flying
first class. Like I said, it's so much‑‑ I'm so excited for our school because
to see our band on the plane, cheerleaders on the plane, our players, to fly
on a charter flight here, get off the charter flight right to the bus to the
hotel. We walk in the hotel. I'm quite sure they never had fans cheering for
them when they walked into the hotel room.  
I experienced it at Indiana. It's great for the NCAA to give Texas Southern
that chance to experience it.  
  
Q. Along those lines, is this a big day for the SWAC tomorrow? You know,
conference pride. This was kind of a tough year off the court with the APR
stuff and Southern. Is it important for the conference to get a win tomorrow
night on national television?  
COACH DAVIS: It's important for us just to‑‑ first of all, we had all 10 teams
participate in our conference tournament, which I thought was a terrific idea,
because a lot of the schools that has APR problems, not one young man has
caused an APR problem. So to give them an opportunity to play in the Toyota
Center and play in the conference tournament was really good.  
It was really good that it turned out to be Texas Southern‑Prairie View in the
finals, two teams that have an opportunity to go and play and participate in
the NCAA Tournament.  
It's a big day for the SWAC every day, every day we play and participate
against another team outside of our conference. It's a big win if we win. We
beat Temple this year. I think Jackson State beat Air Force and Evansville.
There was some really good wins in the SWAC. Every time we have a chance to
win a non‑conference game against a non‑conference opponent in the tournament,
it's always a big day for us.  
  
Q. I know you're primarily concerned about your own business, but is there
part of you as a basketball fan and somebody that spent your life in college
basketball that you kind of look at a team that was 10 ‑19 a week ago and here
they are in the NCAA Tournament for the very first time and what it must mean
to them?  
COACH DAVIS: I think it means to them, as it means to us, like I said before,
you're not going to have a good record from the smaller conferences going into
conference play if you have to play bye games.  
And so if you play 10 bye games ‑‑ to give you an example, we end up having
two home games this year, which we wasn't scheduled to have any home games.
And imagine playing no home games in non‑conference.  
So I don't know Cal Poly's schedule, but I know they played some bye games. So
your chances of winning on the road is 25 percent anyway. When you play a bye
game, it goes down to probably about 5 percent.  
So you can't really look at their record when you're coming from a small
conference. If somebody‑‑ if someone wins‑‑ Southern won I think 20 games last
year. They won 19 this year. Alabama State won 19. We won 19. So to win 15 or
more games overall in these smaller conferences, as a coach that's been at a
big school where you can bye games‑‑ when I was at UAB, we had to play bye
games. And so but when you are the ones who are bying, your record should be a
lot better than most teams.  
So I don't look at that record, to be honest with you. I just look at the way
they're playing right now, and to win three basketball games in a row is like
Prairie View. I think they only had eight wins going into the conference
tournament, and they went on a three‑game winning streak. When we played them,
they was playing really good basketball and we really had to play to win that
basketball game.  
  
Q. What were some of the standards you set for Aaric to be able to join your
program, and how has he handled that throughout the course of the year?  
COACH DAVIS: Aaric is going through the John Lucas program. He's been drug
tested once a week. He goes to counseling almost every day. We communicate all
the time, and I told Aaric when he came to Texas Southern I was going to treat
him like my son. I don't think he's ever been treated that way.  
We text a lot. We talk a lot. I try to be as positive as possible with him
throughout the course of the game, in practice and off the court.  
I think he really appreciates me and respects me as a father figure. I'm not
his father, but I'm that father figure to him. I communicate with his mother
from time to time.  
And so what I wanted Aaric to do is feel comfortable, feel more‑‑ feel
appreciated not from just basketball, from just a person in life.  
As I tell all of my players, that when you leave Texas Southern, you're not
going to compete in the real world against other SWAC people for jobs. It may
be a person from the SEC, ACC that you want this job. They want the job as
well.  
So as their leader and as their coach and father figure, I have to show them
what they're going to have to do to be able to survive in the real world.  
And basketball is not Aaric's problem. He's one of the most talented players
I've ever coached. I've coached Jared Jefferies, I coached D.J. White, I've
coached NBA players. And from a talent standpoint, he's definitely an NBA
player.  
And I was really proud of him for adjusting his game once we got to conference
play.  
He averaged more points in non‑conference than he did in conference, and I
asked him not to get in foul trouble in non‑conference. And it looked like he
wasn't playing defense. But once we got to conference, he won Defensive Player
of the Year because he shut the mill down and played.  
To make that commitment and sacrifice from Aaric tells you a lot about his
maturity and where he's coming from since he's been on our campus.  
  
Q. What have you seen on tape just from their main guy, Chris Eversley, and
what he does? I don't know if you remember, but when you were at UAB he was at
Rice, and I don't think ‑‑ he wasn't a starter, but he was on that team. If
anything sticks out from what you've seen so far?  
COACH DAVIS: The first thing that jumps out to me: That they are very good
defensively of taking away drives, taking away open left. They will take
charges on you if you're out of control. They put a wall up on one side of the
court, and so you have to make sure you reverse the basketball from side to
side to be successful against them.  
They'll double team the post, which we expect that because everybody we played
this year doubled us except for Temple. We played Temple. So Aaric is a guy
playing really well and passing the ball out of the post.  
But they have shooters. Anytime you've got guys that can make 3‑point shots,
four, five feet behind the 3‑point line, that's a dangerous basketball team.  
So it's a game that we can win. It's a game that they can win. So neither team
is like a sure shot to win the game, it's just the one who plays to their
strengths and plays the best basketball that they‑‑ and I say this all the
time when I was at Indiana‑‑ we had three guards never dunked a basketball in
their college career, we only had one guy on that basketball team that even
went to an NBA camp. It's not about having a lot of talent, it's about being
the best that they ‑‑ playing relaxed and playing to your strengths.  
You only have to win one game, so the 40‑minute game should be the best
basketball game you play. If you do that, you have a chance to win and move
on.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach?  
Coach Davis, appreciate it and good luck tomorrow night.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

Albany  71  
Mount St. Marys  64

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the head coach of Mount St. Mary's Jamion
Christian and student‑athletes Julian Norfleet, Rashad Whack, Sam Prescott and
Will Miller.  
Coach, an opening statement. After that, we'll open up the floor to the
student‑athletes.  
COACH CHRISTIAN: First of all, a lot of credit to Albany. We just had so much
respect for their program. One of the things I tried to do when we took over
the program two years ago, I wanted to look at mid major programs that had
been to the NCAA Tournament and had very good regular season success.  
One of the teams I looked at was Albany. I have so much respect for them and
how they've been able to transform themselves over the years.  
And as for us, I felt like we played very well. Maybe some nervousness at the
beginning. The way we came back is very typical of how we like to play,
shooting the 3‑ball getting into the press and playing together.  
Not surprised that we were able to come back from such a poor start, our team
has so much character and we play for one another so well that just about
anything can be achieved.  
But, again, I'm going to give a lot of credit to Albany, did outstanding job
tonight and they deserved to win.  
  
Q. Rashad, you had a 3 there in the final minute. Looked like it might roll
in but it rolled off. Can you talk about what you were thinking at the moment
you saw it roll off?  
RASHAD WHACK: I got a good look at the shot. Shot it with confidence. As I
seen it leave my hand, see it hit the rim, I thought it was going in. But
sometimes it doesn't always fall. So it is what it is.  
  
Q. Julian, what was it like out there in the beginning of the game and how
surprised were you guys, missed your first 11 shots?  
JULIAN NORFLEET: It was a little surprising, being that we shot the ball so
well the past three games we played. But once we were able to get the first
one to fall, we were able to make a little bit of a run there.  
  
Q. Sam how did you guys keep your composure there when you're down ‑‑ you've
done it a lot, talked about it a lot. Still it's challenging when it happens.
You were 21‑2, got back into the game, how did you keep your composure
there?  
SAM PRESCOTT: This team has been down a couple games and made a couple of
runs. We were able to rely on each other and trust in this game.  
Will, he came in, gave us a spark off the bench. So that always helps. Once
you see a couple go down, the ball gets rolling.  
  
Q. Sam, I saw you kind of linger off the court a little bit. I know it's a
tough way to end your career here. What does the season mean to you? Did you
want to hold onto it there at the end?  
SAM PRESCOTT: It's been a long journey since I started college basketball. And
to make it to this type of stage, it's tremendous, get the type of exposure,
experience the lights, it's been a great ride.  
  
Q. Will, you were able to hit a lot of big 3s, kept the team in the game.
How were you feeling out there and how nice was it to keep the team in the
game especially after that start?  
WILL MILLER: It felt good. Anytime any player really can get a start like
that, you just kind of keep going and you build off momentum. To be able to
come in the game, make that kind of impact, really made a lot.  
  
Q. Rashad, you led 45 ‑41 in the second half. Two parts, A, I assume you
felt really confident, felt like you were going to win the game at that point.
What happened after that, really what was going as you were making baskets,
you went cold again?  
RASHAD WHACK: Albany did a good job taking our punches. We were trying to
fight, get the lead back. And we did a good job. And there was kind of focus
on Will, and a lot of falling shots, credit to them, credit to Albany.  
  
Q. Will, are your emotions kind of torn right now because you played so well
on the big stage, national TV, but at the same time you guys didn't come out
with the outcome you wanted, is it sort of mixed emotions for you right now?  
WILL MILLER: Anytime you get to play, just from years past watching the NCAA
Tournament, it's a huge stage. So just for our team to be able to make it this
far is something huge.  
Not every team, obviously not any team in the nation makes it this far. But
just be able to do it with these three seniors, it confident a lot.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for our student‑athletes?  
  
Q. Julian, if you could sum up these last four years and sum up this run
that you guys have made. I know it ended at least one game earlier than you
hoped it would. What's it been like?  
JULIAN NORFLEET: We started off not making the playoffs and being a low seed
in our conference and just to see it come up over the past two years and make
it back to the tournament and then win a championship, you know, come to the
NCAA Tournament and play on this stage, it just shows how much Coach Christian
has come in here, just changed the program and it's a lot of great things
ahead.  
THE MODERATOR: Time for one more question. All right. Julian, Rashad, Sam,
Will, thanks for your time and congratulations on your season. Open up the
floor for questions for Coach Christian now.  
  
Q. What were you feeling at the beginning of that game? It had to be a big
surprise to find yourself down 21 ‑2 after eight and a half minutes.   
COACH CHRISTIAN: Honestly, I just knew if we got one to go down, it was going
to‑‑ we were going to be able to turn the page.  
I didn't really waver, to be honest with you. My emotions stay pretty calm. I
knew this game was going to be all about possessions and creating tempo.  
Although 21‑2 is not exactly the best way to start the game, I think anyone
would acknowledge that, I knew our team would rally together and be able to
come back.  
We scored 11 points in a minute five or six times this year. Once you do that,
get them fatigued a little bit, now you're in the ballgame. We're able to do
that.  
A lot of credit goes to the guys on the floor and our program, just having
enough character to be able to take their punch at the beginning.  
A lot of teams would have folded. I don't know if people understand the
emotions of the NCAA Tournament, how much these guys want to win on both
teams. And it's real easy to be on an emotional high that leads to depression
that creates an emotional low.  
Our guys didn't do that. They took the punch, and we bounced back.  
  
Q. You guys took 37 3s in this game. Was that a little higher than you were
imagining coming in?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: I love shooting the 3. 37 was a bit high for even my liking
today. But I did feel like we had some very good looks.  
I think if Rashad Whack and Julian Norfleet can get off 19 total 3s, I like
our outcome, if they're taking good shots.  
I thought the majority of their shots were. Whack misses that 3 down the
stretch and it goes in and out. And if that goes down, maybe there's a
different outcome.  
So I'm pleased with our guys, how they played together and they shared the
ball.  
A lot of credit goes to Albany for their defense. They did a good job getting
out to their guys. But we could have been better offensively tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, with the 3 ‑pointers, how big was Will Miller in giving you a
spark tonight?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: We felt Will was going to have a huge game for us. He's been
a kid all year long playing on big stages, against big teams, he's made a lot
of 3s. And we knew he was capable of getting hot.  
I believe in his career some day he'll hit 10 of these. I thought that might
have been tonight. He got to seven. Had he got to 10, we would all be in here
jumping for joy, at least I would. So I thought he played well, though.  
One of the things that they did a good job of, they switched their matchups up
at the beginning of the game, made us have to play one more at the 4. We were
able to do that. He was able to find found some open looks, and he made the
majority of them.  
  
Q. Coach, what does Julian Rashad and Sam mean to you, for your first two
years, they've been complete leaders for you?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: They mean everything to me. I love these guys as if they were
my own children. As an alum, as a person who wore this Mount St. Mary's jersey
and not being able to play in the NCAA Tournament, I have so much respect for
what they've been able to do and I'm so proud of them.  
It's not easy getting to this point. It's very difficult in a one‑bid league.
They were able to take the program from where it was two years ago and really
change the trajectory of it, and they did so by believing in the vision that I
had for them.  
It wasn't always easy because they're each individually very talented players.
They would probably be All‑League players in every team in our league, but
they decided to play unselfish for one another to help our team win,
sacrificing their individual games along the way.  
And they got a chance to go to the NCAA Tournament and really be really create
a legacy in our program because of it.  
  
Q. I know you haven't had much time to think about it or look back yet, but
what do you think the ultimate take ‑away from this run and just this season
will be?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Good question. I think, first of all, it shows everybody in
that locker room that what we do here works; that the plan that we put before
them, when everyone buys into it, it will work.  
We came up a little short a season ago. We got into the NCAA Tournament this
year, which is a goal of ours, but our goal is always going to be to win games
in the NCAA Tournament.  
So we were making progress each year, and the first thing I've learned from
being at VCU and Bucknell, teams that have won games in the tournament, you've
got to know that you can get there first. There is a road, there is a
blueprint to get there, and you gotta have the confidence to know that the
blueprint works.  
Our guys in the locker room all know that. I'd be shocked if the younger guys
weren't back in the gym in the next 48 hours, trying to fight back to get back
here again.  
  
Q. Julian and Rashad, they did have a tough night seeing the ball tonight.
Do you attribute that to anything that Albany was doing or to the big stage,
like you say, or was it just one of those nights? Could it have even been a
week off?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: No, I don't think so. Those guys have been so tremendous for
us their entire careers. Sometimes they just don't fall. And that happens
sometimes.  
I'm really happy with them, Whack able to get to the free‑throw line nine
times and able to score 16 points, and also did a great job defensively.  
I think the biggest thing you take from it that could have easily happened
because they weren't shooting the ball well, they could have stopped playing
defense, they could have leading. They didn't do those things. Because they
continued to stay locked into the game plan and continue to fight to help our
team win, we had a chance to win the game despite their numbers.  
So I'm really proud of them. I'm proud of all our seniors. And, again, this
road to get here isn't easy. But they've been tremendous for us, and I'm
really proud of them. I'm proud they call me Coach every day.  
That's one of the biggest things I'll take out of this is when you go through
a journey, you go through a battle with a group of guys, and at the end of it
you can look at each other in the eyes and have a lot of respect for one
another. You've done everything you could to help them move forward.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks for your time. Congratulations on your season.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the head coach of Cal Poly, Joe Callero,
and student‑athletes Kyle Odister and Chris Eversley.  
So we'll open up the floor for questions for our student‑athletes, and we ask
you direct your question to a specific student‑athlete.  
  
Q. How big of a deal is this back in SLO?  
CHRIS EVERSLEY: It's a huge deal. As you guys probably know, we're not like a
huge city in California and we're a town of about 38,000 people. So this is a
huge aspect of them, of our college experience, and for the student body.  
We had people waiting for us when we got back at 3:30 in the morning from
Anaheim. That shows you what the city thinks of it, and everybody's excited
for us another chance for us to make history.  
KYLE ODISTER: Definitely been a great experience for us. Like Chris said, we
got back, we had students waiting for us. We had a bunch of text messages
right after Selection Sunday. We went to a sports bar, Firestone, and
everybody's there celebrating, and then we found out we had to come to Ohio at
6:00 in the morning the next day.  
So we're just still riding the ride and ready for our game Wednesday.  
  
Q. As a Cali guy, when was the last time you guys played toward the East
Coast? You've been there four years. Did you come to any tournaments this
way?  
KYLE ODISTER: This year we traveled a lot. We went to New York for New Year's.
We played‑‑ what's that in the East Coast?  
CHRIS EVERSLEY: Played Delaware.  
KYLE ODISTER: We played Delaware. So we went back and forth twice this year in
a certain amount of time. So we've been traveling a lot this year. That's why
we had tough preseason schedule. That's why we feel like we're ready for the
tournament this year.  
  
Q. Is there any danger in the fact you feel like you've accomplished
something just getting this far? Because this is a pretty remarkable turn of
events that you find yourself in.  
CHRIS EVERSLEY: One thing we stress in our program is not having what we like
to call altitude sickness. That's when you reach a certain level of success.
Not letting yourself feel like you've arrived and not being complacent with
anything you do.  
So we try to keep our guys as the co‑captains with Jamal Johnson, who is not
up here, but as the leaders of the team, we try to make sure everybody's
staying hungry and staying focused and making sure everybody's on the same
page in terms of accomplishing another goal. Because we're excited that we
made it, but no one's excited that we're just here just to be here. Everybody
else wants to come out and make some more history. Why not keep it going.  
Kyle, obviously you guys started with UCSB in the Big West Tournament. Your
record was what it was coming in. Was there something you guys did differently
going into the Big West Tournament, or was it just a matter of focusing and
getting hot at the right time?  
KYLE ODISTER: UCSB is one of our rival games, so they beat us 20 points on our
senior night, so that was tough to swallow. We had them the first game of the
Big West Tournament. So we came out like this is it. We have three games. We
started the season off 3‑0, so might as well end the season off 3‑0, and
that's just what we did. We had that mentality, and that's what we want to
bring into the tournament tomorrow.  
One of the strange things about the NCAA Tournament no matter where you are,
the underdog ‑‑ usually you're playing before a crowd that a lot of people are
neutral and they just want a sign from the underdog they can play with the
favorite team. Or particularly in your case, because your record, everybody's
going to look at you as the underdog. Do you get a feel at all that there are
people pulling for you strictly because you're not like the other 67 teams in
this?  
CHRIS EVERSLEY: Yeah, we definitely got that sense of just feeling that, like
you mentioned. But like we knew our season didn't really turn out the way we
wanted it to, but we made sure nobody was just full of lament about like how
their record was going into the tournament.  
And it's just‑‑ we understand that we're the underdog. We've been the underdog
since we entered the conference tournament. And nobody expected us to be here,
but we stuck together and made sure that all 15 players and the rest of the
coaching staff made sure that every guy in that locker room believed that we
could honestly play with anybody in this tournament.  
Chris, you starting up at Rice, the transition from Rice to the Big West, and
there was the hope that you would get to the NCAA Tournament, but was it a
tough transition going to the Big West?  
CHRIS EVERSLEY: It has been. It's been a tough transition. You can see it
because it took us four years to get here. So it wasn't anything that happened
overnight.  
But the decision for me to transfer was one of the best decisions I've made
because it provided me with an opportunity to be around great people and great
coaching staff and put myself in a great position to help a team get to the
tournament.  
  
Q. And great weather.  
CHRIS EVERSLEY: And great weather, exactly. I'm not complaining.  
  
Q. Have you guys had an opportunity to look at all of Texas Southern? And
what do you think is particularly an area that you have to be good tomorrow
night in order to win?  
KYLE ODISTER: Actually, we started watching them yesterday. We had the whole
day of traveling yesterday, so we just watched a little film on them
yesterday. We don't really know much about them yet. After shootaround today
we're going to go back and really lock in on what exactly what they do.  
But the main thing we know we have to do is be there defensively. That's what
got us to this point. We have to keep it going.  
  
Q. Chris, obviously Aaric Murray is ‑‑ their player has also transferred.
Have you talked about him at all, or is that something you guys are going to
do in the next 24 hours or whatever?  
CHRIS EVERSLEY: We covered him yesterday in the scouting report. Like Kyle
said, we went through their personnel and got the basics down.  
We understand, you know, a great player, averaging 21 points a game, seven
rebounds, I think 2.4 blocks or something like that.  
So we've also looked at the rest of their team and like those guys that are
contributing factors to why they're here as well. And we're just going to keep
our defensive principles, like Kyle said. Pressure and defending and
rebounding is what got us here, and that's what's going to keep us here.  
  
Q. Have you had the opportunity ‑‑ was there anybody on campus or somebody
who put you down late in the year or anything that you could kind of get the
last laugh on? Or did you get any odd‑‑ you said you got text messages and
everything when you got back from the tournament. I wondered if anybody said,
hey, look, I gotta admit I didn't believe in you guys.   
KYLE ODISTER: No, our whole community has been behind us the whole time. So we
had a lot of support throughout the year. They knew our talent we had. We had
some injuries. I got hurt in and out of the year, and people were finding
roles.  
So people had faith in us and knew we played a tough schedule throughout the
beginning of the year because we played Arizona, we played Pittsburgh, we
played a lot of top teams that are in the tournament now.  
So we knew we had a tough schedule, and the whole community has been behind
us.  
There might have been friends back home that said something, but at the end of
the day they're still behind me.  
CHRIS EVERSLEY: As Kyle said, the SLO community is ‑‑ we're 6‑9 going into our
senior night against Santa Barbara, and that game was still sold out. Like
there were people still there being supportive of like the three seniors and
the rest of the team.  
So that just shows you no matter what happens the SLO community is just that
close and that bonded. And since day one we both felt like we've been embraced
as one of their own.  
  
Q. I'm not going to lie. I got Cal Poly Pomona and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo
mixed up. Am I the only one to do that, or do you guys get that sometimes?  
KYLE ODISTER: We seen that on ‑‑ before we played the championship game, said
Cal Poly Pomona versus Cal Poly Northridge. We're like oh. I mean, it was
Northridge, we were like wow. So we just want to make a statement so everybody
knows now we're Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.  
CHRIS EVERSLEY: DIRECTV is right there with you.  
  
Q. They do the same.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for our student‑athletes? Kyle and Chris,
thank you. Good luck tomorrow night.  
We're joined by the head coach of Cal Poly, Joe Callero.  
Coach, an opening statement before we open the floor to questions for you.  
COACH CALLERO: We're ecstatic to be here. And how many teams in the nation say
they're ecstatic to be a 16 seed and being in Dayton and aren't complaining
about their seeding.  
We love it. We're pleased. We've earned it. Some people might say, wow, you
snuck in.  
We think we're a very good team. We've been a very good program the last two
years. We won 18 games. We set a school record for victories. Last season as a
DivisionI program we played in the semifinals and lost to Pacific at the
buzzer who went on to the tournament.  
We thought this year we were completely qualified to win the Big West
Conference Tournament. We played five high majors on the road to start the
season off. We're competitive at Arizona, Oregon, Stanford, Pittsburgh, and
the Colonial Conference champion, Delaware, who are all in the tournament.  
We've been seasoned. We started off conference play 3‑0 and suffered an injury
to Kyle Odister. We were 4‑2 and we went on a terrible streak where we
couldn't score consistently and Kyle wasn't playing.  
We got Kyle back late in the year starting, getting some of the wear and tear
off of them and we went on a phenomenal run during the tournament to get to
the tournament.  
But I think myself, the assistant coaches and the players are the ones who are
least shocked to have a team that is 13‑19 in the tournament.  
My last opening statement is if we win the National Championship, we'll have a
winning record, 20‑19\. We have to win seven straight.  
  
Q. Coach, I saw UCSB earlier in the year and you obviously lost to them
twice in the regular season ‑‑  
COACH CALLERO: No.  
  
Q. Did you beat them the first time?  
COACH CALLERO: Yeah, we beat them on their home court. I'm going to correct
you.  
  
Q. Correct me anytime you want.  
COACH CALLERO: Beat them on their home court; came up on Senior Night, beat us
on our home court.  
  
Q. So, anyway, you guys obviously did a really good job in the Big West
Tournament. Did anything change going into that?  
COACH CALLERO: Yeah, we played them down at their place and we beat them with
offense. We hit 10 of 16 3‑pointers. They came up to our place eight weeks
later, because of scheduling was kind of weird. We started off with them early
in the year and rotated to playing them in the last game of the year.  
And it was Senior Night. They came up and kind of punched us in the throat and
we never recovered. They beat us down the court. They beat us in the interior
and exterior and we lost by 15 points. We pushed back very aggressively and
really turned up our defense, pressured the perimeter.  
We forced some turnovers and we really won the second game based upon our
defense. Our man‑to‑man defense the last week at the tournament has been the
best I've ever had a team play at Cal Poly in my five years. That's what we're
basing it on. And what's happened is because our defense is turned up so much,
we're flowing a little bit more relaxing a little bit more on the offensive
end.  
  
Q. Is there a danger at all that, like you said, you're ecstatic to be here
that you can consider this an accomplishment without necessarily playing
through tomorrow?  
COACH CALLERO: Absolutely. And we've addressed that with our players, that
we're concerned about celebrating the birthday party for week‑long.  
It's like we've accomplished a first‑time historical moment for Cal Poly as
far as 20 years of DivisionI. We've made the tournament as a Division II
program a number of times. But 20 years as DivisionI, first time we get to the
Big Dance.  
So everybody's celebrating the first time. That's great. I'm just glad that we
are playing on Wednesday, not Tuesday, because I think it gives us an extra
day to exhale and realize that was a great accomplishment but put that in the
archives and move on now to try to win a first round game.  
And I think that the more time that we have to come out here and practice and
get our feet underneath us and get the emotions and go to press conferences
and talk to parents, friends and family, eventually you're like, well, let's
go play another game now.  
I think if it was a Tuesday‑playing game right away, that would have been much
more difficult for us about it's going to be a Wednesday game. I think it's
big to get us our emotional stamina as I call it. We have to get our emotions
back to an even‑keel level.  
  
Q. Along those lines, obviously 24 teams, there's YouTube and tape and stuff
like that, but was it tough to get a scout on Texas Southern and do you have
people that you can call?  
COACH CALLERO: With technology nowadays, you can get anything on anybody. I
can get a ninth grade team in Alaska's tape on YouTube if you need to.
Everything's available. So in the last five years things have advanced that
you can get any tape on anybody you need.  
  
Q. Just looking at the stats, Aaric Murray averaging 21 points for them.
Obviously the most important thing I guess for you is to play great defense
and not allow him to hit his average and hold him down a little bit.  
COACH CALLERO: Yeah, it is. And we've played against ‑‑ Al Williams got signed
to Santa Barbara who's the MVP of our conference. Al is 6'7", 6'8", 255, 260
pounds, and 21‑12 kind of guy, double‑double machine. I think he leads the
nation.  
What we've learned about that is when you get a player like that you're going
against, it's not just about stopping him. Guys like that, if they draw so
much attention from you, you leave their second, third, and fourth leading
scorers open, they're flat‑footed 3s, they're getting easy drop‑off baskets.  
So we've gotta do a great job concentrating on the leading scorer, but I put
as much emphasis in the second, third, fourth options as well as making sure
you know who the guys are coming off the bench, that X factor of a guy who
steps on the court that maybe you didn't pay as much attention during the
scouting report, comes and gets 10, 12 points and gets hot.  
I think that's a big part of our team's maturity in the last two weeks is that
notion that everything matters. We talk about over and over again the game
really comes down to one play. You just don't know when that one play is.
Might be 12‑minute mark, 60‑minute mark, everybody focuses on the last play of
the game, but many times that one play could be at the 12‑minute mark that you
get a stop, you recover from defensively, you knock from behind, instead of
them getting a layup, you knock from behind and get it and kick it ahead and
it's a four‑, six‑point swing in those situations.  
We try to look at it play‑by‑play, break the game down to, hey, they've got
great players, they're going to have their run. But just staying in the
moment. We've talked really a lot about one‑day contract, one‑moment
contracts, just keeping the focus on the play at hand. So don't get too far
ahead of yourself in any direction.  
  
Q. You mentioned that it was a tough turnaround. Can you go through the
timeline that you had, what you guys had to get where you are now from
Saturday night?  
COACH CALLERO: It's been a whirlwind. Saturday night we win, it's West Coast
time, 9:30, 10:00. By the time we get the championship net cut down, get to
the hotel packed up the bus, they didn't leave to get to San Luis Obispo until
about 11:30at night. Four‑hour drive north from LA‑Anaheim where we were up to
San Luis Obispo, north of Santa Barbara. So four hours in the bus, they got in
at 3:30 in the morning.  
There were 100 students waiting there to greet them. I'm sure the players
didn't go to bed until 5:00 or 6:00 when the sun was coming up. We got up
about noon, 1:00, 2:00 and we met for the Selection Show down at the local
barbecue place. Turned around and went up to the gym and did paperwork for the
NCAA on gambling and physicals and flight.  
Found out we'd be catching a flight Monday morning at 8:00a.m. so then we had
to get up at 6:15 to get on the bus to get to Santa Maria to catch a charter,
took the charter, got into town late yesterday afternoon, checked into the
hotel, unwound a little bit and went out to a team dinner and looked at our
guys' eyes and going, wow, in about 72 hours we went from trying to hope to
win a championship of the Big West on Saturday afternoon to Tuesday afternoon
we're sitting in Dayton, Ohio, at the Spaghetti Warehouse going we're here.  
You go from 72 hours you're having a subway sandwich in Anaheim hoping you can
win to going, hey, we're in the Big Dance in Dayton.  
And the coolest part, though, I want to give the NCAA and the city of Dayton
some real credit, kudos for when we stepped off the charter plane, there was a
sign there on the cyclone fence, Welcome to the First Four, the first step to
the Final Four. It was a nice sign. It was just‑‑ and there was a little
basketball sitting on top of the cones where the charter jet ‑‑ I thought that
was classy, the hotel lobby being decorated with team photos and balloons.  
I know that you guys are reporters and you're not responsible for that, but I
do think that it needs to be noted to the city of Dayton, the feeling and the
hospitality that we've been in town now for 20 hours, I understand completely
why the NCAA wants to keep the First Four here and appreciate the city for
hosting that.  
From a small school, small‑town Catholic kid coming to Dayton, being part of
the NCAA Final Four and the whole tournament, couldn't be more appreciative.  
I hope everybody will cheer for our team. That's where we are, is what a cool
thing this is.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

Albany  71  
Mount St. Marys  64

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by the head coach of Albany, Will Brown, as well
as student‑athletes DJ Evans and Peter Hooley.  
Coach, an opening statement, and then we'll open the floor for questions for
student‑athletes.  
COACH BROWN: First off I'd like to congratulate Coach Christian and Mount St.
Mary's program for an outstanding season.  
To me it's all about matchups, and this was not a good matchup on paper for
us, because they played four guards, they spread the floor, and they shoot a
ton of 3s.  
Our goal coming into this game was to stay big, play big, be stay. And I'm
proud of my guys. I thought we handled adversity well tonight. I thought we
weathered the storm, we stayed the course, and we made plays down the stretch,
we finished.  
That's important. It's a great win for the America East Conference and for
University of Albany, our athletic department and our program, and we couldn't
be happier.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes only.  
  
Q. DJ, nine rebounds tonight, it was one of those things you knew coming in
‑‑ you knew you had to do what you had to do against the pressure?  
DJ EVANS: Yeah, my coaches just told me to get in to help the bigs rebound
because they were shooting a lot of long 3s, so long 3s against long rebounds,
so I was at the right place at the right time.  
  
Q. For either of you guys, what was going through your mind when you guys
were up 21 ‑2 and they just made a furious comeback, end up with the lead?
What was going through your mind?  
PETER HOOLEY: We knew they were a great team. Every team here is a great team.
We knew they were going to make a run. We just had to remain calm and weather
the storm and make sure we stayed together.  
We had to go on a little run of our own, and then we did. They went on another
run, and then we had to fight back and make another run.  
That's what we pride ourselves on, being resilient. The fact that we managed
to pull it out is a great thing.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the guy sitting to your right, what DJ has meant
to this team, not just today but the past three games?  
PETER HOOLEY: DJ is a terrific player. I knew that coming. He's really an
unbelievable player, every part of the court. He got nine rebounds and he's
about 4'8", so that's really impressive.  
He does all the little things that you can't find in most players. I don't
think any other 4'8" guy would go in there and get that many boards.  
But he did what he had to do to help us get this win, and I'm really proud of
him.  
  
Q. Your family been to the game?  
PETER HOOLEY: They had a nice 3:00a.m. wake‑up, so probably all my 20
relatives will probably all be around the TV watching back home. Probably get
on the phone with my mom after this. She'll probably be in tears, so that will
be good.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for our student‑athletes? DJ and Peter,
thanks for your time. Good luck against Florida in the second round.  
Open the floor now for questions for Coach Brown.  
  
Q. You guys are leading 21 ‑2\. They go on a 21‑2 run. I don't think I've
ever seen that. Can you tell us as the coach what were you thinking at that
point when the game was tied and blowing a 19‑point lead?  
COACH BROWN: Blowing a 19‑point lead, we're the only game on national
television, so we wanted to keep the viewers interested.  
No, I mean, basketball is a game of runs, and we happened to make that first
run. And Mount St. Mary's is too good of a team, they're too good offensively.
And they play the pressure, defense and they ‑‑ as VCU, it's havoc.  
So we just knew they'd make a run. We just didn't want to hurt ourselves, and
we did during that initial run they made with some careless turnovers.  
They took 37 3s out of 60 shots. I mean, our defense wasn't bad. We held them
to 36percent. Biggest thing was we pounded them on the glass. That was
important to us.  
But they're a difficult matchup for us. They played four guards, they spread
the floor, shoot a ton of 3s. And heading into the game‑‑ I'm a stubborn coach
and I wasn't going to match up to them. I wanted to stay big with Sam and John
up front and try to be the more physical team.  
And I think we did enough. We beat a good basketball team and a team that was
playing very well heading into the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Same question I asked of Pete. Do you think is it fair to say DJ has been
sort of an unsung hero for you guys for a little while?  
COACH BROWN: DJ is awesome. What people don't realize, DJ as a freshman in
college led East Mississippi Junior College to the national tournament, as a
sophomore led East Mississippi right back to the national tournament. As a
junior now he comes in and sits behind Mike Black, a First‑Team All‑Conference
point guard.  
Tough, tough year for him. He just kept working and working and working, and I
had to keep telling him next year's your time. Next year's your time.  
And one of the things we talked to DJ with, you know what, Mike left his mark,
you know, make your mark now.  
And he was up and down. He was streaky for the first ‑‑ throughout the year.
And the last month he's been as good and as valuable as any player in our
program. And I'll tell you what, I have no problem saying the last couple of
weeks he's been as good as any player in the America East Conference. He has a
chip on his shoulder. Peter said he's 4'8". I'll give him five feet. He's
fearless. I think at that size you have to be fearless and play with a chip on
your shoulder.  
I'm very happy for him because it would have been very easy for him last year
when he wasn't playing to make every excuse to go somewhere else, and he
believed in us, we believed in him. And he's the happiest kid in the world
right now. He really is. And he deserves to be recognized. And I'm glad he
made All‑Tournament in the America East Conference tournament, and he was
tremendous today.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach Brown? Coach, thank you for your
time. Good luck against the Gators.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST ROUND:
DAYTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+ROUND%3A+DAYTON)

  

## March 18, 2014

  

### [Melsahn Basabe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26772)

### [Devyn Roy Marble](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23400)

### [Zach McCabe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23485)

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

  
_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up the floor for questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. This question is for Dev. When you look at what McRae's done on video,
what do you see and how does he compare to yourself and are you going to be
the one that looks like you're going to have to defend him quite a bit?  
ROY DEVYN MARBLE: Jordan McRae is a good guard. I think our games resemble
each other a little bit. He's asked to carry a lot of the scoring load for
that team, and, yes, I will be guarding him.  
  
Q. Devyn, is it interesting to you that you're playing a Tennessee team that
you very nearly could have faced in the Battle for Atlantis, and does it help
or hurt? What are the benefits of playing a team that you guys probably
scouted and got a chance to see, play in person earlier this season?  
ROY DEVYN MARBLE: I don't know if it's any benefits or advantages or anything
like that, but it is a team that we were prepared to have to face, like you
said, in Atlantis. And the coaches have done a good job in keeping us focused
and concentrating, making sure we have the right game plan going into it.  
  
Q. Both Zach and Melsahn, it's been four years for you guys to get to this
point. Does tomorrow's game and the preparation for tomorrow's game feel any
different than any other game in your career?  
ZACH MCCABE: You know, obviously it's a big opportunity being in the NCAA
Tournament and an opportunity to play, and I think we just have to focus like
any other game, just take it like we've been doing in our routine, every game
each year and stuff like that.  
So we just have to be prepared and focused and be ready for a great team in
Tennessee.  
MELSAHN BASABE: To piggyback what Zach said, I give credit to Coach McCaffery
and the coaching staff. We're prepared at an elite level for each game whether
it's a preseason scrimmage or non‑conference, or any game we treat as a very
important game.  
So obviously the stage is a big stage, and this is elimination setting, but as
far as our preparation, you know, the coaches have built the culture of us
always being diligent and focusing no matter who you play.  
  
Q. All three, and I'll start with Melsahn on this one, defense has obviously
been an issue down the stretch in some of these losses, but also seemed to be
kind of lack of communication on defense, not really the high tides or
whatever that were there earlier in the season. Is that just a perception, or
is there some truth to that, that maybe there's not either as much intensity
on defense and the chemistry isn't as strong as maybe it was before February,
before you played Wisconsin?  
MELSAHN BASABE: It's not perception, because obviously the numbers show that
we haven't been defending to our capability. Like you said, we were a really
good defensive team. The last two years we've been one of the good defensive
teams in the country. I'm going to say as a senior I'm going to start off by
letting my voice be heard. I know Devyn and Zach will do the same thing and
let it carry out throughout the team. We're just going to play defense the way
we're capable of playing.  
ZACH MCCABE: It's lack of focus, I think. Not doing what we need to do. And, I
mean, it's kind of just killed us the last couple of games. We just gotta get
back to the basketball we were playing, playing together as one unit, and
gotta get that back.  
ROY DEVYN MARBLE: I think we've been able to make some adjustments. We're
communicating better as far as practice, leading up to this point. I think
you'll see a higher energy level. If this doesn't excite you and energize you
as a player, then I don't know what will.  
  
Q. All three of you, this is the first NCAA Tournament Iowa has played in
since'06. Have any former Iowa players reached out to any you, sort of giving
you advice or offering their hand at all going into this game?  
ROY DEVYN MARBLE: I've talked to Matt recently. He reached out to me. I've
also stayed in constant communication with guys like Archie and E. May and
Jarryd Cole. So they're all supporting us, and we appreciate it and they've
given me different words of encouragement that I've definitely taken into
consideration.  
ZACH MCCABE: Yeah, same pretty much. I've been reached out by Matt Gatens and
Jarryd Cole and Eric. And (indiscernible) actually texted me and just told me
to play, just get our team ready to go, play with energy, stuff like that, and
leave no regrets out on the floor.  
MELSAHN BASABE: I have spoken to Devon Archie as well as Jarryd Cole, but I
always speak to them. They're like my big brothers. And then actually Dev's
dad, even though he was playing in the'80s, he's been a mentor person I talk
to a lot, so that's a former player that I was speaking to just about the
stage and how it works.  
  
Q. Dev, your coach is in a tough spot with his personal situation. Do you
see that as being any kind of rallying cry for this team, or are you just
going to be there and support him behind closed doors, let it go at that?  
ROY DEVYN MARBLE: You said something about rattling?  
  
Q. He's in a tough spot personally with Patrick. Is it a rallying point, not
rattle, rally behind him?  
ROY DEVYN MARBLE: Yeah, of course. Coach McCaffery is our guy. We love him.
We're all like family. Pat is a guy that basically at practice with us every
day. He's like our little brother.  
So I think as a unit we will rally behind it, and hopefully we everything goes
well for them. They're all in our prayers.  
So I know, like you said, he's in a tough spot, so we're just trying to make
this as simple and easy for him as possible.  
  
Q. This one's for Zach and Mel. Tennessee has a pretty good inside player in
Jarnell Stokes. What have you seen of him on video and what's your challenge
going up against him?  
THE MODERATOR: Zach first and then Mel.  
ZACH MCCABE: Obviously a big body. Guys we haven't seen in our league. They're
very good offensive rebounders, and just on the glass constantly. So it's
something we haven't seen.  
But I think we're prepared. We know what we need to do. They're great players,
and they bring a lot of energy to the game. So we just gotta match that and
bring even more than we have in the past. So it's just a mindset game and we
just gotta be aggressive with that.  
MELSAHN BASABE: Obviously Jarnell is a very talented player. But like I said,
the Big Ten has been pretty good my four years here, so I've seen everything
from Sullinger to Draymond Green and Adreian Payne and Brandon Dawson and all
those guys. So I'm used to competing against high‑level big men. And he
presents his own challenges, but I think as long as you play them correctly
and bring the proper intensityand you've got to realize when that shot goes
up, it's going to be a war for the rebound, I think we're able to get it done.  
We just gotta have confidence in our own experience, our own ability while
respecting our opponent as well.  
  
Q. Zach, not to harp on the Battle for Atlantis, but you guys played well in
that tournament. How would you compare how you played at that point tothese
last few games you've been in? Do you think you can get back to that point in
another tournament setting?  
ZACH MCCABE: Yeah, I mean, definitely it's a different type of environment
there and tournament setting, and I usually play my best in tournament
settings.  
So just gotta stay confident, believe in my shots, stuff like that, just
getting in a rhythm and just play the best I can.  
Now, that tournament was a great tournament for me, and I hope I can continue
to play like that in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Zach, you said you play your best in tournament setting. Is there
something different about sort of that format, for all three of you, that
makes it easier to elevate your play?  
ZACH MCCABE: Just knowing it could be your last game. Every game after that,
there's nothing to prepare for after that if you lose. So just brings you full
circle what we need to do to win.  
And it's a big opportunity for us in the NCAA Tournament. And we look to going
on a run and stay aggressive and bring energy like we have at the end of the
season.  
  
Q. This one is for any of you three, doesn't matter which one who wants to
address it, but after halftime the last four games you guys have given up
sizable runs. Is there anything, any common element in the locker room at
halftime that I guess ‑‑ kind of a lack of intensity right off the bat? Or
what is the common element as far as giving up those runs right out of
halftime?   
MELSAHN BASABE: It relates to us getting away from who we are in the first
half of those games. I can't remember the exact numbers, but we was doing what
the coaches had told what we had to do and we were playing great team defense,
playing up to our capabilities.  
I think when we start giving up runs and stuff, we start going away from what
has made us successful and what we're capable of.  
So that sample of what you just talked about, those spurts just relate to the
whole body of the stretch, which is not that we're not capable, where we're
getting away from the things that make us successful.  
So I think we need to whenever when we go into halftime just‑‑ the coaches
send their message, repeat what got you here, in the situation when we are up,
and if we're down, remember, okay, what gets us out of the hole and what's
going to help us win this game. I think that's it.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for our student‑athletes? All right,
Melsahn, Devyn, and Zach, good luck tomorrow night.  
We're now being joined by Fran McCaffery, the head coach of the Iowa Hawkeyes.  
Coach, an opening statement and then we'll open up the floor for questions for
you.  
COACH MCCAFFERY: This has been an incredible journey for our team and we're
just thrilled to be here. I've been here before playing in the NCAA
Tournament. Incredible venue here at Dayton. And I'm just so excited for our
guys to have this opportunity to play in the tournament.  
We've prepared well. I like our professionalism in terms of how we approach
getting ready for this game. And that's about it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Fran, in your experience as a coach and especially tournament time,
what's your take on the importance people place on point guard play?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I don't know that I would look at it any differently in terms
of this time of the year or any other time of the year. I view point guard
play as incredibly important. You look at this game, in particular, and you
say, well, it might be rebounding, because they're so good in that area.  
It could be transition. They run, we run. It could be any number of things.
But I think when it's all said and done, the guy that's got the ball most of
the time and his ability to make decisions is going to be critical in terms of
who wins and loses the game.  
  
Q. Coach, watching the bracket, pops up you play Tennessee, is there a
benefit, anything good about playing a team that you got a chance to probably
scout and see over at the Battle for Atlantis tournament earlier ‑‑  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I don't think there's any benefit because both of us thought
there was a real good chance we were going to play each other. If we both won
or we both lost, we were going to play each other in the second round. So I'm
sure they have a scouting report on us. We have a scouting report on them.  
But that was so long ago. I remember watching them and watching them recently
and saying, you know, how impressed I was with how they've continued to
improve, how their team came together. At that time of the year you're sort of
not sure, where are we going to end up. Both teams obviously came into the
season with great expectation. We both have experience. And typically with
experience you have expectation. And fortunately we're both here.  
  
Q. Fran, your three seniors just said the guys you mentioned Sunday, Cole,
May, Gatens, those guys, had reached out to them, wishing the best of luck. Is
that a sign leadership doesn't end when your career's over maybe and how much
those guys want it for these guys?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I do, but I also think it speaks to the character of those
guys and how close they are that they've remained in touch with each other.  
I think Jarryd Cole in particular really took Melsahn and Zach under his wing
and tried to show them how to do it. And so did Matt and Eric with regard to
Dev, and you could see it's been reflected in their play and their
development.  
And I think when you have‑‑ when you have great leadership, you don't have
other issues. If you have issues, you don't get here.  
And so I'm thankful to the leadership that came before and hope that those
guys feel very much a part of the fact that we're here.  
  
Q. Fran, this game features two explosive 2 guards in Marble and McRae. What
kind of challenges does McRae present and is Dev going to ‑‑ when you're in
man, is he going to largely draw that responsibility on defense?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: There will be a lot of times he does; there will be some
times when he won't.  
McRae has really been impressive to me. Watched him live, of course, but when
he's making 3s, his first step is so quick. He seems to always have his
defender on the side of him.  
If that's the case, then he can create. The thing about him, he's a scorer.
But he also gives it up easy. And I think that's what makes him special. He
also will run you down and block shots. He has the ability to guard and take
advantage of his incredible length.  
He's explosive, but I think his length presents issues at both ends of the
floor that make him a guy that I think will ultimately end up in the NBA.  
  
Q. Coach, were you able to work on a situation where you're able to fly back
to Iowa City, spend some time with your family and make it back to the game
tomorrow?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I was. I'm going to leave tonight about 8:30. So we'll
obviously‑‑ we got here yesterday. We had a meeting, we practiced before we
left, so actually had two meetings, a meeting this morning, and obviously
we'll have practice today. We'll have another meeting and then I'll take off.
And so we'll put everything to bed for today.  
Tomorrow, the other coaches will handle the morning meeting and the
shootaround. Hopefully I'll be back before the last meeting we have which is
typically right before pregame meal or right after pregame meal and be ready
to coach the game, assuming all goes well.  
  
Q. Walking off to the plate, I heard you guys laughing behind the scene
here. I guess, you know, with the way these last few games have gone for you
all, have you noticed kind of a ‑‑ has there been almost a relief of pressure?
Are they more carefree than they were when the regular season was ended the
way it did, or is this kind of like a refresh button for you guys?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I hope so. I really do. I think there was so much emphasis
put on this team's ability to get here, to get into the NCAA Tournament in
terms of progression. We all look at progression. 18 wins two years ago, NIT
bid. Second round departure, then 25 wins, NIT championship game. The next
step is you've gotta go to the tournament.  
I think without question that was on their minds every time we took the floor.
And I think it was helpful at times. Maybe it wasn't as helpful at times. But
like you said, once you're here, you know then, okay, we all have an equal
opportunity to win a National Championship. And it starts with the first game.
And anybody that you play against is going to be really good. And we recognize
that and we'll prepare and be ready.  
  
Q. Fran, have you been concerned at all about the communication issues on
the defensive end, or sometimes does it seem like guys are talking to each
other, a little out of sorts? Have they been ironed out over the last few
days?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I don't think that's been the case. I think we've talked
quite a bit. Sometimes the recognition isn't exactly what you want. But that's
true for every game.  
We've had some unique sets of circumstances that happen in games recently
that, quite honestly, defy the law of averages. We typically will go after the
other team's top guys and try to lock into them, and in a lot of cases it's
been other people, which is a credit to the opposition that have made shots
against us.  
That said, we have to react differently. I don't disagree with that point. I
think you're right, and we have addressed a lot of those areas. And I think
our practices have been incredibly spirited and intense and focused, and we
have already shown that we're capable of playing really good defense. It just
hasn't happened in recent weeks.  
  
Q. Is it hard for you not to remember the Siena ‑Ohio State game when you
walk into this building?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: It was not hard at all. We're in the locker room next to the
locker room that we celebrated in. I remember walking off the floor like it
was yesterday. And Coach Francis and I were just talking about it five minutes
ago. Great feeling, incredible sense of accomplishment, and hope to enjoy
similar experience.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for Coach? Fran, thank you for your time.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by student‑athletes Jordan McRae, Jeronne Maymon,
Jarnell Stokes, Antonio Barton, and Josh Richardson. We'll open the floor for
questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Just Jordan and Jeronne, the veterans, how does it feel now you're in the
building and see the NCAA logos? If both of you will talk about your emotions
this morning.  
JORDAN MCRAE: It's just a great feeling for us on. This is something that
we've been working towards all year, and for us to finally be here, it's a
great feeling.  
JERONNE MAYMON: To second what Jordan said, I think it's a good accomplishment
for us to finally be able to make the NCAA Tournament. And that's about it.  
  
Q. Jarnell, just ‑‑ you talked about the NIT not being fun. Did it hit you
today when you walked in here and see all the blue and all the NCAA logos that
this is the NCAA Tournament, you're finally kind of where you always wanted to
be in?  
JARNELL STOKES: It hit me when we got to the hotel room, got to the hotel and
we were able to see some of the things people go through when they get to the
tournament. Something I personally never experienced.  
But we realize we have unfinished business. So I don't want to get too hard, I
guess.  
Jarnell, what do you know about Iowa going into this game?  
JARNELL STOKES: We saw them in the Bahamas, and I stayed and I watched a lot
of their games. I saw them competing with Villanova, one of the top teams in
the country now. So this team is very good. They can shoot the ball and they
have very good balance in their offense.  
  
Q. Jordan, I guess both teams are in a similar position, came into the
season with big expectations, are now in the First Four game in Dayton. Coach
Fran McCaffery talked about this kind of being a reset for his team, now it's
a new season. Is that kind of how you guys feel as well?  
JORDAN MCRAE: For us, it's definitely something new. Everybody's record is
like 0‑0\. 68 teams right now are trying to do the same thing.  
Josh, I don't know what your game plan would be, but I assume you'll spend
some time on Marble tomorrow. What have you seen from him on film and what
kind of a challenge is that compared to some of the guys you faced this
season?  
JOSH RICHARDSON: Devyn Marble is definitely a good player. He's good at
creating his own shots, he plays well in transition. It's kind of tough to
contain somebody like that that can do so many things with the ball.  
But, I mean, I've got my guys behind me to help me if I get off balance or
something like that, so I think we should be all right tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jarnell, for you, you tend to play well in games that there are a lot of
eyes on you. This tournament is going to be probably the most ‑‑ most people
that have been watching‑‑ are you excited about that opportunity? I mean,
you've put up some good numbers this year. Do you feel like this could be a
showcase of some of the things you've been doing?   
JARNELL STOKES: Well, I'm not thinking about putting up big numbers except
maybe rebounding. But anything else I'm not really thinking about that. I just
want to make the right play, make high‑IQ basketball plays and defend,
rebound, do what my team needs me to win. I'm not really thinking about
numbers.  
  
Q. Antonio, you guys have won I think five in a row going into that Florida
game, and I don't think it trailed any of those five games. Did that Florida
game at all feel like stopped your guys' momentum at all? Because, again, you
guys were beating teams so easily up to that point.  
ANTONIO BARTON: I don't think it stopped anything. We watched a lot of film on
it. We made a couple of adjustments. I think it's more motivation on the
bounceback after a loss. We've just gotta come in, get a job done.  
  
Q. Jeronne, the last time you guys had ‑‑ these two teams had the potential
of crossing each other was at the Battle for Atlantis. Looking back at you
guys now compared to where you are now compared to then, how has this team
changed and what have you learned about yourselves since that preseason
tournament?  
JERONNE MAYMON: I think we're a totally different team in all aspects from top
to bottom. I think we've all improved. If not so physically, mentally more so
than anything. So we came a long way, made a lot of different strides and a
lot of different directions to reach this point. That's why we're playing our
best basketball right now.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, what was it like when you first came to Dayton?  
JOSH RICHARDSON: We first got to Dayton, well, for me I remember just stepping
off the bus and hearing somebody playing a bagpipe. And we were all kind of
thrown off like we just didn't really know what was going on. Then we
remembered it was St. Patrick's Day, so that was part of it.  
We were all excited getting off the bus and like little decorations on the
bed, so it finally set in for us that we're here and we just gotta come out
and play well.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you talk about the pace of play, how important it will be
tomorrow, average over 82 a game, no team scored 80 on you guys this year? I
know you're not afraid to get out and run, but how important is it you just
don't get caught up in going back and forth with them?  
JORDAN MCRAE: Just like you said, they're a team that's scoring 82 points a
game. So we run the run when we get a chance to. We're not trying to have an
up‑and‑down battle with them. We're trying to sit down on defense the whole
game and limit them.  
  
Q. Jarnell, you've played a lot of close games. I'm sure you expect one
tomorrow night. What do you guys need to do to maybe come out on top in a
close game because you guys maybe haven't done that as well throughout the
season?  
JARNELL STOKES: We have to want it a little more than the other team. I feel
like Florida game, Florida did a very good job, particularly at the end of the
game, finishing us off well, letting our defense lead to offense.  
And we just have to make plays, go to what's been working. If they take one
thing away, just someone has to generate offense.  
  
Q. Jordan, Jeronne, I don't know if you heard the news, rather not comment
on it or not, but Bruce Pearl accepted the Auburn job today. Either of you
guys heard about that? What are your thoughts on that, him staying in the SEC
and being back in the coaching game?  
JERONNE MAYMON: We ain't got no comments on the Auburn situation. We're here
to talk about Tennessee.  
JORDAN MCRAE: What Jeronne said.  
THE MODERATOR: Fair enough. Any other questions for the student‑athletes? All
right, Josh, Antonio, Jarnell, Jeronne, Jordan, good luck tomorrow night.  
We're joined by the head coach of the Tennessee Vols.  
Coach Martin, an opening statement, and then we'll open up the floor to
questions for you.  
COACH MARTIN: Just very excited to be in the NCAA Tournament, great for our
guys, great for our program, our fans. Just a tremendous honor. We're excited
to be here. We're looking forward to a great game against Iowa.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Martin?  
  
Q. So many coaches talk about the importance of, /he importance of point
guard play. Is it even more important than it is during the regular season
when you get to tournament time or not, and, if so, what are your feelings on
that?  
COACH MARTIN: I think it's always important. I don't think that the level
raises just because it's an NCAA Tournament, you're still playing against a
college opponent.  
Even though Iowa's a talented team, I think after 30 plus games, you are who
you are. I don't think you can just scrap what you're doing and change.  
So for us I think what Antonio and Darius, those guys have been playing well,
especially in the last six games.  
Even though some games they might not make a lot of shots, they are playing
well and they run their team and facilitate offense, getting the ball where it
needs to go and defending a lot better.  
But, of course, you've got to have talented, good point guard play in order to
be successful.  
  
Q. Coach, you see some similarities between you guys and Iowa, not
necessarily in styles of play, but just two teams that entered the season with
expectations, had some ups and downs but are now here in Dayton playing each
other?  
COACH MARTIN: I think you can say that. I think two teams that went into the
preseason that weren't ranked, whatever the expectations were, we're picked to
finish third in the SEC, finished fourth. You go through things through the
course of a season.  
I think for us, when you have two new point guards in a program and you have
three returning starters, a guy all‑league guy two years ago, he's back in
your program. So trying to gel those guys together to get the chemistry right,
the flow right, doesn't happen overnight. But I'm glad it's happened for our
guys the last six or seven games.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about the importance of pace of play tomorrow;
they averaged over 80 points a game. You guys haven't given that many up all
season long. How important is it you play your style?  
COACH MARTIN: I think for us it's not necessarily control of the tempo,
because we'll score the ball, we'll run in transition when we have
opportunities to score. But I think for us, playing against a very talented
Iowa team, we have to stop them in transition. Similar in some ways to Mizzou,
when they get up those wings, we watch film of those guys, some cases they'll
score with two or three seconds, going off the shot clock, 31seconds on the
clock, 30seconds on the clock, put the ball in the rim. Not just their guards
running the wings, their bigs do a great job of running.  
You have to control it from that standpoint, which is easier said than done,
and just really make those guys play in the half court. You have to box out
because they're a really good offensive rebounding team as well.  
  
Q. You guys have talked about seeing Iowa in the Bahamas back in I guess it
was November. How have you seen them, how are they different maybe now than
they were a few months ago?  
COACH MARTIN: I don't think they're necessarily different. They're still a
good team. I think in some ways they're probably better than they were in the
Bahamas. That was a new team.  
They probably played four or five games before they got to the Bahamas,
probably not the best opponents.  
They played well in the Bahamas, went through the grind of a Big Ten season.
So in some cases you'll probably think they're better than they were at that
point, even though the record might not show as much.  
But I think they're a better team because anytime you go in a league of that
level in 18 games and you talk about 19 games, tournament game, it's tough. So
you learn a lot. You see a lot.  
You've got some great coaching in the league, some very talented players. I
think a lot of cases they're probably better than what they were.  
  
Q. Can you talk about their depth versus your bench, if you think that's
going to factor in at all, they play a lot of guys a lot of minutes, you play
kind of three guys, are you looking at playing more, and how important is that
tomorrow?  
COACH MARTIN: I think we'll go with the eight guys. If there's foul trouble or
a situation that takes place, if you can get a guy a few minutes here or there
we'll do that.  
But for us, we'll play the way we play and whatever happens happens. If we
need to make adjustments, we'll make them and they have good depth. I think
they've got 10 guys hovering around 15 plus minutes at least, excuse me, 10 or
11 guys and have some young guys very talented as well that played a lot
early, probably don't play as much, but they have the pieces to play a lot of
minutes.  
  
Q. When you look at Marble, what can he do not only scoring but away when
he's distributing and how does he compare with McRae?  
COACH MARTIN: Well, I think two different players, though, very talented.
Marble's a guy, 6'7", can run some point, play the 2, play the 3, and some
cases can possibly play the 4. I'm not sure they play him at the 4, but with
his size and his ability to hand the ball, can make shots, crash the glass,
great job of catching and shooting. And I think his skill level definitely
translates to the next level.  
Jordan McRae's case, 6'2" guard that scores in transition, doesn't run the
point for us, but different players, but their approach is the same as far as
how they score the ball, they're both in attack mode.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for Coach Martin?  
  
Q. I asked the players this, Coach what was it like when you first arrived
here in Dayton?  
COACH MARTIN: It was great. I mean, just being in the NCAA Tournament on the
bus ride, with our guys, it's a fun time, exciting time, not only for our
guys, but for our fans, our program, the university.  
And to walk in a hotel, to receive the fanfare that we did, it was great for
our guys and our program. So it was fun.  
  
Q. With the health issues you had earlier in your life and you beat them and
now Coach McCaffery going through a thing with his son, he's going to have to
leave, he has surgery tomorrow, does your heart go out to him and how does
that, how do you think you would deal with that as a coach?  
COACH MARTIN: Obviously I said a prayer for he and his family last night and
this morning because at the end of the day this is what we do for a living but
it's not who we are. First and foremost, he's a father, and that's the most
important thing.  
But that's first in his life. Put it in God's hands. And when he coaches his
team, he'll coach his team. I think it's a tough thing to deal with in a
situation like today you plan the NCAA Tournament game, your players need you,
but your family needs you more. So tough thing to deal with.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for Coach? All right. Thanks for your
time. Good luck tomorrow night.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Introducing the players from North Carolina State University,
Jordan Vandenberg, Ralston Turner, and T.J. Warren.  
  
Q. T.J., it's been kind of a whirlwind since you guys found out you were in
the field. Can you walk us through what you guys have been doing since you
watched the Selection Show last night?  
T.J. WARREN: We got in this morning. We've been preparing for this tournament.
We're excited to be here and we're ready to play, so we're really excited for
it.  
  
Q. T.J., Semaj told us last night you were roommates at Brewster. Could you
talk about your relationship with him and the times you guys had together.  
T.J. WARREN: We were teammates at Brewster my senior year. We have a good
relationship. I'm familiar with his game. He's from Cincinnati, so it's not
too far from here. So it's going to be a lot of fun to play against him in the
NCAA Tournament. Really looking forward to it.  
  
Q. How would you describe his game?  
T.J. WARREN: He's very athletic, very quick, got a good size for a point
guard, can finish out the rim very good. He's a great player. So looking
forward to getting out there with him, so it's cool.  
  
Q. More of a group question for the three of you. How does the familiarity
of playing here last year help you guys in any way, knowing the facility?  
JORDAN VANDENBERG: That question is more directed to T.J., because I didn't
play when we came here last time and Ralston was redshirted. And Ralston was
redshirted. But, T.J., if you want to field that question for me.  
RALSTON TURNER: Like he said, I wasn't here last year because I redshirted.
But despite that, we'll be ready to play.  
T.J. WARREN: What was the question? Oh, it was my first time. I was a freshman
last year, so it was a great opportunity to be able to play in the tournament.
So looking forward to being back here.  
For all you guys, did you go into the Selection Show knowing that the First
Four was a possibility, and what was your initial reaction when it popped up
on the screen?  
JORDAN VANDENBERG: We didn't know what was possible, to be honest with you. We
got texted at like 2:00 to come in the Dail Center and have some pizza and
watch the show.  
We came in there not expecting much. You could see from the video, we're all
sitting there slumped in our seats. When our name was called, we all got
really excited. We didn't know what was possible.  
We're fortunate enough to have this opportunity, so hopefully we can make
people proud and make people think it was the right choice to put us in this
tournament.  
RALSTON TURNER: We had no idea whether we'd get in it or not. We had hope and
we had faith, but we still really didn't know. But we huddled together and we
saw our name come up. We were very excited, so hopefully we can make some
noise.  
T.J. WARREN: It was a big mystery just waiting. They kind of called us early.
So we're going to take full advantage of it, show that we belong here. And
we'll get as many wins as possible in this tournament.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, what did you know about Xavier, if anything, when
you saw their name was paired with you on the show?  
JORDAN VANDENBERG: We didn't know much. We know they're a solid basketball
team. We know this isn't an easy game for us to go into.  
As soon as that name came up, we knew they played pretty solid the whole year.
They had a good couple of games with Creighton.  
So we're not expecting to go out there and just blow out this team. We expect
to have a good, hard match, and hopefully we have a good result for ourselves.  
RALSTON TURNER: I think that they're a team that play really well. They get
into their offense well. They have a great player in Christon. So obviously
he's a tough matchup.  
But we're excited about the opportunity to play. So hopefully we'll be ready.  
T.J. WARREN: With Xavier, we know they execute very well, defend pretty good.
Obviously they've got Semaj, so we'll be prepared for it and be ready to play.  
  
Q. T.J., you've gotten a lot of accolades nationally for the season you've
had. In your world, what kind of season do you feel like you've had?  
T.J. WARREN: I feel like I've had a terrific season. Credit to my teammates to
allow me to lead this team the best way I can.  
And we're in a tournament now, so it's a great opportunity for us to lead the
way. It feels pretty good, and all my teammate have my back.  
  
Q. For you guys, how good has T.J. been this year?  
JORDAN VANDENBERG: I've known T.J. for a little over two years now. It's been
good to see him take a leadership role in this team. He was a great player
last year, but he's now had to take a more predominant role on this team.  
He's a true team player. Yeah, he scores a lot of points, but he's more
willing to pass the ball if someone's in a better position.  
He leads the team both vocally and performance‑wise. It's an honor to watch
him play. He does spectacular things every game. And without him, we wouldn't
be here. So I'm just thankful for having him on the team.  
RALSTON TURNER: It's been great playing with T.J. this year. In my opinion‑‑ I
said this some weeks back‑‑ he's the best player I've played with to this
point in my life.  
So I'm proud of him. I was here last year, so I've seen his growth. And he's
done an excellent job.  
  
Q. For all of you fellas, for about maybe the last 10, 12 games, Coach
Gottfried has been preaching about the NCAA Tournament being the greatest show
on earth and a great privilege to play in this thing. How much was that a
motivating factor toward the end of the season when you guys were put in the
position where you had to keep winning?  
T.J. WARREN: We just wanted to take one game at a time. We understood our
backs was against the walls leading to the end of the season. It was just
crunch time for us.  
We just had to prepare for every game like it was our last. It's good to be in
this position right now.  
RALSTON TURNER: Definitely, it was on our minds. Especially there late, we
knew it was something we wouldn't have a chance to do. So we went into games
knowing that we needed to try to finish them off to give ourselves this
opportunity.  
JORDAN VANDENBERG: Going into the second half of the season, we knew we had to
perform a lot better. We had to close games better, know our defensive
assignments better.  
We knew that the NCAA was an option for us, so we just had to come together as
a team and prove that we were a tournament‑worthy team. And I think we proved
that in the second half of the ACC season and the tournament.  
Just like good to have the opportunity to be here. It's my fifth year at NC
State. So I'm proud of my whole team. We brought it together at the end, and
now we have an opportunity to show everyone how good we are.  
Up until this year, when Xavier went to the Big East, they were in the same
conference with Dayton. In the two decades, pretty heated rivals. Do you
expect to have the home crowd or the crowd behind you here tomorrow night, and
how beneficial would that be as opposed to just being a straight neutral
court?  
T.J. WARREN: It will be great, I mean, having a mutual floor for both fans.
We're here to play basketball, so we're not really worried about fans so much.  
RALSTON TURNER: It would be nice, but I think right now we're expecting them
to have a good turnout. They're just down the road from Dayton. So we'll treat
this as if it's probably a road game for us.  
JORDAN VANDENBERG: I feel the same way Ralston does about the game.  
  
Q. T.J., what are your memories of the game last year against Temple?  
T.J. WARREN: It was pretty tough the first round, losing the first round.
Don't want to repeat that.  
But it was great to be out there last year. My first time, like I said before.
This is a new tournament year, so looking forward to turning things around and
going forward in the tournament.  
  
Q. T.J., you know Semaj from Brewster. We talked about that. More and more
guys are going route, prep school or something like that. How was that
beneficial to you and your process?  
T.J. WARREN: It was great for me. It prepared me for this level, and I'm
playing with a lot of great DivisionI players. Everybody was excited to play
DivisionI basketball. And it just prepared me a lot for this level.  
And anybody who is willing to take that route, I respect that.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for players? Gentlemen, congratulations
making the NCAA Tournament. Good luck tomorrow.  
Up next we'll have NC State's head coach Mark Gottfried.  
Introducing NC State's coach, Mark Gottfried. If you'll begin with an opening
statement, then we'll open up the floor to questions  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Our team is very excited to be here, and I'm excited for our
guys. We've got a lot of young guys and guys that hadn't played a lot of
college basketball.  
And so I feel like our players played their way into the tournament. So I'm
proud of them for that. Obviously we're going to play‑‑ everybody in the
tournament is obviously very good and a good team. So we've got a great
challenge playing Xavier.  
But our guys are excited. They've got a lot of enthusiasm and anxious to play.  
  
Q. What were your thoughts as you were watching the Selection Show and what
were you thinking was going to be the destination seating ‑wise or if your
team was going to be in the bracket? What was going through your mind at that
point?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Well, we weren't sure, obviously. We knew we were a team that
was close. But you just don't know exactly what the committee is thinking and
who it may come down to and what the deciding factors might be.  
But I did feel like we put ourselves in a position where we were in the
discussion.  
And the one thing I do believe in and I think over the years ‑‑ I've listened
to the committee members that have served on the committee, I've listened to
the chairs of the committee, and over and over again I've heard them say that
you gotta choose to play good teams in the nonconference.  
You obviously gotta win some games, but sometimes when it comes down to you're
trying to compare two teams that are both good, good teams, deserving teams,
the one thing that can separate that sometimes is how you chose to schedule
and did you win away from home and those type things.  
So even last year we had a group for two years at NC State. We had four
starters that started just about every game for a two‑year period, and we lost
that whole group. And there were times where I thought, boy, we might need to
really soften up the schedule and maybe play a little easier schedule and get
some‑‑ maybe some more wins.  
But in the end I always believed that if you got yourself in a position, kind
of like we were, right here, the schedule is one thing that can tilt things
into your favor.  
So I was hoping those things were going to come true for us as we watched the
show last night.  
  
Q. T.J.'s had a great year. From someone's who watched every play five
times, how good has he been?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: T.J.'s been spectacular. I think what I've enjoyed the most
is watching him mature and grow up. And we forget he's just a sophomore.  
And you look at how he's improved. And last year he was a really good freshman
player. He improved his foul shooting, improved his 3‑point shooting.  
He's improved his demeanor. He's matured. He's growing up. He's still a young
guy. And he's also learned how to accept the fact that he needs to play well
for us to have a chance, and he knows that.  
And sometimes that comes with maturity. Sometimes you're not ready to do that.
Like even the beginning of the year, we came up here and played Cincinnati, I
think our second game, and he wasn't comfortable all the way just yet with
that. I think as the season wore on, he began to be more comfortable.  
So he's had a terrific year. I think he's had an All‑American‑type year
obviously. He's been ACC Player of the Year, and he's deserved it because I
think he's played at a high level all year long.  
  
Q. When we asked coaches from leagues like Albany's about the First Four
they always say they prefer this event be just four games between at ‑large
schools, like yourselves, and they obviously want to let the 16 seeds just go
on to the second round. So I'm just wondering what your thoughts on that were,
how you feel about a change to the event to make it so it's just a game
between at‑large teams.   
COACH GOTTFRIED: You know, I don't know. I don't really care too much. I think
when you're in it, you're in it and you need to be excited about it.  
There are some college student‑athletes that never have the opportunity to
play in the greatest show on earth, whether it's Tuesday night or Thursday
night or whenever it might be.  
And so you cherish that. And I truly believe this is the greatest show on
earth in sports. I don't think there's anything like the NCAA Tournament.  
And I've got a son that's getting ready to play college basketball. He's
coming to your town, by the way, to play at Siena. I hope he gets to play one
day in the greatest show on earth. I don't care what night it is. I don't care
if it's the First Four. It's a great thing to be a part of.  
You've got to earn your way in. Teams are good. Everyone in it is deserving.
So I think that's the approach I have with it, and I'll be excited to play
whenever it may be or however they want to do it.  
  
Q. With the addition of Pitt and Syracuse in the ACC, how much tougher has
it made the conference, especially your schedule as it already was hard?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I think it just took a great league, made it greater. And we
get Louisville next year as well.  
So the emphasis and the commitment to basketball. All of our sports are
important. Football at our place is very important, baseball, all of our
sports.  
But basketball in this league, it's exciting. And you bring in some teams like
that that have made a commitment at their schools to be good, they want to be
in the tournament. They want to be in the Final Fours. They want to win
national championships. You're bringing that kind of a group into an already
great league, it does a lot.  
It helps your strength of schedule. It helps our strength of schedule in the
league. It makes it tough. Now you've gotta go play at Duke, at Carolina, at
Syracuse, at Louisville, or Notre Dame, Pitt, those kind of games, or play
them at home. It adds a lot to what is already, I think, a really difficult
schedule and a difficult league.  
  
Q. What are your impressions of Xavier and what do you think are some keys
for you guys in tomorrow's game?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I think they're really good. And I think in the games that
I've watched on tape, they really execute their offense really good. Semaj
Christon is a terrific player. He's a handful to try to stop because he
attacks you in so many different ways. He gets the ball in the break. He's
tough to guard there.  
They do so many things in the half court for him and some pick and roll things
and try to create mismatches.  
The big guy inside is as skilled and talented as a player that maybe we've
seen. He can really pass out of the post. I think that makes him dangerous,
because when the ball goes in there, they do a great job cutting and moving
and those things off of him.  
But Chris has done a great job with this team. They've got some guys I think
that have improved a lot. Guys I watched in high school and watching them now
saying, wow, they're better. So he's done a great job with them.  
  
Q. Anything for you guys?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I think when you get to this time of year, there's a lot of
things you want to take away from your opponent or expose maybe offensively.
But I think the most important thing is that you've gotta do what you do
really well.  
Like we've got to execute our offense really well. We've gotta defend them
with our principles.  
You only got one day to prepare, and so it's not like you're going to have a
thorough, full scouting report with your team where they're going to grasp
everything in one day.  
But you've gotta be fundamentally sound defensively in how we defend and how
we do things. But you've gotta execute your offense.  
John Wooden always used to tell me when I was out at UCLA: Your ability to
execute your offense from the top of the key to the baseline and your ability
to guard somebody from the top of the key to the baseline usually determines
how good you become.  
So for us this time of year we've gotta be good in those areas.  
  
Q. Despite your turnover, just the natural way things go with college
basketball, different team this year, but is it beneficial at all to be back
in the same venue where you started last year's tournament, any additional
comfort level?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: You know, I've been asked that a couple times. I don't think
so. Tyler, T.J., and Jordan, on our team, those three guys were here. We were
here. I don't get to play, so that doesn't help.  
But I don't think so, really. I think we have so many new young guys, this is
a new experience for them. We need to make sure that we're not just excited to
be here, because when you're young sometimes that's what happens, you just‑‑
you're so giddy that you're here.  
And we need to have some maturity about that, which I think our guys will. So
I don't know that there's a real advantage for us having been here last year.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach? Congratulations on making the
NCAA Tournament. Good luck.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Introducing the student‑athletes from Xavier, Isaiah Philmore,
Semaj Christon, Dee Davis, Justin Martin, and Matt Stainbrook.  
Congratulations on making the NCAA Tournament. I'd like to turn it over to
questions on the floor.  
  
Q. Matt, can you tell us how you're feeling with your knee and can you
explain what that cryogenic tank was that you were in the other day?  
MATT STAINBROOK: Yeah, I'm good to go, feeling okay, and I'll be all right for
the game.  
The cryo tank we got in, it was a nitrogen‑based‑‑ what it is, it pumped
nitrogen in to drop the temperature down to negative 300 degrees for
180seconds, so three minutes, and it gives you the same effect of like an ice
bath for 15 to 20 minutes except it does a little better for‑‑ sort of shocks
your system, so it helps it out that way. And it was something to help heal
and just refresh your legs.  
  
Q. What was that like?  
MATT STAINBROOK: It was really, really cold. It was tough. The first two
minutes weren't too bad. The last 60seconds definitely were tough.  
  
Q. Matt, Chris said yesterday he thought you would be better than you were
for the Marquette game physically. Can you just talk about comparing to how it
feels now today?  
MATT STAINBROOK: Yeah, I feel a ton better. Dave Fluker and Matt Jennings have
done a great job making sure I've used all the resources that are available to
me. And we've continued to run on the treadmill, the AlterG, try to stay in
shape. And the cryo spa we used, that was really cool.  
I think I've had a lot of time‑‑ a little more time than I did maybe to get my
legs back and feel a ton better.  
So, yeah, definitely I'd say I'm a lot better off than I was ready for the
Marquette game.  
  
Q. If you could each talk about what it's like to play here at the UD Arena
and be in the NCAA Tournament. Isaiah?  
ISAIAH PHILMORE: We played Dayton last year, so we're kind of familiar with
the arena, when it comes to shooting and the background and everything, when
it comes to the atmosphere.  
So, I mean, I'm really excited to be in the tournament. It's my first time,
first go‑around. And we're looking to make some noise.  
SEMAJ CHRISTON: I feel pretty much the same way. Like Isaiah said, we played
here last year. The arena is crazy when a lot of people are in the gym. So
just ready to play them. Ready to shock the world.  
DEE DAVIS: I agree with both my teammates, but, I mean, in the tournament it
doesn't matter where you play at, doesn't matter where we play at, I just want
to play.  
JUSTIN MARTIN: I'm just ready.  
MATT STAINBROOK: I never played here before. I came and watched these guys
play last year. I'm just excited to have an opportunity to be in the NCAA
Tournament, and I know our guys are really excited and that one thing that
won't be lacking in the game tomorrow is definitely energy.  
  
Q. Matt, how much of your decision to transfer here was the chance the play
in the NCAA Tournament?  
MATT STAINBROOK: A lot of it. That was a big appeal for coming to Xavier
University. They had the track record that showed they're getting to the
tournament over and over again.  
That's something I wanted to do. Now that we have the opportunity to do it,
it's kind of surreal. You get in here and you're just like, wow, looking
around, kind of just sightseeing. But we know we have to be locked in for
tomorrow.  
  
Q. I know you've answered it before, but not when I was around. How much
have you changed your body and changed as a player in two years since you were
last seen?  
MATT STAINBROOK: A ton. A lot of credit to Xavier University for doing that.
I've lost a lot of weight. I've matured a little bit. Still have a little more
maturing to do.  
But overall it's just been a drastic change for me from the things I eat to
how I work out. And definitely the cast around me. So it's all benefitting me
in a great way.  
  
Q. Isaiah, we talked to you about 24 hours ago. Can you talk about what you
guys have been doing in the last 24 hours and what kind of crash course you've
gotten on NC State?  
ISAIAH PHILMORE: In the last 24 hours, you know, we had walk‑throughs,
shootaround and practice, watched some film to get more familiar with NC
State.  
You know, when you find out you're going to play on a Tuesday on a Sunday, the
only thing you can do is really get in the gym and try to get ready for your
opponent.  
When it comes to NC State, they're more of a driving team than a shooting team
like Creighton. So that's good for us, because it didn't turn out well against
Creighton.  
Other than that, we were just getting ready to play.  
  
Q. You guys talked about the building itself. But what do you expect from
the crowd tomorrow night? It's not going to be as hostile as when you played
Dayton here, but do you think the neutral fans will get behind NC State, or do
you think you'll have a lot of blue up here as well?  
ISAIAH PHILMORE: I think we're going to have a lot of blue, but the neutral
fans around here are probably going to be on NC State's side. So, I mean, we
have away games like that, so it shouldn't really affect us.  
SEMAJ CHRISTON: I feel the same way. We have a lot of Xavier fans here, but I
know a couple of Dayton fans will be here yelling at us. It is what it is.  
DEE DAVIS: Yeah, playing in the Dayton game, you expect that from the Dayton
fans if you play Xavier. But I'm more so looking forward to the Xavier
support.  
JUSTIN MARTIN: I don't know who is going to be here, but I know these guys and
the rest of the people in the locker room, we're going to be ready to play.  
MATT STAINBROOK: Yeah, I'm not sure whether we'll have big‑‑ a lot of red fans
out there, but I think Xavier Nation will do a good job coming out. And,
regardless, we have a team full of warriors. When you challenge a warrior, a
warrior responds.  
  
Q. Dee, given the standard that was set here and now making the tournament
last year, how satisfying is it to be back?  
DEE DAVIS: It could have been a lot more satisfying if we didn't have to play
the first game, but just being in the tournament is great. We're excited as a
team, and we're doing as much as we can to prepare for this game.  
  
Q. Semaj, you know T.J. from your time at Brewster. What did you get out of
Brewster? How did you improve on and off the court?  
SEMAJ CHRISTON: I improved. I improved in a lot of things, just growing up and
knowing that you're not always going to be the best player on the court.  
We had five or six players that can do‑‑ score whenever they want to score.
You have to play a role and be happy with winning. We was winning all the
time, so I couldn't complain.  
I think coming from Brewster, that was the biggest thing for me is just
knowing you're not going to be the best all the time; you just work as hard as
you can trying to do what you can.  
  
Q. The question for everyone, excluding Matt: What's the transition been
like switching over from the A ‑10 all the way over to the Big East now?  
ISAIAH PHILMORE: Well, the Big East has‑‑ I mean, the transition, there's
competition everywhere. But obviously when you're going to the Big East, you
expect a little bit of tougher teams physically, you know, more athletic
teams.  
That's really what I would say the biggest thing is. Because the A‑10, the
fans are just as wild as the Big East fans. So I would definitely just say
more physical and the athleticism.  
SEMAJ CHRISTON: I say you have a big game every night. Every night it's going
to be a show. So you don't know what's going to happen. Just gotta come out
there and play.  
DEE DAVIS: Like Semaj said, every game is a big game. It's going to be
competitive, but if you look at the A‑10, they have a lot of teams in the
tournament as well. College basketball has been great this year.  
JUSTIN MARTIN: I kind of don't like when people ask that question because I
feel basketball is basketball. No matter where you play at or who you're
playing against, it's still basketball. They tie their shoes up just like us.
So we just gotta come and compete.  
  
Q. Dee, how much were the last couple of days beneficial to you in terms of
healing a little bit? You seemed pretty banged up in the Marquette game.  
DEE DAVIS: Very beneficial. It's quick turnaround, so I'm doing everything I
can, like Matt, to get ready.  
  
Q. Did you do the cryo tank?  
DEE DAVIS: I did get in the cryo tank. I'm not a big fan of cold. My three
minutes were a lot longer than his three minutes.  
  
Q. T.J. Warren is one of the great scorers in college basketball. I'm sure
you've seen videos of him. What are your impressions of him and what's going
to be your defensive approach?  
ISAIAH PHILMORE: He's a player that can score in bunches from anywhere. So
basically just try to contain him as much as we can. We can't allow it to be a
one‑on‑one matchup. It has to be a one‑on‑five. You have to limit him from
driving to the paint and shooting his floaters or jump shots, stepbacks,
anything like that.  
SEMAJ CHRISTON: He pretty much can do anything. He scores the ball in
different ways. But it's not just going to be one‑on‑one. It's going to be
five of us. So at the end of the day it's going to be one‑on‑five. He'll have
to score‑‑ he'll have to beat all of us; it's not just going to be one guy.  
DEE DAVIS: Very much agree. We've played players in the past‑‑ Doug McDermott,
for example. He's a one‑man show, but he's got people around him that's
helping him out. So we just try to crowd the floor as much as we can and make
it tough.  
JUSTIN MARTIN: I agree.  
MATT STAINBROOK: Like all these guys reiterated, you just try to crowd the
floor for him. You know he's going to get shots up and score points, too. You
just try to limit them as much as possible.  
  
Q. One other question, what happened at the end of the season? You lost
three of the last four. Was it just who you played and when you played them,
or was it you or was it them? What was it?  
MATT STAINBROOK: Had a very tough schedule. We were banged up a little bit. We
played some very good teams in Villanova and Creighton. Faltered a little bit
Seton Hall, too.  
But overall we're not looking to the past anymore; looking more to the future.
And we're excited about the game tomorrow.  
JUSTIN MARTIN: It was just a tough schedule. No excuses or explanations, but
we just gotta be able to get stops. Anytime we're able to get stops down the
stretch, we are usually good at closing out games. And we weren't able to do
that those couple of games. So anytime we can do that, we'll be all right.  
DEE DAVIS: I believe we did enough to get here to where we're at now, and I
think we're just moving forward. That was the goal at the beginning of the
year, make it to the NCAA Tournament, and that's where we're at.  
SEMAJ CHRISTON: Like Matt said, it's a new season. Tomorrow starts something
new for us. So I don't really think we're thinking about how we finished out
the season. Tomorrow starts a new day.  
ISAIAH PHILMORE: I agree with my teammates. You know, it doesn't matter what
we did the last five games, doesn't matter if we lost all five games because
it's a new season and we're going to come out tomorrow ready to play and ready
to give it all we have, leave it all out on the court.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student‑athletes? All right. Thank
you, gentlemen. Good luck tomorrow.  
Up next we'll have Xavier head coach Chris Mack. He'll start out with an
opening statement and then we'll open up the floor for questions.  
COACH MACK: When you go to a restaurant with your wife, you don't sit on the
same side of the booth, so I'm going to have a little space here.  
THE MODERATOR: Begin with an opening statement.  
COACH MACK: We're tremendously excited to kick off the NCAA Tournament here
tomorrow night. We think, as our players alluded to, we feel like we've earned
it. Played a very tough schedule. And this is what you worked for all year.  
We have a huge challenge in NC State. They're a good team. They're playing
their best basketball of the year down the stretch.  
T.J. Warren is a scoring machine. And we're going to have to do a great job
not only on T.J. but the rest of their team.  
  
Q. Coach, we were talking to Matt and Dee about that cryo tank and some of
the treatments. And I'm kind of intrigued about that. Could you talk more
about that, and is that something new that you guys are using?  
COACH MACK: Yeah, just had a person reach out and say that this is, you know,
a way to sort of expedite getting iced after practice, after games, and so we
just felt like we would try it out.  
This time of year guys are trying to heal up a lot of bumps and bruises along
the way, and we've been going at it since mid‑September. And certainly Matt
and Dee have been battling injuries. Obviously Matt's a little more severe
than Dee.  
But, again, anything that our training staff can do, they'll do. And they'll
turn over every rock to try to figure out what they can do to put our players
in the best position possible to play on game night.  
  
Q. What has Matt brought to your program, not just your rotation?  
COACH MACK: Tremendous work ethic. High character kid. Kid who wants to win. I
think when you talk specifically about his play on the floor, one of the very
few post players in America that wants to be in the post that can pass equally
as well as he can score.  
And I think he's just scratching the surface. It's been well documented how
much weight he's lost in the last year. But I feel like when this year ends,
Matt's going to put just as much hard work, effort, perspiration in this
coming offseason so he can be one of the best centers in all college
basketball.  
You know, he's the smartest kid on our team. He's probably smarter than any
coach on the coaching staff, and at times he tries to tell us that. But Matt
has to understand coaches and then players.  
But I've really enjoyed having Matt in our program. He's a great kid.  
  
Q. Coach, the players addressed playing here in Dayton and the experience
and that ties in with the crowd as well. Could you just address that?  
COACH MACK: I'm sure it's going to be a little bit oil and vinegar tomorrow
night. You're going to have a large contingent of Xavier fans that are going
to make their way up 75.  
We have a tremendous fan base, very loyal fan base, hopefully a very loud one
tomorrow night. And I'm sure they'll be sprinkled in some Dayton fans that
will give us their warm welcome, but that's okay.  
I think it's going to make for a great environment. I'd rather play in a
supercharged atmosphere than a hollow one, and we're going to have that
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. T.J. Warren gets the lion's share of the publicity, as well he should,
ACC Player of the Year, but what does Ralston Turner bring to the team and
what does he add to the complement?  
COACH MACK: He's a tremendous shooter. Coach Gottfried does an excellent job
of getting him free on screening actions. He can change the game. Just two or
three consecutive possessions they're going to free him up for two or three
3s, and the next thing you know you're down ten points.  
When he's playing well and shooting at a high level, they're a different team.
So it's a huge challenge.  
He's not a small kid. He's got great size. He's got a very quick release. He's
a big challenge.  
  
Q. Semaj has had a great year. How good from your perspective has his year
been?  
COACH MACK: He's had a very, very good year. I mean, to me he's one of the
best guards in the country in transition. He does a great job of getting in
the lane. I think he's extremely hard to keep out of the lane.  
He makes the right play almost every single time. He draws contact well. He
finishes through contact. I think his shooting has been much improved. Earlier
in the year he wasn't shooting free throws as well as he is now.  
But down the stretch, I'd say over the last 15 or so games, he's won us games
at the free‑throw line. And, then again, he's not a one‑way player. He plays
defense. He takes just as much pride on the defensive end as he does the
offensive end. Had a huge steal in our Providence win at home against Bryce
Cotton that sealed the game.  
To me he's one of the best players in the country, and I know he's anxious to
play in this tournament.  
  
Q. NC State seems like it's a very different team compared to your last
opponent, Creighton. But do they remind you of anyone else that you've played
this season?  
COACH MACK: I don't really get into comparisons. We take each team for what
they're worth. And I do know that NC State is playing their best basketball of
the year. They have a lot of young kids, and so usually that takes time.  
T.J. Warren has really started to‑‑ I don't want to say put it together, but
he's had some unbelievable nights at Pittsburgh, to have 40‑plus games. We
know that he's going to be extremely difficult to guard. They're going to put
him in the long post. They're going to put him in iso situations, he's going
to try to draw fouls.  
But it's one thing if you have only one or two talented players. NC State has
really, really good guard play. They have big guys that go off the offensive
glass.  
So I don't really compare teams. We just know it's going to be a challenge.
Anytime you make the NCAA Tournament, whether you're us, you're NC State,
whether you're Florida, whoever, you're a good team, and you're very capable
on any given night.  
  
Q. Overall, just how do you see the matchup? What do you think it will boil
down to?  
COACH MACK: Well, I think it's a good matchup. We have to keep them off the
glass. We're going to have to be prepared for different types of defenses.  
I know Coach Gottfried throughout the course of the year showing several
different defenses, whether it's man to man, which is primarily what they play
in the ACC tournament.  
But they'll quickly go to a 2‑3, they'll go to a diamond and 1. We can expect
that with Semaj being out there.  
But, again, I think what tournament play comes down to is being yourself, not
getting rattled by the environment, making sure that at least from our
standpoint we're the same team that limits you to one shot.  
We've led the Big East in rebounding differential. If we want to advance in
tournament play, we've gotta be that same team tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, I asked some of the guys this earlier. What was it like for that
transition for you guys moving from the A ‑10 to playing in the Big East this
year?  
COACH MACK: I think Justin Martin said it best: Basketball is basketball.
There's some terrific teams in the Atlantic 10 as evidenced by the number of
teams that got in the NCAA Tournament.  
It's really hard to compare leagues, per se. I would tell you that physically
there's greater size in the Big East, but in terms of skill level and talent,
it really depends on who you play.  
And, for instance, you look at UMass, they're a completely different type of
team than St. Louis but yet they're both really, really good.  
I think what's been really great from our standpoint is the round‑robin feel
of our conference. Much has gotten lost in the 14‑team, 16‑team leagues.
There's no equity. There's no equality. We play everybody home and away. By
the time we got to the conference tournament, anybody that played one another,
they were playing for a third time.  
So I think over time our league's going to have some great rivalries that are
going to be built in overtime.  
  
Q. Semaj knows T.J. from Brewster. You've had a lot of success with guys
from Brewster, different prep schools, high school all ‑star teams, various
levels. What do you think guys get out of that experience?  
COACH MACK: I think they get, number one, the ability, an opportunity to live
away from home. And those schools, especially up in the New England prep
school system, are really good academic schools. Those kids have to go to
study hall. They're taking tough classes. They have to balance the fact that
they're away from home. It's a mini college experience.  
And so when they get to an Xavier, an NC State, I think they're better
equipped to make that transition.  
I think a lot of kids that just go straight from high school, where they go
home and watch cartoons with Mom and Dad at the house, it's quite an
adjustment.  
And I think guys like T.J. Warren, Jalen Reynolds, Semaj Christon, Myles
Davis, guys that have that prep experience are better because of it.  
  
Q. Did you ever worry about losing Semaj during his year?  
COACH MACK: Well, we didn't have him before he came out, so when he was a
senior at Winton Woods, that's when we began recruiting Semaj. He made his
decision at that time that he was going to go on to a fifth year, a prep
school year. And so he committed to us in the summer right before he went off
to Brewster. So but, yeah, you always worry.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach?  
Thank you, Coach. Good luck tomorrow.  
COACH MACK: Thank you.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Introducing Mount St. Mary's Sam Prescott, Rashad Whack, and
Julian Norfleet.  
Gentlemen, congratulations on making the NCAA Tournament. Open the floor to
questions.  
  
Q. Any of you, you guys opened up 0 ‑5, played some good teams, but was
there any possibility in your mind at that point that you could reach the
juncture you're at now?  
JULIAN NORFLEET: You know, we started off the season, we never looked towards
the end of the season. We just focused on improving every day. So when we
started off 0‑5, we knew we had to play some great teams. And we knew if we
kept improving, we would be able to get to our goal at the end of the season.  
RASHAD WHACK: Same as he said. We knew we wanted to have a tough nonconference
schedule to prepare us for our conference. So I think even though we lost, we
learned a lot from those games and prepared us for our journey.  
SAM PRESCOTT: Just growing pains, you know. Young team, got a lot of freshmen,
so we have to get them prepared for a nonconference schedule. So starting out
tough. It wasn't easy, but it paid dividends.  
How much fun is it to just shoot the 3s? Seems like you guys love to shoot
3‑pointers.  
SAM PRESCOTT: We do like to shoot 3s. Big part of our offense. We've got a lot
of players who can spread the floor for us, and then Julian, being one of the
best point guards in the league ‑‑ in our conference, or even in the nation,
if you want to, can find us. That's a big weapon we have.  
RASHAD WHACK: Like he said, we like to shoot them. And it's fun. Our coach
definitely like gives us the green light to shoot shots we feel we should
take. And just having that freedom definitely helps us offensively attacking,
getting in the paint. And then once that opens up and people collapse, just
shoot the wide‑open 3.  
JULIAN NORFLEET: Like Rashad said, Coach gives us a lot of freedom to play. He
usually gives us the green light. So it makes it easy for us, where we're
really trusting each other and we're able to just spread the ball out. When
teams fly at us, we're able to drive the basket. It makes the game a lot
easier when we're all hitting 3s.  
  
Q. It's one thing to get to the tournament, it's another one to win one.
Neither team has won a NCAA Tournament game. What do you think it would mean
for your program if you finally won on the big stage?  
JULIAN NORFLEET: I mean, it would mean a lot. I think it would bring a lot of
exposure to our university, small school. So to get a big win in the NCAA
Tournament, you know, it brings a lot of exposure. It would be a great feeling
as well.  
RASHAD WHACK: Definitely be a great feeling. Our program will definitely be
going in the right direction over the past two years. So just to get a win and
get that experience and that exposure, definitely great for our program.  
SAM PRESCOTT: Tremendous honor getting to this point in our careers.
Especially being the seniors, we haven't been able to get here. So to win here
for The Mount would be tremendous for us.  
  
Q. Because your record is 16 ‑16, do you guys think you're getting the
respect you should get? You are in the NCAA Tournament.   
RASHAD WHACK: As far as respect, I mean, we are a mid low major team, so a lot
of teams look down on us. But we don't pay attention to that. We try to stay
together and focus on what we need to do to get better and just work on it,
preparing us for the game.  
SAM PRESCOTT: The same as Rashad said, we can get glossed over sometime. We're
not one of the bigger schools, but we just take the challenge. We're always
open for the challenge. If they doubt it, it makes it even sweeter when we're
here.  
JULIAN NORFLEET: You know, for the most part, as a team, we don't really focus
on the outside sources and stuff like that, so the respect thing doesn't
really come into play. We just focus on whatever is in that locker room and go
out and execute what we're taught.  
  
Q. Can you allow ‑‑ I realize that the big thing is the game tomorrow night.
But do you ever, even in your wildest dreams, think, boy, if we get through
that, then we're playing the No. 1 overall seed in Florida, no less?  
JULIAN NORFLEET: You definitely think about that. You think about going in and
trying to win the game tomorrow. And if you win that, you go and go up against
a monster like Florida, who is an outstanding team. They've got the overall
No. 1 seed.  
But you've got to win the first game, which is tomorrow, against Albany.
That's all our focus is on right now.  
RASHAD WHACK: We like to talk about standing in the now, hopefully get past
the game tomorrow. And facing Florida is definitely going to be a tough game,
but we also accept that challenge.  
SAM PRESCOTT: Take it one day at a time. Can't get too far in the future, even
if it is Florida. But it starts tomorrow, winning a game.  
  
Q. Did any of you guys watch the Albany ‑Stony Brook game on Saturday? And
even if you didn't, what do you know about Albany now?  
SAM PRESCOTT: What we know about Albany, did a little film, a little research.
I bet some of my teammates have looked over them. They're almost the complete
opposite of us, a slow‑tempo team. I think they're 61 possessions; we're 71.
So ten possessions off . They're going to try to slow the game down and pound
the post. They've got some good big men down low, and they'll try to slow the
game down and grind it out as we're going to try to speed it up.  
I'm interested to see whose will will be imposed on the game.  
RASHAD WHACK: I haven't got a chance to see them play. We got a chance to see
some film earlier today like Sam said.  
Like he said, it's complete opposite. They're slow, kind of bigger, a little
more physical, but we have speed and make the tempo a lot faster, get them out
of their comfort zone.  
JULIAN NORFLEET: I remember I played them my freshman and sophomore year. I
didn't get a chance to watch the game. But they're playing totally different
from the film we saw so far. So definitely they're a lot slower and they're
going to try to slow the game down, and we've got to just try to speed them
up.  
  
Q. Rashad and Sam, you guys have played for three different coaches in your
collegiate career. What's it like playing for Coach Christian?  
RASHAD WHACK: It's been a great honor and experience to be able to come in
here and witness the change that the program has made. And just being able to
help, it's been a great pleasure and I'm just very blessed to be in this
situation.  
SAM PRESCOTT: Playing for Coach has been an honor. He's a very upbeat guy.
Nothing but positive vibes coming from him. Coming from Marist and playing for
‑‑ under Burke it's complete different a lot more energy, exciting guy to be
around.  
  
Q. A lot of people put down the trip to Dayton and the First Four, it's a
play ‑in they call it or whatever. They don't even think of it as being a main
part of the tournament. But tomorrow night you guys are going to be playing in
the NCAA Tournament; you're the only game being played at that time. Just how
big of a stage is that? Are you concerned at all you'll be nervous or anything
like that?  
JULIAN NORFLEET: Everybody gets those pregame jitters before a game. I
wouldn't say it's nervousness or anything like that; I would just say it's a
little bit of excitement, anxiousness.  
But being on that national stage, it's an honor. Just took a lot of hard work
to get here.  
We're just going to take it step‑by‑step and hope we can come out with a win.  
RASHAD WHACK: Like he said, some people will be a little nervous. And we like
to try to keep a steady like emotional not too high, not too low, so
concentrate on that.  
And it's going to be an opportunity for us to showcase our talent, so we're
just going to go out there and play our game and do what we have to do.  
SAM PRESCOTT: I wouldn't say we were nervous. I think we're all excited, you
know, especially us seniors because we've never been here before. And now it's
a bigger stage to showcase our skills. I think that we'll be ready for the
challenge.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for players? Good luck, gentlemen. Thank
you for your time.  
Up next will be Mount St. Mary's head coach Jamion Christian.  
Introducing Mount St. Mary's head coach, Jamion Christian.  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Thanks so much. We're excited to be here in Dayton to open up
college basketball's March Madness.  
Well, obviously tremendous year in all of college basketball. 68 teams were
chosen yesterday. All very deserving of a chance to continue to play for a
national championship.  
The Mount, we're excited to be here to represent the Northeast Conference. We
had a great league tournament, and we're very excited to be here and play.
We're highlighted by three seniors: Julian Norfleet, Sam Prescott, and Rashad
Whack.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions up in the front.  
  
Q. You guys play a lot different than Albany. You want to play fast; they
want to play slow. What happens when those two meet?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Mayhem meets. Well, you know, quite honestly, I've watched
Albany a lot through the past few years. I was assistant at Bucknell when I
played them, and I just have so much respect for their program. They've done
an unbelievable job over the years.  
They've always played a physical style of basketball. They've always had one
or two guys that could stretch the defense, but never too many, and they've
always played under control and with a lot of pace.  
I remember from our game we played them way back then, that they really
dominated the pace with their physicality and ability to rebound the ball.  
So our number one thing, coming in now, is that we've got to get the tempo to
an insane level, insane pace. Really make it difficult for them to get the
ball inbounds. And we've got to play really good offense, but it has to be
early in the shot clock to get the pace at the level we need it at.  
  
Q. When you were 0 ‑5, was it difficult at all to not lose the younger guys,
in particular, just to tell them that, hey, look, we'll get through this;
there's stuff we can still accomplish?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: I'm a really positive, upbeat person. And I think when you
take over a program, you have to understand there's going to be some highs and
lows. You're not going to be in the NCAA Tournament right away.  
I think we've been able to get here over the last two years because we have
great senior leadership.  
And one of the things we've tried to do over the past two years is we try to
coach each one of our guys very differently. We try to take a lot of time
understanding their strengths and weaknesses, and we try to coach them to play
through their strengths and weaknesses.  
Again, there's going to be some highs and lows with that. We opened up the
season with a very tough schedule. One of the things I learned from Pat
Flannery at Bucknell and Shaka Smart from VCU is that if you're going to be
good in March, you have to challenge yourself and can't be afraid to take some
bumps and some bruises and get back up.  
I thought that our tough nonconference schedule has really helped us later
here in the season. Being able to beat Robert Morris and Wagner on the road,
and they're two of the best defensive teams in our league, but we played very
well against them because we played at BYU, we played at Villanova and West
Virginia and Michigan State. I thought that stuff really helped us as we began
to grow as a program.  
  
Q. Going into your conference tournament and also when Albany was going into
their conference tournament, the way the seed was, neither of you were
expected to be here. What does it say about each team; that they were able to
beat a higher seed on their home floor to get to the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: It says that both programs have a lot of character and a lot
of substance. I think the reality of it is, you know, when you go on the road
in a conference tournament setting‑‑ and one‑bid leagues, the reality if
you're in a one‑bid league, all the pressure is in the tournament. Because if
you don't win, you're not making it in.  
So both teams have a lot of character to be able to go on the other team's
home floor and play against the best opponents.  
They beat a very good Stony Brook team. They've just been unbelievable for the
last three seasons. It says how good they are, and it says they're very tough,
mentally tough and physically tough. It says they can go into a conference
opponent and be able to exert their will onto another opponent.  
  
Q. Is this just as simple as speed against physicality, outside shooting
against inside shooting?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: I would say it's probably as simple as that. I'm looking at
it as it's a battle of wills between two teams that have both earned their way
into this tournament and that both have a distinct style that they like to
play.  
  
Q. When people say, oh, they're 16 ‑16, they must not be any good but
they're in the NCAA Tournament, what do you say to them?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: I say there's 68 teams that have an opportunity to play for a
national championship. And we're one of them.  
And I think being 16‑16 means we try to challenge ourselves. It means we're
not afraid to fall down sometimes and get back up. I mean, it could have been
very easy for us to schedule six really easy opponents at the beginning of the
year.  
So I sort of look at it like we're 16‑10 on the year against opponents that
are like us. And so that would mean we'd have a very good season, if people
looked at it that way.  
So you can look at it 16‑16\. The reality of it is we're going to get a chance
to open up college basketball tomorrow night, to put on an excellent game to
start March Madness. And we have an opportunity, like the other 68 teams do,
to play for that trophy at the end.  
  
Q. Obviously you've scouted Albany. What players on their team impress
you?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Hooley is excellent, his ability to shoot the ball from the
outside and his ability to get hot. They do a great job ‑‑ because they don't
play a high‑tempo game, they do a great job of screening for him, getting him
open. We have to know where he is all the time.  
One of the things, the way we press a guy like that can sometimes find some
open looks. So you've got to really key on him defensively.  
The kid on the inside, Rowley, is really talented as well. Really versatile.  
I think that's the key, is, you know, you're looking at a 4‑man there that can
stretch out and knock down a 15‑footer but is also very physical in the glass.
And there's not a lot of guys in college basketball that do that. I bet if you
went through the tournament, you'd only find eight to nine guys that can knock
down that shot and be physical. Those two guys can be really tough defensive
matchups.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach? Coach, good luck tomorrow.
Sorry, one more.  
  
Q. If you don't shoot the 3 ‑ball well tomorrow, are you in trouble?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: I don't think so. I think we are‑‑ actually, we're 8‑2, I
believe, when we make seven or less 3s. So it's not all about 3‑point shooting
for us. The 3‑pointer is more of a weapon to allow the pace to get to a level
we need it to be at.  
We have four guards also very skilled, and they shoot a high percentage from
2. And we're one of the better teams making it to the free throw line and
making free throws, the number one free‑throw shooting team in our league.  
So it's a little bit more than just knocking down outside shots, although we
do love the 3‑point shot and we're going to use that. And hopefully we knock
some down early to kind of get us going.  
But I think the biggest thing is when you play a team that has such a physical
prowess, we've got to really try to get into the paint and make them chase us
down with our speed. If that ends up being layups or pullups, we'll take
those. Most likely it will end up being in attacking from the 3‑point line.  
  
Q. Albany's coach says the team with the most Australians will probably
win.  
COACH CHRISTIAN: One of the things he's done an unbelievable job of‑‑ much
respect to him. Over his time, I think early on when they had a lot of success
they had some JUCO guys on the inside that are very physical and very
talented, and now they have some Australian guys that are very physical and
talented.  
I think that's a lot of credit to him, of his ability to go out and find the
best players for his program, and that's going to be able to put Albany at the
top.  
Again, I really respect him for that because there's not a lot of guys in this
business that‑‑ they were unbelievable back there in like the mid‑2000s or so,
but now he's been able to rebuild it back up with guys he can really coach.  
And you've got to give a lot of respect for someone that can have that kind
of‑‑ have that kind of ability throughout the course of the career.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Congratulations on making the tournament.
Good luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST ROUND:
DAYTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+ROUND%3A+DAYTON)

  

## March 17, 2014

  

### [Will Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25160)

### [Peter Hooley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26760)

### [Sam Rowley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25163)

  
_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
Q. When you're O and 5, was it anything you dreamt could happen? I realize
you played good teams to start, but to be here, did you think there was any
possibility this could be?  
PETER HOOLEY: We pride ourselves on always believing we can win any game we
can play. We know that in our conference we can play with any team on any
given night.  
So we kept harping on that, knowing when it came down to it, we were going to
be playing our best basketball at the right time, and that's what we managed
to do.  
  
Q. For both of you, last year you drew Duke in the NCAA Tournament and
really no one gave you a chance at all, and not many 2s will lose to a 15. Is
it better, you think, now that you're in this play, and even though a lot of
people don't like to be here, thinking it's not the real tournament ‑‑ no
offense to Dayton‑‑ but is there more of a chance to win a game, do you think
it's a better situation, do you think?  
SAM ROWLEY: Sure, absolutely. We're not playing a 2 seed or a 1 seed, we're
playing a team who is far more similar to us in terms of their record and in
the same ballpark of us, in terms of talent.  
So it's a very realistic game for us to win.  
PETER HOOLEY: As he said, it's a great opportunity for us to get our program's
first win in the NCAA Tournament. It's still a game that other teams wish they
were probably still playing if they had a chance, eight other teams would
probably want to trade spots with us if they could.  
And it just gives us a chance to get that win, really.  
  
Q. It's one thing to get into the tournament; it's another thing to actually
win and have your name out there a lot. What would it mean? Both these
programs are trying to win their first NCAA Tournament game. What would it
mean to actually go to that next level and win a game in this?  
SAM ROWLEY: It would be huge. That's the next step for our program. It's as
simple as that. We've been to the tournament a few times before but never won
a game. So that's the next logical step for us and that's our goal for this
game.  
PETER HOOLEY: It's a tremendous opportunity for everybody involved. It's been
a great run for us over these last couple of weeks and we're really excited to
try and continue that tomorrow night.  
  
Q. You guys have had a little time to find out something about Mount St.
Mary's. We know they shoot the 3 very well. When they shoot the 3, they're
very good. And you guys have had some games where teams have really crushed
you with 3 ‑point shooting. How much of a conscious effort will it be to make
sure it doesn't happen for you tomorrow?  
PETER HOOLEY: We know they're shooting 3 at a high rate. One through four
starters can let it go at any time and fill up the stat sheet pretty quick.  
We have to know that we have to run them off the 3‑point line and make them
uncomfortable with what they want to do. So that's our big goal going into
tomorrow. And they also like to press up and down the court a lot, so we have
to make sure we control tempo and try to play our style of game.  
SAM ROWLEY: Yeah, just going on from what Peter said, trying to run them off
the 3‑point line is a huge part of our game plan. And also just they play very
high‑tempo, high‑pace style of basketball.  
So we're just going to try to slow them down, take our time getting shots, and
just sort of take them out of their game.  
  
Q. For both of you, it would be a big thrill to win a game in the NCAA
Tournament. You're constellation prize is to win the No. 1 overall seed. If
you do win. I don't want to get you ahead of yourselves. But could you talk
about what ‑‑ you get up to play a game and then you have a quick turnaround
on Thursday and have to go to Florida's home state if you do win.   
SAM ROWLEY: If we do win, getting up to play the No. 1 team in the country in
the atmosphere that that game will be in will not be hard.  
Those guys are the highest calibers some of us will ever play against. And
it's not an effort to get up for that in the context that it will be in that
arena.  
PETER HOOLEY: Yeah, I think if that happens to be the case, with the short
turnaround, in our conference tournament we showed that in 24 hours we could
really concentrate and focus on what we needed to accomplish going into a big
game against Vermont.  
So I'm sure we'd get the best game plan possible as quickly as possible from
the coaches and be well prepared going into that game.  
  
Q. We know both of you guys are from Australia, Sam, and your family I guess
is coming over. And, Peter, you said that for the Stony Brook game your family
gathered to watch like, what, 2:00 in the morning. Sam, can you talk about
where your parents are at right now and why they decided to come and, Peter,
what the plans are for your family for this game?  
SAM ROWLEY: With my parents, it's just any excuse to get out of work, I think.
But they have a week to come over here and watch us play, me and my brother on
the team. So it just makes sense. It's such a great opportunity for us, and
they want to see us in that setting.  
But I think they just arrived like about now in LAX, so they'll be flying‑‑ in
Dallas, actually, and they'll be making their way here. They didn't even know
where we were playing when they left. So they just found out. And they should
be on their way here soon.  
PETER HOOLEY: I think my parents and family probably will do the same thing.
They might switch out whose house it's at, but they'll go down whatever time
the game is in the morning, they'll all crowd around there in support. And my
mom always sends me photos of everyone crowded around together, so I see that
afterwards. That's always a nice feeling. Not ‑‑ would be great to have them
here, but some things just can't happen.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for players?  
Okay. Congratulations on making the NCAA Tournament. Good luck.  
Introducing the head coach of the University of Albany, Will Brown.
Congratulations on making the NCAA Tournament. If you would like to start out
with an opening statement.  
COACH BROWN: We're excited to be in the NCAA Tournament for the second year in
a row. It's a tremendous accomplishment. Very proud of my players and my
coaching staff. Wonderful opportunity for our university and our athletic
department.  
A lot of people are involved in the success of our program, and we're going to
try to do our best to represent those people, represent the city of Albany,
and we're going to play extremely hard tomorrow night against a very good
opponent in Mount St. Mary's. And we'll enjoy that two‑hour spotlight and give
it our best shot.  
But we're really looking forward to it and we're excited to be here.  
  
Q. The school's come close to winning before in the NCAA Tournament and
played well. What are the benefits from winning in the tournament, from
actually getting a first win?  
COACH BROWN: Well, we've run into some tough opponents. This is our first trip
to the NCAA Tournament. You know, we played‑‑ in'06 we played UConn, who was
the best overall team, and we were tied with about five and a half minutes to
go in a 1‑16 game and we ran out of gas.  
In 2007 we played against Virginia, co‑regular champions in the ACC, and I
think maybe we were a little overconfident because of how way we played the
year before when I think we made one of our first 18 shots and the game was
over, and then we really challenged Duke last year.  
This is an opportunity for us to win an NCAA Tournament game against a very
good opponent who is playing really well right now, a well‑coached team and
I'm sure Coach Christian feels that Mount St. Mary's has just a good of an
opportunity right now as well.  
Whoever wins the game will have to play really good basketball 40 minutes and
we're excited to have this opportunity, and it will mean a tremendous amount
to our university athletic department and program if we can get an NCAA
Tournament win.  
  
Q. How much of an edge do you think Mount St. Mary's has because they've had
more time in between games, even though they only found out they were playing
you yesterday?  
COACH BROWN: Well, we both have the same amount of prep time. I think they've
had a lot more rest than we have. We've been going with what I call the iron
seven. We've been playing seven guys.  
I think it can work both ways. You can be well rested and that can help you,
but you can also have so much time off having not played in a game in a while
that it could take you a while to get going again.  
The one thing we've done is after we won on Saturday, we wanted to make sure
that our guys were, number one, well prepared for this game but also well
rested for this game.  
We have to have fresh legs, and I think that we've tried to do a good job
making sure our guys are going to be able to compete at a high level tomorrow,
because they're going to be focused and they're going to be well rested.  
So we're looking forward to the opportunity. So if we win, it's tremendous. If
we don't win, it's not going to be because we played on Saturday, it's going
to be because Mount St. Mary's played better than us, and hopefully that does
not happen.  
  
Q. Is there one particular area, one particular statistic that you feel you
have to do very well in and/or is perhaps something that they do that you need
to hold them down on?  
COACH BROWN: I think the team with the most Australians is going to win. No.
All kidding aside, I think this is going to be a game of tempo. They want a
lot of possessions. They want to play fast. They play just like VCU, where we
want to be physical. We want to play inside out. We want to control tempo.  
We want to get them out of their rhythm. So I think this is going to be
contrasting styles, which could lead to a very interesting game.  
  
Q. Will, they shoot the 3 ‑point shot pretty well and you've had games
against teams that have really hurt you with the way they shot 3s against you.
How much of a concern is their 3‑point shooting to you?  
COACH BROWN: Their 3‑point shooting is a concern. It's a strength of theirs.
They'll have four guys on the floor at all times that can shoot the 3. They
play four guards, they spread you out, space you out. They do a really good
job of getting out in transition, penetrating, kick.  
They're going to take 3s no matter what. I think the biggest thing is we
cannot allow them to get in a comfort zone, can't allow them to get in a
rhythm.  
We do have to force them to make some 2‑point shots. And another way for us to
defend the 3 is to make sure that we control tempo and don't allow them to get
in a rhythm.  
The more possessions, the faster the game, the better chance they can get in
the rhythm and get a lot of 3s. We've got to try to frustrate them with the
way we play.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach Will? Congratulations, Coach.
Good luck tomorrow.  
COACH BROWN: Thank you very much.

BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 22, 2014

  

### [Archie Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23486)

### [Devin Oliver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26117)

### [Dyshawn Pierre](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26715)

  
_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

Dayton  55  
Syracuse - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Dayton head coach Archie Miller and
student‑athletes Devin Oliver and Dyshawn Pierre. Coach, if you'd get us going
with an opening statement, and we'll take questions for the student‑athletes
after that.  
COACH MILLER: First of all, just an unbelievable environment to be in. We're
really proud of our guys in terms of their approach and coming in here.
There's very few guys on our team that have NCAA Tournament experience, and
we've played a couple teams here in the last couple of days that I would say
is quite the opposite.  
So really proud of the character. They really believe in one another. We're a
tough group right now, and we just continue to improve.  
A lot of it is the guy to the right of me. He's a senior. I know Vee and Matt
aren't up here, but those three guys have done a tremendous job, not only
improving as the year's gone on, but they've really been an unbelievable group
of guys to coach. Credit to all our guys.  
Obviously, Syracuse is a heck of a team. It was a great environment. We're
fortunate. But just proud to be here, sitting here in the winning circle.  
  
Q. Dyshawn, again, it comes down to your free throws. Any more pressure than
last time?  
DYSHAWN PIERRE: Not really. Just trying to make sure I came through for our
team. I'm happy I was able to knock them down.  
  
Q. Dealing with that zone defense, how did you cope with it throughout the
game? How do you think your teammates coped with it?  
DYSHAWN PIERRE: It was really tough. We realized they pressure the ball really
well. They were able to jump out and contest our shooters. We were able to
attack the zone by throwing it in the middle of the paint and just sharing the
ball and making sure that we got open shots.  
  
Q. Could you guys talk a little bit about how satisfying it was to come to
Buffalo, really close to Syracuse, and get a win in Syracuse's own backyard.  
DYSHAWN PIERRE: It feels good for sure. I mean, anyone getting into the Sweet
16 feels good. We really stuck together tonight.  
DEVIN OLIVER: Just what Dyshawn said. It's an incredible feeling. It could
have been a high school team. If we're going to the Sweet 16, nothing's
better.  
  
Q. Devin, there was a play at the end of the game where you attacked the
rim, got blocked, hustled back on defense, and were able to help make a
defensive play to throw it ahead. Can you just talk about the toughness that
it took to pull this one out.  
DEVIN OLIVER: Yeah, a lot of toughness. I know on that particular play I had
to get back or Coach would have let me have it. I think that's one of the best
things about this team. We're together. We're a very tough group, like Coach
said.  
When times get tight, you know, in that last four minutes, guys stick
together, a player like Dyshawn makes some big free throws, and we just will
ourselves to a win.  
  
Q. Devin, when Jordan stepped out on the line, what was the first feeling
that went in your head?  
DEVIN OLIVER: Got to get a stop. You know, you can't go over to Jordan and get
all over him. You know, it's a tough spot he was in. I think it maybe even
could have been called a foul.  
But you've got to pick him up and get that next stop.  
  
Q. Dyshawn, if you can, if you can replay the last few seconds of the game.
You missed the free throw. Please maybe explain what is going through your
mind as the ball is going back up the court and you see the ball in the air.  
DEVIN OLIVER: It was me.  
  
Q. What's that?  
DEVIN OLIVER: To miss the free throw.  
  
Q. Oh, I'm sorry.  
DEVIN OLIVER: It was me.  
  
Q. Thanks for jumping in there.  
DEVIN OLIVER: No doubt. I don't want Dyshawn to take the blame for that.  
  
Q. Am I forgetting something here?  
DEVIN OLIVER: I mean, what can you think? Like I said on Jordan's play, same
thing. You got to get back and get a stop and just continue to play. At that
point, you've got to let it go. It's over.  
  
Q. What's going through your mind as the game is in the balance for the two
seconds that the ball is in the air?  
DEVIN OLIVER: Just hope we don't lose because then you kind of feel like it
falls back on your shoulders.  
But then again, that's the beautiful thing about this team, you've got guys
like Dyshawn who have your back and who make those free throws after you miss
them.  
  
Q. A situation where you grabbed the early lead, kind of clinging to it, and
they clawed back a little bit, but they never got that big run against you.
You always held it really close. When you were getting the early lead, were
you thinking this is going to hold up, really?  
DEVIN OLIVER: Well, we know Syracuse is a good team, obviously. So we know we
just had to keep it close all the way to that last four minutes. We knew they
were going to make their run.  
Basketball is a game of runs. They were basically in a home environment. So we
just tried to maintain, remain consistent, and then push out a win at the end.  
DYSHAWN PIERRE: We just tried to trust in each other and make sure that their
run wasn't too big, make sure that we kind of attacked back when they were
making their runs and make sure we're there at the end of the game.  
I think we did that pretty well tonight.  
  
Q. How good does this feel? You guys have knocked off two higher seeds now.
Everyone is talking about this game. But just this feeling, what's this
like?  
DEVIN OLIVER: It's unexplainable, man, especially for me. I had a coaching
change early on in my college career. Coach Miller came, and it's been a
process.  
Last year was a little bit more of a down year. To come back this year, my
senior year, with this group of guys to be able to get to the Sweet 16, it's
unexplainable. Just really happy for this group of guys.  
DYSHAWN PIERRE: It's incredible. We really worked hard for this in the
off‑season. We're happy we're able to make it this far, and hopefully, we can
keep pushing.  
THE MODERATOR: Devin, Dyshawn, thanks for your time. Congrats. Good luck. Take
followup questions for Coach Miller.  
  
Q. Thursday you said you thought Aaron Craft's shot was in.  
COACH MILLER: It was definitely going in tonight. That thing was on line, and
he went for the win. The thing that went through my head was the game at Pitt,
when I saw that highlight on SportsCenter 7,000 times when he banged the three
on Pitt.  
Similar situation. You don't have any timeouts you're trying to get organized.
We were going to foul on a made free throw by Pierre. Devin has missed so many
in the last couple weeks. He just assumed you were talking about him.  
It was Dyshawn. He made the first. It's a two‑point game. And on that miss,
you got to get matched up. You would hope to be able to corral the ball and
stop him a little bit earlier. On a make, we were going to foul on the
dribble. Lo and behold, he missed. He's coming down.  
We got stopped. It was stopped deep. I thought he was going to go to the
basket. When I saw him raise up, I didn't feel good about it.  
Buffalo has been good to us the last couple of days on the buzzer shots.  
  
Q. Coach, is there anything specific you did against Jerami Grant? He didn't
even attempt a shot really until end of the second half. It's one thing to
miss shots, but he really couldn't even get any looks.  
COACH MILLER: We were very concerned about him coming in. I think sometimes
when you're able to put two on the ball, so to speak, and they can pick on
you, they throw the ball back to him, and he has those lanes to drive. That's
when he's really tough to deal with at the basket, on the drive.  
We switched a lot. We tried to just keep a body in front of him, and then when
he caught it, try to load the floor on him a little bit, try to play the drive
the best we could. He wasn't on the glass as much as he's been maybe because
we blocked out, maybe because he didn't go.  
Nothing special other than just not trying to give him the lanes on the catch
where he could put the ball on the floor.  
It was also a physical game. There was a lot of plays in and around the basket
that were challenged. It could have gone either way. A couple that went in, a
couple that didn't.  
  
Q. Coach, during the preparation, how much was poise and patience talked
about with your players?  
COACH MILLER: Well, we spent a lot of time in the last however many hours it
was talking to our players about the feel of the game. You know, the feel of
the game against Syracuse is a different feel. Nothing is normal. No rhythm
shots, not the amount of reps that you've had in practice. Nothing feels the
same.  
So we spent a lot of time just talking to our guys about I'd rather have a
shot clock violation than a turnover. We'd rather work the clock the best we
could to see if we could get it to the paint as much as possible.  
And patience was talked about. You're going to have to earn the right to score
on them, and it's very difficult to do.  
  
Q. Did it surprise you that Ennis didn't drive the ball those last two
possessions for them?  
COACH MILLER: Well, one breakdown on a switch where we conceded the layup, and
then we did a great job on the second switch. Devin did a good job eliminating
the driving lane, and I thought he challenged the 16‑foot pullup. Then we got
the rebound. That was a big play.  
Obviously, on the last one, he went for the win.  
  
Q. How much are you flirting with disaster or feeling that way when you have
a very narrow lead in the first, you had opportunities to extend, then you
were up by seven, I think it was. And you have opportunities to extend the
lead and maybe dictate a little bit, but the shots aren't going in, turnovers,
all that stuff. What's that?  
COACH MILLER: I mean, you're playing against a great team. I mean, you're
playing against one of the best teams in the country, and to play them in
Buffalo, to expect to push ahead, so to speak, it's not really going through
your head.  
Battling every possession defensively, watching our kids compete, giving
ourselves a chance to be there, be there, be there. At the end of the game, we
wanted to be right where we were, which was we had a chance to win the game.  
If you'd have told me at the end of the game, you'd have a one‑point lead with
a minute or whatever, you're taking it. You're just going to take that.  
Fortunately tonight, they didn't hit some shots that they probably normally
hit. The defense was great, but you also could play them ten times, and I
don't think that some of those shots would be missed.  
So a little bit of luck is on your head. And you need that, I think,
obviously, in this tournament. You've got to be fortunate.  
  
Q. Coach, Allen Griffin played at Syracuse ‑‑  
COACH MILLER: He's trouble.  
  
Q. I noticed your assistants were crouching on their hands and knees pretty
much all of them on defense, on defense, on offense. What was his input as far
as prepping?  
COACH MILLER: Allen does a great job, as do all of our coaches. They do a
great job. That's why we've had a good season. You have to have good people
around your kids. And Allen playing there, maybe they make a big deal about
it, but you're playing against their players. They've got really good players.  
Allen knows a couple of tendencies just like some other guys would know, but
from a scouting perspective, we took it all on, just like we did against Ohio
State. It's a team approach.  
We have a great staff. It's one of the reasons we were able to endure a bad
January is because we had good people around our kids.  
  
Q. Coach, people here in Buffalo, they know all about Syracuse's success,
the brand names, Ohio State, Syracuse, definitely well ‑known. But maybe to
the casual fan that was taking it in this weekend, what does this mean for
your program? You proved it on the floor, obviously, but Dayton basketball
going forward, to beat Ohio State, Syracuse. Just kind of what does that mean
to you guys?   
COACH MILLER: Credibility. You know, I think the big thing is credibility and
what we do works. We didn't walk into a place and have just a stockpile of
young kids in our program. We inherited eight scholarship players, four of
which were seniors. The first thing you think about is how much turnover is
going to go on.  
And as you approach year two and three, how young can you be?  
But I think at the end of the day, it was we never deviated from developing
the guys we had. We never deviated from the plan of bringing guys in to fit
the style of play. And we never deviated from evolving and getting better each
day and sticking with the plan 365 days a year.  
That's what's gotten us to this point. It wasn't just this team. It was the
whole starting point and sticking with it.  
So what we do have now is credibility. Now we have to sustain that over the
course of forever. That's what the talk was when we got here. We have a good
program with great tradition. Now we have the ability to build, and I think
that's what it's all about.  
  
Q. Coach, you just said great tradition. First Sweet 16 since 1984. You were
5, if I did the math right. What does that mean? Great basketball city for the
NCAA Tournament.  
COACH MILLER: I'm just happy. I'm happy for the institution. I'm happy for our
fans. When I say great tradition, there's a lot of people that have been going
to our arena 20, 30, 40 years who have seen great moments.  
We've had good teams, and there's been great players that have come through,
but we haven't been able to break through consistently in a long time.  
I'm just happy for our administration. I'm happy for our city. I'm happy for
our fans. I'm happy for our players. This is where they deserve to be. There
isn't a better place to play basketball than the University of Dayton. There's
a lot of great places, but if you're a player at our place, you experience the
same stuff that you can experience at a Syracuse in terms of the way they're
cared about and treated.  
I'm just happy for everyone involved in and around our program.  
  
Q. So we talked about what this means for the institution and all that. What
does it mean for you? There are thousands of coaches who will never even get
to this position. What does it mean just personally for you, where you are
right now?  
COACH MILLER: You've got to have a little humility. I've come up in a
basketball family. I think everybody knows that. But I've been very fortunate
to be around some great coaches.  
Started off in college, and somebody gives you a chance. Then you're around
good people, and they help develop you to be ready, hopefully.  
I'm grateful, and I'm thankful. Now that I'm here, I don't think anything
further than tomorrow. That's not how I'm wired. It's about tomorrow, and
we'll figure a way out. Kind of move towards Memphis.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congrats. Good luck.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

Dayton  55  
Syracuse - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Syracuse University head coach Jim Boeheim and
student‑athletes C.J. Fair and Baye Moussa Keita. We'll start with an opening
statement from Coach.  
COACH BOEHEIM: I thought we had a tremendous defensive effort. When we were
down late, I thought we made a tremendous effort to get back in it. We had a
couple of good shots. They didn't go in. This is a tough loss, as they all are
this time of the year.  
But that's what happens. Somebody gets beat on the last play, and tonight it
was us.  
  
Q. C.J., question for you, with 13 seconds left, you come out of the huddle
‑‑  
COACH BOEHEIM: We didn't come out of the huddle.  
  
Q. With 13 seconds left, can you walk us through what the play was going to
be?  
COACH BOEHEIM: We did not have a time‑out.  
C.J. FAIR: When we got possession of the ball, we just wanted to space the
floor and try to penetrate and get a good opportunity, and we missed. So we
had to foul.  
  
Q. C.J., Dayton seemed to be playing really physical on defense. Could you
talk a little bit about how they were playing you guys, especially in the
first half.  
C.J. FAIR: They're a small team, but they're scrappy, and they're quick to the
ball and rotations. Every time we put the ball down, they got a hand in there.  
So they kind of set the tone early, where we was playing catch‑up, we were
trying to catch up the whole game.  
  
Q. Baye, you didn't play a lot tonight, but after every timeout, after every
huddle, it seemed like you were gathering the guys and talking to them. What
were you telling them?  
BAYE MOUSSA KEITA: Every time, it doesn't matter if I'm on the floor or not,
I'm just trying to motivate them and trying to get them to make the right
play. Just motivation every single time.  
  
Q. C.J., talk about the defense they threw at you early and kind of threw
you off a little bit. Was it different than any defense you've seen this
season? Was it because of their size? Was there anything different about what
they did as opposed to what you've seen all season?  
C.J. FAIR: No, it's not anything different. It's just we didn't react good to
start the game off. We didn't come out aggressive on the offensive end.  
We kind of got ourself together, but it was kind of too late. One or two
possessions too late.  
THE MODERATOR: C.J., Baye, appreciate your time.  
Questions for Coach Boeheim at this time.  
  
Q. Jim, just talk about the night offensively, if you could. I guess under
40 percent shooting and 0 for 10 from beyond the arc.  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, in our games, we haven't started particularly well.
Tonight was no exception. I thought, after the slow start, and particularly in
the second half, I thought we were getting the shots you've got to get. We got
good shots.  
The only thing we could make was a layup, and it's not easy to get layups
against a good defensive team, and we did. We broke through. C.J. got to the
basket for two or three, and then the next possession, we settled for a jump
shot.  
If you're shooting the ball, it's okay. But after 30 minutes, if you figured
out you're not making jump shots, I think we needed to keep driving the ball,
even though it's hard to do. But we took two or three jump shots when we had
the lead, and you've got to keep driving at that stage.  
With 13 seconds to go, we wanted to get it to Tyler and drive the ball. We'd
just driven the ball for three baskets, and I don't know why he settled for
the jump shot. There was plenty of time. He had space. I'm not sure why.  
The last shot was a great shot. That was the right play, a chance to win the
game. You don't have enough time to get to the basket.  
  
Q. Coach, looking at the last four losses, 3 of the 4 were very close games.
It seemed like towards the end of your season, the last month or so, it seemed
like the close games, early in the year, you were able to turn them around.
Now they're kind of biting you a little bit.  
COACH BOEHEIM: Yeah, that's right.  
  
Q. Could you comment on what changed from the early part of the season as
opposed to the last month or so.  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, when you make shots, you win. When you don't make shots,
you lose in close games. Early in the year, we made shots.  
Obviously, Tyler made a 40‑footer at Pittsburgh. But in the other games, we
won seven straight close games early in the year, we made shots. It was
different people. Tyler made some. C.J. made some. Jerami Grant made a couple.
But we made shots.  
In tonight's game, we had shots. We got stops when we had to. Made a couple of
great defensive plays down there to get stops. Made a great play on our press
to get them to step out of bounds. So we made the defensive plays that we
needed to make plus, but we didn't make a shot when we had to.  
  
Q. And did you feel that Tyler's shot at the end, that you were due to get
that one? You were 0 for 9 at that point from the three ‑point. It seems like
you were overdue for that.   
COACH BOEHEIM: There's a lot of guys in Vegas that think that too. They go
home with nothing.  
That was a good shot. I have no problem with that shot. Some of his other jump
shots were not good decisions.  
  
Q. There's going to be a lot of focus maybe on what your team did not do,
but can you talk about Dayton beating Ohio State down the stretch, beating you
guys down the stretch? Talk about what they did so well these last couple of
games.  
COACH BOEHEIM: I'm not going to talk about Dayton. Why would I do that? I'm
going to talk about Syracuse. I'm not going to talk about Dayton. Ask their
coach. He should be very proud of their team.  
  
Q. Jim, seasons always end and seniors graduate, but could you talk a little
bit about C.J. Fair and his struggle tonight in his last game.  
COACH BOEHEIM: He struggled a little, and he's had some games where he's
struggled. In the second half, he got it back and got it going to the basket.  
But it's very hard to get to the basket against good defensive teams, and
Dayton certainly is. Like Pittsburgh in our league and Clemson, teams that are
really good defensively, it's hard to get to the basket.  
We had some good looks from the perimeter. C.J. had a couple of good foul line
jump shots that he usually makes. Tyler usually makes some of those. I think
he missed 14 jump shots tonight. I think he went 7 for 7, or 7 for 8 going to
the basket, and he just couldn't get the jump shot to go.  
They made a few. They made some threes and some jump shots, a couple of tough
ones.  
I thought we did an unbelievable job fighting to hang in there when you're not
making anything. When you're not making anything from the perimeter, it's
hard. It's a hard game. I thought we finally got to the basket. Mike got
there. Tyler got there. C.J. got there.  
But sooner or later, to win, usually, you've got to make something from the
perimeter. You can give Dayton credit, and that's good. But we had some open
looks, and we didn't make them. That's really, pretty much, basically, what
happened.  
Once we got off to a slow start, we were fine. We fought the rest of the game.
But sooner or later, I think you've got to make a shot out there to win.  
  
Q. Your feelings on frustrations with your team not being able to make shots
on one side versus admiration for Dayton's defense on the other. Where would
the needle be?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I don't talk about the other team. I mean, everybody in this
tournament plays good defense. You can't get here without playing good
defense, and they play good defense, as did Ohio State yesterday.  
But we've got to be better on offense.  
You can give them credit, and I think you should. But I look at the shots that
we get. If we don't get shots, and that's happened to us with some teams
defensively. I thought we got good shots. I really did.  
A couple of Tyler's jump shots, really, all of his jump shots were pretty
good. He was open. He got on them. He just wasn't making them, and that
happens.  
But you look at the quality of shots, and I thought, once we started driving
it, I thought we got shots we really needed to get. I mean, we missed a couple
of layups, Rak missed one. We missed a couple of easy shots around the basket.
That happens.  
But overall, it's very hard to win making layups, and that's all you're making
against a good defensive team, that's very difficult to do. At some point in
time, you need to knock something down from the perimeter, and we didn't. It
was just not a good offensive game for us.  
You give credit to the defense in that case too. Our defense was good.  
  
Q. How much does coaching become psychological on nights when the shots
aren't falling as opposed to Xs and Os?  
COACH BOEHEIM: You just try to drive the ball. That's all you can do in those
situations. We try to just drive the ball, and we finally did. We got eight,
nine, ten layups in the second half because we did drive the ball. But it's
hard to get enough to do that.  
If the other team makes five or six threes and you make five or six layups,
you're six points down. So that really was what I saw out there tonight pretty
much.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

UConn  77  
Villanova - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Connecticut head coach Kevin Ollie, as well as
student‑athletes Ryan Boatright, Niels Giffey, and Shabazz Napier.  
COACH OLLIE: Great game by our guys. They showed some resiliency. They showed
toughness, and they just played with a will.  
When Shabazz went out, guys stepped up, and that's what a team is all about.
Then in the second half, he scored 21 points for us.  
But everybody was strong. Everybody rebounded the basketball, and we just
played together. It was a gutty win.  
We're going to the Garden. We just love to plant seeds. We're going to keep
planting seeds there. We're going to keep playing together and keep caring for
each other.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
Questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Shabazz, the injury sustained with about four minutes to go. What
happened there? It seemed like you were in quite a bit of pain, and you were
able to come back a minute or so later.  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: I was trying to get open for the ball, and I think it was
Hilliard was playing me aggressively. I just tried to make a move, and he kind
of kicked me or kneed me in my shin area. The pain was just excruciating. I
couldn't really put pressure on it.  
Our athletic trainer James Doran, one of the best in the country, he was just
applying pressure on it to make sure I was fine. Put some good Biofreeze on
it.  
He told me mentally stay strong. Physically, everything felt like it was in
the right place. I think it was just a deep bruise. Like I said, James Doran,
our athletic trainer, put that Biofreeze on, and I was ready to go.  
  
Q. Any of you guys, what does it mean to be able to go back to the Garden,
playing Sweet 16 at the Garden where UConn's had so many great moments.  
RYAN BOATRIGHT: It's always good to go back to the Garden. At UConn, we call
the Garden our second home because, when we go to the Garden, we take care of
business. But it just feels good to go through to the Sweet 16. Going through
what we went through last year, it was hurtful and painful to watch. We didn't
have nothing to do with the sanctions, but it just feels good, man, to move
on.  
NIELS GIFFEY: Great chance just for us to have the type of home game. We have
a couple of guys from New York, and that's one of the reasons why Terrence
played so well. He was really trying to go home for a little bit.  
Yeah, we're just excited to have our home crowd right around the corner,
especially the older guys with so many great memories in the Garden. Like Ryan
said, we're just trying to take care of business in the Garden.  
  
Q. Ryan, how important was that stretch of Shabazz was on the bench in foul
trouble. Did you guys just turn it up on defense? What did you do to hold on
and build a lead there?  
RYAN BOATRIGHT: I just told the guys that we had to come together and we had
to take care of the ball and play good defense to get to the second half so we
could get Shabazz back.  
The guys that came in and played in that first half, they stepped up real
tremendously. I was just trying to make plays for myself and for others and
just take care of the ball. I knew that, if we could take care of the ball and
we could play defense going into the first half either winning or with the
game close, once we got Shabazz back, he'd have a good chance of winning the
game.  
  
Q. Shabazz, you always talk about how important your teammates are to you.
Does that kind of show at that point, when you're sitting out, how important
they are?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: Exactly. It was a big moment when I got my second foul, but we
didn't skip a beat. That just shows the maturity of this team and how much
they continuously are getting better.  
I get recognized for a lot of things, but everyone knows that there's no 'I'
in team, and they proved it today. I got in foul trouble. Boatright, being the
captain that he is, stepped up. Niels stepped up. Terrence got in the game and
stepped up. I could go down the list. Everybody stepped up, and that's what
they do.  
I've been watching them this entire season in practice, in games, and spurts
in games where I know my teammates are ready. It showed today collectively,
and I'm definitely so happy I'm part of this team.  
Like I always said, I'm nothing without these guys, and today was a big show
for that.  
  
Q. Shabazz, you've been working with Terrence since he got on campus. What
are the biggest differences that you see in his game from then until now?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: He just matured so much. As a freshman coming in, you know, in
high school you play so many minutes. The biggest thing is you want to do the
same when you get to college, but when you have great guards in front of you,
it's kind of hard.  
He kept his head. He understands he's a big role member on this team. Today, I
mean, it didn't shock me one bit. It was just beautiful.  
I'm not the only one that's helping him out. Ryan Boatright is helping him
out. Coach Hobbs. Coach Ollie. We have a tremendous coaching staff that were
guards, they were great guards. So Terrence, nothing he did today shocked any
of us. He does that all the time.  
In practice, he can take over in practice plenty of times. That's just how he
is. He just showed how much he matured, and I'm just happy for that.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, congrats. Good luck next weekend.  
  
Q. Kevin, I think Villanova scored 13 points in the first four and a half
minutes when you called timeout. What did you see defensively in terms of
intensity from that point on?  
COACH OLLIE: I seen a lot. I seen us being great for three. When we called
great for three, it's not enough to go two slots. We have to go the third
slot. They was penetrating and going out and getting easy threes. So we wanted
to run them off the three‑point line.  
I think when Shabazz got his foul, his second foul, we started really turning
up the defense another notch with him on the bench. It's nothing against
Shabazz, it was just we got to take this moment. The game is right now.  
I think once they took Shabazz out on this last play and he hit three and was
up nine, we went on a 16‑1 run. It was just a great run by us with our leader
on the bench. But that just shows you what kind of team we're made out of.  
Everybody talks about we're not deep, we're not this, we're not that, but
we've got heart. Every guy that comes in on the court, they stay positive, and
they stay productive.  
I'm going to keep saying the same thing. That's what our guys do. That's how
we're built. We're UConn made. We're UConn made through and through. And every
day we come out there and play with that toughness and play with that heart.  
  
Q. Kevin, after Shabazz got hurt, he came back in and scored on a pretty
ridiculous scoop layup. Does anything he does at this point surprise you? That
looked like I thought he wasn't coming back in, and there he was scoring on a
wacky shot.  
COACH OLLIE: He's just tough‑minded. A lot of things he's been through in life
made him that way. His mother Carmen is one of the toughest ladies around, and
he'll be the first to say that, how he was raised and what she had to do to
keep their home together, and I think he gets that toughness from her.  
He goes out there and plays. I told you on many occasions he does whatever we
need to win. If that's scoring a scoop shot, that's being my unpaid coach for
12 minutes, you know, that's what he does.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Terrence's development and what he's done lately.
Obviously, he didn't seem to be too nervous. Even after he misses the layup,
he seemed to respond quickly and got right back on D.  
COACH OLLIE: We've been telling Terrence and all of our guys, you've got to
recover quick. For me, I've got to be positive over there because they're
looking at me, and I have to have the right body language when he makes a
mistake.  
That's what I try to do with Terrence. He's going to be a great player for us.
He's maturing right now. Like I told him, once he stepped on the free‑throw
line the last game, he's not no freshman no more. You're all sophomores. This
is the big stage, and they're stepping up and playing wonderful basketball.  
Things I don't see. I keep telling you. They work hard in practice. Kentan's
working hard. You don't see it, but he's working hard. All our guys have that
passion and that want to get better. We tell our guys, every time you step on
the court, Try to do something better.  
Terrence is maturing, and he's a great competitor, but he's also a great
teammate. He's going to be a great basketball player for us and a great
student‑athlete for the University of Connecticut.  
  
Q. You're getting guys that do things when you need them, Niels, 11
rebounds, Lasan scored today when he hadn't scored much. How do you explain
the guys can fill in when you need them to?  
COACH OLLIE: I just explain, we plant seeds. We plant seeds every day in
practice. Sometimes you're not going to see them growing the first day or
first two days, but sooner or later, they're going to grow. That's what they
do each and every day.  
Lasan has been working hard. He does different things for us to win. You know,
against Saint Joe's, he played tremendous defense on Galloway that last
possession. We just want our guys to be solid, just continue to play their
role, be solid, and just contribute in so many different ways.  
You don't have to be a great player all the time, but you can always be a
great teammate. That's what we try to strive for all our guys to be great
teammates on and off the basketball court.  
  
Q. When Shabazz went out with that injury, I mean, it's still a pretty close
game at that point. How much concern did you have? How much fear did you have
that might have been a long ‑term injury or something more than what it ended
up being?   
COACH OLLIE: Just, I believe in my team. I'm hurting for him because I don't
want him coming out of the game. But like they just said, we've been hurting a
lot, but we stayed here. We're hurting, but we're still here. That's our
motto. We're going to be here. We're going to stand up. We're going to say I'm
present.  
If Shabazz is on the bench, we've got to keep going forward for him, and we
got to uphold each other. I think that's what we did. Then Shabazz got back
in. I knew he's a tough player. He's going to get back in there, and that's
what he did, and he led us to victory.  
He was just unbelievable that second half. You know, 21 points, crucial
threes, dagger threes. You know, it looked like he was 30 feet out and just
making them with all the utmost confidence in the world. Great game by him.  
But it was a great thing, when he's on the bench, our other players can step
up and provide a great spark for us.  
  
Q. Kevin, is this at all starting to feel like Kemba did with this team four
years ago?  
COACH OLLIE: Kemba is a special player. I just want to keep riding Uncle Mo.
That's the momentum. Wherever it takes us, it's going to take us.  
We got to stay together as a team. We can't get drunk off success. We got to
make sure we understand we go back to work on Monday. Give the kids the day
off and then go back to work. We see who we're playing, and we've got to
prepare. That's what we need to do, and whatever happens is going to happen.  
We're going to write our own story. We're not going to let anybody write it
for us. We're going to continue to learn and grow and appreciate this journey
that we're on.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congrats. Good luck next week.  
COACH OLLIE: Appreciate it. Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 22, 2014

  

### [Ryan Arcidiacono](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24960)

### [James Bell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25172)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

UConn  77  
Villanova - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Villanova University head coach Jay Wright and
student‑athletes Ryan Arcidiacono and James Bell.  
Coach, if you want to go ahead and make an opening statement.  
COACH WRIGHT: Certainly a tough way to end the season. I don't want to let
this put a damper on what this group has done this year.  
We want to congratulate UConn. They were outstanding, just really tough in the
second half. The defense in the second half was outstanding. Napier was just
awesome. There was just a period there where he hit those three threes, and it
just created a separation. In a game like this that was that close, that
separation was tough to make up, and I think that was probably the story of
the game, their defense and that period where Napier hit three deep threes.  
  
Q. Do you feel like there's anything more you could have done with Napier?
Was he just so good today there was really nothing you guys could have done?  
JAMES BELL: He made some outstanding plays. He's an outstanding player, and
he's put in great position.  
Do I feel like we could have did more? Maybe a little more pressure on the
ball. But he was making some good plays. He was shooting outside what we call
the scoring area. He's an outstanding player that made outstanding plays.  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: Yeah, like James said, he got in foul trouble early in the
first half, so that helped us get them out of rhythm.  
Second half, he hit one, and then a couple more. That's what great players do
and that's what he is. He made great plays. Like Taj said, he was making it
from deep outside the scoring area. He's a tough player.  
  
Q. I believe you went 15 straight possessions without a field goal towards
the end of the first half. What exactly happened there? Did UConn's defense
lock up a lot tighter, or did you guys feel you missed some open shots?  
JAMES BELL: I mean, we didn't even know that. We're out there playing. Our
main focus is not offense. We're focusing on defense, defense and rebounding.
So that can happen in a stretch.  
Did we know it was that long? No. Did we even know we missed 15 straight or
went 15 straight possessions? No. I mean, probably could have taken a little
better shots. We have to go back and look at that.  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: It could have been a combination of both. They were changing
up their defenses a little bit, going from the zone to a man and then
switching on the shot clock.  
We were taking some great shots. Like Taj said, we could have passed up a few.
But I think to only be down one and not scoring 15 possessions straight, that
just is a compliment of our defense and just kind of holding us together until
the other half.  
  
Q. Ryan, when a guy like Napier is going off like he is, do you guys feel
pressure to kind of try to match him shot for shot? How do you kind of handle,
when he's doing what he's doing? How do you handle on your end of the court?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: We just play Villanova basketball. No one's going to try to
get into a one‑on‑one battle or anything like that. I thought that's what we
did. We took great shots in the first half, and some of the shots didn't go
for us, and every shot he took was going in.  
I don't think anyone on our team was trying to match him play for play or
anything like that. I thought we shared the ball and just didn't make open
shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Appreciate it, guys.  
Questions we'll take for Coach Wright.  
  
Q. Napier goes out after eight minutes. He's got the two fouls. Connecticut
goes on a 14 ‑1 run after that. How frustrating is that with him off the
floor?   
COACH WRIGHT: That was probably the second most important part of the game was
him not being on the floor in the first half and then making up a difference
there. We had a lead. That was disappointing. In a game like that, you got to
take advantage of that, which we didn't.  
But like Ryan said, we still felt all right. We were pretty poor offensively
there, and we were down one. We felt in good shape at halftime.  
  
Q. How much did Terrence Samuel help in that situation with Napier out? What
impact did he make?  
COACH WRIGHT: He was great defensively. He really was. He got up on our guards
and pressured our guards. He had good size. He drove the ball. He was good.
Made free throws tonight. I thought he did a great job making up for Napier
right there.  
And Boatright at that point started making some plays. They did a good job.
They did a really good job of covering that up and getting him back in the
game and still had a lead.  
  
Q. You start the game 5 for 8. Did you feel that you had a good shooting
night? Was that a real shock to then go 15 possessions without making one?  
COACH WRIGHT: Yeah, I did. I really thought we were going to shoot the ball
well. I don't think they came out really aggressive. But once we went on that
little run, they stepped up the defense big time. They really stepped it up.  
Because we got a couple of easy ones early, a couple of layups, there was a
different level of intensity after maybe the first 16‑minute timeout.  
  
Q. Jay, I think bench scoring was something like 18 ‑5\. Kris hit the three
at the end. That puts a lot of pressure on. You've been getting good
contributions from those guys. How tough is it against a team like that to not
get that?   
COACH WRIGHT: It wasn't all our guys' faults. We get down like that and trying
to go with some guys that have been there before in a tight game. I don't know
if, as a coaching staff, we gave those guys from the bench a great opportunity
to score.  
You kind of got to make a decision what you're going to do there when you're
trying to come back and it's a tight game. We've got a lot of young guys that
come off the bench.  
It definitely would have helped if we could have stayed close and used our
depth a little bit better.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, great season. Congrats.

## March 21, 2014

  

### [Archie Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23486)

### [Devin Oliver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26117)

### [Vee Sanford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26669)

  
_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome back to day three here at
First Niagara Center. Joined by Dayton student‑athletes Devin Oliver and Vee
Sanford.  
Guys, congrats. Thanks for being here.  
We'll go ahead and get started.  
  
Q. Vee, I don't want to assume, so just for clarification, how does that
shot rank in terms of big shots you've ever made in your life?  
VEE SANFORD: It was a very big shot personally, but kind of just getting that
out of the way. I want to focus on tomorrow. That's the main thing.  
As a team, we want to focus on tomorrow. It was a good win, but now it's
Syracuse we've got to focus on.  
  
Q. How difficult is it to come off a high like that? I don't know, 24 ‑hour
rule about celebrating before looking on to the next opponent. You don't
really have that. How do you get past it when it's such a big moment in your
life?   
VEE SANFORD: You just got to have a business approach, the whole advance
mentality. Enjoy the moment while you can, but it's on to the next.  
I feel like with the team, we have a business approach to everything, which is
helping us focus in on the next game.  
  
Q. Devin, you know kind of what it's like to have some success, surprise
some people dating back to your high school days at Kalamazoo Central. What's
this year been like for you leading right up to yesterday?  
DEVIN OLIVER: It's been great, me being a senior along with Vee. Three other
guys that I came in with in my recruiting class all left after our freshman
year. Then last year it didn't live up to what we wanted it to be.  
So for this team, this team that I'm a part of this year, to finish up like
this, it's just a great feeling. There's no group of guys who deserve it more.
We're going to continue to try to advance.  
  
Q. Devin, Jim Boeheim talked about there's really no surprises when another
team tries to work on the two ‑three zone. What do you guys expect him to do
tomorrow against that?   
DEVIN OLIVER: I think the most important thing is just to continue to do what
we do. The zone is the zone. I mean, it's basketball. The zone's going to be
there.  
So I think we've just got to focus on what we're trying to do as a team, play
physical and play aggressive. You know, don't just settle for launching threes
and playing around the perimeter, but doing what we got to do to get the ball
into the interior.  
  
Q. Talk about Coach Miller and what makes him so special? What makes you
guys want to play so hard for him?  
DEVIN OLIVER: Coach Miller, he's one of those guys who's just an everyday type
guy. I think that really spreads to the rest of the team. He's not really the
big‑time jokester or anything like that. Every day is a serious and
business‑like approach.  
He's a guy who, you could tell, that he has passion. He had passion when he
played, and he shows his passion in practice. You know, if someone messes
something up, he'll hop in the drill and go for a couple of minutes. He's not
afraid to show his passion for the game.  
I think the most important thing is he's all about winning, you know, winning
and togetherness. But more than anything, winning because that's the most
important thing is winning.  
VEE SANFORD: Going on what D‑Mo said, he's a really passionate person about
the game. It's something that I've grown to understand throughout my three
years being here along with I feel like, if he had the opportunity to play the
game right now, he would. That's how passionate he is about the game. I feel
like that gives us a good vibe and an understanding on what our goals need to
be.  
  
Q. Does he ever talk about his time as a player, because he was a really
good player?  
DEVIN OLIVER: Yeah, if we're practicing and a couple of guys missed a shot, he
brags about how he would have knocked that shot down.  
I mean, not specifically. He more so talks about being tough and nasty in the
game. He said that he used to do that.  
But some of his passion as a player spreads to us, which is good.  
  
Q. Vee, you're a guy who played at Georgetown for two years. So what's it
like going up against a team you used to be rivals with?  
VEE SANFORD: Yeah, it was a big rivalry, Georgetown‑Syracuse. I'm just looking
at it as another game. I'm a Flyer now, and I'm just happy for the opportunity
to be playing in this game.  
  
Q. Anything you learned from watching Syracuse in Maui and playing at
Georgetown?  
VEE SANFORD: They're really good, a long team in the zone. You can't slack
off. They like to get it out, the whole roster is pretty good.  
DEVIN OLIVER: Just to add to what Vee said, they're a good team. They pride
themselves on being really long in the zone and forcing turnovers and getting
out on the break. They've got some athletic guys.  
  
Q. You guys have been in 15 single ‑digit games. Do you guys thrive in those
kind of games?   
DEVIN OLIVER: Well, you know, it's funny, last year we lost about eight or
nine games. Like between all nine of those games, it was like a total of 10
points, something crazy like that. So we went through it last year, we just
happened to come out on the losing end of it.  
But this year after the first initial game when Jordan Sibert hit the buzzer
beater at IPFW, I think we have the confidence that if we have it close in the
final four minutes that, if we stuck together as a team, we can pull a win
out.  
  
Q. Syracuse has had one less single ‑digit game than you guys. You both are
very similar in that regard.   
DEVIN OLIVER: Yeah, Syracuse started the year off very well. They're a good
team. They have a lot of veteran guys on this team, and then a freshman who
was very composed near the end of the game. So it's no surprise that a lot of
their games have finished up close, but with them pulling out the wins.  
THE MODERATOR: Appreciate your time, guys. Good luck tomorrow.  
Joined by Dayton head coach Archie Miller.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you learn about Syracuse while watching them in Maui?  
COACH MILLER: They're big. They're really, really well coached and good. We
didn't spend a ton of time watching them, just the eye test because the Maui
games are back to back. Saw them really one time because we played Cal and
they did, as well.  
Obviously, the size and the length and the zone can consume you if you let it.
I think offensively they have a lot of guys individually they can isolate on
you, really talented.  
But it's a typical Syracuse team. They're very good, and they're very big.
You're going to have to be organized. They thrive on the steals. They thrive
on the defense creating offense.  
Down the other end, they really have some game changers in terms of Cooney,
Fair, and they're really good off the glass at times as well with Grant. We
have our work cut out for us.  
  
Q. Coach, yesterday in the first half, I think it was like seven ‑minute,
maybe a little bit longer stretch of continuous basketball, no media
time‑outs, no nothing. How does a stretch like that affect the play on the
court? How does it affect you as a coach? Does that change anything that you
do? Did it change your mindset? Because it's very rare that seven minutes go
by without any sort of stoppage or whistle.   
COACH MILLER: Sometimes when the four‑minute medias go over, guys are gassed,
more so on offense when they're not running the floor, than they do on
defense. During those stretches, guys are trying hard.  
I think where they rest the most on those stretches when they're gassed is
running the floor on offense. You're looking to get subs in the game. You're
hoping to get to the media as fast as you can to get the subs.  
We've had a few games this season where that's happened. It goes five or six
minutes, and you almost have to get all five out.  
You just keep an eye on it. I think it suffers more on offense than it does on
defense.  
  
Q. And just as a followup if I could, what does that say about the quality
and the high level of play during yesterday's game that there was that much
time eclipsed with no stoppage, no whistle, no foul, or nothing?  
COACH MILLER: Both teams obviously have been through the battles, and I think
the guys on the floor are conditioned at this point to play as many minutes as
they possibly can. I also think the stage, the adrenaline that's out there
now, that helps you.  
One thing about the NCAA Tournament, when you do get a couple of medias,
they're longer than normal. So you get a little extra rest.  
I thought our guys handled it well. I thought we played all the way through
the finish, just like Ohio State did.  
  
Q. Coach, in the nonconference, you guys saw a lot of zone. It's not
Syracuse's zone, but is there anything that you can take from those
experiences to prepare you for tomorrow?  
COACH MILLER: Yeah, I mean, obviously, your team has to evolve as the season
goes, and you want to improve on everything. I didn't think we saw a lot of
zone in the A‑10 this year. Usually, you see a little bit more. In
nonconference, I don't think we saw a lot of man‑to‑man.  
So we've corrected things. I think we have a different way of attacking the
zone now as we did in the nonconference.  
The main thing for me is we want the team to be confident in what we do. We're
not going to change a lot. One thing is we have to amp up our pace of play.
When we play against the zone, we have to play as fast as we do against the
man. That's the comfort level of our kids. That's the one thing we've got to
do tomorrow, that game's got to be on the run.  
  
Q. Archie, a lot's been made about your conference affiliation. We've got
three sort of Big East teams here tomorrow playing. How much does that really
matter, and how much is it really just about you building a schedule and a
program? Does the conference affiliation really matter to get you here?  
COACH MILLER: I think the conference is always something that you take great
pride in being in. In particular, I think the Atlantic 10 is underrated. Since
I became the head coach at Dayton, I can't recall the numbers, but I'm going
to say with six this year and at least four back‑to‑back years, that's 14
automatic bids, or 14 NCAA Tournament seeds, opportunities in three years.
There's very few leagues that can do that.  
And I think Bernadette has done an amazing job with the defections and some of
the conference alignments. The Atlantic 10 is as strong now as it ever was. As
it goes down the line and you look at the programs there, you've got great
coaches, and you've got great players that are a little bit older.  
I think there's a little chip on your shoulder when you're in the Atlantic 10,
usually because you're constantly left out of the BCS talk. I'm not sure how
many other teams got six bids.  
But when you build your schedule and you're building your program, everything
is revolved around the strength of your conference and what you're trying to
do.  
For us, we're trying to be where we're at right now. To do that, you have to
play a national schedule to the best of your ability. We've tried that. We had
to take the next step in our league, which we hadn't done in a while.  
I think this year, getting ten conference wins, being right there for maybe a
bye, we were a lot more confident this year in a good league.  
So for us, we're building a program. This is where we want to be, and we have
to build around our league. I think right now the great thing is we can build
a schedule around an at‑large bid league.  
  
Q. It's a later start. Is that a relief to you to have a 7:10 start as
opposed to like a noon start?  
COACH MILLER: Yeah, we get to last a little longer than everybody else
throughout the days, you know what I mean? A couple games go by, you're still
alive late in the day.  
I don't care when we play. We're excited to play in general. I think a 7:10
tip in here, the environment with Syracuse being here is going to be one heck
of a scene.  
  
Q. With all the distractions, all the attention the Flyers are getting
around the country today, how do you make it just about basketball the next 24
hours?  
COACH MILLER: Stay with what we do. We don't talk about anything. There's
enough coverage right now on television. They can hear it. There's enough. We
don't have to talk about anything.  
It's around them all the time, whether they're reading Twitter, whatever
they're going to do, they're going to be around noise. For us to bring up
noise, that's not what we do. We don't talk about anything other than the job
at hand.  
Proud of our guys for the way they've handled, in particular, the last month.
I thought coming into yesterday we did a really good job of being ready to go.
I want to be ready to go on Saturday. So we're going to stay with what we do.  
  
Q. Coach, I noticed your dad is up here making the trip, not with Sean in
Arizona. I know he hates the cold up here in Buffalo. What does he bring here
for you just to have your dad around.  
COACH MILLER: He's my dad. He spent just a crazy amount of time with us
growing up. To me, hopefully, he's enjoying this as a father. He's really not
a coach anymore. He's around our guys. He's around my daughter. I'm just happy
that he's able to see us.  
He spends a lot of time, obviously, through the ranks here with Sean and a
couple of his big runs. It's good for him to see, so to speak, the success
that we've had. He's been in Arizona the last couple months. He obviously saw
how their run has been going. He's caught us at a really good time as well.  
I'm just happy he's here to see it. It's always good to watch him be around
us.  
  
Q. Coach, one of the ways you're distinct from Syracuse is to the extent you
use your bench. I thought maybe you could explain how that's come about.
Obviously, style of play plays into it, and what are the pros and cons of
it?  
COACH MILLER: When we started off this season, we were going to be an
unfamiliar group. Early on, we weren't going to have very good chemistry.  
We had four freshmen that turned to sophomores. Brought in three new freshmen.
Four guys sitting out. That's nine players who haven't played many games. It
was going to be difficult to figure out the rotation. We had two seniors
stepping into lead roles.  
We were very new to one another. To be honest, it was trial by error early. We
didn't have a rotation early that was comfortable. We almost lost to IPFW at
home in our home opener because we literally had ten individuals that didn't
know what was going on.  
I thought very early what we needed to become was a group that could beat you
a lot of different ways with a the lot of different people. To do that, we had
to trust a sacrifice like a Vee Sanford made, like he's going to take a step
back and go on the bench and come in with Scoochie Smith because he's a
freshman. You get a little more ball handling with Scootch. We try that out,
and lo and behold, that got those guys in sync.  
A guy like Kyle Davis can come in and win you games. Kendall Pollard needed to
develop. We weren't real deep in our wing spot. We needed to keep him coming.  
What you do is file them in there. Irregardless of rotation, you file them in
there, and, bang, you have a good game, and that helps you get through the
season.  
Our depth has been basically a quest to keep our team together. The
camaraderie we have is a big deal. It's why we've gotten to this point is
because our guys like one another. They're together. They're tough. We have
good camaraderie.  
We've been able to practice at a high level late in the year, which is tough
because we have guys getting in the games. The secret sort of the method to
what we've done is there's a the lot of different guys that can help you win
the game, and that's just kind of the way we do it.  
  
Q. What about from your perspective allows them to keep teams from playing
fast and getting transition baskets.  
COACH MILLER: I think one thing is obviously, you know, they get back. They
get back. They get set. Sometimes people act like you've got to beat the zone
down the floor. Sometimes those guys are running to the same spot 70 times in
a game. They know what they're doing.  
But part of it is, obviously, I think, their size. They have great size, and
quickness and length. And I do think that sometimes when you play against a
zone for 40 minutes, it changes you a little bit. You want to execute. You
don't want to shoot quick. You're not going to get the same looks you're going
to get against the man‑to‑man. It's different. It takes more time as well.  
Sometimes you can push it as fast as you want. You're just not going to get
anything because the same looks you usually get aren't there.  
  
Q. And can you get into the 60's again?  
COACH MILLER: The 60's? I don't know. They do a great job of holding you down.
Yesterday I thought we'd have a hard time scoring against Ohio State, and we
did, but we were able to win because of our defense a little bit. I think
tomorrow will be similar.  
I don't know what the score of the game is going to be, but I know this, our
defense has got to be just as good as it's been the last two or three weeks to
play against them.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, good luck tomorrow. Have a great time.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Connecticut student‑athletes Niels Giffey and
Shabazz Napier. Congrats, guys, on the win last night.  
  
Q. Shabazz, over the past couple of years, how much has your chemistry and
your relationship playing with Boatright grown?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: It's grown a lot. Always ups and downs. Even when I was
playing with Kemba, there's always ups and downs. You're going to struggle
because you want the ball in your hand, and you know how to play with the ball
in your hand. Sometimes it's hard to figure out how not to play with the ball
in your hand.  
We've grown. A lot of these guys, you see us arguing and think it's a big
thing. That's just a little bump in the road. We don't really take it further
than that.  
We understand we need each other to win games. I wouldn't want to be on nobody
else's team besides his.  
  
Q. Niels and Shabazz, if you could just talk about the two or three games
that you've played against Villanova in your career, that great overtime game
in Philadelphia a couple of years ago, the game at XL Arena last year, what
you remember about it. They have a lot of the same guys. What you remember
about Villanova.  
NIELS GIFFEY: They are one of the typical former Big East teams, real scrappy,
really aggressive. I know they played a double‑team, and they trap on defense.
So they really try to bring the game to you. They're not going to just sit
back and relax and wait for stuff to fall. They're trying to bring it at you.
That's just the kind of basketball we expect.  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: Same thing. Villanova, they've got great guards. They've got a
great player in JayVaughn Pinkston. He's been playing outstanding for them.
They've got a great coach.  
That tradition is rich. They're always going to have a lot of aggressiveness
and passion. At this stage, you want to move on. You're going to do whatever
it takes.  
Like Niels said, they're going to be scrappy. That's what a Big East team is
about, to be scrappy and aggressive. We're going to be ready for it. We've got
to deliver the first punch.  
  
Q. Shabazz, how much of an advantage do you think it is being familiar with
Villanova, having played them over the past few years, especially when you
only have one day to prepare?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: It's kind of funny because, you know, even though we played
against Villanova, they're a whole different team. This is a new season. Their
players are much more experienced, and we have not played any of their guys.  
They've been playing real well throughout the whole season. So definitely it's
not going to be new in the sense of Connecticut playing Villanova, but it's
going to be new in the sense of the plays they run and how well they run it or
the experience that the guards have. So it definitely, that's what's going to
be different.  
I don't think anything we done two years ago they're going to sit back and
remember because they understand we've gotten better, they've gotten better.
We've just got to go out there, and as soon as the ball gets tipped up in the
air, the Xs and Os are going to be flying.  
But the team that's going to be giving the most effort, the most
aggressiveness on the court are going to end up winning because that's what
Big East is all about.  
  
Q. One quick followup from that game two years ago, what do you remember
about that buzzer beater you hit in Wells Fargo Center against Nova?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: Oh, the game. Oh, oh, oh. It was a close game. It was
definitely a big shot. The first thing is I remember the commentator. I think
his name is Bill Raftery. After I hit the shot, he said, Onions. That's one
thing I definitely remember after I watched SportsCenter that day.  
  
Q. Shabazz, when you got to UConn, did you ever envision yourself as a guy
who would at one point in your career lead your team in points, assists,
rebounds?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: No. I wasn't thinking too far ahead. I just wanted to play
basketball, to play the game I know how to play with effort and love and
passion for the game.  
Sometimes when you go out there and just play with all your effort and give it
your all. Sometimes it shows up on the stats.  
But I'm not a stat guy. I don't really care too much about leading my
teammates in all the stats. The thing I care about is leading my team. All the
intangibles that don't show up on the stat sheet. That's my biggest thing.  
I'm just happy that I'm in this position to play with these guys and create
this brotherhood that we continue to have.  
  
Q. Is there a sense of pride? You don't see a lot of guards your size that
lead in rebounds and stuff like that. Sort of as this team has evolved, have
you sort of become whatever they need you to be?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: Yeah, I just want to win. I don't really care if it didn't
show up on the stat sheet. I just want to win games. I'm able to get rebounds.
I'm able to do the things that my teammates need me to do.  
I don't think I'm better than anybody on my team in rebounding. I don't think
I'm better than anybody on my team in scoring. I just think that sometimes I'm
fortunate enough to make the shots, fortunate enough to get the rebounds, and
just move on from it, you know.  
  
Q. Niels, how much has Amida improved from the beginning to the end of the
season?  
NIELS GIFFEY: He's really matured a lot on and off the court. You've got to
understand that he's not, like a lot of us, played basketball for his whole
life, I think. He's been playing basketball for three or four years now.  
You can really see his improvement within the first couple of months. Just him
understanding the game better and how we play and the team concept and him
just using his abilities and sometimes understanding where he's got to take
steps back with his shot blocking abilities in order to get rebounds. Just
understanding his overall position in the game. He's going to continue to make
big steps in that direction.  
  
Q. Shabazz, I guess there's been some reports that Coach Calhoun might be
interested in coming back to coach maybe at BC or somewhere else. Would you
like to see him come back? Do you still think he has a lot to give as a coach
if he did?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: To answer the second one, yeah, he has so much to give. He's a
talented man on and off the court.  
Would I like for him to come back?  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: Would I like for him to come back in general? Yeah. It's up to
him at the end of the day. He's a grown man. He's been away from basketball
coaching‑wise for a while, and when you hit a couple years from coaching, you
kind of forgot whether you want to stay in coaching or not.  
If he feels like he wants to get back in coaching, then so be it. If he does,
wherever he goes, I'm going to be a fan of that team. Hopefully, when I'm done
with my career, he'll give me a job (smiling).  
I think he's an intelligent man, like I said. I can't stress that enough. He
knows basketball, the ins and outs.  
If he decides to do so, I'm going to be one of his biggest fans and support
him.  
  
Q. Shabazz, that was the question I was going to ask, so I'll ask the same
of Niels about Coach Calhoun. Were you surprised about the talk that he has
serious interest in coming back?  
NIELS GIFFEY: Well, he actually asked me a similar question a little bit down
the stretch when he looked into getting involved with certain national teams.
You know, you can just feel his desire to be involved in basketball because he
loves this game and he's such a great basketball mind. You know, he's such a
great resource for us, just having him in the office in Connecticut and always
having him there on the sidelines.  
To be honest, at this point, I just want him to be happy. If that's the
decision he makes, like Shabazz already said, we're going to be his number one
supporters. If that's his desire, I'm going to support him 100 percent with
that.  
  
Q. Shabazz, it's almost not a compliment these days to talk about guys as
four ‑year players, especially young kids don't understand the value of that.
As far as your game having become as well‑rounded as it's become and you're
the Player of the Year now in the league because you've got that experience.
What is the value, if you want to tell kids, about being a four‑year college
guy?   
SHABAZZ NAPIER: I really can't sum it up in a few sentences. I think, at the
end of the day, you get to play the game you love for so many years, and
that's it. My mother always told me, One thing no one can take from you is
your education. I took that to heart. I feel, as a four‑year player, you learn
a lot, a lot of things that you may not get the chance to learn on the next
level.  
You may not develop as much as you need to develop. A lot of kids struggle
with understanding that. I'm kind of way ahead of my years the way I think
sometimes. It has a lot to do with the way I grew up. I never wanted to
believe all the hype that I was given when I was younger. I wanted to always
stay humble and always stay ready for any opportunity.  
I just feel like, basketball‑wise, there's always room for development.
Outside of basketball, you get a free scholarship to this university, you've
got to take advantage of that. Some people come back, once they leave, come
back and get their degree, but I'm the type of guy I have to stay in class. I
have to be in class to understand whatever I'm trying to learn. If I'm not in
class, it's a hard task for me to do.  
I think it was definitely very important for me to get my degree. I think that
Niels, too. It's just something you can have to show your grandchildren, you
show your children. This is a beautiful thing. People may not understand that,
but ten years down the line when you show your grandchildren your degree,
you're like this is special.  
At the end of the day, that's what you want to be known of, somebody that
stayed loyal and somebody who had their degree at the end of the day.  
  
Q. Shabazz, I know you're a fan of the tournament. Just what are your
thoughts, your general impressions so far as the first few days of this
tournament? Louisville struggled, Duke lost. What are your thoughts as a fan
of this?  
NIELS GIFFEY: Duke lost?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: Duke lost?  
THE MODERATOR: Duke lost, yeah, to Mercer.  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: Oh, wow!  
THE MODERATOR: I like your focus. You haven't been paying attention.  
NIELS GIFFEY: No, I haven't.  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: Wow!  
That's just how the tournament is. Just on any given day, Duke can lose.
Louisville could have lost.  
Who did they play? Mercer?  
THE MODERATOR: Mercer.  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: That's a good team.  
Any given day, it doesn't matter. All it takes is a good 40‑minute game from
one team, and you're on to the next level. That's why it's called March
Madness. So much madness involved in this tournament.  
You've got to take the best of your opportunities. Some teams don't take the
best of their opportunities that they seed, I'm a 2 seed, I'm a 1 seed, and
it's a 16 seed, we're going to blow by them.  
No.  
Throughout the whole season, you've seen teams losing to, you know, less than
power conference teams. It's just part of basketball.  
The only thing that sums it up is, what it's called? It's called March Madness
for a reason.  
NIELS GIFFEY: That was great.  
  
Q. Shabazz, just want to ask you, you went over last night to the Saint
Joe's bench and shook hands with Galloway and Roberts before the game was
over. Why did you do that?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: Like I said before, I think the biggest thing this game does
is creates a type of competitiveness that you would want to see in your
opponent, which then showers over the respect that you have for that person.  
I was just telling Galloway, I have so much respect for him, that he worked so
hard. As a senior, you don't want to go out with a loss. At the end of the
day, you want to go out with a win. At the end of the day, someone has to be a
loser.  
I just wanted to show him, tell him that I felt like he played his heart out
today and I respect him for that, and I respected his whole team for that. You
know, that gave us a big run.  
But our team, we never doubted each other. We just wanted to push hard. At the
end of the day, when you play an opponent, that's what you want. You don't
want somebody that's going to bend over. You want somebody that's going to
fight you back.  
I just wanted to tell him I respected him for that. I think, at the end of the
day, he understood that. Justthat's it.  
THE MODERATOR: Niels, Shabazz, thanks so much. Good luck tomorrow.  
Joined by Connecticut head coach Kevin Ollie.  
Coach, congrats on the victory last night.  
  
Q. Kevin, you have good guards. They have good guards. How do you see the
matchup at that position, and also, with regard to Villanova's ability to
shoot the three?  
COACH OLLIE: They're a great, amazing three‑point shooting team. I think
they've taken probably, I think, top ten in three‑point attempts. I think
they're in the top five of made three‑point field goal shooting teams.  
So we're going to have our work cut out for us. We've got to run them off the
three‑point line. We've got to play Pinkston down low. He's a great player
also. That's what gives them their balance, and that's what makes them tough
to guard.  
Jay does a wonderful job exploiting matchups. So we're going to have to be
able to be matched up and play our type of basketball and just play with
energy and passion. Hopefully, we can come out with the win tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Feel like a Big East reunion in some ways? Boeheim's here, and now you're
playing Villanova. Does it feel that way?  
COACH OLLIE: You know, it's a great feeling. I don't care who we're playing
with. We want to get to the next round. It's great to see Jay. It's great to
see a foe that we've had so many battles against. Villanova's a great team.
We're going to go out there and play.  
But we're worried about and concerned about UConn and our keys to the game.
We're going to go out and play our type of basketball. Whoever we was matched
up in this round, we was going to have to go out there and play and do a great
job on the offensive and defensive end.  
I feel like I'm a part of the Big Five now. I played Saint Joe's and
Villanova. I guess LaSalle is coming up next. No, I'm just playing.  
  
Q. Kevin, does it help to be familiar with an opponent at this time of year?
I mean, you just played them a year ago.  
COACH OLLIE: Yeah. I mean, they're a different team. Their guys are playing
with more confidence. They're a year older. We're a year older. The last time
we played, I believe we had an 11‑point lead. Then in the second half, they
kind of took over the game and got some offensive rebounds.  
Archie was outstanding. I think he had 25 points. I think that was his high as
a freshman. So we're going to have to keep him in check. We're going to have
to keep everybody else in check. Knowing that we're playing a great opponent.
It's going to be a war.  
That's how we play. Villanova plays the same way. We're going to challenge
each shot. We're going to challenge each dribble. It's going to be a fight. We
got to be ready for that, and we got to keep throwing punches.  
  
Q. Amida says you're on him a lot to get rebounds. It took a while to try to
help them. How much extra work goes into a guy who just recently started
playing ball compared to some other guys?  
COACH OLLIE: We owe them a lot. I used to hate when the coach didn't say
nothing to me. That means I wasn't a part of the rotation or anything. I'm
going to be on those guys. We need him to rebound. We need him to be our best
rebounder.  
You know, I take it personal. If I'm a big and the point guard is leading us
in rebounding, I'm going to take that personal. So I'm going to go out there
and get those crucial rebounds.  
That offensive rebound, I was on him the whole game. If he was on our
sideline, I was on him. He went out of his area and got that offensive
rebound. I'm so glad he didn't pay attention to me because I was screaming,
Throw the ball out, and I'm glad he didn't. He made that jump hook and got
that and one. It was just a big moment. He stepped up to the free‑throw line
and the emotion he showed.  
That's what this tournament is all about. Other guys making plays. That's what
shows you a true good team when other guys can step up. It's not always Ryan.
It's not always Shabazz. Amida did a great job, and he grew up last night, I
believe.  
  
Q. Coach, if you look at your whole season now that you've played 35 games
and you had to say the biggest two to three strengths of your ball club
overall. Second part of that, maybe your guys struggled. What are the areas
that you guys had to grow in the most that hurt you throughout the year?  
COACH OLLIE: Our rebounds have been up and down. Earlier in the season, we
wasn't rebounding the ball particularly well. We got in conference, and I
don't know what got into us. We started rebounding the ball like no other. And
then it dipped down towards the end of the season. It's always rebounding the
basketball.  
We get the crucial ones. When we need to get a rebound, we get those. I think
that's the important thing, too. We're growing, and we're learning, and we're
going to get those tough rebounds.  
There's been some inconsistencies that we had. Some of the great things, we
shoot the ball phenomenally well from the three‑point line. That's what's been
saving us, having no turnovers. That's going to be very crucial against
Villanova with their different defensive packages they throw at you.  
And also, getting to the free‑throw line, converting on the free‑throw line. I
believe we're probably top ten in the nation and number one in our conference
in free‑throw shooting.  
That's a big part of the tournament. You never know how fouls are going to get
called. Down the stretch, I think we made 15 out of 15 down the stretch.  
So it's a great attribute that we have as a team.  
  
Q. Kevin, Coach Calhoun's comments this morning, I was wondering if they
caught you off guard at all? If he were to come back, would it be tricky for
you to have your mentor in the game again and perhaps even in your own
backyard?  
COACH OLLIE: No, it wouldn't be tricky for me. It would be great. If that's
what he wants to do, more power to him. I'm always going to support Coach.  
I haven't heard about it until today, but if that's what he wants do, I'm
going to be supporting him. I know he got passion for the game.  
I know he's enjoying his vacations he's taking in January playing golf. I
don't know if he wants to pass up on those.  
But if he wants to get back in the game, more power to him. He earns that
right. He earns that respect. Whatever he wants to do, he has my prayers and
my best wishes.  
  
Q. Boeheim didn't want to talk about Big East reunions either. He said it's
like talking about your ex ‑wife around your new wife. So is that kind of the
way it is? Have you talked nostalgically about the Big East, it's kind of a
knock on your current league?   
COACH OLLIE: No, I haven't really talked about it. We just talked about
Villanova. We've got to go out there and play a game.  
But it is. You feel familiarized with them. You played against them last year.
But at the end of the day, it's a basketball game. I don't care what league
we're playing against, we've got to go out there and play. I want UConn to be
out on top at the end of the game.  
So it's good for the media. It's good that they set it up. But at the end of
the day, we've got to go play.  
  
Q. Kevin, how has Shabazz turned into a guy who can lead this team in
scoring, lead this team in rebounding, lead this team in assists? He's almost
become an all ‑around guy that sort of fits all the pieces that you need him
to fit into.   
COACH OLLIE: Yeah, he's a winner. Whatever it takes for us to win, he puts
that burden on himself. When we were struggling rebounding, he got 11, 12
rebounds. If we struggling in moving the basketball, he becomes the perfect
facilitator for us.  
You've seen his ability at the end of the game, last game, where he could take
the game over and score 19 points in the second half. So he has that innate
ability to do whatever we need at any time. And he's not scared to fail, and I
think that's one of his biggest attributes. He's not scared of the moment.
He's not waiting for his giants. He's going to meet them.  
That's what we all want to have. We want to have that power that we're going
to go out there and win the game and not look at, Oh, we make a mistake. I'm
going to be the one getting talked about.  
No, if I make a mistake, I'm going to go out there and prove that I'm going to
be a winner anyway. That's what I love about Shabazz.  
That's what I love about this team. They believe in one another. They believe
in Bazz. Bazz is a great leader, too. Those are the things that don't show up
on the stat sheet. He's just an awesome leader, and he's grown to that. That's
a tribute to him and his parents and what he believes as a student‑athlete,
how you need to conduct yourself on a daily basis.  
  
Q. Is that something that you saw in him when he got here? I mean, did you
think he could grow into this role? Is it something that's sort of happened
because of the makeup of this team?  
COACH OLLIE: I ain't going to lie. There was a couple that I was like, No, it
ain't never going to happen. There was a couple of those days. But most of the
times his freshman year, Kemba was there, but he was shadowing Kemba. He was
seeing how he was leading, but he still had a little rebellion in him a little
bit, wanted to do it his own way.  
But he understood you're not going to change UConn. UConn is going to change
you. He started to conform to that. And now you see him grow into a great,
amazing leader, and you see everybody following him.  
When he showed that he has the leadership, he has the enthusiasm, everybody
falls in line. He's a great young man. He's going to be graduating on time
this spring. That's just a great, great, great goal for him. He just does
everything for our team. We all feed off his energy.  
He's matured a lot. That's great for our basketball team, but it's great for
him. It's great for him when he goes back to his community because a lot of
those guys don't get this opportunity. For him to come back and be a story
that kids can look up to, not just on basketball, but getting your degree, is
amazing, amazing thing that he can share in his legacy that will live long
after he walks off the Storrs campus.  
  
Q. Daniels, your starter, can you describe his offensive game and defensive
game? Break him down a little bit. Then talk about your bench as a whole and
how they've played the last two or three weeks and how you sort of see your
bench as your overall team, them fitting in.  
COACH OLLIE: Yeah, I'll just talk about DeAndre a little bit. He's been coming
along. He's been a little inconsistent this year, and we just talk to him
about getting touches. The more touches he gets, the better offensive player
he becomes. Touches could be a deflection. Touches can be an offensive or
defensive rebound. Touch can be a charge, anything like that that's making our
team win.  
He's starting to do that. He had a great conference tournament, and then he
brought it over here in the first round. He's an inside basketball player.
He's a mismatch nightmare when his game is on. We can manipulate the defense,
take him down on the post. He can pick and pop, and we try to utilize him in a
lot of different ways.  
My bench has definitely been a spark plug for us lately with Amida coming off
the bench, also Lasan Kromah coming off the bench and Terrence Samuel coming
off the bench giving us a change of tempo and allowing me to rest my guards a
little bit.  
  
Q. Kevin, Shabazz hit that buzzer beater against Villanova two years ago. It
was kind of his first big collegiate shot. Did you know before that he kind of
had that clutch gene in him that he wasn't going to be afraid in the big
moment, or did you kind of learn something about him that night?  
COACH OLLIE: No, I knew he had that gene in him just watching him in practice.
Like I told you many times, when I first started working him out, he was
telling Kemba what to do. And I was like, What's this little freshman telling
Kemba where to shoot at. He just had that moxie about himself. Coming from his
neighborhood, Mission Hills, you're going to have to have a little something
in you. You're not going to make it out of there.  
He always has something. He had a quiet confidence. Then he also had a
confidence that 'I'm supposed to be here.' We like our student‑athletes to
have that kind of confidence, especially our basketball players because if you
come to Connecticut, you've got to expect competition. That's what it's all
about. That's what Coach bred in all of us.  
You've got to expect competition, and competition, it leads to success. He
wasn't afraid of the competition, if it was Kemba, if it was Jeremy,[] he was
going to go out there and play good, solid basketball.  
I think that allowed him, when he was able to face the Villanovas and the
Syracuses, to step up and face those big moments because he was challenged in
practice every day.  
  
Q. How can the way you won last night, coming back and winning in overtime,
how can that help you going forward into the next game?  
COACH OLLIE: Just winning. Just being in those types of moments. We was down
by four with three minutes to go. I believe it was 3:10 to go. I know a lot of
people had their doubts that we can come back and win. Gavin, you follow this
team enough, so you know what we're made of. We know how we are a resilient
group. We go through different problems, but the bigger the problem, the
bigger the destiny, I believe.  
We've gone through everything. I believe in these kids. They believe in
themselves. Til that last zero goes, we're going to play. That's the great
thing about this team.  
We made plays at the end like we always do, and we got in overtime, and it's
like our time. That's when the light's the brightest. Once again, we won an
overtime game.  
  
Q. Kevin, with Ryan Boatright's first three ‑point last night, Shabazz
passed you on the school's career assist list. Your thoughts about Shabazz
moving ahead of you to number 3 all‑time.   
COACH OLLIE: Nobody remembers number 4. Nobody's going to remember. It's
always one, two, three to the media guys. That was my last ride with the media
guide. I don't think we're even doing media guides anymore. That was my last
time being in the media guide.  
  
Q. You mentioned Villanova's ability to shoot the ball from the outside, but
lately they've been struggling. How much stock do you put in what they've done
the last few games versus their track record for the entire season?  
COACH OLLIE: I don't put a lot of stock in that. It's not like we're going to
sit on their shooters. We're going to be right in their face. We want them to
continue to struggle. That's the respect we have for a great three‑point
shooting team.  
I look at the body of their work. If they're creating good shots, they're
going to knock those shots down. We've got to get back in transition. That's
where I think they really hurt teams.  
Yeah, they're a great three‑point shooting team, but they get out on the
break. I don't care if you throw it in the stands somewhere. Don't have no
live turnovers because they convert it to easy buckets. That's our first and
foremost thing.  
Of course, run them off the three‑point line. And we've got to keep Archie in
front of us, Arcidiacono. We've got to keep him in front of us. He really
destroyed us at XL Center when we played Villanova last year.  
He's doing the same thing. He's not shooting at that high of a level when he
scored 25 points against us, but he gets in the thick of the defense, and he
just makes the right plays over and over and over again. We've got to really
do a good job containing him.  
  
Q. Coach, when Shabazz was asked about Coach Calhoun possibly coming back,
he joked about after his playing days were done, he'd go to him asking for a
job. Do you think he has that coaching gene in him, and do you think that he
can be like yourself and he can transition right from player to coach?  
COACH OLLIE: I'm going to play him a little bit more. So he's going to be
working for me. We're going to be fighting for Shabazz whenever he get into
coaching because he's got a great basketball IQ and he knows the game inside
and out.  
I think he got enough fire to motivate guys and get them to the next level,
kind of that same gene as Coach had and I'm trying to have. It's the same
thing.  
You know, he wasn't McDonald's All‑American coming out of high school, so you
always have a chip on your shoulder. I play with that same chip on my
shoulder. I coach with that same chip on my shoulder. I think he's going to
have that same gene. If he decides to get into coaching, it's going to be a
war. Me and Coach is going to have a sitdown.  
Hopefully, I'll be able to have him look in his back pocket and pull out a
little more money so we can get him on our side.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks. Good luck tomorrow.

### [Baye Moussa Keita](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25953)

  
_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Syracuse student‑athletes C.J. Fair and Baye
Moussa Keita. Guys, congrats. We'll take questions for them at this time.  
  
Q. Dayton, a lot of guys, a lot of different faces you're going to have to
match up with. What's the preparation been like so far?  
C.J. FAIR: You know, today in practice we're going to go over a lot of the
tendencies against the zone. We know they've got a lot of different players
that can do multiple things.  
Dayton is a tough matchup, but we're going to prepare as much as possible for
the game tomorrow.  
BAYE MOUSSA KEITA: Dayton is a tough matchup. We see them play a little bit at
the end of regulation against Baylor in Maui, but we didn't have a chance to
watch them play the whole entire tournament.  
We've got to go through their offense and see the faces we're going to match
up to tomorrow.  
  
Q. I know you guys have the game a little bit out of hand in the second
half. You guys got some rest. Does that really affect you guys going into
tomorrow playing a team that plays 10, 11 guys when you guys are only playing
7, sometimes 8?  
BAYE MOUSSA KEITA: I think that doesn't make a difference because we're just
going to go ahead and play our game. It doesn't matter if they play 9, 10,
guys, and we play 7 or 6. I think everyone is going to play their game, play
the hardest we can. I think we're just going to play smart and just play the
game.  
C.J. FAIR: Yeah, they have their style. We have our style. They rotate a lot
of guys in and out frequently. For us, we play our starters the majority of
the game. But it's been effective that way. So I don't see no problem with it.  
  
Q. Baye, we've seen you and Trevor get in a lot of foul trouble in the
latter part of the problem. How do you guys fix that problem? Why do you think
that's happening?  
BAYE MOUSSA KEITA: Foul trouble, we play as hard as we can. Every foul we
have, we're going to use it and put the guys on the line if we can. Everybody
thinks about, Oh, you're getting in foul trouble, you're getting in foul
trouble. We're just going to play the game.  
We don't go into the game thinking we're going to get in foul trouble. We just
play the game. Every game you're going to have inside presence somehow. So
we're just going to go ahead and play the game and not worry about the foul
trouble. If you worry about it, you're not going to play to the best of your
ability.  
  
Q. If you're getting three or four, you're not thinking, Oh, I'm going to
get my fifth, you just play the same way?  
BAYE MOUSSA KEITA: It's kind of a little bit tough if I'm out and Rak has four
fouls and Jerami might be in playing center. But if that's what we have to do,
we're going to do it.  
  
Q. C.J. and Baye, as seniors, how do you help the younger guys prepare for
playing two games in three days on this kind of stage since you've been
through it before?  
C.J. FAIR: I mean, it's tournament time really. We don't really need to say
much. Everyone in the locker room wants to win. You know, we have some
experience in the beginning of our season where we was in Hawaii, and we
played three games three days in a row. So coming into this tournament, it's
not a lot of time to get rest, but everyone is going to be eager to play.  
BAYE MOUSSA KEITA: We started out the season going to Canada and played three
tough games there. After that, go to Maui and play three other tough games.
Been playing all the tough games throughout the season.  
The guys, like I said, they're mentally ready, and they know it's tournament
time. There's not a lot of things to say. They know everybody in the locker
room is ready to play and get your rest. I think everybody got their rest, and
we're just going to go ahead and play the game.  
  
Q. Dayton talked about the importance of getting some easy baskets against
you guys. Just what is the key for you guys to being so good at limiting,
being in transition, defense in transition?  
C.J. FAIR: We do a good job of getting back. Since we play zone, we can just
run back to our area. We don't want them to penetrate our area. We don't want
them to penetrate the zone.  
So our guards do a good job of stopping the fast break. By the time that
happens, our forwards are back, and we can regroup from there.  
BAYE MOUSSA KEITA: Same thing, we play zone. So getting back, it isn't going
to be a challenge because everybody know exactly where they have to be. Coming
down the floor, I know I have to be right in the middle. I don't have to worry
about it. If that was man‑to‑man, we'd have to worry about who we're guarding.
The guards are going to stop and take out our defense. So we put our defense
in and just help.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys, for your time. Good luck tomorrow.  
With Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim. We'll just take questions at this time.  
  
Q. Jim, you're probably sick of this, but UConn, Villanova, you, three of
the last four teams. I even thought Providence might have got here. It's a
little bit like a Big East reunion for you.  
COACH BOEHEIM: I've only looked at Dayton, so I can't help you with that one.
They're good teams. Not surprising that they're here and playing.  
  
Q. So you are sick about hearing about the Big East?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Not really. I just don't think about it anymore. You've got to
move on. It's like you don't ask questions about someone's ex‑wife, do you?
There's a good reason for that. You can only get in trouble with answering
that question, if you're married again.  
  
Q. Jim, everybody talks about pace, and they talked about liking to go and
liking to run and trying to do it their best. Is that something you try to
dictate in a game like that? How do you adjust that to what they like to do?  
COACH BOEHEIM: You know, if teams are going to hold the ball for the whole
shot clock, which we see sometimes, it's hard to get in a running game. You're
not going to probably be able to in those situations. You try to run when you
can. But it is difficult.  
Teams that play a little bit faster, then I think you can get up and down a
little bit better. But really, the pace of the game is dictated by whoever has
the basketball. You know, basically, that's the way it is.  
  
Q. Coach, what's it going to be like to see Allen Griffin on the other
sideline?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I'm not looking at Allen, don't worry. I know someplace on him
he's got something orange. It's not going to be in view, but his heart will be
for sure. He's a great kid, a great Syracuse kid. He's as good as we've ever
had. He's a great, great kid.  
  
Q. He said afterwards you guys are going to meet, and he's going to give you
a big hug. Looking forward to that?  
COACH BOEHEIM: We'll see what happens.  
  
Q. When you see what just happened to Duke, does that remind you of how
sudden things can happen at this time? Do you feel for Coach K?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Yeah, I watched the game, I watched almost the whole game.
Honestly, it's probably the only team in the country I haven't seen play this
year. I don't know how I missed them. Just watching them play, I thought they
were a better team.  
I didn't think this was like Duke playing bad or anything like that. Whoever
is playing Mercer is in trouble. That's what I think. Inside guard play, big
guys. I just think they're just a really good team.  
In this tournament, when you lose to a really good team, it can happen any
time, and that's just the way it is. That's the way this tournament is. It can
happen any time to any team in this tournament. It's as simple as that.  
You watch those games last night, and it was just a thread as to who was going
to be playing and who was going to be going home. That's what makes the
tournament great. It makes it heartbreaking for the teams that don't quite get
there. It's one play. It's one shot. One missed free throw. That's what it is.
It's very, very difficult.  
  
Q. Jim, at this portion of the tournament on the second day of the weekend,
how hard is that turnaround in terms of preparation and scouting?  
COACH BOEHEIM: You know I don't watch much tape, so it's not much difference
to me. I don't mind. It's the same for everybody. You got to get your team
ready.  
As long as it's the same for everybody, it's fine.  
  
Q. During the month the tournament is going on and you're in it, how much do
you watch of other games? If you do, do you watch as a fan? Do you watch as a
coach?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I watch all the games. I always do. I always have. You only
think so much about your game. You've got to get that done. We have our
scouting report.  
We haven't talked to the players yet about Dayton. If you ask them a question
about Dayton, I don't know what they'll do because we haven't done that yet.
We'll do that today at practice.  
We think Dayton's terrific. We happen to see them play in person in Hawaii
three times. So we know how good they are before we ever got here.  
But I watch all the games. Go out to dinner. We'll get ready for tomorrow
night.  
  
Q. You had an early start yesterday, late start tomorrow. Do you have a
preference? Does it make a difference?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I kind of like the 4:00 game where you're not too early, not
too late. It's fine. Whatever, you know. It's good. 7:00's fine. I'm good with
that.  
  
Q. Coach, with some schools it's a celebration of getting in the tournament,
some winning a game. You guys have won so much. Sweet 16 has been a place
you've been a lot. Not that people won't be excited, but that celebration if
you were to win tomorrow, that some schools obviously would have more than
maybe yours, because you've put this team in this position so many times?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Yeah, I mean, everybody has different expectations and
different, you know, goals or where they want to go. It's just the way it kind
of is.  
My feeling is if we play well, whatever that game is, and if we lose, we lose.
You might not play well. That's just the way this tournament is. There's no
predicting it.  
There was no predicting that we would play the way we played yesterday. I
thought that would be a difficult game coming into it. Things just went right
for us, and the game changed quickly early.  
The one thing, as you get old like I am, you know it's going to be
disappointing if you lose. You just have to learn to live with it. I'm not
sure I've quite learned that yet, but I'm optimistic that at some point in
time I might learn how to deal with it better. But I don't know if you ever
do. Probably never do learn how to.  
That's the nature of this tournament. It's just such a great, great
tournament. It really is. But it's such a real kind of false indication of
what you are. I remember when we won, we were 18 points down to Oklahoma
State, and it was like one of those games you think, Well, let's try not to
get beat by 30 here. We came back and won. That was the biggest scare we had
in the tournament.  
You just never know. We could be out in that game and not able to go on and do
what you did.  
  
Q. Jim, I just wonder what you know about Archie Miller, real young coach.  
COACH BOEHEIM: I've known him a long time. I saw him on the Tonight Show when
he was 6 (smiling).  
He's a great coach. I think he's done a great coaching job. I said earlier in
the year when we saw him, you know, you watch teams on TV, get a certain feel,
but when you watch them in person, like we did in Maui, which you can't do
anymore. You can't scout people anymore, but we watched him over there because
of the tournament.  
I'm just impressed with how hard his team plays, how they play together. Just
a really, really well‑coached team. He's done a tremendous job coaching that
team.  
  
Q. Jim, do you have any theories on shooters, why they get on streaks, off
streaks? Why a guy like Cooney is suddenly making them?  
COACH BOEHEIM: The thing about shooters, I like the ones that don't think
much, or maybe can't think much is even a better description, because they
just forget things. They forget what happened or what didn't happen. They just
get the next shot. And the best shooters, those are the guys.  
They want that shot, they're going to take it, and they don't think about
anything except getting that shot up there, and they think they're going to
make every one. That's what the great ones do. They just get in that mode.  
You know, there's not really a lot of great shooters. I mean, guys like Reggie
Miller. If he gets ten shots, on a bad night he's going to make four, and on a
good night, he's going to make seven. There aren't many guys like that.
There's very, very few like that can really shoot the basketball that way.  
Like I watched Kevin Durant and Carmelo during the Olympics, these guys make
18, 19 out of 23 in shooting drills. College kids, if they make 10, we call
them great shooters. These guys make 19 out of 20 like 10 times. If Kevin
Durant makes 15 out of 20, well, look at the ball because there's something
wrong with the ball there. That's just not right.  
But those guys, they go up. They believe they're going to make every shot. The
worst thing is when the shooter starts thinking about it, and some shooters,
you'll see them change their shot a little bit, try to aim it a little bit.
Those guys are never going to be good.  
You've got to get set. You've got to take the same shot every time. That's
really the key to being a great shooter. You watch the great shooters, they
shoot the same shot every time.  
Too many guys don't. They're moving. They're sliding. Too many different
things. Trevor's a really good shooter, and I'm confident that when we get him
good shots, he's going to make them.  
I'm very confident in that until the game's over and he doesn't.  
Thanks.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our last set of student‑athletes for the day from Villanova,
James Bell and Darrun Hilliard have joined us up at the dais. Guys, congrats
on the victory yesterday.  
  
Q. This is for both of you guys. You've played UConn several times, beat
them last year in the overtime game the year before. What's your take on them?
What are their strengths and weaknesses? How do you size them up as an
opponent?  
JAMES BELL: Great guard play, well coached, physical team, and it's just like
an old Big East game. It's going to be real physical, great pace, and just
going to be an all out good game.  
DARRUN HILLIARD: Like James says, just another Big East team. They've been out
of the league for only one year. It's just going to be another big time Big
East game, great guard play and a great coach. It's going to be an outstanding
game.  
  
Q. The two of you both sort of alluded to this, but they've only been a not
Big East team for one year. Is there any nostalgia playing these guys even
though it's only been one year, or is it too soon for that?  
JAMES BELL: I wouldn't say nostalgia. You miss the good teams in our league.
We have great teams in our league now, like Syracuse, Connecticut, they
brought an extra edge to our league that we kind of miss. It's just great
playing them again.  
DARRUN HILLIARD: Again, it's going to be a great game. It's good to see
another old Big East team make it this far. It's a great tribute to the old
Big East, and it will be a great game.  
  
Q. Darrun or James, what's it like a day later, you know, getting that first
game under your belt and getting the bit of a slow start and your approach now
to looking ahead to tomorrow and knowing your opponent?  
JAMES BELL: It's always good to get the first one. We always focus on our next
game. Our last game was a tough one. Great team. We weren't making shots, but
we did it with our defense. Now it's just time to focus on UConn, great team.
It should be a good game.  
DARRUN HILLIARD: It was just great. None of us had an NCAA win under our
belts. I mean, it's just a great accomplishment for a lot of us. Milwaukee's a
great team, and it was a hard fought game. It just feels pretty good to be
moving on.  
  
Q. Three ‑point shooting is always been one of the strengths of your team
throughout the regular season. It's been in a bit of a slump during the
postseason. Are you guys looking at tape or working more on fundamentals? How
do you propose to get three‑point shooting back to where it's been this
season?   
JAMES BELL: We've just got to take good ones. Some of the shots we were taking
were highly contested, were very highly contested. We've just got to find the
open ones. Make the extra pass, get our teammates better shots.  
We took some all right shots, but just finding the best ones.  
DARRUN HILLIARD: Same thing that James said, just finding the best shot. Our
shots we were taking yesterday, they were good shots, and we just weren't
making them.  
But we don't really worry about that. We just worry about getting stops on the
defensive end, and we're just going to keep working on making the extra pass
and getting better shots.  
  
Q. Can you guys just discuss the ability that Shabazz has and how difficult
a challenge he presents for you guys.  
JAMES BELL: He's a great player, a great point guard, gets everybody involved
as well as himself. He's a senior at this point, very experienced. Been in
this position before, just won a National Championship. He knows what it takes
to win. He's just a great opponent, one of the best players in the country.  
It should be interesting playing against him, trying to stop him.  
  
Q. Darrun, can you just talk about the development Kris has gone through
this year, just sort of how he's improved getting to campus to where he is
now.  
DARRUN HILLIARD: He made great improvements from the summertime until now with
dropping weight and getting his body to where it needs to be to compete at
this level. He's just been all in and didn't really complain about doing
anything we asked him to, that coach has asked him to. It's showing right now.  
Yesterday he had a great game. He's going to keep improving, and he's going to
be a great player in this program.  
  
Q. For both players, you know, we've talked about your struggles with the
three ‑point shot and shooting, but your defense has been getting better, too.
Is there a correlation that you're spending maybe more time and concentration
on defense?   
JAMES BELL: I wouldn't say we're spending more time. It's just what we're
focusing on. Shots will fall. If you play the percentages, maybe 1 out of 3
should drop. But defense should never change. Our effort or how tough we play,
how together we are should never change. That's what the foundation of our
program is, and that's what we try to focus on the most.  
Making or missing shots, it just happens.  
DARRUN HILLIARD: That's just the foundation of this program. Defensive
rebounding. We just pride ourselves on getting stops and rebounding the ball
and getting easy baskets.  
Like James said, the shots will fall, but we don't really pride ourselves on
that.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thanks for your time. Good luck tomorrow.  
Joined by Villanova head coach Jay Wright. Our last coach of the day.  
Coach, congrats on the win last night.  
COACH WRIGHT: After last night's game, I think our team learned a great lesson
in being able to win without shooting the ball. Now watching tape of
Connecticut and watching that game over again, that was an incredible game
last night, Saint Joe‑Connecticut. High level. Really well played.  
This is going to be a heck of a battle. Just to think about it, we played
Connecticut last year, and two of the guys that started last year come off the
bench now and give them strength. They've got other starters in there now that
have even taken them to another level. So I think they've improved their
depth. Each guy that stayed has gotten a lot better.  
I think Kevin Ollie has done an incredible job with his team. Having played
them last year, having watched the film of our game last year and now watching
them now, every individual on this team has gotten better, and they've gotten
better as a team.  
We've got a heck of a challenge. I hope we've gotten a lot better, too.  
  
Q. Just the familiarity of knowing UConn, I'm not trying to say you
overlooked Milwaukee, but to be familiar with an opponent such as UConn, how
much does that hone in the focus of yourself and the team knowing what you're
up against?  
COACH WRIGHT: I think the point you're making, and it's true, for a coach,
when you play Milwaukee, you know how good they are. Now our players know how
good they are.  
But young kids who are 18 and 19 who maybe got recruited by Villanova don't
realize it until they're ten minutes into the game, no matter what you tell
them. UConn, they know, and these guys were recruited by UConn, and they've
watched UConn. So I think our guys are very dialed in because they have great
respect for the tradition and also the current team.  
  
Q. Jay, old home week with all these Big East teams plus an A ‑10 team. How
much does the actual conference affiliation in the grand scheme of things
matter? You guys are all here, all three different leagues now. Does it really
make that big of a difference?   
COACH WRIGHT: I can only speak to the Big East. I think the Big East probably
did the best job of any conference ever in the history of sports of creating
camaraderie and a pride in the conference.  
Think about our coaches meetings, you know, you'd go for three, four days, get
to know everybody's wives. The experienced coaches in the league, you know,
when I came into the league, Calhoun and Boeheim and Pitino and all those
guys, they really took the younger guys under their wing and created a pride.  
And the older guys like John Thompson, Rollie Massimino, P.J., those guys
still stayed connected to the league. So the Big East means a lot.  
And for UConn, I know we all still root for each other. I know we do, because
Syracuse people are in our lobby. I'll never forget when we played for
Syracuse in the Sweet 16 against North Carolina, when we walked into the dome,
everyone is like, Hey, let's go, Big East, Big East, you know. And they
cheered for us.  
There's just something very special about the Big East. So conference means a
lot when it comes to the Big East, the old Big East. I think the new Big East
is creating the same thing.  
  
Q. Jay, postseason, you guys are 8 for 42 from three. That three has been a
strength ‑‑  
COACH WRIGHT: Thanks, Joe.  
  
Q. Threes have been a strength all year for Villanova.  
COACH WRIGHT: Is Mike Kern here? Usually Mike Kern can't wait to tell me that.
He can't wait to throw that in my face and no one won an NCAA Tournament on
this team. Is Mike Kern here? He called this into you.  
  
Q. He texted it into me specifically.  
COACH WRIGHT: Is it 8 for 42?  
  
Q. 8 for 42. But you shot like 38 percent during the regular season. So
you've done it well. Is it a great area of concern for you? Are you concerned
about technique or anything else or confidence with regard to three ‑point
shooting and how much better are you going to have to shoot tomorrow night
against UConn?   
COACH WRIGHT: Not making shots. The name of the game is putting the ball in
the basket. I thought last night's game subsided a lot of concern because we
really do take pride in our defense and our rebounding. We believe that if
we're going to be a good team, we've got to survive poor shooting nights. I
just thought last night was a great example.  
I know we're a good shooting team, and I really think our guys believe that.
To answer your last question, I don't think we'll be able to shoot as poorly
as we did last night and keep a Connecticut team down to 53 points.  
Those missed shots against a team like Milwaukee, they want to control the
tempo. Those missed shots against Milwaukee didn't turn into fast break. It
turned into us having another 30 seconds of defense. But against Connecticut,
that's going to be Napier and those guys out in transition, and that's going
to be trouble.  
  
Q. I just wanted to give you one stat that you may like. You were 14 of 18
from two in the second half last night, which was 77 percent.  
COACH WRIGHT: Thank you, Joe. That's one I'll share with the team.  
  
Q. The conversation about four ‑year players and the value of four‑year
players to a program, at a time where often younger kids don't understand
that, younger players, Napier, the poster boy for that kind of thing with what
he's become for Connecticut, rebounding, assists, always assists, but shot
making. Can you just talk about his development that you've seen over the
years.   
COACH WRIGHT: Definitely. I think it was when he was a sophomore, he hit a
shot at the buzzer against us at the Wells Fargo Center, about a 50‑footer. He
was playing great as a sophomore. He was one of those guys that you would hear
people talk about, you know, he's going to go early to the league. I don't
know what happened between then and now, but he was a scorer then.  
Now he is a complete guard, like what we like to teach our players to be.
Great decision‑maker, scorer at the right time, leader, defensive player.  
I don't know if a guy like him, if he would have left early, would have
developed into as complete a player. He's one of the best guards in the
country, obviously, but there's a great value for that in college basketball.
A complete basketball player, mature, intelligent, physically capable. I don't
know if there is in the NBA. I don't know.  
I think the NBA kind of likes a younger, potential‑oriented guy that they
might blossom into some type of superstar. I think that's the difference.  
I don't look at it that way, but I think that's sometimes the way the business
is right now.  
  
Q. Hey, Jay, you touched on it the other day. I'm just wondering how much of
Mike Morris' influence on the University of Rochester still, I guess, shines
through in your approach today.  
COACH WRIGHT: Always. Mike was the first guy that gave me a job. I didn't know
anything about coaching, nothing until I got with him. I think he's one of the
great coaches in college basketball. He proved it. He won a National
Championship at Rochester and then retired. I seem to be around those kind of
guys a lot.  
Him, Rollie Massimino, Barry Brown. I don't know if I'm going to be that some
day. He retired, but couldn't retire, so he had to come back and coach at
Hobart. Really, he's one of those guys, a basketball genius, and his mind is
always going. He really inspired me to love coaching and everything around it,
the recruiting, the organization, practice schedules.  
I just talked to him yesterday. He would have been here, but his player's
getting the Academic National Player of the Year Award. Great guy, man, and
outstanding coach. I hope there's a lot of him in me.  
  
Q. When you see the type of player Shabazz has become, you sort of alluded
to it earlier, he's sort of a guy, Kevin needs him to score, he scores. Needs
a rebound, he rebounds. Generate offense, he does it. Did you see that kind of
player four years ago when he was sort of the Robin to Kemba Walker a little
bit?  
COACH WRIGHT: I didn't, because at that time everybody was leaving early,
going to the NBA, and Connecticut had a lot of guys that were leaving early
going to the NBA. I thought that next year, his sophomore year, when Kemba
left and then he took over, he was great. He was kind of an Allen Iverson type
scorer.  
But I wouldn't have said he was as complete a player as he is now. As I said,
right now, I think he's arguably one of the best guards in the country. Now,
how that projects at the next level, I don't want to try to figure out anymore
because I don't know how they evaluate that.  
But I thought he would be a guy that would go. I really respect him. I admire
his decision. I think it was a smart one. I think it's going to pay off for
him in the long run in terms of his professional career. I do. I know he'll
get a degree, and he's been with Kevin Ollie who knows what to do at that next
level. I just hope we can shut him down and he doesn't show everybody that
tomorrow.  
  
Q. You and your kids seem more willing to talk finally about the old Big
East than Kevin or Jim. Jim even compared it to talking about your ex ‑wife.
Is it easier from your perspective as the one that kind of stayed in the house
to talk about it in nostalgic terms about those old days?   
COACH WRIGHT: I guess it is because we stayed, and it is tougher. I know Jim,
Jim Calhoun and Jim Boeheim, I know they miss it. But they're also loyal guys
to their university. They realize they work for a university, and they go with
the decision the university made.  
But I know they miss it. It was so special for all of us. And I talked to Jim
Calhoun about it the other night. So was Dave Gavitt and all those guys know.
I was an assistant at the time watching this. None of us are where we are
without Dave Gavitt. Those guys know it. I was working for Rollie Massimino.
He knows it. And if it weren't for Rollie, I wouldn't be where I am.  
He created this whole thing, college basketball, TV, the excitement. That was
his dream. Everybody stays connected to that.  
  
Q. Jay, you alluded to this earlier about you were amazed at how you were
able to stay focused on defense even though you're missing shots. You've been
able to do that for the last several games, six or seven games. Is it just a
mindset that they've kind of got into your defensive concepts and
principles?  
COACH WRIGHT: As you know following us, earlier in the year, I would say early
to mid part of the year, we were great offensively. We were just outscoring
people. We were average defensively. But we started to get better and better
defensively, and that might have affected our offense.  
I really believe with our younger guys, even if we're going to continue to get
better, even next year, that you've got to understand that. You can't just
live on making shots. If we were a team that lived on making shots, we'd lose
that game last night.  
So it is our philosophy, and I do think the guys have bought in.  
  
Q. Jay, it's been a while since you've been to the Sweet 16. But can you
talk about the survival type instincts that you have to have now. There's
still a lot of tournament and how to keep the players focused. What do you
have to do to just kind of rewind to that last Sweet 16?  
COACH WRIGHT: There's things that you go through‑ Sweet 16, Elite 8, Final
Four‑ that the first time you go through, there's just little things, little
distractions, little decisions you make as a coach that don't have anything to
do with basketball that impact how they play.  
At this point in the season, the guys know what they're doing. They know how
to prepare. They know how to go through a scouting report. They know the
plays. It's more what their mindset is.  
Like you said, they've got to have a survival instinct where whatever's
happening in this game, we can't get down. We've got to keep grinding,
fighting, give ourselves a chance to win, and you learn that in tournament
time.  
So kids that are experienced in the tournament, they're usually good at that.
That's why a team like Wichita State, I think has got a great shot because
those kids have been through it. It's a unique experience. Unless the kids go
through it, the coach can know it all he wants, but the kids have to have that
mentality.  
  
Q. Jay, guard play is a strength on both teams. How do you see the matchups
and the importance of them tomorrow night?  
COACH WRIGHT: It is. I think both teams are generally perimeter‑oriented but
have good enough people inside that, if left alone, they can score. So I think
the matchup of these guards, and I know our ability to defend their perimeter
play, and I'm counting Giffey now, the way he's the shooting the ball, I'm
counting him as a guard. I think the last time we played him, he's a four or
five.  
And they'll play him at the four sometimes, so they'll play like four
perimeter guys. It's definitely going to be a perimeter matchup. With them,
those two little guards are so special. We've got to contain them, man. We've
got to contain them.  
  
Q. Jay, you've talked about how much you adore, love this team that you have
right here. What would it mean to you to take this team to the Sweet 16?  
COACH WRIGHT: The longer you're in it, and you as a coach have experienced
these things, it's not as important for you. When you're a young coach, you
want to do those things for you, too.  
When you're in it a while, you really want to see those kids experience it.
You feel like the kids that deserve it, you want to see experience it. But it
doesn't happen that way all the time.  
But I would love to see this group get there. Like I said, they're such a good
group. They play the right way. They're unselfish. I would love to see it for
them.  
But there's only one way you do it. You've got to go out there and play hard.
You've got to defend. You've got to beat really good teams. So we'll see if
we're ready.  
  
Q. Jay, I know the guys asking you about your coaching roots here, but I
think your first NCAA Tournament game was here, was it not? What do you
remember about that? How are you different from what you were then?  
COACH WRIGHT: My wife and I were riding over on the bus yesterday, and it was
the exact same snowy, lake effect day. It was St. Patrick's Day. It was the
exact same day. And we got hammered in this building by Oklahoma State, Eddie
Sutton, big country, Doug Gottlieb, of all people. I heard Doug Gottlieb
talking on TV the other day about somebody shooting. He couldn't make a foul
shot that day. Everybody else made a shot.  
We had Speedy Claxton at Hofstra, and he was a great guard. They were big and
physical. They had the two guard that went to the NBA, too. Can't think of his
name. He came off a ball screen early and came running over to me at the
bench. He was like this, and his finger was like that (indicating). I was
like, Oh, we're in trouble. We're dead now.  
They reset it, but they hammered us. I think Bobby Knight played his last game
with Indiana here, too, that same night. It was amazing night for me. It was
my first NCAA Tournament, great Hofstra team. We got hammered, but it was a
little different then. We were still happy. We got hammered, we were happy to
be here. We got hammered, and we got hammered after the game because we were
so happy to be here.  
  
Q. How are you different now?  
COACH WRIGHT: Because I wouldn't have been happy if we lost yesterday. I would
not have been celebrating after that game.  
Just, you know, I've been fortunate and blessed with a lot of good players and
being at Villanova, that I got to go to a Sweet 16, go to a Final Four. So now
when you're going through it, you understand what that's all about. That first
time when we came, as a coach, you don't know what you're doing. You go into a
meeting, they have a meeting here, and you're sitting there with John Chaney
was here, Bobby Knight, Eddie Sutton, and you're sitting in the meeting like,
Whoa, I was intimidated before we even got on the court.  
Now you're thinking, Okay, I've been to these meetings. We've got to make sure
the kids are right, their heads are right. I want these kids to experience
this. It's just you're thinking a lot more about getting the kids right. You
know what's going on, and you want the kids to experience it.  
  
Q. Kris Jenkins is putting a lot of work to where he is today. Can you just
talk about how much he's grown since he stepped on campus.  
COACH WRIGHT: Really proud of him, man. He hasn't grown at all since he
stepped on campus. He shrunk since he stepped on campus. 40 pounds. He's lost
40 pounds. He worked so hard.  
He's a great shooter, and we knew that. He's a freshman that comes in and
can't make shots. Playing defense harder than he ever has in his life. Running
the floor harder than he ever has in his life. Not being able to eat candy
like he has his whole life. All those things are going on, and he can't make a
shot.  
And he just keeps battling and keeps battling. His mom is a college coach at
Jackson State, and she texted me every day. We talk every day. She always
says, Keep your foot on his throat. That's her line to me. And we just keep
pushing him, and he keeps working.  
To see him, in these last four or five games find his shot while he's doing
all the other things when we need it has been really exciting for me to see
him get to that point. I'm really proud of him.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Best of luck tomorrow.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

Dayton  60  
Ohio State - 59

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH MILLER: Obviously, an incredible finish, but we're really proud of how
our guys prepared and approached to battle against what we consider an elite
team.  
I thought both teams played pretty hard. It was back and forth. But at the end
of the day, you know, in this tournament, like everybody knows, a few plays
here and there have to go your way.  
Dyshawn's three free throws in a row, and then, obviously, Vee's shot off the
glass. It could go either way, 50‑50, but they made them today. It's a big
reason why we won the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. We'll take questions just for our
student‑athletes at this time.  
  
Q. Probably during the regular season, your free ‑throw percentage wasn't
what you wanted it to be, but today you were perfect from the line. What was
going through your mind when you hit those threes?   
DYSHAWN PIERRE: I was trying to stay calm, stay focused, and I knew we had to
make those free throws for the team. Luckily, I did.  
  
Q. Just a quick followup. How eagerly are you watching this game knowing
that you could potentially go up against Tyler Ennis?  
DYSHAWN PIERRE: I'm not really thinking about that right now. Right now it's
about the team. We just want to advance.  
  
Q. Were you nervous?  
VEE SANFORD: No, I wasn't nervous. I just thank God and thank Coach for
trusting me. We've probably drawn up a play like that and I messed it up
previously, but he just kept his trust in me, and I'm just thankful that the
shot went in.  
  
Q. And just as a followup, what did that shot mean to you knowing you
transferred here to Dayton and to seal this win, this back ‑and‑forth win
against Ohio State?   
VEE SANFORD: It goes above me, us as a family and as a team, it's all about
how hard we worked and how we've bounced back through our hard times. So it
goes on above me.  
  
Q. Vee, during the timeout with ten seconds left, they design a play to get
you the ball. What did Coach say? Can you take us through that?  
VEE SANFORD: Mainly, he wanted me to go right and kind of just open up the
floor. He knows that's my strength. If I had opportunity to get to the basket,
you know, I have a high percentage of hitting the shot.  
So it was a well drawn up play, and I'm just thankful that I was able to
execute it.  
  
Q. To either of you guys, there's been some talk coming in that maybe the
Atlantic 10 wasn't getting as much respect as you deserved. Do you feel like
with tonight's win you guys have vindicated that talk and vindicated you guys
being here?  
DYSHAWN PIERRE: We kind of try to cancel out all the noise and kind of focus
on this game. With this win, we're happy with it, but now we've just got to
keep focusing on moving forward, next game mentality.  
We're happy that we got the win.  
  
Q. Guys, can you take us through what you guys were thinking at the time
Ohio State made that big run in the second half.  
VEE SANFORD: We were just trying to stay positive. Our main thing is they're a
really good team. Good teams are going to go on runs. The main thing is just
to hold our composure and be able to handle it. So I felt like we did that
pretty well.  
DYSHAWN PIERRE: Can you repeat the question, please?  
  
Q. Just wondering what was going through your mind during the 10 ‑0 run that
Ohio State had during the second half?   
DYSHAWN PIERRE: Just staying with our team game plan, just staying together.
At the end of the day, we knew that, if we stayed together, that we'd be there
at the end of the game. Luckily, with Vee's tough shot, we were able to pull
it out.  
  
Q. Vee, there was talk about little brother versus big brother. Maybe you
guys get bragging rights, right?  
VEE SANFORD: We didn't look at it like that. It was just another game to us.  
  
Q. Really?  
VEE SANFORD: Honestly, it was. Coming into the game, we wasn't thinking about
who they were. It was just, you know, it was a game. It was five‑on‑five. It
didn't matter who it was. We just wanted to advance.  
So that stuff was irrelevant, and we put that out the door.  
  
Q. Vee, can you talk about how you handled their defensive pressure and how
you think that went and the challenge that was.  
VEE SANFORD: They're really good defenders, and I felt like the main thing we
just stuck with is just being tough. We knew Craft and Scott are really good
defenders on the ball, and they swipe down.  
So we knew they were going to get some calls, but we just wanted to stay tough
and keep playing through.  
  
Q. Dyshawn, they played Oh, Canada before the game. Did it kind of strike
you off guard?  
DYSHAWN PIERRE: No, not really. I saw the flag and heard the anthem start
playing. It was pretty cool, but didn't really take it anywhere really.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, congrats.  
I'll take questions for Coach Miller at this time.  
  
Q. Coach, against Saint Joe's, kind of deja vu. You didn't like the play
call you had at the end of the game. This time it happened again, ten seconds,
this is it. Did you feel confident in giving Vee the ball at the end and just
a complete play?  
COACH MILLER: Yeah, you know, the Saint Joe's game, I've been thinking about
that all the way through. I didn't put those guys in a situation where we were
going to be able to get a good shot. We took out all the confusion this time.  
He was able to get the ball up at the top. Once we got it up at the top, we
spaced and just kind of ran up and got out of the way just to see if we could
create any kind of confusion up on the top.  
I think Aaron may have took his head off the ball for just a quick second, and
Vee, if he can get on the side of you, can get to the rim. If he'd have made
it, missed it, the guys did a good job. But I just wanted to make sure we got
a shot at the basket.  
  
Q. Archie, just the significance of this victory for your team, for yourself
to beat Thad Matta, your mentor. I don't want to say does it sink in, but can
you put it into perspective at this point?  
COACH MILLER: I mean, a lot of people are going to make a big case about it
being Thad or it being Ohio State, but you advance in the NCAA Tournament,
that's hard. That's really hard. It's hard to get here, and it's hard to
advance. So it's always a good thing.  
But I don't think we came here like it was a circus act. I don't think we came
here trying to hopefully hang in there and go home, and, Boy, it was a great
run.  
Our guys have been very consistent. We've talked to them the same way for
about two straight months. We didn't get real complicated. It wasn't about
Ohio State or where they're from or blah, blah, blah. It wasn't. It was about
us.  
I thought our guys approached it. They did the same thing we've been doing,
and we gave ourselves a chance to win the game.  
  
Q. Archie, any thoughts register as Aaron goes down for that last shot?  
COACH MILLER: I thought it was going in. I thought it was going in. I've seen
those a bunch since I've been at Dayton, but more importantly, I've watched
Ohio State, in particular. I've watched those guys win that game a thousand
times.  
He's a bulldozer with the ball. He got it down there in about three dribbles,
and he got a good look. It just ended up rimming out, and we got lucky.  
  
Q. Archie, after that game, you stated your case why you guys should be
here. The Atlantic 10 got six bids. Do you feel like with this win you've sort
of shown why that happened?  
COACH MILLER: A‑10 is great. Coaches are great. I've said it a couple days
ago, there's great players in our league. The seniors in that league have been
through it.  
The fact we got six bids, we earned all six. Now if we'd have lost today and
someone says they shouldn't have gotten in? Probably. It's all irrelevant. We
are in. We earned the right to be in. The other teams in the A‑10 not only
earned the right to get in, I thought they were seeded pretty good. I wouldn't
expect anything less of our league to keep advancing.  
  
Q. Coach, Kendall Pollard, probably one of the unsung heroes of this game.
What did you see from him to get his minutes increased?  
COACH MILLER: I didn't think D. Mo had a good stretch. He had a four‑ or
five‑minute stretch where he didn't play real well. To let him go out there
and keep doing it, we didn't like that. So we gave Kendall a chance and wanted
to give D. Mo a blow. He did a great job while he was in there.  
While that happened, Ohio State went small. When they need something to click,
they go Loving or Ross in together with your five, and next thing you know,
you're in a tough spot, either getting back or in the half‑court.  
Kendall's role this season has grown. I have confidence in him. He's a good
player. He's going to be even better. But we were able to play small the rest
of the way as well, which we haven't done all season. I thought that's a great
thing for a freshman to be in there in those moments.  
  
Q. Coach, you had the same exact number of rebounds, same exact number of
assists, same exact number of steals. What was the difference in this game
that allowed you to win?  
COACH MILLER: I would say we were able to win the game just based on how the
flow was going. We capitalized off turnovers. I thought we had ten steals in
the game. I thought we got some transition baskets, some run‑outs. We were
able to play.  
I also thought that we probably had about a three‑ or four‑possession stretch
where we had numbers in transition where we shot ourselves in the foot or the
game could have went even a little bit more extended.  
I mean, we had four straight turnovers in one run when we had numbers. That
wasn't good. It kind of really took the game air, the confidence out of our
team for a minute. Our defense gave us a chance to win as well.  
Looking at the percentages, just in general, I thought our defense gave us a
chance because they're such a great offensive team‑‑ I mean, defensive team.  
  
Q. Sam Thompson scored 8 out of the 10 in that 10 ‑0 run. What was the
adjustment after that, because he only scored one more basket?   
COACH MILLER: He got a couple of sets out of a timeout. They run a ton of
lobs. You've got to be ready to go. I thought he did a tremendous job on the
offensive glass where we made an end block out. Then early in the game, he
banged two threes, which from our standpoint, we didn't want to give him the
three, but obviously we were trying to protect the dribble drive.  
He's a really talented guy. He was bouncy around the basket. He got a couple
there. You know, I think some loose ball plays, nothing that was really
designed.  
So once the game got under control, we started to block out a little better.
We were trying to keep awareness as everything went on, just the lobs and the
things that we run for him, to stay below him.  
  
Q. How do you feel you handled their perimeter pressure defense?  
COACH MILLER: Great.  
  
Q. And what was the key to doing that?  
COACH MILLER: I thought we handled it great. I watched so many games where
they dismantle you off a dead ball free‑throw, and they make a lot of plays
when they go small.  
We were composed. For the most part, our turnovers were self‑inflicted. I
didn't think very often they created the turnover. Maybe one. Craft made a
heck of a play on the underneath out‑of‑bounds steal.  
I thought our press offense was organized. I thought we did a good job there.
Then I thought in the half‑court we were able to move the ball and get it to
where we wanted to get it.  
The thing you've got to do that's amazing is on penetration and post‑ups and
offensive rebounds, how many hands they get on the ball. It's just the amount
of deflections that they get in the paint is just crazy. It's an unorthodox
feeling usually as a player when you have a hard time picking it up and
getting it up.  
I was worried about Vee on the last play, Craft knocking it off him or getting
a hand on it.  
They're really good on defense. Their perimeter quickness is tough. Off the
ball, they do a great job. But I thought our guys were strong with it and able
to handle it.  
  
Q. Then as a follow ‑up, did you have a number in mind, you know, turnovers,
if we keep it to this, we're in decent shape?   
COACH MILLER: If I told them we wanted to play with 12, we'd play with 24 or
something like that. Keep it simple.  
  
Q. Coach, Vee was 3 of 10 going into that final possession. What gave you
the confidence to call his number?  
COACH MILLER: He's the guy that can get the shot. He's the guy that can get
the shot up. He's been in that situation a lot for us. Most people have
watched us play have seen him come down that right lane line probably 20 times
this season and banked that banker right off the glass.  
I was worried about him getting bottled up. We wanted to get him a lane where
maybe he could get it downhill. I thought Devin did a great job coming up and
slipping. Vee was able with the first step to get the first dribble by him.
That was a big key in the other play.  
Vee made that shot a lot. He's terrific inside of 15, 16 feet making those
type of shots. We have a lot of confidence in him. He's the one guy we can
call his number, and he can get one.  
  
Q. Were you expecting maybe a collapse and a kick?  
COACH MILLER: No. They want to stay home on the three‑point shooters, and we
spread the floor very open. They'll take their chances with the Big Ten Player
of the Year on defense with ten seconds to go and let him see if he can't win
the game.  
  
Q. How uneasy of a feeling is it during that 10 ‑0 run when for five minutes
you can't get a basket?   
COACH MILLER: Well, you know, it's uneasy. It's uneasy during any game when
momentum shifts. This team is oblivious to it. We've been through it a lot.
We've come back a lot. We've done a lot of things in big moments this season.
We have a lot of guys that have been out there.  
So I think over the course of the season every team gets used to it. The thing
we talked about a lot during the run was we were creating a lot of our own
problems. Turning the ball over on a break with a two‑on‑one, a one‑hand
bounce pass through the lane to get stolen, underneath out of bounds. Didn't
properly execute.  
There's simple things there where if you just do them right, they don't create
some of that. They do a good job of obviously making things happen there, too.
You're going to have some turnovers. But for the most part, we hung in there
pretty tough.  
  
Q. Given the familiarity between the two programs or people in the programs,
is there room for sympathy with Ohio State coming here with the expectations
they've had in their program?  
COACH MILLER: I would just say the familiarity with the two programs is
probably Coach Matta, his staff, and myself, more so than anything.  
  
Q. How do you feel ‑‑  
COACH MILLER: Our players don't know Ohio State's players. Maybe Jordan, but
there was no sympathy in our locker room for winning the game.  
For me, it's tough. You line up against somebody who gave you a lot. He thinks
a lot of you. He helped us just as much as anyone. He's pulling for us at the
end of the season. And then you play him.  
But at the end of the day, it is what it is. If he would have won, obviously,
he's going to say it's tough. But the name of the game right now is advancing.
This is the biggest stage you can be on. This is where our program is supposed
to be. And we've gotten here, and we want to stay.  
  
Q. Coach, your first NCAA win. Are you going to sleep easier tonight?  
COACH MILLER: Probably not. I'm assuming we're going to have another one
that's going to be very, very similar in a couple of days. So we're going to
prepare.  
I want our guys to go enjoy it. This is the greatest thing in the world when
you win the 12:00 noon game because you've got a lot of ball, and you can sit
and watch the replay a lot.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

UConn  89  
Saint Joseph's  81

  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Saint Joseph's University head coach Phil Martelli,
and student‑athletes Langston Galloway and Halil Kanacevic.  
Coach, if you want to go ahead and make your opening statement.  
COACH MARTELLI: We have a message on the wall in our locker room, we put the
message on the blackboard before every game, and then we say it, Act like a
champion. I just told the team, that's exactly what they did for 45 minutes,
and really what they've done since June.  
Sometimes in life you don't get really what you want. There are reasons that
may be out there for anybody. I don't know why. But if anybody deserved to
keep playing, these guys certainly did. Connecticut did everything that they
had to do. And the only number that jumps out is our turnover numbers. It's
too high, particularly when we only had five at half.  
So we came in here as champions, and we're going to leave that locker room
tonight. It will be a long night tonight, probably a long weekend. Then we'll
get each of these guys on their path to life.  
If it's the hardest thing they face, they've lived a blessed life.  
  
Q. Can you guys just discuss the senior class and the effort you guys gave
through your four years, and how difficult it is to go out like this.  
HALIL KANACEVIC: Yeah, I think we gave tremendous effort since we've been
here. We've had a lot of ups and downs. Not only me and Langston, but Ron
Roberts, Daryus Quarles, Colin Kelly, we've all been through a tough time
since we've been here. We just stuck together honestly.  
I think that's what made this year a great one up until now. I mean, it's
tough to go out like this. You never want to go out an a loss.  
But, yeah, I'm happy to see these guys grow with me. That's the happiest I've
been because I've seen everybody get better. It's just been tremendous.  
It's tough because obviously no one wants to go out with a loss, but I've seen
these guys grow up right with me, and I'm better for that. They're tremendous
people. Forget about the basketball. Everybody is a tremendous player, but
they're tremendous people, tremendous teammates. I don't think I've been
around a group of people my age that are so giving.  
So I love these guys from the bottom of my heart, and if I didn't, I wouldn't
be saying so. I'd tell you I hate them, but there's no ounce of hate in my
heart for any of these guys.  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: It's definitely been a journey. We've been on so many ups
and downs. And the main thing, the reason why I know I came here and the rest
of these guys came here was to bring Saint Joe's back and get them back to
this point because it's been a long time since we've been at this point in the
tournament.  
I wouldn't do it with any other group of guys. I mean, everybody gave it their
all tonight. I mean, the shots fell here and there and some went out. But I
just love this group of guys, and I'm just glad I got a chance to play with
them. I hope that we keep it going for Saint Joe's.  
  
Q. You guys really seemed to execute extremely well offensively all night.
Coach mentioned the turnovers. What do you think changed in the second half?  
HALIL KANACEVIC: I think we did a good job in the second half defensively,
honestly. We had them up by three, and Napier went to the basket, missed, and
I did a horrible job boxing out Brimah, and he got the offensive rebound and
got that one. That was the pivotal moment when we had them. That's where I let
these guys down. I should have boxed him out better and never let him get the
offensive rebound.  
I think coach did a great job laying out a game plan for us, and we executed
it. We had them down. We were up by three. I think that hurt us tremendously,
and I'm sorry for that, honestly.  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: I think that we were right there. I know I made a turnover
at the end and then forced a shot at the end. I just wanted to keep the ball
in my hand. I wanted to go out with the ball being in my hands. It's a tough
play. Hit the side of the backboard.  
I'm definitely upset with myself for not getting a better quality shot because
I know if I had gotten a better quality shot, I probably would have made it.  
Just upset. Just going to console the rest of these guys because they have to
come back next year and try to get to this point.  
  
Q. Langston, at the end there, Shabazz came over to you and said some words
and gave you a hug. Just what did that mean to you? If you shared any words,
were you expecting that? What did that sort of mean for you?  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: I mean, he's a great player, and he just was saying a few
words, saying that I had a great game. I'll see him in the future.  
Hopefully, in my career, I'll be able to play professionally and go with
Halil, Ron, and just see our games flourish, and we'll see him down the line.  
  
Q. How does the team change when Halil's not on the floor?  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: I mean, that's a tough question. The team changes a lot. I
mean, he definitely is one of our main ball handlers. He does it all. That's
the thing, you get everything from him, offensive with assists, rebounds,
defensive you get blocks. He does it all.  
It hurt us at the end with him not being on the court, but us as seniors
wanted to step up and try to make some things happen, but it didn't go our
way.  
  
Q. Halil, can you just talk about to have such an incredible game, what it
was like to have to be forced to watch the end of it.  
HALIL KANACEVIC: It was tough. You don't want to go out like that. I
definitely don't want to go out like that. It's one of those things where it
bothers you tremendously.  
You've got guys on the bench trying to lift your spirits. And I'm still in the
game because we were still in the game at that point. I'm still trying to keep
these guys going. With me on the court or without me on the court, these are
great players. This guy has close to 2,000 points in his career, and leading
three‑point shooter. Ron Roberts, the beast down low.  
Me on the court, me not on the court, I've got nothing but confidence in these
guys. But me being in foul trouble is no way I want to go out. I feel bad, but
I tried to just stay in the game with these guys. There's nothing you can do
at that point.  
He called the call, and I'm just mad I was on the bench at the end of the
game.  
THE MODERATOR: Langston, Halil, thank you for your time. Great season.  
  
Q. Phil, if you could just take us through that final possession of
regulation. Did Langston kind of have carte blanche? What was the approach
there?  
COACH MARTELLI: I felt that they would overreact to the ball screen. So what I
wanted to do was we ran a fake ball screen. Halil came, and Lang put the ball
through his legs, and I was tempted right then to grab another time‑out. We
wanted the ball a little bit more centered than we got. We got stuck on the
side.  
If they said, you know, rewind, we're going to do that again, then I would
give him the ball again and let him make a play because both of the big plays
he made last weekend, he had the ball. Usually, we've been running him off
things.  
But I really wanted the ball in the center of the floor and Ron and Halil
close to the basket for an offensive rebound opportunity.  
  
Q. Phil, when you're in the course of a game, you're not really thinking
about how great the game is. Do you ever take a moment and realize, This is a
great game? As the game is going on, I know it's tough now, but it was a great
basketball game to watch.  
COACH MARTELLI: Yeah, I appreciate that, and if I worked for the network and I
could care about viewership, I'd be cool about that. But it wasn't so great.  
I appreciate what you said, though. Thank you.  
  
Q. Just to follow up on Langston, Phil. If you could kind of put his career
in perspective, given some of the you've coached Bernard Blount. You've
coached Jameer and Delonte, close to a thousand points.  
COACH MARTELLI: The things that jump out to me with the human being, that's a
tribute to his family. He's a wonderful, wonderful young guy. He worked to be
this good.  
When you start talking about all‑timers, you start talking about the person
that he is. He's on that list as an all‑time person, and the numbers speak for
themselves. He's had an awful lot of opportunities, and they've been through
some things and stayed the course.  
I don't know if we've ever had a player more proud to wear the Saint Joe
uniform.  
  
Q. Phil, did what Shabazz did with Langston and Ron, did that kind of catch
you by surprise a little bit? As a coach and a mentor of younger children, I
mean, does it strike you as sort of a touching moment in an atmosphere like
that?  
COACH MARTELLI: I didn't really see it, but I heard you describe it to him. To
me, a lot of societal ways, we've lost our way because we no longer pay each
other respect. I tried to build this program on respect, respect for the game,
and I think that's what he did.  
And to be honest with you, that's what I tried to do, to take them out with
eight seconds left. I let them down Senior Day because I was in such a fog and
worrying about how he played. I should have gotten them out for a final
ovation in Hagan Arena like they received tonight.  
But I don't have anything but classy thoughts about Kevin Ollie and the
Connecticut program and the competition tonight. The gentleman over here said
it was a straight‑up competition, and that old cliche, somebody had to lose,
and unfortunately, it was us.  
  
Q. Were you worried at all about what your team had left in the tank heading
into overtime considering the amount of minutes they played, not only tonight
but all year?  
COACH MARTELLI: No, I wasn't worried about it. It was a media timeout. It was
a four‑minute media timeout that we had to play. That's how we break the game
up.  
And really until later in the second half was the first time we lost two
consecutive media timeouts. We won four and one in the first half. I don't
know what the numbers were in the second half. The first basket in the second
half, an then one, and I'm just saying it this way. We did exactly what we
wanted to do. They had 67 points in regulation, and they had taken four foul
shots.  
Then we had to chase. When we got down, we had to chase, and that's not to our
strength. It's not minutes. It's actual abilities. We don't have a lot of foot
speed.  
  
Q. Phil, just talk about the senior class as a whole and what they've done
to bring this program back. I mean, it's your first tournament appearance in a
few years. Just talk about the senior class as a whole.  
COACH MARTELLI: I don't know if I can answer that as well as you just
expressed it. Here's what I'm driving at. Halil has graduated. Langston has
graduated. Colin Kelly will graduate, and Daryus Quarles will graduate. Ron
Roberts will graduate, and Daryus Quarles will be pulled by his feet across
the stage at graduation. So that starts with that.  
What I asked them to do is to be better men than they were as high school
kids. Across the board, that's a yes. I want them to be on the brink of
college graduation. They've done that. And every one of them is a better
player. So mission accomplished for those five guys.  
And for the way that they represented Saint Joseph's, you're talking about
three of them are going to go into the Basketball Hall of Fame sometime at
Saint Joe, and that's quite an honor. And they left a mark that will have to
be followed by DeAndre' and Chris Wilson and the upcoming kids we have.  
Thank you for the way you told our story.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

Dayton  60  
Ohio State - 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined up here by Thad Matta, Aaron Craft, and Sam
Thompson from Ohio State University. That being said, Coach, go ahead and make
your opening statement.  
COACH MATTA: I'm good. Just ask these guys questions.  
No, give Dayton credit. They made some big plays. We got ourselves in a little
bit of a hole again.  
Had a great shot at the end to win the game, but it was just one of those
games for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.  
We'll take questions just for our student‑athletes at this point, either Aaron
or Sam.  
  
Q. Aaron, just like you have your entire career, you're in on every single
play down the stretch. Can you just take us through from your vantage point.
Just the big layups, the last play on Sanford, and just kind of where your
head is at right now.  
AARON CRAFT: I just wanted to do everything I could to help our team win, and
down the stretch, I couldn't do that today. I can take blame for that.  
This is the fourth game winner hit on me in my time here. I can't change it.
Obviously, you want it to end differently, but these guys still have time. The
best thing that we can do is just move forward.  
Got to give Dayton a lot of credit. Obviously, he made a big shot down the
stretch. They made the last punch, and we couldn't.  
  
Q. Aaron, would you discuss your last shot. It looked like it was going to
bank in, kicked out. What did you see?  
AARON CRAFT: Just tried to get up the floor as quickly as possible. There's
only four seconds left. That's kind of how our season's gone. Thought I got it
up there high enough, and I obviously didn't, so...  
  
Q. Sam, you guys have played these back ‑and‑forth games, close games,
different stakes and what not. In the NCAA Tournament, is it tougher to try to
eke out a game like this when so much is on the line and both teams have their
backs against the wall the way they do?   
SAM THOMPSON: I don't know. We lost maybe ten games like that this season. So
I don't know if it's tougher in the NCAA Tournament. I don't know if it's
tougher in the Big Ten Tournament, regular season. We knew going into the
season that we were going to get everybody's best shot. Today we weren't able
to withstand it.  
  
Q. The fact that you guys have experience going deep into this tournament
for both Aaron and Sam, with it fresh right now, how much does that offer
solace or help you? At least you have gone deep, versus how much does it make
it tougher?  
SAM THOMPSON: It doesn't, doesn't help.  
  
Q. To what degree does it make it more difficult because you're used to it,
you expect it more?  
SAM THOMPSON: You know, I guess. Any competitor wants to win. This is a game
that we had an opportunity to win. We had a chance to extend our season,
extend the seniors' careers, and we didn't do it. So it was tough.  
  
Q. Aaron, you put this on your shoulders. You made big plays down the
stretch. Other than that last desperate shot, what could you have done
better?  
AARON CRAFT: Not let them make a shot, obviously, down the stretch. It's
amazing the way that, you know, defense has kind of been my thing, and it's
amazing how it's going to end with a kid getting the game winner on me.  
Obviously, I think I knew he wanted to go right. There's so many things that
are going through my mind right now that I wish could have gone differently,
but they didn't. He made a big shot, made a big time play, and we couldn't
come back.  
  
Q. Kind of a grandiose question, Aaron, but how would you like to be
remembered at Ohio State?  
AARON CRAFT: Sorry, I have zero thoughts on that right now. I'm upset at the
way that we played this game and the way that we didn't take the opportunity
and make the most of it.  
So that's for you guys to decide and discuss, but right now, I can't move past
this game yet.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.  
At this point, we'll take questions for Coach Matta.  
  
Q. Thad, just with the way Aaron was able to make plays. He made the few
that weren't so good. Just can you put in perspective the way you thought he
played and finished his career today?  
COACH MATTA: I thought he was great. Just from the standpoint of we wouldn't
have been in this position had he not been doing the things that he had done
to get us here. You look at his career, in my mind, in the ten years I've been
at Ohio State, he's going down as one of the all‑time greatest players to ever
put on the scarlet and gray.  
Obviously, you don't like this season to end the way it ends, but just that
kid has probably meant more to this program than anybody's ever meant to this
program, just in terms of what his teams have done in his time here.  
Obviously, you don't like the way this game ends today, but, you know, he's
special.  
  
Q. I know in the moment it's tough, and then the last shot there. Is there
anything you can do differently defensively if you're Aaron in that situation?
Or is that kind of just something that happens sometimes?  
COACH MATTA: Honestly, me telling him how to play defense would be like me
telling somebody how to build a rocket ship. I'll live and die with that kid
any day of the year of what he's going to do defensively.  
The kid made a tough shot, a runner that went in. These things happen. I would
trust him more than anybody I've ever coached in terms of those possessions.  
  
Q. Thad, we've talked a lot about late in the season, especially about this
team playing better with its back to the wall, which happened again today. But
for about the first, I don't know, 32 minutes, do you have any explanation for
why you couldn't build any kind of a lead on these guys and keep it?  
COACH MATTA: Honestly, I don't know. It's kind of been this team this year. As
I told them after the game, truth be told, we probably shouldn't have been in
this position from the standpoint of some games that we lost throughout the
season.  
  
Q. In the tournament?  
COACH MATTA: Not in the tournament, no, regular season games.  
The positions we were in at times, and you look at this team, you have ten
losses on the season, and you've led nine of them in the second half. The
other one that you lose, you're down one with eight minutes to go.  
I wish I had the answer for you. I would have used it about a month ago.  
  
Q. That being said, what you just said, is this the first time you've gotten
to an end of the season with a team and felt like you didn't have an answer or
didn't know what buttons to push to get it to play?  
COACH MATTA: I think so. The funny thing, and you know this, we've been
together for ten years, I've always predicated a team on how they practice,
and this may be one of the best practiced teams I've ever had. You know, an
interesting phenomenon.  
Like you said, the deal of getting ourselves down, I take a time‑out to start
the second half, just to try to get some momentum, try to get some juice. Two
loose balls, they come up with them. Five seconds on the shot clock, and a guy
shoots a layup. I think those were the things that kind of get me the most.  
Not so much the stage we're on today or anything like that, but just having
that ability to do the things we need to do to win basketball games
consistently.  
  
Q. Coach, how did you view the challenge going against their defense going
into the game? And what did you need to do better offensively?  
COACH MATTA: Well, we needed to finish better. I think that was one of the big
keys. We were getting the ball in there, and we weren't finishing. There was a
lot of contact. We kept telling our guys, you've got to finish through
contact. You've got to finish the play through the contact. We didn't do a
good enough job in terms of that.  
  
Q. Was there any transition defense early?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, yeah. That was probably the difference in the game was the
start of the game, just our ability to get back, you know. It was such a key,
because we thought we could do a great job with their half‑court offense, and
unfortunately, we gave those up.  
  
Q. You go on a 10 ‑0 run there in the second, I think it was 10‑0 over a
span of almost five minutes. To what degree at that point are you thinking,
we're figuring this out? What kind of place are you in mentally, I guess, in
terms of confidence or that the turbulence of earlier in the game is behind
you?   
COACH MATTA: You know, you're never comfortable. You look at this, the last
five games we've played, literally, I've listened for the horn to go off to
see if we win or lose. That's something we had talked about coming in. The
last five games come down to like the last shot.  
And coming into this game, we had talked about extending leads and that sort
of thing. We weren't able to get over that hump in terms of what we needed to
do. That was the difference.  
Thank you.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

Syracuse  77  
Western Michigan - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by Western Michigan head coach Steve Hawkins
and student‑athletes David Brown, Tucker Haymond, and Shayne Whittington.  
Coach, if you'd open with a statement.  
COACH HAWKINS: Well, we ran into a buzz saw today. I think they spent the
majority of the season ranked number 1 in the nation, and they looked like it
today.  
We made too many mistakes in the first half. We had 11 turnovers in the first
half, I believe it was. Only made two the rest of the way, but that's what
staked them out to that lead. I felt like after we started taking care of the
ball in the second half, we got a few better looks. But we made too many
mistake in the first half, and Syracuse will make you pay when you make those
kind of mistakes.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Please raise your hand if you have a question
for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. David, how tough was it to get the ball through that two ‑three zone?   
DAVID BROWN: It wasn't too bad. I mean, once we got the ball where we wanted
to get it, we did some things. They're long, athletic. They make you second
guess where you want to throw the ball. But I feel like we were hesitant where
we wanted to throw the ball.  
Like Coach said, we turned the ball over way too much. When we got the ball
where we wanted to get the ball, good things happened, but we just didn't get
the ball to where we wanted to enough.  
  
Q. Shayne, can you talk about how difficult it was for your teammates to get
you the ball? How much they were fronting you in there and how much they were
trying to deny you the ball?  
SHAYNE WHITTINGTON: Most of that was my fault. First half, I really wasn't
posting up as strong as I should have been, and that really attested to that.  
So second half, we kind of made an adjustment, and that got the ball in there
a little bit easier just by me being more aggressive.  
  
Q. David, were you injured late in the first half there with about two
minutes to go? And what happened there on that play?  
DAVID BROWN: We just banged knees. It hurts a little bit when you bang knees
with a guy that's got a brace on his knee as well. So it was just a little
knee‑to‑knee contact. I should be fine.  
Just need to rest it up and ice it, nothing major. So I'll be all right.  
  
Q. Looked like you were limping in the second half. Did that affect your
ability to jump on your shot?  
DAVID BROWN: Yeah, a little bit. When I sat down and talked with Kevin, he
said it was terrible where the place I got hit at because that's where all the
impact is from you jumping and cutting. Where I got hit at is right where
everything I wanted to do, I couldn't barely do.  
He said it's nothing major at all. It's just something we need to ice, and it
will go away in a couple of days or so.  
  
Q. Shayne, can you talk about going up against that front line because they
look so long and active.  
SHAYNE WHITTINGTON: You know, it was different. We're not really used to
seeing that long of a front line in the Mac, but it shouldn't have affected us
at all. Like I said, I was a little hesitant at first in the first half. Like
I said, I wasn't being aggressive, and that's really what attested to a lot of
our turnovers and a lot of our problems.  
  
Q. Shayne and David, this is a tough loss, but it's been a very good season
for you guys. Can you just talk about what this run has been like this year.  
DAVID BROWN: I enjoyed this run. Being a senior and possibly this would be my
last year, it was a great way to go out. Coming in and getting a chance to
play in the NCAA Tournament and pretty much playing with your brothers is a
terrific way to end your season.  
I mean, hats off to Syracuse. They were well prepared for us, and they took
away what we needed to do to win.  
But other than that, I enjoyed every moment, every single moment with these
guys.  
SHAYNE WHITTINGTON: Basically, the same stuff that David said. It's great
being able to come here, but you never really want to lose the first round. So
it's a little tough.  
Other than that, I'm proud of the guys that got us here. It was a team effort.
We stuck together throughout the entire year. Ups and downs. We did have our
ups and downs, but we definitely stayed positive throughout the entire year.  
  
Q. Tucker, can you talk about your first experience of being in an NCAA
Tournament, especially being just a freshman.  
TUCKER HAYMOND: I mean, the experience and everything is cool and all, but I
had the mindset, so did everyone in that locker room, that we wanted to come
in and win. We weren't just here to say we made it. We were here to make a
statement.  
Definitely puts fuel on the fire for the following years to know what it feels
like to be here. I don't want anything less than that. So definitely puts some
more fuel in the fire for the following years.  
  
Q. David, did they bait you a little in that two ‑three zone? Were they
closing in on the passing lanes? What was the biggest issue with the turnovers
in the first half?   
DAVID BROWN: It was just us not throwing the ball where we need to throw it. I
mean, we were hesitant throwing the ball, and we should have just caught the
ball and threw it where we wanted the ball to go.  
It's nothing that they really did to throw us off or bait us into doing
something different. It was pretty much us not throwing the ball where we
wanted to throw the ball right away.  
We ended up with turnovers and miscommunications, and then it got them easy
points.  
  
Q. Tucker, you're losing Shayne to graduation and possibly David, two big
guys on this team. Maybe there's already that talk, what's this Western
Michigan team going to be like next year? What do you say to that? Will this
team be back in a position to be here next year?  
TUCKER HAYMOND: I don't expect or see a reason that we would fall off. There's
a lot of guys in the locker room that can play. We know Shayne's leaving, so
we'll have to fill in that spot.  
If Dave does leave, other guys, including myself, just have to step up. If
Dave does stay, then we'll just go from there.  
But I don't see a fall‑off coming from next year.  
  
Q. David, do you have one more year to play?  
DAVID BROWN: Maybe. That's something I've got to sit down with the coaches and
my mother and father and stepfather and see what I can do. We probably won't
know that until after this whole thing is over with, and we have to get in
contact with the NCAA.  
But the chances are me having a sixth year, but we don't really know yet.
We'll have to wait and see after this whole NCAA Tournament thing is over.  
THE MODERATOR: David, Tucker, Shayne, thanks. Congrats on a great season.  
We'll take questions for Coach Hawkins at this time.  
  
Q. Coach, how big of a difference does it make when Trevor Cooney starts
hitting threes for them?  
COACH HAWKINS: A lot. You know, we felt pretty good going into the game about
our ability to guard their first shot. After that, they've got a brand‑new
offense, and that's when the shot goes up. Their offensive rebounding, they're
so long, so big, and they overpowered us there.  
But we felt okay about our ability to make them miss the first shot. When
Cooney starts hitting, of course, he'd been slumping a little bit as of late,
but a lot of that had to do with the fact that he was being guarded so
closely.  
But when he knocked down a couple, it stretches you out. You always have to
account for him when he's out on the floor, no matter where he is. When that
happens, then that opens up Fair and Ennis, you know, the whole inside. Now
that opens up their driving lanes because you have to account for him where he
really stretches the floor.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you do to prepare for the length of Syracuse? I know you
looked at some tape on Eastern Michigan and their zone, but what did you do to
prepare for this length?  
COACH HAWKINS: Well, you can't really prepare for it. You talk about the gaps.
You watch a lot of film.  
You heard the guys say it. We felt like we could get the ball to certain
spots. We got it there in the second half. But once you get it there, you
still have to make some plays.  
Their length still comes into play. We were able to get the ball into the high
post a lot more effectively in the second half, Connar is a playmaker from
that spot. But we only turned the ball over two times in the second half. We
got outscored by five.  
I realize they had a big lead at that point, but when we were able to get the
ball to the right spots...  
And Shayne did do a much better job. We wanted to get the ball into the high
post and the low post. When you go intotheir zone at times, the difference
between their zone, they call it a two‑three zone, and really it's almost a
four‑one zone because the four guys on the perimeter are out on the
three‑point line, they've got a big‑time shot blocker in the back.  
When you do that, that was not a good matchup for us because it takes away one
of our best players, if not our best player, in David, who's a great
three‑point shooter. So it takes away your three‑point game.  
You have to make them pay inside, or they don't have to think about that. We
weren't able to do that in the first half. They got out to a big lead.  
  
Q. Coach, I know this is a tough loss, but you won the MAC regular season,
you won the MAC tournament. Has this been a successful season?  
COACH HAWKINS: Yeah. Not because of winning. You know, it's a successful
season whenever your team plays as hard as they can play and reaches its level
of competency.  
When you reach your level of competency, when you reach your ceiling, it's a
success. We reached our ceiling this year, I really believe that. There
weren't too many games that we lost that we couldn't have.  
We played really hard. Our practices were great. They gave us everything we
could have. As a coach, what more could you possibly ask for? Can't get
anything else. That's what they gave us.  
To be honest with you, regardless of what happened in the MAC tournament, I
would have felt the same way because these kids gave us everything they had
all year long. Really, really happy with this group, really played hard,
tough‑minded group.  
  
Q. Coach, specifically, what do you get out of this experience? I know
everybody wants to come here. It's an honor to be here. What do you get out of
today?  
COACH HAWKINS: I think it is, it's a lifetime experience. It's certainly
something our kids will never forget.  
But I do want to echo Tucker's statement. We felt going into the game like we
had a shot. You know it's a long shot when you're seeded as low as we were
seeded. It's a tough go.  
But you're going to have to beat a good team somewhere along the line if you
hope to advance, and pretty much everybody is good when you get to this point
in time.  
But these kids will remember this. You know, it's not every day at our level
these kids get to sit up on a stage. We walked into the locker room yesterday,
and there's four or five cameras shoved in front of their faces. We don't get
that. So it's a lifetime experience for them.  
I've said this before going into it, as a coach, you get many opportunities to
hopefully do this throughout the course of your career, but as a kid and a
student‑athlete, you only get one, two, three, four opportunities at the most.
So when you can capitalize on it and you can get that, it's really special,
truly special, and something these kids will never forget.  
  
Q. Do you feel you have a shot to get back here again next year? What do you
think about David's future?  
COACH HAWKINS: Yeah, we expect to contend every year. We've won our division,
I don't know, something like 7 of the 11 years I've been there, and we've been
towards the top of the league for the great majority of the time.  
We were able to do it this year, and we've been very competitive. We expect to
do that every year. People will always ask, Well, how are you going to replace
Shayne? We have somebody. We get to use scholarships.  
So, yeah, I fully expect to be able to contend again. Whether or not we get
back here again, you know, there are 11 other teams that have something to say
about that too in our league.  
Get off the winning thing for a second. I'm concerned about our guys just
reaching whatever their potential is. Somebody could get hurt. If Shayne were
to go down this year or David were to go down this year, we would have had no
control over that, and that affects your ability to get back here, especially
at our level. Charlie Coles, the late Charlie Coles, I love him to death. He
told me one time, in this league, we're only an ankle sprain away from
being.500, and there's a the lot of truth to that.  
  
Q. What about David?  
COACH HAWKINS: David's future is up in the air. David, we feel like both of
his redshirt years were due to injury, and he was under the number of games
that you can be under. So David's future is up in the air.  
We'd have to petition the NCAA for the sixth year. There is precedent. At the
same time, David has to make a decision. He graduated at the semester of last
year. So he's been working on his graduate degree. So he has a decision to
make too.  
If he has a chance to make some money playing this game, we have to look at
that too. Basically, it comes down to we owe David. Whatever is in David's
best interest is what we have to concentrate on.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Congrats on a great season.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

Syracuse  77  
Western Michigan - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Syracuse University student‑athletes Trevor
Cooney and C.J. Fair as well as head coach Jim Boeheim.  
We'll have Coach open with a statement, and we'll just take questions for
Trevor and C.J.  
COACH BOEHEIM: I thought our defense was really good right from the beginning.
We made some shots. That always makes it a little bit easier when the ball
goes in the basket.  
But overall, our defense was really good, and I thought that was the big key
for us today.  
  
Q. Trevor, could you just talk a little bit about this game and what it
means for your confidence going forward in the tournament.  
TREVOR COONEY: I mean, my confidence was never down. I mean, I had some games
where the ball didn't go in for me. I made a lot of threes this year, and I
know I can make threes. It was just about coming out and doing it.  
  
Q. Trevor, just to follow on that, I think this is the most field goals
you've made since that Notre Dame game. What was the difference today, and how
much does it help your team when you're shooting like that?  
TREVOR COONEY: I mean, it just spaces the floor a bit when I'm making shots
and defense has to come out on me when I'm out there. It opens up other lanes
for other people.  
It just spaces the floor when I make shots.  
  
Q. Trevor, you missed your first three, but how important was it when on the
second one you got a clean look after Rakeem's offensive rebound?  
TREVOR COONEY: It was just good to see one go in. That just adds to your
confidence a little bit, and I was able to get into a good rhythm, and guys
found me in good spots. I mean, the ball just went in today.  
  
Q. C.J., can you talk about your team's ability to force turnovers,
especially early, preventing them from getting the ball inside?  
C.J. FAIR: Tonight we came out playing, you know, pressure defense, and we
wasn't letting them get comfortable. We was quick on all our defensive
rotations, and that kind of hurt them.  
You know, Tyler and Trevor did a good job anticipating a couple passes, get us
going in the first half.  
  
Q. Can you also talk about your ability to get offensive rebounds and Grant
being so active, especially in the first half, with the slams?  
C.J. FAIR: Yeah, we knew we were going to have a height advantage going into
this game. Coach always tells us whenever Trevor or Tyler get the ball, Do
your work early. Try to get in rebound position.  
That's what me and Jerami tried to do because Trevor's not going to miss many,
but you want to be thereto put it back or give him another chance at a shot.  
  
Q. C.J., Trevor's been in a little bit of a slump. When he makes a couple
there early on and starts to get going, what's that do to the rest of you
guys?  
C.J. FAIR: When anybody is making threes in bunches, it gives the team that
much more energy. It gets us going. It spaces the floor out. It makes the
defense have to react differently.  
So when he's making threes and Tyler is making threes, it makes the offense
that much more easier to get going.  
  
Q. Trevor, can you talk about the crowd? It seems like almost a home game.
It's about 70 percent orange jerseys out there. What did that mean to the
team?  
TREVOR COONEY: I mean, we're only two hours away from Syracuse. Syracuse, we
have a lot of great fans, and they travel well. And to be so close to home was
definitely good for us. We expected to see a lot of orange out there.  
But when you get going and you get some stops and you score and you get the
crowd behind you, it definitely adds to it.  
THE MODERATOR: Trevor, C.J., thank you for your time.  
We'll take questions for Coach Boeheim at this time.  
COACH BOEHEIM: We can go home here.  
THE MODERATOR: I was going to say.  
  
Q. Jim, I know you said you haven't seen anything different from Trevor
during his little slump he's been having. Did you see anything different
today, or was it just the shots were going in?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Same guy, you know, same guy. He's just got to get his looks
and take them. I think he's been aggressive. I think he stayed aggressive the
whole time.  
That's what you have to do. If you're a shooter, you've got to be aggressive.
I think his defense has stayed up the whole time. He's played all the other
parts of the game, which is what you have to do.  
It just makes our team different when it's 7‑4 and he shoots and it goes in,
it's so 10‑4\. He shoots and he misses, it's 7‑4, and they can come down and
get it within one.  
I thought Rak and Jerami got him two really good looks. Jerami got Tyler a
really good look, and Rak got him a good look.  
I thought we screened better. I thought he made better use of the dribble.
Attracted guys to him. He got fouled twice on three‑point shots, which he
doesn't usually. Usually gets it off too quick. But I thought he did a really
good job with that, and he got drove one time. Those are things he's got to do
that he'll continue to work on, and I think be able to expand his game.  
He's much too athletic a player to just be a shooter.  
  
Q. Coach, how important was it to get up quickly like you did and get the
crowd into it and really give them something?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Obviously, whenever you can get off to a good start, you know,
it's always good. When you can get some separation early.  
We made some really good plays. We made some shots, and we made some really
good defensive plays.  
They had a couple passes in there. They were going for a layup, and C.J. made
a good read, came across the lane, got the ball, and we went down and scored.
We made a couple plays like that. We forced a couple turnovers.  
When you get that separation, it's always easier.  
  
Q. Coach, we always talk about the confidence and the momentum from offense,
but what about when your defense gets on a team like that early? It builds for
you, but the impact it has on the opponent.  
COACH BOEHEIM: It's important. Our defense has been pretty good all year. I
mean, it hasn't been quite as good from the three‑point line as normal, but
our field goal percentage defense, our scoring, we've really had a pretty
consistent year defensively.  
Our problems have been more on the offensive end in the games that we've lost
or the games that we're closer maybe than we would have liked them to be. We
struggle sometimes to score.  
But I thought at Florida State, we really played well. We really scored
against a good defensive team. I thought against NC State we got great shots.
We just didn't make them.  
So tonight we got the same type shots, and we made them.  
So, again, I think we're a better offensive team than some of the numbers
would show.  
  
Q. Jim, obviously, Trevor has a good night tonight, but looking at Tyler
Ennis' numbers, does he continue to be maybe your most important guy out on
the floor?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, he's a key guy. There's no question about that. We don't
have a whole lot of point guards. He's extremely important to what we do.  
I thought he was good today. He's always pretty solid. Today he made a couple
threes, which makes him even more effective. I guess he made one, and then he
made one long one. He's been good all year. He's been very steady all year.
He's a very mature player.  
  
Q. This was the first time all season David Brown had not scored in double
figures. How much of the game plan was centered around stopping him?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, we wanted to get out on him and not let him get
comfortable. He only got a couple real good looks, and he made them. We wanted
to try to make it difficult for him.  
And then for the big kid, I thought Rak and Baye did a really good job making
it hard for the big kid. We wanted to try to contain those guys.  
You know, you have to focus on the two best players on the other team. We
don't try to shut other people. We try to get on those two guys and make it
difficult for them, actually try to make somebody else score besides those two
guys.  
I thought we did a really good job defensively. We worked real hard this week
defensively in practice and what they do. We had a lot of tape on them playing
against the zone. So we had a real good idea what we were going to do.  
Most people do the same thing against us anyway. They had one kind of wrinkle
which was different, and I thought our guards did a good job defending that
part of their game plan.  
But, again, Rak, I thought, and Baye were really good defensively. They made
it difficult for him. I think Whittington is a really good player, and I
thought we contained him pretty well.  
  
Q. Coach, there was about a five ‑minute stretch in this one where Jerami
just completely took over. When he's going like that, how much better of a
squad does that make you? Is there anything other teams can do to stop him?   
COACH BOEHEIM: He's a very good player. Particularly when people double‑team
Tyler, it gives Jerami a lot of space to maneuver in, and he's very good in
those situations.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you didn't play Dayton in Maui, but did you get a chance to
watch any of their games there? If you did, what did they do well?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Yeah, I saw them. I thought we were going to play them. They
lost a very close game. I thought that we would play them in Hawaii.  
I thought they were really the second best team out there. They lost a
one‑point game that they probablyshould have won probably.  
So I was very impressed with what they did out there. I've seen them a couple
times this year. I watched the game today. They've got a very, very
well‑balanced team with a lot of guys that can play and put the ball in the
basket.  
But I was tremendously impressed with them in Maui. I really thought that we
would play them there. I thought they were just a terrific team. I thought
they were the second best team in Hawaii.  
  
Q. You have a good track record of playing these games wherever they are,
all over the country. Does it make any difference to you that it's two hours
from campus?  
COACH BOEHEIM: It's good to have fans, but they don't score. You've still got
to play. We've lost games close to home in the past. We've won 3,000 miles
away in the past.  
Just the NCAA Tournament, you've just got to play. It is good to have fans
there, but, you know, that's just not going to determine too much at this
level. All these teams who played on the road in tough places, and I don't
think that that's going to matter in terms of determining who's going to win a
game in this tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks very much. Congrats.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

UConn  89  
Saint Joseph's - 81

  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by university of Connecticut head coach Kevin Ollie as
well as student‑athletes Ryan Boatright, DeAndre Daniels, Shabazz Napier.  
COACH OLLIE: First of all, I thought it was a great game by both teams.
Unfortunately, someone had to lose. I'm just glad we came out on top.  
The guys right here, they played hard. They played with grit. They played with
grind. At the end of the day, we wanted to outwork our opponent. It took a
little longer than I thought, but fortunately, we got it done at the end.  
We started making plays. It's all on my players, and I thank them for having a
great game for this great university.  
  
Q. (No microphone) a three ‑point play at the end and the composure he
showed, hitting the shot and then the clutch free throw.   
RYAN BOATRIGHT: He showed a lot of maturity and a lot of heart for that
possession. Man, for him to make that play, just for him to go to the line
like he knew he was going to make it. He went to the line with the swag and
all that.  
So he went to the line and knocked it down. It was a big play for us.  
  
Q. Shabazz, I think you had five points in the first half and 19 in the
second half in the overtime. What was the difference between the two halves?
Was there ever a moment in that game where you thought this might be the end
of your career?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: You know, the first half went by so fast. I was in the locker
room, and I was just telling myself, Man, I got to do something because my
teammates need it. And at the end of the day, this may be my last game, like
you just said.  
My teammates helped me. They willed me, like they have been throughout the
whole season. Guys are telling me, Shabazz, keep going. Keep shooting. You're
going to make the next shot. And they willed me.  
I was fortunate enough to make a lot of shots in the second half, but it
wasn't what I did in that second half. It's what everybody who stepped on that
court did. They never gave up. We was down. We had all the excuses to give up.
But guys was just willing each other, the resiliency that we have was just
tremendous.  
That's what you've got to do when you come to these tournaments. You've got to
just keep pushing along because anything can happen. I'm just so proud of my
guys.  
  
Q. Shabazz, at the end there, when Saint Joe's took out Ron and Langston, I
saw you go over and give him a hug. What sort of prompted you to do that? Did
you know those guys or was it just the game?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: No, I didn't know them guys until today, but when you play
basketball with that competitiveness, you earn a lot of respect.  
I'm passionate for the game, and I seen it in them guys' eyes. They're
seniors, and this is it. I would have loved for them to do the same thing for
me.  
When you work so hard for something and it goes down the drain, it saddens me.  
But I'm happy I'm on the other end. I just wanted to show them my respect and
tell the guys that he did a tremendous job. Just sometimes you fight, and you
don't win the battle. Just showing respect, basically.  
  
Q. Shabazz, it was an entertaining game for a lot of people to watch. How
much fun is it to play whena team played hard, too? You really don't know how
it's going to end up when you get down to the final moments there.  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: That's what these games are all about. Any team any given day
can beat a big team. That's what you kind of want. That's why I came to the
University of Connecticut to play in these tournaments, to give myself and my
team a chance to hoist that trophy at the end of the day.  
We're all here for one common goal. If someone told you different, it's a lie.
They play with so much competitiveness and passion, that we had to do the same
on our end.  
Like Coach said, someone had to be a loser. Not to say that we had more
passion and more competitive, but we were lucky and fortunate to be on the
other side and win.  
  
Q. DeAndre, or maybe all of you could address it, but you've been through a
lot of games like this over the last couple of years, tough, grind it out
games. Was this the toughest game of this kind that you've been through?  
DeANDRE DANIELS: No, we've been through a lot of tough games through the whole
season, just the will that this team has is amazing, and just to fight, and we
never give up.  
Everybody just follows our two leaders on the team with Shabazz and Boatright
and the heart those guys got in them. Everybody on the team is just following
along.  
  
Q. Thanks for making it interesting. Shabazz ‑‑ or Shabazz, I'm sorry?   
SHABAZZ NAPIER: Shabazz.  
  
Q. I'm a little out of breath here. I'm sure you are too. To be able to
shake off some of the misses that you made, especially the one at the end of
the second half, what gave you the confidence to know that you could ‑‑ you
hit nine‑‑ I think you scored nine points in overtime. What did that mean to
you?   
SHABAZZ NAPIER: You know, at the end of the day, I've been playing basketball
since I was 5 1/2. Just because I missed two shots, three shots, doesn't mean
I'm not going to take the next one with a lot confidence.  
I told my guys the same thing, you can miss a shot, you can miss ten shots in
a row, but I'm going right back to you because I know what you're capable of.  
None of these guys on the team are going to tell me not to shoot the ball
because I missed ten shots. They love me, and they know what I'm capable of.  
Same goes for everybody on the team. I missed that shot and went to the next
one, and I was fortunate enough to make shots. When I make shots, my teammates
make shots, it's hard to play us.  
Today was a big dogfight, but we willed ourself and just continued to push
each other to get the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you. Congrats.  
  
Q. Kevin, congrats. You're the first coach at UConn to win a tournament game
since Dom Perno in '79, I believe. Is there significance to that? Just the
fact that it's your first tournament game, and what is the significance of a
win like this to you?  
COACH OLLIE: Coach Calhoun won three National Championships, so I think he won
a couple of games in the tournament. I don't know where you're going with your
question.  
  
Q. You're the first one other than Jim.  
COACH OLLIE: That sounds better. That sounds better. You were scaring me at
first. Don't let Coach Calhoun hear that either. It will be hard.  
It was a great win. It's for the university. I love this university. Those
players right there, that's what kept this university alive. They could have
transferred. They could have did anything.  
Like I said, they have even now faith. Even now we're going through a dark
time, we're going to stay with our program. That's the beautiful thing about
those guys. They just stayed, and they're resilient, and they played hard.  
We was banned from the NCAA Tournament, but like I said always, we wasn't
banned from loving each other and encouraging each other all the time. That's
what got us through.  
Coaching is overrated. It's really overrated. These players make plays, and
I'm very passionate about my players. I love to win, but I'm more passionate
about my players being great student‑athletes. They did a great job keeping
this great university where we belong, and that's getting 20 wins every
season. That's getting back to the NCAA Tournament. This is where UConn
belongs at, and I give them all the credit in the world.  
  
Q. Coach, defensively what changed in the second half, in overtime? Can you
talk a little bit about what Kromah did on Galloway.  
COACH OLLIE: Lasan did a great job on Galloway. He was still making
unbelievable shots. We kind of started widening in the post. Kanacevic was
getting on the post. Roberts was getting on the post. They was making our
defense collapse, and then they was getting threes.  
We started buckling down there in the second half. We ran them up the
three‑point line a little bit better. I think they made seven threes, and that
was a real big key to us.  
First of all, it was just making a stand. That's what I told those guys, Get
back in transition, make a stand, play them one‑on‑one. You've got to
individually win your battle, and that's what we had to do.  
But also know it's collective, group, team defense. But sooner or later,
you're just going to have to man up and win your individual battle. That's
what they started doing. It really gave us an opportunity to start getting
some buckets on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Kevin, you listened to Shabazz talk about why he went over to their
seniors after the game and talk to them. Does that kind of exemplify what you
want your players to be about and what you want the program to represent?  
COACH OLLIE: Yeah, you want to always respect the game. You want to respect
the players in the game. But that's why you play so hard. And that's what I
try to tell each and every guy. You can't take this for granted because it can
be taken away from you so easily, and every minute you've got to cherish.  
I know those seniors want to go out and play on Saturday. Like I said,
unfortunately, somebody had to lose. Just to go over there and congratulate
them on a great four years at that program.  
And Phil Martelli, if I get an opportunity to see him after the game, I'm
going to congratulate him. He's just a great coach. And that was a very, very
tough team that we just beat. That's not a 10 seed, and I don't think we're a
7 seed.  
But at the end of the day, it's about planting seeds. That's what we keep
doing every day in practice. We keep planting seeds. We've got to continue to
that. We're going to see another tough team out of Milwaukee here and Green
Bay and also Villanova. Whoever comes out of this game is going to be a tough
matchup for us, and we've got to get ready for it.  
  
Q. Were you thinking of trying to get their big guy out of the game early in
overtime? I mean, four fouls early on, and you got rid of him.  
COACH OLLIE: That was the game plan. When he had four fouls, he was trying to
go right at him. DeAndre took it right at him. He got the fifth foul. I think
he was in the charge circle. DeAndre took it up strong and got that one, and
gave him his fifth foul.  
That was a big upswing for us because so much of the offense go through him.
He's just a great basketball player, and he's tough. That exemplifies what
Saint Joe's is all about, the toughness and the grit. I just know how Philly
coaches are. I know how Philly players are. And just all the different players
that come through that program. They play one way, and they play the right
way.  
I got so much respect for their players and also Coach Martelli.  
  
Q. Kevin, Shabazz has made so many huge plays in the last two years at the
end, but the fact was tonight, the 11 big points last minute in regulation and
the first couple minutes of overtime, those 11 points were all scored by
DeAndre or Amida. Could you talk a little bit about what they brought tonight
at that very crunch time when the season was on the line.  
COACH OLLIE: Oh, they brought a lot. They've been stepping up. DeAndre's been
stepping up, and Amida's been stepping up. If you followed our tournament in
Memphis, they was both stepping up. I've seen them be more confident.  
And we have to trust each other. Ryan Boatright trusts Amida to throw it up
and not throw it at the big fella's ankles. So it's just great plays by them.
They wanted to win.  
And you can't wait, and they didn't wait. Amida stepped up and made those free
throws. But there's certain things you all don't see, but he had been working
on that every day after practice with Glen Miller, every day, every day.
That's things under the waterline that a lot of people don't see.  
When he got it in that moment, he stepped up, and it was great for him. It was
great for DeAndre. I need DeAndre to still rebound more, but we'll take four,
and we'll take a win.  
  
Q. Two separate questions. One, talk about that play at the end of
regulation with Amida, the put ‑back and the free throw, which you wouldn't be
here winning now if it weren't for that free throw. And secondly, your guards
and Amida did a much better job in the second half of dribble penetration than
they were in the first half. Talk about those two aspects.   
COACH OLLIE: Amida went to get the basketball, got a great offensive rebound,
went to the right hook, and that's pretty much money in the bank when he turns
over the left shoulder. He got a foul and got excited. Then he composed
himself and went to the free‑throw line and knocked them down. Then he hit two
big free throws in the first possession of overtime, which is huge. That's
three in a row.  
I think we made 15 in a row, something like that, in the game in that last
half, and that's just phenomenal. If you come to our practice, we spend a lot
of time on free throws. That play with DeAndre, he does a great job.  
I mean, all of us did a great job, and I'm just so proud of those guys. All
the plays that we made was winning plays. It's not only the guys in the game.
Everybody sees the guys in the game. I'm talking about Omar Calhoun and guys
like that, cheering their teammates on. That's what I'm so proud of.  
Everybody can make winning plays in a game. It's not just the five on the
court. It's everybody. You know, in practice, Kentan, Terrence. It's guys that
don't even play a lot, and they're giving us effort in practice. That's
winning plays to me, and that's the only thing I care about.  
  
Q. Coach, we talked about DeAndre and Amida's big play down the stretch, but
it seems like in the last couple of weeks, especially Ryan, those times where
we see Shabazz get explosive, it's been Ryan taking over at times. What have
you liked from him the past couple of weeks, and do you think he's taken his
game to the next level?  
COACH OLLIE: I just like Ryan's level. I think you have the right attitude, it
leads to certain situations where you're in the game and your mind is in the
game and you're playing for others. When you play for others, that
reciprocates back onto you and when you get open shots. You know, Shabazz gave
him open shots, you know, great assist on time and on target, and Ryan knocked
them down.  
He's been a special player for us, and we're going to continue to keep getting
him the right shots. And Boat got to understand, when he penetrates, it's for
others, and that's what he's starting to do. He's starting to share the game.
Got three assists, one turnover. He's 5 for 10. He was efficient with 17
points, and that's where we want his game to be at.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Ollie, congrats. See you Saturday.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

Villanova  73  
Milwaukee - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Villanova head coach Jay Wright and student‑athletes
James Bell, Darrun Hilliard, and JayVaughn Pinkston. Congrats, guys, on a
great performance. Open with a statement from Coach Wright.  
COACH WRIGHT: Thanks, Paul. Tough fought game. That was not, as everyone here
knows, a 12‑point game. Milwaukee is a really tough team and hard to play
against.  
Their defense was outstanding. And I thought our patience and our defense got
us through the first half until we could hit some shots and get some stops and
get out in transition the second half.  
But I give them a lot of credit. I was really, really proud of our guys not
making shots and still continuing to defend and play hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.  
We'll take questions just for our student‑athletes at this point.  
  
Q. Darrun, I wonder if you could talk about in the first half, I think you
scored seven straight points and kind of brought you guys back to tie. Can you
just talk about what you were able to take advantage of maybe in that time
frame?  
DARRUN HILLIARD: Yeah, I was just trying to be aggressive, make plays for
myself and my teammates. I was seeing lanes that I could take, and I was able
to finish. I was just trying to make plays out there. That's all.  
  
Q. JayVaughn, I think you opened the second half with a couple of layups,
maybe one where you were fouled and converted the free throws. Those five
points, I think it was a four ‑point game at halftime. How big were those five
points to start the second half to give you a little bit of a cushion?   
JAYVAUGHN PINKSTON: I think those started with stops we got. We got a triple
handoff kicked out to me, and then I kicked it out the next play. It was just
getting the ball inside out, basically.  
  
Q. James, you talked about how badly you wanted to win an NCAA Tournament
game before you left Villanova. Can you just sort of describe the feeling of
sitting up there now having won a game?  
JAMES BELL: With our focus, our focus is always the next game. Selfishly, I
definitely wanted to win one. Me being a Villanova basketball player, the next
game is the most important.  
So this being the most important game, it meant a lot to just get this one.
Now we focus on UConn.  
  
Q. For all three of you guys, early on, did you guys see signs of the Seton
Hall game over again and if so, how did you guys change from what happened
last week and transform it into something good this week?  
JAMES BELL: I don't think we did. UConn game, we weren't ourselves in the
beginning of the game. This game, as a leader, I tried to get the team to come
out with a different intensity and a different attitude. We did it.  
Personally, I didn't see any signs of the Seton Hall game. We came out, played
hard, played smart, and played together. That's what we had to do.  
DARRUN HILLIARD: I didn't see any signs of that either. We been through that
throughout the season, and we learned from it. We practiced this whole week,
and I didn't see any signs of a relapse of Seton Hall.  
  
Q. James, now you can talk about the next game, and the next game is against
a familiar opponent even though it's not a conference rival anymore. What
might it mean to be playing a team your team is familiar with?  
JAMES BELL: They're a great team, well coached, and like you said, we're
pretty familiar with them. They're not in our league anymore, but we played
against them a number of times.  
It's just another opportunity to play a great team. We haven't focused on who
we were going to play, who it was going to be. We just focused on the next
game.  
But now like you said, it's time to focus on the next game. Great players,
great opportunity for us, and a good opportunity for us to go do what we do
another time.  
  
Q. And just as a follow ‑up, it's almost like a Big East reunion here in
Buffalo.   
JAMES BELL: Right. I like it that way.  
  
Q. Why?  
JAMES BELL: Used to those battles. Like I said, they're a great team, well
coached, great players, and you want to play against the best. We can say
that, to get this far, they have to be a great team. This is what this time of
year is about.  
  
Q. James, can you just talk about the difficulty of grinding through a game
when your shot is not going in.  
JAMES BELL: As a shooter, you're going to have good nights, and you're going
to have bad nights. It's not about making the shots, it's about taking the
right ones and recognizing you're open.  
But when your shot's not falling, you've got to do other things. You've got to
rebound. You've got to get stops. You've got to get steals. You've got to get
assists. You've got to just affect the game. But you're going to have good
nights, you're going to have bad nights as a shooter.  
  
Q. Was it weird at all seeing Saint Joe's walk off the floor as you guys
were getting ready to take the floor?  
JAMES BELL: I mean, we see them a lot in the city maybe. You might run into
them getting something to eat. So we're pretty familiar with the players.  
But I don't think it was weird seeing them walk off the floor. Sorry they
lost. Great team. I mean, we were going to play either of the two, but it
happens. There has to be a winner, has to be a loser.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you for your time. Congrats.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned it in your opening narrative a little bit, but that
didn't really have the feel of a 20 ‑point game for quite a long stretch, did
it?   
COACH WRIGHT: Not at all. That was a very well‑coached team and a team we did
not want to get behind on early because they could really control the tempo of
the game.  
They're really good at reading how you're defending them. I thought we tried
to contain Aaron early. It gave them some open threes. Then we tried to get
out on the three‑point shooter, and they started driving and getting fouled.  
They're a well‑coached team. That was a tough game.  
  
Q. Jay, what's your level of concern with James Bell's shooting the last few
games?  
COACH WRIGHT: None at all. I mean, he's had some of these nights
consecutively. He had a little run like that. I know it's coming.  
When you have games like this when you don't make them and you win, I think it
gives these guys more confidence. Because then you get another game where they
don't make them, and they're not worried about it.  
  
Q. You had similar struggles with lower seeds in 2009 and '06. Was it a deja
vu type of thing? How do we get rid of these guys?  
COACH WRIGHT: You know, I think for me, I've just accepted it as this is the
way it's going to be for us, I guess. I actually thought the first three or
four possessions, the way we played defensively, I thought we were going to
really shut them down.  
We lost them in transition for two threes, the back of our press. We had to
get out of the press because they were hitting threes. But if they would have
missed those threes, we could have been on a run and got a big lead early.  
I just look at it for some reason with us, we usually win them, but we
struggle when we're a high seed playing in a first round game.  
  
Q. Just a quick follow ‑up on Hilliard. I think he had 11 points in the
first half when you didn't have other things going offensively. How big was
that effort in the first 20 minutes?   
COACH WRIGHT: It was huge. They're a very, very good defensive team. They
really are. They're very smart about how they defend. They'll give you a shot
you think is open, but then they're right on you. So they keep it packed in.  
Darrun was the only guy that could get through their initial defense. He had
some tough shots in the lane. So that was big for us.  
I mean, we were struggling. We were really struggling, and he got us going.  
  
Q. Jay, I know you said you're not concerned with James' shooting, but you
guys started off 0 for 16 from three. Any cause for concern, just sort of how
the guys are handling the playoff atmosphere right now, or just how the last
two games have been?  
COACH WRIGHT: No, we've had some games like this. It's not bad. I think it's
like baseball. If you're a.300 hitter, the numbers are going to play out, and
you're going to make shots.  
I know these guys are good shooters. After it's over and you win, I like it
better because you get the confidence that we can win when we're not making
shots.  
  
Q. Jay, it seems like a Big East reunion. You just can't escape it. What do
you make of seeing Boeheim here and Ollie now and Jim Calhoun in the stands
and all the other stuff?  
COACH WRIGHT: You know, coming back up to this area, this is Big East country
up here. When we came into the hotel, we're staying in the hotel with
Syracuse. My wife Patty and I saw Darryl and Jim in the lobby, spent an hour
with them, talked an hour on Wednesday night. The Syracuse A.D., the Villanova
coach and his wife, and we talked about the ESPN special in the old days. It
was great.  
Then at practice yesterday, I got to see Kevin. They were coming off the
court. Jim Calhoun grabbed me. We had a great talk. Hey, I grew up with it. I
love it. It's been a thrill to be back up here.  
I'm a big Kevin Ollie fan, man. I remember him when he was an assistant, and I
remember Jim. I remember Jim telling me, Jim and I and Kevin were sitting at a
game in D.C., I remember where we were recruiting. I remember Jim said to me,
This guy is going to be really good. This guy is going to be a great head
coach someday. It was about four years ago, and he's right.  
  
Q. Hey, Coach, I'm wondering how much of a difference maker do you think
it's going to be with Kris Jenkins finally knocking down a shot? He's been in
double figures 4 of the last 5 games?  
COACH WRIGHT: Kris Jenkins is a freshman who came in as a great scorer and
great shooter. He struggle at the beginning of the year shooting, but he did a
lot of thing defensively, rebounding. But you knew the kid is a great shooter.  
His coming on late in the season is valuable, and you can see, if not for him
tonight, we'd be in trouble.  
  
Q. Jay, what do you make of the kid from Milwaukee playing for two minutes
without a shoe on and then drawing a key charge?  
COACH WRIGHT: You know what, I didn't even know it until the end. I didn't
even know it. I didn't even know it until after the charge. I don't know what
that says about me, but I didn't even know until after. I didn't know how long
it was.  
  
Q. Jay, a lot of the three ‑point shooting issues that you're having are
because teams are defending your three‑point shot.   
COACH WRIGHT: Exactly.  
  
Q. I think we talked a couple weeks ago about you guys work on midrange and
work on two ‑point shots a lot more than you would think a team takes as many
threes as you do. Is this the kind of night where that pays off? I know you
don't expect 46 points in the paint, but you got a lot of production where you
needed to to win the game.   
COACH WRIGHT: Giving away my secrets. Do we need to talk about this?  
  
Q. Yes. There's a lot of secrets in this game.  
COACH WRIGHT: You're right. If teams are going to be really aggressive taking
away your three, then you've got to have an answer for that. Early in the
game, we went inside to JayVaughn. They're big, man. They're long, and they're
really good in the post.  
So then you've got to have a midrange game. At the end, second half, we were
getting in the lane, stopping in the lane.  
It was interesting, in the beginning of the second half, first two times we
did it, we work on that jump, stop, pivot, and they called traveling. We were
going to be in trouble if that was going to be a travel the rest of the night.
There's an interpretation there that we don't need to go into.  
After that, we started getting in that midrange area and hitting those shots,
stopping, pivoting. James Bell hit one. Josh Hart hit one. That's got to be
our answer if we're not making threes.  
  
Q. Jay, can you just quickly talk about what Tony Chennault does for your
team. He's more than ten minutes a game.  
COACH WRIGHT: He was great tonight. He brought tremendous energy. He got four
fouls that were dive on loose balls, try to get a charge, just aggressive.  
Again, in the first half, we couldn't break their perimeter defense. He got
into the lane, got Taj Bell three. We missed it, but then he got into the lane
and scored.  
Tony's tremendous for us. Ryan didn't have a great night tonight. I thought
Tony and Ennis did a great job, especially Tony.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 20, 2014

  

### [Jordan Aaron](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26794)

### [Austin Arians](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26865)

### [Rob Jeter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26796)

  
_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  

Villanova  73  
Milwaukee - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Milwaukee head coach Rob Jeter as well as
student‑athletes Jordan Aaron and Austin Arians.  
Opening statement, Coach, from you.  
COACH JETER: We have to give Villanova a lot of credit. I mean, to be
undersized, they do a nice job of fighting and being aggressive, and
eventually they just wear you down. I think that's what happened to us.  
They really kept us off balance most of the evening, and we just really
weren't able to establish clean post looks and get to the free‑throw line when
it mattered. I know we got there, but we didn't get there when it really
mattered.  
You have to give them a lot of credit for how disciplined of a group because
you have to be disciplined, when you're undersized, to battle big guys.  
But my team, I think the score doesn't really indicate how these guys played
and the way they battled and fought. I'm very proud of my team.  
There's going to be 67 teams that are disappointed like us. These guys really
battled all season, and I'm very proud of them.  
  
Q. I know it was a tough game, what was the experience just getting here
like for you guys? Going through the Horizon League Tournament and getting on
that run.  
JORDAN AARON: The experience, it was great. I couldn't be more proud of my
teammates for what they've done this season. We fought through everything
possible we could this season to get to this point, and I can't be more proud
of them for the effort they gave out there tonight and what we've done this
whole season.  
We went through a lot of ups and downs together, and I will never forget this
moment and this team, being a part of this team.  
AUSTIN ARIANS: Yeah, this experience was unbelievable. I mean, we were picked
to finish last in the preseason poll, and we ended up winning the conference
tournament and getting the chance to come here, which was unbelievable.  
Every guy on this team has stepped up at some point during the year. I can't
give enough credit to every single person on this team. Everybody had their
moments and had a great time doing what we accomplished this year. It was
awesome.  
  
Q. Jordan, probably 1 of 15 wasn't what you were expecting. What was going
wrong from the field today?  
JORDAN AARON: Just got to credit Villanova. They did a great job of keeping me
off balance and just staying into me. They just did a great job on defense.  
A lot of shots I took just didn't fall for me tonight, and you just got to go
with what happens out there. But you got to credit Villanova. They did a great
job on defense.  
  
Q. Guys, what was the feeling like at halftime?  
JORDAN AARON: It was just definitely just to get back out there and execute
what we were supposed to do. Just get the ball on the side, try to get our
bigs touches, and keep our tempo to the game. That's what we tried to come out
in the second half and do.  
You've just got to credit Villanova for the effort they gave. They kept us off
balance tonight, and they didn't let us get it in the post and get comfortable
with what we were used to doing. So I tip my hat. They did a good job.  
  
Q. So you guys went right to the crowd after the game. What was it like to
have that support from Milwaukee?  
JORDAN AARON: It was definitely a great feeling. I mean, Milwaukee, our fans,
they have done a tremendous job all year sticking by us.  
Definitely coming off last year with the season that we had was very rough,
and they always stuck by us. They was our backbones, and they traveled a long
way to get here. We just definitely wanted to thank them for that.  
A lot of family members, everybody on the team, and we had a great support
system this season. I can't thank them enough for what they've done for us and
how they always stay behind us through every adversity that we faced this
season.  
AUSTIN ARIANS: It's an awesome feeling when you are traveling from Milwaukee
to Buffalo, and Villanova is only traveling from Philly, and we see as many
fans as we had there tonight. It's an awesome feeling to know that we have the
support of Milwaukee behind us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Great season.  
  
Q. There's a lot of things on this box score that, if you said before the
game you were going to get them, you'd be happy with it. Holding them to four
threes would certainly be one of those. Did you concentrate on arranging your
defense out there and preventing those, and did that open up the paint a
little more than you might have liked under ideal circumstances?  
COACH JETER: Well, yes, we definitely wanted to make them take tough
two‑pointers. I don't really think they got easy two‑point shots until like
the last four minutes.  
We could have played the game to play it safe, but we played it to win. That's
not our style to over extend ourselves and to pressure them, but to try to win
this game, we were going to have to take a chance and do that.  
To run them off the three‑point line was definitely part of the game plan. I
thought we did a nice job of rebounding some of those misses. Their
athleticism just to get to some of those rebounds just late in the game just
was a difference.  
Defensively, to have one field goal in the last five minutes, I mean, that's
where it was won. Defensively, they did a nice job.  
  
Q. In the first half, you guys were up, kind of had the momentum behind you,
fans were in it. Then Villanova went on the 9 ‑0 run. Was that the turning
point in the game, do you think?   
COACH JETER: I don't think it was a turning point in the game. We've hit those
lulls before. It was the free throws. It was the lack of getting to the
free‑throw line the first half. I thought it was the difference, or the
turning point for us in the first half. The frustrating part was we couldn't
get to the free‑throw line, and we only attempted one. That was just we didn't
get a chance to get the ball inside.  
Clearly, the 9‑0 run changed the momentum of the game. That's automatic. But
did it change the game? Did we think we were defeated at that moment? No. But
it did change the momentum of the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach. Great season. Appreciate your time.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to Buffalo, New York, First
Niagara Center, for our press conferences today. Today's format will be
student‑athletes first then followed by the head coaches.  
I'm joined on my right by Devin Oliver and Jordan Sibert from Dayton. Welcome,
guys, to Buffalo. We'll go ahead and get started with questions.  
  
Q. Devin, what are the keys to this game? Are you going to score against the
Buckeyes? What have you got to do to win?  
DEVIN OLIVER: I think the most important thing going into this game is just do
what we do every day. The team up to this point has just got us to this point.
So just continue to be the day in and day out team.  
Obviously, defense, rebounding, and limiting our turnovers are probably some
of the more important factors of the game.  
  
Q. What about Aaron Craft? He's a great defender. How do you deal with
him?  
DEVIN OLIVER: Craft is a great player. He plays extremely hard. From what I've
seen, over the course of my career, watching him play, he plays extremely
hard, and he has a will to win.  
We've just got to match that with our hard play. We know he's a good on ball
defender. So some other guards, other than the point guards, are going to have
to help bring the ball up and relieve the press.  
  
Q. This is for Jordan. Welcome to Buffalo. Obviously, you've probably been
asked this question several times. Deep connections to Ohio State and what
your reaction when you saw the bracket come out, and what this game tomorrow
might mean to you?  
JORDAN SIBERT: Definitely excited when I heard that we were playing them. You
know, every transfer would love to get a chance to go against their old school
again.  
But definitely just excited. Me and my teammates are just blessed to be in
this position and just be in the tournament. Playing Ohio State is definitely
going to be a tough game. They're a great defensive team. We're definitely
going to have our work cut out for us, but as long as we just stay together
and play hard and play how we've been playing all year, we'll be okay.  
  
Q. Just as a followup, what led you to Dayton? Any hard feelings in regards
to Ohio State?  
JORDAN SIBERT: No hard feelings at all. Leaving the program, Thad did a great
job helping me find a new place. My choice for Dayton was pretty easy. I've
had a great relationship with Coach Archie. He's actually the one who
recruited me to Ohio State. Me being from Cincinnati, making that trip to
Dayton was definitely an easy choice for me.  
  
Q. Jordan, you and B are the only guys who have been to the tournament
before. Have your teammates been asking you questions all week?  
JORDAN SIBERT: Not really. They're excited for the opportunity just like me.
Me being from Dayton and enjoying the whole trip, I'm reliving it all over
again. This is my first time with the Flyers, and I just want to enjoy it with
these guys.  
  
Q. Jordan, talk, if you would, about how your redshirt year.  
JORDAN SIBERT: My redshirt year was very important to me. Not only just
working on my game, but getting familiar with my teammates, being able to get
familiar with the system, how Dayton works. It definitely took my game to a
whole other level. I really give credit to the coaching staff who really took
time with my game and to my teammates who really helped me develop and really
pushed me in practice.  
Even though I couldn't play, just in practice every day, just making the game
like as much as possible for me, so I give credit to my teammates and my
coaches.  
  
Q. Ohio State's basketball program maybe could be looked at as the top
basketball program in the state. How important is it on a national level with
this platform to maybe take down the top dog?  
DEVIN OLIVER: I mean, it would be great, but as a team, we feel like we
deserve to be here. I don't think you can really get into that big
brother/little brother mentality, per se. We're a great basketball team. We're
here to win.  
The most important thing here is advancing. Not just beating Ohio State, but
getting to the next round. I mean, it would be great to beat anybody, but we
just want to advance.  
  
Q. You mentioned the keys for you guys, rebound, defense, limiting
turnovers. Three ‑point shooting has been really good. Devin, what do you see
from their three‑point defense that stands out? And how could that be a
challenge for you?   
DEVIN OLIVER: We haven't watched an extensive amount of film just yet, but
Ohio State is known for their defense, getting on to shooters, running them
off the line, and then the next player stepping up and helping. So I think
it's just important for us to take good shots. If you can drive the ball and
kick it to get an even better shot, then that will only help out our team.  
So I think just continuing to share the ball.  
  
Q. For Devin and Jordan, like you said, I don't know how much you've seen of
Ohio State, but how difficult do they make it on the opposing team to inbound
the ball from the baseline? It seems like that's something they really put on
emphasis on.  
JORDAN SIBERT: They definitely take a lot of pride in denying that pass and
trying to get steals and turning teams over. So we've definitely looked at
that on film, and that's one thing that we want to make sure we take pride in
the ball and make sure we don't turn it over and just try to be as protective
as we can. That's something we know that they take pride in. That's where they
do score. So it's something we want to limit for them.  
  
Q. Jordan, taking something that Devin just said there, the big
brother/little brother thing. You've been in both programs. Was there a
feeling like that when you were at Ohio State? Do you see any difference in
the two programs? Ohio State's a little higher profile.  
JORDAN SIBERT: One thing I would say about Ohio State, they're competitors.
Regardless, it seems like they can win, they're all competitors. So I don't
think there's a little brother/big brother thing here with me.  
Being from both teams, I know we're both competitors. Thad's a great coach.
Archie is a great coach. We all just want the same thing. We all want to win
and advance.  
  
Q. Jordan, where did you visit besides Ohio State when you came out? What
did you pick Ohio State over?  
JORDAN SIBERT: I believe it was over West Virginia and Tennessee. It was so
long ago.  
  
Q. Jordan, the fact that you know these guys, how much is it an edge for you
in terms of a competitive drive versus needing to stay within yourself and not
do too much?  
JORDAN SIBERT: I'd be lying if I said I wasn't like I'm not hyped about the
game. Playing against your friends and going against people who you've grown
up with is definitely, definitely something to be excited about.  
But at the end of the day, I want to win. Me and my teammates want to be
considered winners at the end. It's not about me. It's not about me playing
against old teammates. It's not about Jordan or Coach Miller versus Ohio
State. It's about Dayton Flyers versus Ohio State. And at the end of the day,
we just want to win.  
  
Q. Chip on the shoulder, the idea of Dayton versus Ohio State, but also you
versus Ohio State, how much is there one? As you mentioned, you'd be lying if
you said you weren't hyped for the game. So to what degree? How would you
explain it?  
JORDAN SIBERT: I definitely have a big chip on my shoulder, definitely want to
go out there and play to the best of my ability, not do too much, just go out
there.  
Whatever my team needs for me, I don't care if I score a lot or a little. At
the end of the day, as long as we have a win on our side, that's all that
matters to me.  
  
Q. Jordan, how are you doing? In terms of you developed relationships while
you were at Ohio State, who did you have the closest relationship with as far
as another player? And how often do you communicate with those individuals?  
JORDAN SIBERT: I would say Craft is my closest relationship. I talked to him
earlier in the year. We haven't really communicated as much. As far as lately,
I've talked to Sam the most. Actually, I texted him a smiley face once I heard
who we were playing, and he said, I'll see you Thursday.  
So definitely no hard feelings with most of the teammates. We were all family
there. It's just basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Time for two more.  
  
Q. Devin, were your parents excited that Western Michigan also ended up here
in Buffalo?  
DEVIN OLIVER: Yeah, Western recruited me coming out of high school. They're
five minutes down the road. I always give my parents grief about Western
because it's their alma mater. They both played there. It's their alma mater.  
But they're excited. They said they're happy to come and watch me play as well
as their old school. So I'm happy for Western too. Good to see a team out of
Kalamazoo in the tournament.  
  
Q. Do you know any of the guys on that team?  
DEVIN OLIVER: Yeah, actually, one of the kids, Von Washington III, he went to
my high school as well. He was my principal's son. He plays there. So, yeah...  
  
Q. Jordan, if you could just tell me what Devin means to this team. I mean,
he's the guy, the senior that's been here, and you guys kind of ride him a
little bit.  
JORDAN SIBERT: Devin is the heart and soul of this team. From practice to
outside of the court, he brings energy. He brings life to this team, and it's
good. You know, when you transfer anywhere, you always want to try to find who
you can be compatible with and who you can hang around. This guy's been a
great friend, been a great influence. He's definitely somebody I'm proud to
have on my team and proud to be on this journey with.  
THE MODERATOR: Jordan, Devin, thanks for your time. Appreciate it. Good luck.  
We'll have Coach Miller up here shortly.  
We're joined now by Dayton head coach Archie Miller.  
So, Coach, if you want to make an opening statement, and then we'll take
questions.  
COACH MILLER: Obviously, I'm very excited to be here. We've, like all teams
that participate in the tournament, have had our moments this season, good and
bad. Very proud of our group. Together, a lot of camaraderie. Every individual
on a team has their moments where they've had their day in the sun and helped
us win games.  
We've been about the right things from the very beginning. So it's very
rewarding to be here. Obviously, Ohio State presents a lot of challenges, to
say the least, and we're trying to gear ourselves up, and we're ready to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.  
  
Q. Archie, is it too much to overstate this as a battle for Ohio?  
COACH MILLER: Yeah, it's too much. I think everyone understands in the state
of Ohio what it's about in that state. That's Columbus, and that's where they
are. It's a powerful, powerful place. I was very fortunate to spend a couple
of years there and feel that and understand it.  
But at the same time, a place like ours has its own special tradition, has a
great program, an unbelievable fan base. In my opinion, the best fan base in
the state of Ohio for basketball.  
You can get caught up in that big brother/little brother, knocking off the big
dog, all you want. But there's a lot of great programs in the state, a lot of
great coaches, and we feel like we earned a right to be here.  
Regardless if it's Ohio State or anybody else, we have to prepare to be
ourselves. Come here and be ourselves. Locked into what's gotten here, not who
we play and what part of the state they live in.  
But it's going to be the topic of conversation, and to be on the same floor
with them is exciting.  
  
Q. Just as a follow ‑up, Archie, you having coached under Thad. I mean, what
is your emotion knowing that you're going to be going up against a guy you
coached under in Thad?  
COACH MILLER: Thad means a lot to me. He's been a really special guy in my
life for a long time. He's always looked out for me, even when I was a player
coming up. To have an opportunity to work for him, he opened a lot of doors
for me mentally in terms of what the game was really about. He changed the
view for me.  
He gave me a different impression of how to coach the game. Number one, just
how to treat your players, how to really have a program about making people
better, developing the ability to communicate with guys differently. Without
that, I don't think I'd be sitting here today.  
But when you get out there and play, you know, when you work for Thad, you
know how it is. He'll walk around with a smile on his face, but he's going to
try and stomp your head in the first chance you get.  
Being on the same staff with him, going to battle in practice every day, you
have a bond. Unfortunately, we have to play against them. Not so much to speak
of you want to win or lose versus a friend and what not. It's always tough.
You always want to see the guys who mean a lot to you do well and advance.
He's done a lot of that. So he's a good guy.  
  
Q. Normally rivalries come from familiarity, such as your rivalry with
Xavier. Is there an extra edge to this one in that Ohio State, unless placed
in a tournament with Cincinnati, Xavier, and Dayton, does not play them?  
COACH MILLER: Can you repeat the question?  
  
Q. Is there an extra edge to this game because Ohio State has to be placed
in the same tournament draw to play you guys and Xavier and Cincinnati?
Historically anyway.  
COACH MILLER: Yeah, I think there's a lot of great rivalries in the state of
Ohio. Obviously, I think our rivalry with Xavier is one of the more special
ones. I think that UC has its own with Xavier and what not. I think Ohio State
stands on its own two feet.  
Everybody would love to play them. Everybody would love an opportunity to play
them. They're not going to get that opportunity, though. In this day and age
with college basketball and scheduling and everything that goes on, you know,
it's just not possible.  
I think when you draw Xavier, Cincinnati, one of these match‑ups happen,
probably feels a little different to them than it does to the other teams.  
But in our case, we have a few guys that are connected to the state of Ohio.
We also have guys from New York. I've got a guy from New York right now, and
he has no idea what Ohio State‑Dayton would mean.  
  
Q. I just wonder, though, have you looked at Ohio State's pre ‑Big Ten
schedule? It was a pastry cart. I think it would be much more fan interest and
good for basketball if they would do this on some sort of rotation.   
COACH MILLER: I can't really speak for Ohio State's scheduling philosophy.
You'd have to talk to the big guy about that one.  
  
Q. Arch, if you would, just kind of talk about the finish your team had, how
you felt they played going into the postseason, especially on the defensive
side of things.  
COACH MILLER: We've improved a lot. That's been a credit to kind of our team
and how we've handled things. We've improved a lot. Like all teams, you're
going to hit some slides when things aren't going well, but we've been able to
respond.  
I think in the month of February, we became a team where we enjoyed coming to
work every day in practice. It started there. We got better game to game.
Winning helps that.  
But as we approached our finish, really felt like we were playing the best all
season that we've played. Our defense is really gotten a lot better in the
back ten games. It gave us a chance to win big games in particular on the
road. And our finish into even the Atlantic 10 tournament, our game with Saint
Joe's, it was a pretty high level game. We had a 13‑point lead with some
seconds to go on a team we hadn't played in weeks.  
We've continued to improve. The credit goes to the older kids. They've been
really good. This gives us a camaraderie late in the season. Certain guys can
fall by the wayside because they're not playing a lot.  
We've had guys in the games, three freshmen at times on the road, where
they've helped us win games as late as two weeks ago. I think that camaraderie
has really helped us improve. We're playing better, and we've played as well
as we've played all season long.  
  
Q. Archie, there's been a lot of conversation about the number of teams your
league has gotten into this tournament. Going forward now, is there a
responsibility to win and go forward or is it just the mere fact that you've
earned the bids here speak for itself?  
COACH MILLER: There will be a lot of talk about bids, et cetera. The Atlantic
10 this season was as good of a league as I've been in. Every team that got in
the NCAA Tournament got in on its own resume irregardless of the conference
affiliation. It's about the individual teams.  
In particular, the teams that we have that get in, they don't have the luxury
at times of playing the 12 to 15 conference games that are like the Big Ten,
the ACC, and what not, where they're marquee match‑ups that you're going to
live and die by.  
Our conference has to do it in the nonconference, which is difficult. You have
to schedule smartly. You have to try to put yourself in position to earn a bid
in November and December, which is unique. Everyone that's in is in for the
rightful reason of they approached it the right way and they earned it.  
There is a great sense of pride for our league, though. I think the coaches in
our league are great. I think the players are very under‑appreciated, in
particular. We have older kids in our league, seniors. Whether it's St. Louis
that starts five seniors, whether it's Saint Joe's that has three terrific
seniors, whether it's Rob Brandenberg and Juvonte Reddic in the Final Four,
are seniors.  
You typically are going to deal with older, battle‑tested kids that can really
play that come from areas that the coaches they're around every day are good.  
I look for all of our teams in our league to be successful. I wouldn't be
surprised if we didn't have two or three advance into the second and third
rounds, et cetera. But there is a great sense of pride because it is a great
league.  
We've dealt with as much turnover in a three‑year period as any conference,
and we're as good right now as we've ever been. That's probably credit to
Bernadette and her staff and what they've been able to try to do through all
the movement.  
  
Q. Obviously, Coach Matta, his teams emphasize defense and sharing the ball.
Coaching under him, I mean, you look at your team as you develop your program,
what are some of the things that you are trying to emphasize as a trademark
for your ball club?  
COACH MILLER: Well, I think Thad's teams uniquely do‑‑ if you just study them,
even from his very first couple years, they never turn the ball over. They
have great spacing, and they share it, and they're very unselfish. I think
that's one of the things that I've tried to do since we've gotten here. Maybe
different philosophies of how to play the game, but the very same thing of
taking care of the ball and really being unselfish, share the ball. That's one
of the things that Thad really does a great job.  
I think our team embodies that this season. They share the ball. They move the
ball. They move themselves. They care about making the right play.
Defensively, Thad's teams have always been terrific. They never foul. They
don't beat themselves. They're not undisciplined.  
We try to do that. Being young at times, aren't as strong as we need to be and
the size around the basket isn't the same. As I watch this team play, this is
a very unique style to watch Thad's teams defensively. He's got some
unbelievable ball hawks. Those guys just get after you. They can really
disrupt. They can put you on your heels at times.  
In particular, as I watched the Nebraska game in the Big Ten Tournament, they
just put them on their heels with their ability to defend. When you have a guy
like Craft out there, he's not the same player, but he's similar to a guy like
Briante Weber at Virginia Commonwealth, where he can dominate a game by
himself, on the ball, off the ball. He can wreck, so to speak, your half‑court
game by himself. When you have a guy like that, you can really do some things
uniquely on defense.  
But if you ask me, we try to play the right way. I think we try to play
unselfishly, and I think one of the things that really Thad does a great job
of, he really preaches that all year round, not just on game day. He preaches
that year round.  
We've taken a big chunk of that from him.  
  
Q. Just along the same lines, what stands out to you about their perimeter
defense and how much of a concern is that for you given you've been so good at
that lately?  
COACH MILLER: Sometimes you can be a good team defense, but they've got great
individual defenders. If Shannon Scott was named Big Ten defensive player of
the year, I wouldn't have been surprised. Him and Craft in together are
probably two of the best perimeter on‑ball defenders that you're going to get.  
Lenzelle is very experienced. He's been in championship games, and he defends.
You look at Amir Williams, when you have a rim protector like that around the
basket, it's very difficult, and they play around them, and their schemes are
good.  
I think our number one problem, if you ask me what our biggest concern is,
it's turning the ball over. You can't turn the ball over against Ohio State
because in transition, they really can cave you in with big runs, and they can
change the whole flow of a game defense to offense.  
So organization, being strong, and being ourselves, you know, don't try to do
things that you don't normally do.  
  
Q. Sort of along those same lines, what does Ohio State do on the baseline
‑inbounds play that makes it so difficult? You don't see a lot of teams that
place an emphasis on putting pressure on the ball at that point in the course.
  
COACH MILLER: They're probably as good as you get in terms of disrupting you
in special situations, whether it be under, whether it be dead ball after a
free throw. They have the ability to really, because of their uniqueness and
their quickness, switch, deny, blow things up. You're not allowed to run your
normal stuff, which then starts to play mind games with you. You over‑prepare.
You confuse your guys. So you've got that going on a lot.  
I think off dead balls, some of the shortstop press, some of the things they
do with their quickness when they go small is unique. It's personnel related.
Not everyone can do what they've been able to do. They've been good at it for
a long time.  
Even when I played with Thad, played different types of sideout, under route.
It's just a situation where you put the other team in a situation of do you
over‑prepare, under‑prepare, or do you understand how important it is to not
get beat in this area?  
That is something, obviously, we have to spend a great deal on as you get
ready to play them. Like I said, changing the game from defense to offense,
whether it's one steal, one run, one long pass underneath out of bounds, they
pick off. It changes your mindset a little bit. It's very unique. They do a
great job at it, and you have to be ready to go.  
Watching all the teams in the Big Ten, everyone has a different philosophy
against it. I think the big thing is just being sound and getting it in.  
  
Q. It hasn't been asked. What about your brother? What are you doing about
both you guys in the tournament?  
COACH MILLER: Obviously, I follow those guys a ton. Very happy for those guys.
I was sick to my stomach when Brandon broke his foot. I thought they had a
chance to win the National Championship. I thought they had a great way about
them.  
Watching they will respond to the injury over the last couple of weeks, three
weeks, four weeks, has been really good. I still think they have a chance to
make a deep run. I hope they get to a Final Four. They've earned it. But happy
for them. I was there on day one when six players sat in the locker room, and
the seventh player that was on the team, he wasn't coming back. He was going
pro, Nic Wise.  
So it was a daunting task. It was unfamiliar territory. To see where they're
at today is a credit to the way he does things. Wishing them well.  
THE MODERATOR: Not seeing any other questions, Coach Miller, thanks for your
time. Good luck.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome back to our afternoon session here at First Niagara
Center. We're joined now by student‑athletes from Connecticut.  
I'm joined up here by Niels Giffey and Shabazz Napier from the University of
Connecticut. We'll open with questions for these gentlemen at this time.  
  
Q. What's the single greatest benefit that you got from coming back for your
fourth year to play at UConn?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: I mean, there's no single benefit that's greater than the
other. When you play at University of Connecticut, it's always something we
call 'brotherhood.' That's one of the biggest things for us is we continue to
stay together. There's no other brotherhood that you would want to be part of.  
And, of course, being in this tournament is definitely a special attribute of
staying. But at the end of the day, we just want to play for each other, play
for the University of Connecticut. Wherever that takes us is where we're going
to go.  
It's exciting to actually be back here. It's exciting to be with this group of
members of my teammates. I can tell you, from what Giff's been telling me
about, he's just happy to be here as well. So it's exciting.  
NIELS GIFFEY: It's the same situation for me, just coming back for the fourth
year and just being excited to come back to the NCAA Tournament with this
group. Having people around you that care about you and that definitely love
you.  
So we're just happy to be here again at the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Shabazz, when Coach Ollie slid over that one seat from being assistant to
being head coach, that's a big move, and obviously he was filling some pretty
big shoes. Did you accept him right away? What was the transition like? Did he
appear to come into that role easily? And just how was the transition for you
all, too?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: We definitely accepted him very fast because he was a part of
the UConn tradition. He played here, and he was coaching under Coach Calhoun.
So we definitely accepted him fast.  
It was just a big step for him because when Coach Calhoun was here, Coach was
always yelling at guys, and Coach Ollie was the guy to put you on the wing and
comfort you. He had to switch that role.  
It was quite difficult for him in the beginning, but we all understood what he
needed to do to become as good as he is now. We understood that, and we move
forward from it.  
For him, I think it was quite easy because he had the players that believed in
him. He had players that was with him when he was an assistant coach. He
didn't just jump into a new position, not being with the team before. He was
definitely with us beginning of my freshman year. So it was much easier for
him.  
It was just a great opportunity for him to discover how well he is as a coach,
and he's proven a lot so far.  
  
Q. Shabazz and Niels, you guys have won a National Championship. How can
your tournament experience help you now?  
NIELS GIFFEY: It's definitely going to help us to just prepare for the games
and focus on the games. Just put all that stuff that's around us to the side.  
Obviously, we're going to enjoy the attention by the media, but as soon as you
step on the court, you have to put that aside. We've been through that whole
process. So we definitely benefit from that. We're going to pass that on to
everybody who hasn't been here, just showing them how focused you have to be
on what you got to do on the court.  
  
Q. Shabazz, what was it like last year watching the NCAA Tournament?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: I mean, I didn't watch the tournament. I was watching other
things. I didn't really think about watching the tournament. It definitely
sucked because I wasn't a part of it. But it fueled a lot of motivation and
hunger to get to where we're at now. Not only for myself, the whole team took
that as a sign of staying hungry.  
You know, there's always going to be another opportunity, and we just roll
with it. Now this is the opportunity that we have now against a great team
tomorrow. We got to show up and just play as hungry as we wanted to play last
year when we couldn't play.  
Hopefully, we'll be on the winning end of that game.  
  
Q. What do you see out of St. Joe's? Do they remind you of anybody in your
current conference or in last year's conference?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: I think every team's different. There's definitely some guys
that are definitely similar, but they're just a tough A‑10 team. There are no
slouchers in the NCAA Tournament. There's 68 teams make it, and not one of
them guys are slouches, because they're here for a reason.  
We know St. Joseph has great guards, great big guys, got a rich tradition, a
great coach. So we got to show up and show them a lot of respect because they
deserve it. We've just got to play the best basketball we can possibly play.  
  
Q. What were your impressions of your new conference this year? What
adjustments did you have to make? What did you miss about the Big East?  
NIELS GIFFEY: Well, I had a very, very good impression of the whole
conference. I think, obviously, the top five teams in the conference did a
pretty good job in the national rankings overall, and I thought it was really
competitive.  
You have great teams in Louisville, Cincinnati, Memphis, and then you had
teams that pretty much not a lot of people had on the map like SMU. I thought
it was a real competitive league.  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: I did so too. I thought it was super competitive. Our first
media day, I said that to a lot of guys that I think this is going to be a
great conference, just off the strength of the guards.  
The Big East, just miss the match in Madison Square Garden, that's the biggest
thing.  
But the AAC is definitely a great conference, and it's going to be good for
the next years.  
  
Q. Shabazz, DeAndre' Bembry has had a pretty good year. What have you seen
of him on film, and how does he kind of break down defensively? He's a pretty
good defender.  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: What number is that? 43, right? With the afro? The freshman,
right?  
  
Q. Right.  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: Yeah, the freshman. We've seen a bunch of film on St.
Joseph's. Collectively, they're a tough group defensively. He's definitely one
of them guys that's a glue guy that gets everybody together. It's kind of
crazy as he's a freshman. He sticks out there.  
For him to be that big and that quick, he's just a great three spot for them.
He gets them going. He's a big X‑factor. We have to make sure on defense we
take care of him, but on offense we get good shots, because he's going to
contest a lot of shots. He's going to do a lot of things that's going to
disrupt our offense.  
But at the end of the day, when you move the ball around, you're going to get
something good out of it. So hopefully, we'll be able to do that, and
hopefully we'll be, like I said, on the winning end of that.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about the Big East a minute ago, and looking at
the sheet here and Syracuse, Connecticut, and Villanova come in three in a row
here. Is it a little strange to see those three names in three different
conferences and all being here at this site?  
SHABAZZ NAPIER: Not strange. I mean, all three of them teams have always been
good. From Villanova to Syracuse to us, there's no strange reason why any of
us are here. We work hard.  
Villanova having great guards and having great big guys, just like JayVaughn
Pinkston, having great guards. Having us playing so well and just playing
collectively. There's no strange reason we're all here.  
We all worked hard in this big moment to play in the NCAA Tournament, and now
we've just got to take the best of our opportunities.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, guys. Good luck.  
We'll be back with Coach Ollie here in a moment.  
We're now joined by Connecticut Huskies head coach Kevin Ollie.  
We'll go ahead and take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kevin, you spent the brunt of your pro career with a couple of stints in
Philadelphia. Is it a little ironic that your first game as a head coach in
the NCAA Tournament is a game against a Philadelphia team?  
COACH OLLIE: Yeah, it's funny. Phil is a great friend of mine, know him real
well. In my days in Philadelphia, we used to practice over in the gym before
we got started in PCOM.  
I have a lot of respect for him, what he does for Coaches Versus Cancer and
the different things he's doing in the Philadelphia area. A lot of respect for
Phil and what he's done there over 30 years at St. Joe's.  
It's going to be a great test, and I'm looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Hi, Kevin.  
COACH OLLIE: Hi. How are you?  
  
Q. Good. Welcome to Buffalo.  
COACH OLLIE: Thank you.  
  
Q. What's it mean to you to have UConn back in the tournament right now
after what happened last year?  
COACH OLLIE: It's just a great opportunity for us. People see obstacles that
we went through, I see opportunities. We did a great job. My guys stayed
loyal. We thought we'd be an NCAA Tournament team last year, and now we just
took over that same mindset on into this year.  
It's always a players' game. They kept this university afloat when everybody
else was jumping off the bandwagon. I appreciate Shabazz. I appreciate my
seniors. And I appreciate everybody having that same mindset that we're
champions.  
Everybody said we was buried, but we were just playing it. We're going to keep
going forward.  
Love this university, and I love this time of year. Being a coach, I also
played in this tournament three years. I also had an opportunity to be an
assistant coach two years. It's just an excellent time for us, and we're very
excited to be on the stage once again.  
  
Q. To be in Buffalo, I'm not sure you're familiar with UConn's history here.
Jim had some nice times here, and in 2004, started here to spark the national
title run. Are you aware of that, and what might that mean to this program?  
COACH OLLIE: Yeah, of course I'm aware of our history, but this is another
year, another process, a different team, a different coach. But one thing I
always have, I do have Coach right here with me in spirit. He's here on the
trip.  
So any time I need to run some things by him, he's always there for me. So
it's a great opportunity for us to have a great run, but we're not looking
ahead of ourselves. We know it's a process. It's game by game. I'm
concentrating on St. Joe's, and then after that, we're going to cross that
bridge when we get there.  
  
Q. When you slide over that one seat, it's a big transition to go from
assistant to head coach, especially filling the shoes that you filled. I know
it's not yesterday now for you all, it's been a couple of years, but what was
that transition like? Were you confident going in, this is going to work, I
know exactly how this path is going to work? Shabazz was saying you used to be
sort of a good cop, and now you have to be sort of like not always a good cop
anymore. What was the transition like for you personally as a coach and when
you slid over that one seat?  
COACH OLLIE: Like you said, 18 inches is a lot. It's a lot of pressure. You
get suggestions, but you've got to make the final decision, and I take that
with the mindset that I have to make the decisions. I have to be stern in my
decision, and I can't waver.  
I always believed in myself. I always believed in my university, and that
never stops. I think that activates your power as a program when you believe.  
I could never fill Coach Calhoun's shoes. I could never do that. But I could
be the best Kevin Ollie I'm going to be. I never went in there like I'm going
to fill those shoes and try to be Coach Calhoun. I've got to be Kevin Ollie.  
I kind of say it like we're from the same fabric, but we've got a different
suit. But we're cut from the same fabric, though. I want to play defense. You
know, I want to rebound. I want to be the aggressor on the basketball court.  
At the end of the day, I want University of Connecticut to be the best
university in the country, and whatever I have to do to do that, I'm willing
to do.  
I want my players to sacrifice and understand what it means to be a brother to
each other. Hopefully we can do that, and hopefully we can continue the
tradition. I really love this team. I'm going to miss the seniors. I think
we're going to go out on a special ride this year.  
  
Q. How often do you speak to Coach Calhoun? And when you do, what do you
talk about?  
COACH OLLIE: You know Coach Calhoun. We talk about most everything. What play
have you seen last night? It's not all about basketball. Everybody thinks we
just sit back and talk about basketball. We talk about family. We talk about
all kinds of different things.  
He's just such a well‑rounded person. I mean, you could talk about books. You
could talk about anything. Coach is an expert at everything, and that's why I
love him.  
We spent a great time, but we also spend time about basketball. He's been
there. I'd be kind of naive if I didn't tap into those 40 years of being a
head coach. You know, I have Dee Rowe at my disposal. I also have Geno at my
disposal. So I'll be kind of naive if I didn't take something from all those
great coaches.  
But Coach Calhoun is like a father figure to me. He allowed me a great
opportunity to perform at a high level in college, and then also picking me to
become his assistant four years ago. If it wasn't for him giving me these
opportunities, I wouldn't be standing here today‑‑ or sitting down, I should
say.  
  
Q. Kevin, can you just talk about St. Joe's? What stands out to you about
them? Is there anybody they remind you of either in last year's Big East or
this year's AAC? Kanacevic seems to be a unique player.  
COACH OLLIE: Yeah, he's a unique player. He kind of reminds me of Marcus
Kennedy with SMU, where they run their offense through them. He's leading them
in assists. He's an extraordinary player. He can play on the house side, but
he can play inside too.  
We're going to have our work cut out for us. Galloway is an exceptional
shooter. He's not just a stand still shooter. He can go off the bounce. He can
step right and left. They've got other players. Bembry is a great freshman
that's kind of their energizer. He can get it off the rebound and push it.  
And what makes them tough, four guys can get it off a rebound and push in and
start their fast break because everybody is saying walk it up, team's slowing
down. I don't see it. I see them getting out in transition. They're selective
in their transition. But our first thing is getting back in transition and
making them play against our half‑court defense.  
Then they've got a great motion offense that Martelli, Coach Martelli has been
using for years, and getting the ball from side to side. We're going to have
to stay packed in our principles and play great basketball. We've got to be at
a level five, and that's a championship mindset, championship effort. We're
going to have to have a great mindset going into that game and a great
attitude.  
I think our team is real focused right now, and hopefully we can get a good
performance out of everybody that's able to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kevin, you know Phil Martelli, having been around the Sixers and that,
you know the kind of guy he is. Obviously, you play him, and it's all about
that game. But can you kind of feel for some of the tough things that have
happened to him this past season, for him to kind of rise above that stuff?  
COACH OLLIE: Yeah, I know he was going to rise above it anyway. I know that
wasn't going to defeat him. I just know what type of person he is and that
Philly mindset, that toughness. He's going to fight through it, but it's
definitely been a tough situation.  
I bet a lot of people have been through tough situations. But tough times, for
tough people, last longer, and he just out‑willed and out‑worked that tough
time. I knew he was going to get through it.  
I feel for him. I see the emotion when he won a championship at the Atlantic
10 in Brooklyn after the game. I just think he's a wonderful person. He's
going to even be stronger from this, and his family's going to be stronger
from this if they keep staying together. I know they're going to stay
together.  
So it's a great opportunity for them to believe and keep going on. It's going
to be a great matchup. Wish him the best.  
But I wish UConn more success in tomorrow night's game.  
  
Q. Kevin, a lot of guys talked about their last NCAA game, the Iowa State
game, maybe they didn't respect the opponent enough. They respected them but
maybe not quite enough. They say it's going to be different this time. Do you
get that sense that they're respectful of everything Temple can do, and
they're capable of beating them?  
COACH OLLIE: Yeah, yeah, not Temple. It's close enough. St. Joe's is a great
team, a great opportunity for us. I think for us not playing last year and us
watching Selection Sunday and not seeing UConn going in, it just was fuel for
the fire.  
I think they're not taking anything for granted because they know a special
moment can be taken away from them. They want to thrive, and they want to make
sure they're on top of their game.  
I think they're focused. They've been focused throughout the whole season. And
we've been through some ups and downs. It started at the beginning of the year
when we lost to SMU and lost to Houston and SMU back to back. They've just
been a resilient group. They've always stayed together. They love each other,
and that's the most important thing.  
I think the two most important things for a great team is that they listen to
each other, they respect each other, and they care about each other. I think
this team epitomizes that even in the difficult times. They always kept faith
in each other. I think that's a great attribute for any team.  
  
Q. Guys like Niels and Shabazz have been through a lot in their four years
and they won a National Championship. How much have you kind of leaned on
them? Have they kind of helped the kids behind the scenes preparing for their
first NCAA Tournament game or some of them?  
COACH OLLIE: Yeah, I always tell them, and I've told you before, they coach me
too. I'm just not a guy that's coaching them. They coach me. They let me know
when different things happen and on the court, also on the back of the scenes.  
And Niels and Shabazz has been great leaders for us. I think that leadership
character that they both have stands strong when the times get tough. That's
when I need them the most, when times get tough. Then also, when we have big
wins, can we come back and practice and still have that same mindset and still
have that same focus?  
Those guys have been rocks for me. Niels, man, if anybody's got a problem with
his playing time, it should be Niels. I mean, he could come to my office, and
I probably can't say anything, like Niels, you're right. He's been a great
player for us. He's been selfless.  
If I have him play 20 minutes or if I have him play 30 minutes, he just said,
Coach, what's next? Give me my assignment, and what's next? You love a player
like that.  
And then Shabazz has kind of matured over his four years. Everybody knows his
story, and he's just matured into a great leader. That's what you're in the
business for. You're in the business to see young men mature like that. It's
more than just being on the basketball court and making shots. It's about them
becoming men. That's what I want them guys to leave when they leave campus,
they're better men, not just better basketball players.  
Both of those two guys, those two players exemplify that.  
  
Q. Kevin, in terms of your own development from your freshman year at UConn
to your senior year and Shabazz, do you see any similarities?  
COACH OLLIE: No, he didn't have Coach Calhoun yelling at him. Just got to
start right there. Coach was always on me right at my first practice.  
You know, for me, I was a Los Angeles guy. I mean, I was from L.A.. I didn't
really know about the East Coast. I mean, he's been growing up watching UConn
his whole life. I didn't know about the Big East. Probably my junior year in
high school.  
So the similarity is not there the same. But the one thing we both have, we
have hearts big as this room. And we want UConn to win. That's the only thing
I love my players to have, that want to win, and overcome and not stop when
they hit the wall.  
That's what he has. He loves the big moments. I didn't even score 1,000
points. He's got 1,700 points. I think he's got my assist record. He's four or
five away from me on that. He can have it. I want him to be the first player
in UConn history to have two National Championships. That would be a great
honor. And the first step starts tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kevin, good to see your former Big East partners around here.  
COACH OLLIE: Yeah, it's great to see Jay, great to see Jim. I've got so much
respect for those guys. It was just great to see them and just always be
around them. They've been through so much. They always have to lend an ear
when I need something on the road. And recruiting, they're always giving me
some gold nuggets.  
So I'm always just paying attention. I'm sitting at their feet just listening.
It's going to be a great opportunity for UConn to be back in the mix, and I'm
looking forward to whoever we play. It starts with St. Joseph, and hopefully,
we can get through that, and we can keep going on.  
Our mindset, like I keep saying, and I keep saying that word because it's one
game at a time. It's nothing. We're not looking ahead at anybody. We're
looking at this moment, and we need to win every minute of a game, and we
can't lose sight of that.  
Hopefully, our student‑athletes understand that.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Ollie, appreciate your time. Good luck.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by student‑athletes from St. Joseph's
university.  
Joining me is Langston Galloway, Halil Kanacevic, and Ronald Roberts. Welcome
to Buffalo. Thank you for being here. We'll open it up for questions.  
  
Q. If you could just speak to the maturity of being a senior in this
tournament and how you would be better prepared for this now than you might
have been earlier in your career. In other words, what you've gained by
playing your four years in college.  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: Just being a senior, you've been through the battles, and
you've been through so much in your career. And these three guys, us three,
we've been through so much. We know what to expect, and we're just ready to
play.  
HALIL KANACEVIC: Basically, relaying off of what Langston said, none of us
have been in an NCAA Tournament, but we've all played in big games. I've been
in school for five years. They've been in school for four years. We've been in
numerous TV games against high level opponents. I don't think anything like
this is really going to affect us.  
RONALD ROBERTS, JR.: Like they say, we've been through four years grinding and
battling all the time, putting in work in the gym, and now we're just ready.
We waited four years to be here, and now we have the opportunity. We just want
to go out there and play as hard as we could and get some wins.  
  
Q. Langston, what kind of momentum do you think you guys can generate after
doing what you did during the A ‑10 tournament, going into this thing?   
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: I think we have a lot of momentum on our side. Like we were
just saying, we've been through so much, and winning the A‑10 tournament is
definitely big for our confidence, and we're going to try to keep on building
that as we go.  
  
Q. Ron, when you got to St. Joe's, you were kind of just sort of a one
‑dimensional guy who played near the basket. Now you've sort of developed as a
defensive guy down low. Could you just sort of take us through how that
happened and sort of how you've sort of developed into that role.   
RONALD ROBERTS, JR.: Yeah, well, when I first got here, I didn't have all the
answers. I came in with a clear mind. I listened to my coaches. I just wanted
to get better each year.  
Primarily, I was inside, and then I started expanding my game a little bit. I
wanted to work on my shot because I knew I couldn't just do it down low the
whole time. But I still play down low a good amount of the time, but it's just
good to have other aspects, to add other aspects to my game.  
  
Q. Halil, what do you get the most satisfaction from and why? An assist? A
three ‑pointer? A blocked shot? Or a dunk? And after that, can you tell us
what happened in that dunk in the A‑10 championship game, you know the one
when you missed it.   
HALIL KANACEVIC: That's a tough question. Probably a blocked shot. I mean, you
want to defend the basket. You want to be a good defensive team. You want to
be a good defensive player. You win games by stopping teams from scoring. I
could say assists because I love getting guys involved and I like seeing my
teammates score rather than myself, but defense comes first.  
We've been a great defensive team during the A‑10 tournament. Throughout the
year we've been a really good defensive team. So, yes, blocked shots to keep
them from scoring.  
On that dunk, they called a charge. I got hit in the legs and stopped my
momentum. They called the charge. So I couldn't finish. I wish I could have,
but what are you going to do?  
  
Q. You guys have been talking since the beginning of the year about the goal
of the season was to make the NCAA Tournament. Now you guys are here. Can you
talk about that, the experience so far, and how you guys feel about that?  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: I mean, it's big because we've been talking about it all
year, and like you're saying, we don't want to just stop right here and have
our careers end just getting to the first round and saying, All right, we made
it to the NCAA Tournament.  
We definitely want to go out there and shock some people. We want to go out
there and pull the upset off.  
HALIL KANACEVIC: Same thing as Langston said. We worked hard. Very happy with
the A‑10 championship. It's done a lot for ourselves and our school, but I
think we have a good enough team to get a good amount of wins this season. I
wouldn't say that if I didn't think so.  
We've got a veteran group, but we've got some youth with us. DeAndre' Bembry,
Chris Wilson, guys coming off the bench. Coach has us in the right mindset.
So, yeah, we want to get some wins in the tournament.  
RONALD ROBERTS, JR.: Yeah, off of what these guys said, I want to play
basketball for as long as we can. All three of us are seniors. After this,
college basketball is over. So it's kind of like the thing you want to just
keep playing as long as you could.  
  
Q. Langston, what has Bembry done to help this team throughout the season as
a freshman?  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: I mean, he's done a lot. He's the defensive stopper on our
team this year. He's made big buckets in crucial situations. He's able to
attack the basket, which definitely gives the perimeter guys a little more
room to operate.  
Offensively with Halil and Ron, they get a little more operating room, too. So
he's definitely meant a lot to this program.  
  
Q. Halil, you talk about defense first. What are going to be some of the
keys in stopping Shabazz given what he can do on the court?  
HALIL KANACEVIC: He's a great player. He does everything for that team‑
rebounds, scores, assists. So we've got a game plan that we've got to
definitely try to like execute it to the best of our ability. He's a great
player. He's not one of those players where he has a weak point to his game.
He can pretty much do everything.  
We've got to stick to the game plan. Coach is going to tell us what he wants
us to do, and we've got to execute it. It's worked for us the whole year, and
that's what we'll look to do.  
The guy's a good player, so he's going to make shots. We've just got to keep
going, keep playing, and that's pretty much our mindset.  
  
Q. Having Villanova in this pod, is there some Philly pride among the three
of you given the 'Big Five' wars that you guys have gone through for the last
four years?  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: We really can't look at Villanova right now. We know that
we have a big team in UConn in our way. It's definitely our mindset right now
because if we overlook UConn, we'll be headed back home back to Philly.  
So we don't want to look at Villanova just yet. We want to take care of
business tomorrow against UConn.  
  
Q. You talk about being through so much. What specifically do you draw from?
Was there a low point that you draw from?  
HALIL KANACEVIC: As a team or individually?  
  
Q. Team.  
HALIL KANACEVIC: For this season, I would say probably the loss after
Villanova. I can't sit here and lie. They killed us at home. That was
definitely a low point for all of us, mentally and physically.
Basketball‑wise, we didn't play good basketball at all. We weren't together.  
After that point, we just kind of regrouped. We knew we had‑‑  
  
Q. Before.  
HALIL KANACEVIC: Before the season, excuse me.  
  
Q. Four years.  
HALIL KANACEVIC: Oh, the four years? Yes, I'm still saying that, the four
years, it was the low point just because it's our last year, and we've been
through so much. We weren't trying to go out like that. We were 4‑4 after
that.  
These guys can attest to it. We hated having that feeling. It's happened a
couple times, but that was probably the worst feeling we've had since we've
been here. We didn't want to go out like that. So we got ourselves together,
had a pretty good run toward the end of the season. Went to the tournament and
won the A‑10 championship. So we've got to try to keep that going.  
  
Q. Langston, can you just talk about UConn, speak to what you see as their
strengths and what you need to do to get past them.  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: They're definitely a guard‑oriented program. Shabazz and
Boatright, they're definitely going to try and attack us, especially from
perimeter‑wise, and Daniels. They have a really good team. We're just going to
try to limit them as much as we can.  
But going to the counter aspect, we're going to go right back at them. We
don't want to just let them come at us. It's definitely going to be a fun
matchup, and we're ready to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you for your time.  
We'll have Coach Martelli shortly.  
We're now joined by St. Joseph's University head coach Phil Martelli.  
Coach, welcome back to Buffalo. You've been here before for this event. Always
good to see you. We'll open up with a statement, and then we'll take questions
from the media.  
COACH MARTELLI: Obviously, I'm elated to be coaching this group, have been
since June, tremendous character, and they've carried the day. What they
accomplished last weekend puts them in a special category at St. Joseph's
University, and they will be remembered for a very, very long time, not only
as champions, but the way they handled themselves when we were kind of down
and out on December the 7th.  
So I'm really pleased for them, excited for them. I sat in the back, and I
heard that, and I believe that, that this isn't enough, just to come here. The
way I've explained it to them this week is your euphoria goes to a 50 if
you're one of 32 teams that's still playing on Saturday morning.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start way in the back here.  
  
Q. When Kevin Ollie was up here, he mentioned that one of his stints with
the Sixers, when they were still practicing in your gym, that you and he
struck up something of a relationship, and he would pick your brain a little
bit. Even back then, did you say, Hey, this is a guy that could turn out to be
a coach? Could you talk a little bit about those encounters and what you
remember of them.  
COACH MARTELLI: Heavy emphasis on pick my brain for a little because there's
not much there. Class, class personified. Really, I do believe that those are
separate worlds, the NBA and college basketball are separate worlds, and he
would be a guy that I would say, Yeah, you could see him on a sideline in the
NBA.  
I'm in awe of the fact that he's two years in, he comes from the background of
the NBA, and the way his team defends. Again, maybe I haven't delivered this
clearly to my team. This is a St. Louis level defense, top ten in the market,
field goal percentage defense. Everybody wants to play fast. Ask any kid. You
want to play fast and average 80, and that will be great, and we'll get
everybody excited.  
You know what gets everybody excited? Winning. And that's what he's done,
including a big win over Florida that maybe we haven't talked enough about.  
  
Q. Phil, welcome back.  
COACH MARTELLI: Thank you. It's been a long time.  
  
Q. Any special memories from 2004? I know it's a different team, but ten
years later, here you are back again here.  
COACH MARTELLI: Yeah, my memory was, when I looked out there and said those
two guys are going to be in the NBA, I'm going to be pretty good at coaching
this weekend.  
And, again, it's ritualistic, it's not superstitious. We did practice at
Canisius this morning. But the last time we got off the bus to practice at
Canisius, I think I ruined about, I think they were $35 at the time, $35
shoes, but that was the high end for me at that point.  
But maybe a little bit different vibe. I mean, we were the number 1 seed. Not
that you're treated differently, but you could feel that. There was a lot
swirling around our team. There's a lot swirling around our team now, but it's
not about our team. It's about a member of my family.  
So you're sitting in a room today at the head coaches meeting, and Jay's
there, who's my friend, and Boeheim is my friend. He doesn't have many of
them, but I am one.  
Look, it's the memory of a lifetime. '03/'04 was the memory of a lifetime, and
have this group of kids with their character be with me is very special.  
  
Q. Just as a follow ‑up, Jim Calhoun is here, but he's available to Kevin
any time he needs him. What is it like to be facing a UConn team without Jim
Calhoun behind the bench?   
COACH MARTELLI: That's interesting because I think we're still facing the
brand, and I'm delighted that we're facing the brand that is UConn, because
when the name popped up for our team, our players in their lifetime have seen
UConn hang three banners. I just have to remind our guys that Kemba Walker is
not playing, and Rudy Gay is not playing, and Ray Allen is not playing, and
Emeka Okafor is not playing. They have a whole other cast of players who are
of that ilk.  
But I think it helped. I really do think it helped get us over the celebratory
hangover that we had on Monday.  
  
Q. Phil, you've talked a lot about what you've been through both
professionally and personally in the last year. Was there ever a moment where
you said, I don't know if I can do this, if I still have what I need in my
belly to continue?  
COACH MARTELLI: Not really in my belly, but my abilities, you know, some of
the things that they've been through, you all know were well‑documented. I
made a decision on a transfer. They were collateral damage on that. Whether it
was recruiting decisions or whatever, there was never self‑doubt. I would
label it more I was more self‑disappointment that I let people down and that
there weren't enough smiles and there wasn't enough joy in all that we were
doing.  
  
Q. So how did you get it back?  
COACH MARTELLI: Two groups really, to be honest with you. This group and their
character, and I picked it up in April and May last year, and I didn't want to
let them down. I didn't want to go into a Shell and say, Oh, woe is me, and
people should leave me alone. Don't they remember? I didn't do all that.  
And then the fact that my grandkids live with me, two of them now live with
me, they kind of took a little bit of the tension that I was walking around
with off.  
  
Q. Phil, if you could compare from a preparation standpoint, going back to
the ten years ago that you were here in '04, the difference between preparing
a team that does have two future NBA players and the best three ‑point shooter
in Big Five history versus a 10 seed and just how different are they, if at
all?   
COACH MARTELLI: I think that this team was better prepared than that team was
in '03/'04, only because of experiences learned and the way that we've gone
about this. We've taken their time and our time and kind of really reduced it
to being very efficient, I believe. That could be self‑promoting, but I
believe that we're very efficient in what we do.  
To be honest with you, when we got here in '03/'04, I was literally managing
people's time and doing less coaching because I had to make sure that,
'03/'04, they had a chance to be sons and to be friends and to be boyfriends
to people. It was a different world. Just ten years ago, no texting, no
tweeting, no Spacebook or whatever that thing is called that they do
(laughter). They just didn't have all those distractions.  
That's why I stand in admiration of what Wichita State has accomplished. They
went through this whole thing, and you haven't heard about a kid jaywalking.
And had it been ten years ago, look, people would have created a story. They
would have created misinformation to just be able to say, Hey, did you see
what I said?  
But I'm very comfortable with this team's preparation for this moment in time.  
  
Q. Phil, Ronald's a guy who everyone looks at him and sees the dunks and the
highlight stuff, but how has he sort of changed himself to be a guy on the
defensive end who sort of patrols that underneath the basket area?  
COACH MARTELLI: Work ethic and Dave Duda, my assistant coach. He took Ron and
spoke very bluntly about, You're going to be okay doing this, but you're going
to be a highlight reel dunker, and maybe you're not going to fit.  
You have to understand the frontcourt that he was trying to get in. We had
C.J. Aiken, who at a time led the country in blocked shots. We had Halil
coming with his whole kind of different skill set, and Ron had to find a way
to fit in there.  
And we would have many conversations. I asked him, when we played the big
lineup last year, I said, you're going to guard a small forward, but you have
to be really good at it. And he would study tape, and he would listen to the
coaches.  
The beauty of the person with him has allowed the basketball player to come
out and to keep continuing to grow. And I think maybe in three years from now
he's even going to be a much better player than he is today.  
  
Q. Was that something that you thought was possible when you asked him to
sort of make that move?  
COACH MARTELLI: That he would grow his game or that he would be‑‑  
  
Q. That he would be so good at it or so efficient at it for you guys.  
COACH MARTELLI: I believed in him. I believed in him from the day I saw him as
a junior in high school. I thought he could be special.  
  
Q. Phil, you referenced Wichita State. What has gone through your mind
during the course of the season? You're one of the few people that can relate
to what they've accomplished, and you talked about the social media aspect of
it, but what else has gone through your mind as you've seen them continue to
go?  
COACH MARTELLI: First, I think we over analyzed them. They went to the Final
Four last year, so they had a month of this. They knew what they were getting
into. Second was the infrastructure there. If it you ever watch a game there
and you think, Okay, this is as big time as this could get. What would I be
missing? You might say their leg.  
And then the third thing is, when they got to 28‑0, I went, I'm off the hook
because now when all of you need information on the next team that gets to
that number, why would you call me? We only went 27‑0\. So you're going to
call them, and Gregg Marshall can handle that.  
  
Q. How does winning those three games in Brooklyn in three days prepare you
now for this stage?  
COACH MARTELLI: It doesn't, to be honest with you. It really doesn't because I
think the excitement of conference tournaments is great. I think they're a bit
unfair because at no other time, other than an exempt tournament, do you play
back‑to‑back‑to‑back days. So in this tournament, we've had a normal practice
set. We've had the two days of practice.  
I just think that what it prepares us for is to realize that there are 68
special teams that have been selected for this tournament one way or another,
and we're never going to give that back.  
And then the other idea. You know, I was just asked by radio, I've never seen
anything like the limited bench. It's limited. What can I do? We just won an
Atlantic 10 championship. I don't know how many minutes those guys averaged,
but it had to be in excess of 35 minutes per guy. So we can do this. We can do
this for one night and play 40 minutes.  
  
Q. And one quick followup. 6 of those 68 are from the A ‑10\. What does it
say about the league that you guys are in?  
COACH MARTELLI: All tribute for that goes to Bernadette McClain, the
commissioner, the athletic directors and the presidents for scheduling and
allowing their coaches to schedule properly. It's pure and simple numbers. The
teams scheduled and won the games that they scheduled to be in a situation, to
be in the conversation, whether it was for five days or four days or three
days or on the last eight or whatever it would be.  
But it comes from the very top and the coaches buying in and saying, We're
going to do it. It also challenges now the six that have made it. There are
going to be eight teams at home now saying, We can do that, and we're going to
do that.  
So it's wonderful, wonderful competition, but it all comes from the plan that
originates at the top.  
  
Q. All that stress, that off ‑season stress, the personal issues that are
painful, how did you avoid like kind of wallowing in pity? You know what I
mean? That can be an easy thing to do. How did you manage to do that and keep
battling through it?   
COACH MARTELLI: Well, the players for sure, the character of these guys, and
the support, because each in their own way would say to me, Coach, I got you.
I got you. I got you.  
So when I would go to them and say, I need this, or I need you to do this
better, or I need you to eliminate this academic conversation that I'm having
via e‑mail with your professor, they bought into that, and they recognized it.
They could tell whether it would be my face or my movement or whatever, that
there was a lot going on, and there was a lot churning.  
There was a lot of discussion among friends, even some St. Joe people that,
you know what, maybe you should take some time off in the spring, but I can't.
I can't. This is what I do. It's not who I am, it's what I do, and I do this
365 days a year.  
  
Q. Phil, just to follow up on that real quick, that whole idea, I mean, is
this your best team? I know that 2004 team had two first ‑round picks. Is this
your best team?   
COACH MARTELLI: It's close. You know, I don't rank them. I don't rank wins. I
don't rank anything. I'll rank the Atlantic 10 champions, but this is close.
This is a group that I'd like to duplicate year in and year out for the rest
of my career.  
  
Q. So, Phil, your grandson, first of all, how much of the edge has he taken
off for you this year? Was there any thought of allowing him to sit with you
and answer some questions today?  
COACH MARTELLI: He has his own slot.  
THE MODERATOR: Yes, after you.  
COACH MARTELLI: Why would he want me up here with him?  
THE MODERATOR: We're expecting more media for that event, too.  
COACH MARTELLI: No kidding. So am I.  
Let me give you a 4‑year‑old's day today. He did a phone interview with a
Philadelphia radio station today. He was featured on the CBS the morning show
segment. He got buckled into his car seat and went to preschool with the other
4‑year‑olds, and the 4‑year‑olds welcomed him back like, let's play, and the
parents lined up to get their picture taken with him.  
He's on a plane. We got here by minivan. He took a private plane to Buffalo.
He has an appearance tomorrow morning on a Buffalo television station.  
The part about mimicking, I didn't know. I really didn't know because in the
arena he sits a little bit higher, and I wasn't quite aware that this was
going on during games. What would happen is we would play on a Tuesday night.
Maybe I would be home on Thursday night by chance, and I would say, I have a
game tonight. Then he would go through the same routine that I do to get ready
to coach this team.  
And then somebody said to me, You need to see the YouTube. And this was prior
to the selection show on Sunday, and I about lost it. I never saw anything
like it. It's not practiced. He told somebody the other day, they said, What
do you do when you coach?  
And he said, I stand up.  
And they said, Why?  
And he said, Because I'm the head coach, and Tug, that's what he calls me, Tug
never sits down.  
Now, how would a 4‑year‑old know that I've never sat down in 19 years as a
head coach? It blows my mind really.  
He went to Brooklyn last week, and he packed three suits. He said, How many
games are we going to play?  
I said, We could play three.  
He said, Okay, I'm going to take three.  
For this trip, he's packed two. And he'll be working out of a suite probably
at the Ritz‑Carlton by later tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Hard to follow that up, but we'll go in the back here. We've
got time for two more questions.  
  
Q. Phil, when you deal with your team at this time of year, do you try to be
business as usual, or do you try to emphasize like it's a special time?  
COACH MARTELLI: I was going to go into the Atlantic 10 tournament and treat it
as business as usual, and the coaches, in conversation with me, said, We know
there's an elephant in the room.  
And I would say, Well, what's the elephant?  
And they said, They're reading the bottom line, bubble this, bubble that. You
blew your chance by losing the last two games in the regular season.  
So I talked to them about it, and I told them, It's a basketball game. I don't
know what the result could be of a win or a loss. I know what you're reading,
you're normal basketball people, but just we have to stay in this group, in
this locker room, and play the best that we can play on Friday.  
For this tournament, I used the earlier line about euphoria. I just want you
to know from experience. It's one thing to be here. It's another thing to be
here Saturday morning.  
So everything else, though, is business as usual. The same practice length,
the same amount of film, the same amount of rest. And I've asked them to be
very, very careful from Tuesday on about answering all the social media and
all the congratulatory and worrying about tickets.  
I pulled up the Super Bowl, I said, Look, the Super Bowl teams, they're done
with that stuff. You can't be taking calls on Wednesday night at midnight
about your girlfriend's friend didn't get a ticket to the game. There's
nothing you can do. All you can do is go play and win that game.  
  
Q. By Geno's standards, wise guy standards, he was kind of mild the other
day, saying if he had spoken to you before tomorrow night, he would tell you
guard Shabazz and also don't forget the tall German kid. But he also got a
little bit serious, and he said in '95, the first time they won, you were the
first one there, in 2000 in Philadelphia, as well. How proud are you of him
and the role you've played in helping him develop as a head coach?  
COACH MARTELLI: Well, I had nothing to do with it. He had a gift. He's always
had a people gift. And the perfect storm occurred, I believe. I think that Lou
Perkins and the people at Connecticut said, we want to be the best in women's
basketball, and they took every obstacle, and they said, We're going to move
it and go do it the right way.  
Now it's, you know, 900 wins. The best want to be associated with the best.  
Why does Taurasi end up there and this kid Stewart end up there? Because the
best want to be with the best. He's the best women's basketball coach of all
time. But he did that. I don't have anything to do with that, nor have I ever
thought that I did. Thank you very much.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Ohio State student‑athletes. Next to me is
Aaron Craft. Next to him is Lenzelle Smith,Jr. Welcome to Buffalo.  
We'll open it up for questions at this point.  
  
Q. Aaron, can you talk about what you gained in terms of maturity and growth
in playing the entire four years at Ohio State. What do you think it means to
be a senior in this tournament?  
AARON CRAFT: I think it helps a lot, just knowing what the routine is, being
able to know when you have to concentrate and get things done. Lenzelle and I
have been here for four years now. Just because we've had a little bit of
success before doesn't necessarily mean we'll have success now, but I think it
helps us prepare ourselves mentally for what the NCAA Tournament means and
what it's about.  
It's very easy to get caught up in everything that's different with the media
going on right now and open practice and things like that, but I think we've
gone through it enough that we know and can help lead our team to be ready to
play come tomorrow.  
LENZELLE SMITH, JR.: Can you repeat the question?  
  
Q. Just talk about what you gained by playing the entire four years in
college and staying the fourth year and the experience and what that means now
to you.  
LENZELLE SMITH, JR.: I think it's just helped me grow as a player, matured a
lot. I've seen everything. I've been in a lot of situations. I've been on both
sides of the spectrum from winning tough games to losing tough games. I just
think it helps me mentally prepare better and know what to expect, especially
when you get into the tournament.  
Obviously, each game means a lot more. It's different situations, and the name
of the game is being prepared and knowing how to make changes. I think the
experience of that will help us a lot in the tournament.  
  
Q. For Aaron, I didn't hear the context in which you said it after the game
against Michigan, but you said something about this team playing better when
its back is against the wall. I wanted to ask you about why you think that is
and maybe in what context were you talking about that last week, if you can
remember.  
AARON CRAFT: Context is pretty easy. The last two games we played in the Big
Ten Tournament, we got ourselves down by double figures in both games, and we
found a way to fight back. So I don't know. We just start playing with a sense
of urgency, and that changes the way we play. We're not playing perfect, but I
think we're playing harder and we know possessions mean a little more.  
  
Q. Aaron or Lenzelle, just the talk of this big brother/little brother
rivalry and, you know, the talk of this being the battle of Ohio. How much
does that resonate with you guys being the big dog in state?  
AARON CRAFT: I mean, we haven't heard anything about big brother/little
brother. Right now, everyone's even. It doesn't matter what league you play
in, how well you did in that league. Right now it's about finding a way to win
tomorrow.  
Dayton is a great team that's won and played against great competition all
year, just like we have. Just because we're Ohio State and they're Dayton
doesn't mean anything to us. It comes down to being a basketball game. If you
don't execute and play great basketball, you're going to go home. It doesn't
matter where you're from.  
LENZELLE SMITH, JR.: I agree.  
  
Q. And to Lenzelle, what about facing a former coach and a former player in
Sibert?  
LENZELLE SMITH, JR.: With both of them, just over the years the relationship
that I was able to build with them, I still have it. I mean, I don't talk to
them as much, but those guys are still family in my eyes.  
Off the court, we'll show love, but on the court, I've got a job to do, and
I'm going to do whatever I can for my team to help us get the win.  
  
Q. Aaron, back to the question that Bob asked you about playing with your
backs to the wall, have you guys talked about the sort of danger that that
kind of mentality has, especially in this situation when it's one and you go
home?  
AARON CRAFT: We haven't talked about it explicitly, but I think one of our
biggest focuses coming into this tournament is valuing every possession. Since
Lenzelle and I have been in college, the margin of defeat for us in the NCAA
Tournament has been very, very little, and it comes down to one or two
possessions a game. Understanding that that one or two possessions doesn't
necessarily mean the last two in the game, it could be the first two in the
game. Those are things that we're trying to focus on and hone in on because
those are the little things that add up to big things by the end of the game.  
  
Q. For Lenzelle and Aaron, can you guys sort of explain your philosophy on
how you guys defend the inbounds pass along the baseline? I guess, how much
time do you work on that during the off ‑season, during the regular season,
and how much is it a part of what you guys do?   
THE MODERATOR: Go ahead, Lenzelle. Why don't you start.  
LENZELLE SMITH, JR.: You say how we defend the pass along the baseline? Well,
for our defense, we match up pretty well. We got the guards on the outside to
take care of the wings, if need be. Our bigs, obviously, on the inside to
protect for lobs.  
We can switch it up. Sometimes we trap in the corners. Sometimes we don't. I
think, with our type of defense, you know, we got guys that can pressure the
ball. We usually have a big that's on the ball, and we pretty well match up
after that. We can switch.  
We have to have great communication to talk to each other to know what
position we need to be in, and it just goes from there. The tougher it is for
them to get the ball in, the easier it is for us to guard.  
AARON CRAFT: We just kind of throw it up and kind of do whatever we need to
do. We don't talk about it a ton. We just kind of go out there and have guys
run around, and hopefully, we're talking, communicating well enough to keep
them from getting an easy bucket.  
  
Q. Just what do you guys see from Jordan this year for Dayton? What do you
see as his strengths? What is he doing well? What is the challenge he presents
to you?  
AARON CRAFT: Obviously, he's done a phenomenal job of scoring the basketball.
He's one of their leading scorers on the team. The way he's shooting the ball,
he's done a good job of not being one dimensional. Obviously, he can shoot it
and put it in from the three‑point line, but he can pull up and get to the rim
when he needs to, too, and that always makes it difficult.  
We've seen him in the spring and the summer, and we've been through the
battles with him. So it's not a huge surprise to us to see him being so
successful.  
  
Q. Aaron, what does it mean to have the amount of tournament ‑tested
experience that you and Lenzelle have? Is it significant? And how important
might that be that you've been here before?   
AARON CRAFT: I think the biggest thing it helps us with is the mindset you go
into games with. Dealing with everything that's different from a normal game
to a game in the NCAA Tournament, from media to open locker rooms to open
practices. You know, those things that are just different from the regular
season.  
The experience isn't going to put the ball in the basket for us this year.
It's also a balance of understanding it's a new year and it's a new team, and
it's a new experience that you've got to try to make the most of.  
  
Q. Just they've been very hot from three ‑point range. If it becomes a
scoring game, your defense is so good, but if the game just turns into a
scoring game at any point in this tournament, do you guys feel comfortable,
feel confident you've got enough to stay with teams that are hot?   
LENZELLE SMITH, JR.: I mean, I think so. Specifically for this game, I don't
think they've seen anybody that's guarded as well as we do. So if it turns
into a scoring game, they have to face a defense that they've never seen.  
As for us, I think, you know, just as well as any game, we've obviously got to
find a way to put the ball in the bucket. I'm confident in our team. We have
multiple weapons. You never know who's going to show up each game.  
You've got guys that can break out at any point, and I think that's going to
be big for us in the tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, good luck. Good luck in Buffalo.  
We are joined now by Thad Matta, head coach at Ohio State.  
Welcome to Buffalo, Coach. We'll go ahead and have you maybe start with an
opening statement and then take questions unless you just like to take
questions.  
COACH MATTA: We'll go with questions.  
THE MODERATOR: Very good. We'll start in the back.  
  
Q. Thad, I was just wondering what your reaction was when you saw Archie was
opposite you?  
COACH MATTA: You know, it's funny. The first thing, I was elated for Archie.
I've known Archie ever since he was in seventh grade, I think, when Sean and I
were at Miami. To see him take his team and get them into the NCAA Tournament,
I couldn't be happier.  
Now, the fact that we're playing each other, I think that's kind of the irony
of coaching. But as I've said I think the longer you do this, A, you work with
a lot of different people, and then, B, paths are going to cross. I wish we
weren't playing, but it is who we're playing, and we've got to be ready to go.  
  
Q. What enables your guys to do what they do in defending the baseline
inbounds pass? I mean, is it a combination of the players you have? The scheme
you run? Just sort of how does that all work together?  
COACH MATTA: You know, I'm not sure. It just sort of happens. There's a little
bit of a method to it. I think the bottom line is something we take great
pride in. I don't think it's anything out of the ordinary. We spend a lot of
time preparing for it in terms of practice time. Like I said, it's something
that the teams we've coached here, we've tried to sort of hang our hat on that
if at all possible.  
  
Q. Thad, Archie called you a good guy, and then he said, but you know when
you work for Thad, you know how it is. He'll walk around with a smile on his
face, but he's going to try to stomp your head in the first chance he gets.
How difficult might it be to do that facing Archie? And I ask that politely.  
COACH MATTA: No, no question. I appreciate the compliment from Archie.  
I think this: For you guys, it probably means a lot more in terms that he and
I worked together and we've known each other for 20‑plus years. And not
speaking for Archie. I honestly won't even know he's down there. It's the
game. It's what's going on there.  
Before the game, you shake hands. After the game, you shake hands. But in
between there, I don't know what he's doing or anything like that.  
So it's not so much a personal, between he and I. It's more of the guys on the
floor, and that's how I've always viewed it.  
  
Q. And just as a followup, is it too much to overstate this whole talk of
big brother/little brother, the battle of Ohio?  
COACH MATTA: I think it is. From my perspective, because you're in the NCAA
Tournament, I think people want to put tags on situations. But for us, and for
Dayton, you win or you go home. There's not a whole lot more than that.  
I'll swear to you, when the game starts, I don't know what's across the
opposing team's jersey. It's more of how do I get my guys to play their best
basketball? I've always been that way. I mean, I'm not going to be thinking,
Gosh, this is Dayton. We're Ohio State. You're just more focused in on what do
we have to do to achieve our goal.  
  
Q. Do you have any feeling that maybe playing some of these schools such as
Xavier or Dayton or Cincinnati would be a better preparation for Big Ten play,
not that the schedule you did play?  
COACH MATTA: No. You know from the perspective of what we've just been
through, playing 21 straight Big Ten basketball games, there's rivalries.
There's national televised games. We've gotten guys that our opponents are
recruiting. They've gotten guys that we were recruiting. There's so many side
notes that goes into 21 straight games that from the perspective, I think our
guys are able to put that behind.  
I think in terms of nonconference scheduling, as a coach, you can't win. I
mean, you play one team, and people complain about it. Then you play this
team, and then they complain that you don't play this team. To us, we've got a
heck of a method in terms of what we try to do in regards to our schedule, and
I like what it is.  
I like to get out of the Midwest and play some teams. That was one of the
things that I was opposed to in terms of the Big Ten going to 18 games because
that took away our opportunities to schedule a Big East team, an ACC team, an
SEC team. You pick up two games, and it happens to be Wisconsin and Michigan
State. That's what the 18 games had for you.  
  
Q. Coach, can you speak the advantage of having seniors on your team and
important roles in the tournament. And also, to the benefit that those players
get from playing their third and fourth year in college.  
COACH MATTA: I've always said this. I can't create a drill in practice to give
guys experience. You have to go through the rigors of a college basketball
season. The fact that you got guys in Aaron and Lenzelle that have been
through now four years, you look at what they've done in terms of last
Saturday was their 12th Big Ten Tournament game. They've been to the Sweet 16.
They've been to the Final Four. They've been to the Elite Eight, and here they
are now coming in.  
This stuff, sitting up here, may be new to some guys. For those guys, they get
it. They understand the preparation. They understand the importance of being
ready to go. You know, when you have those type of guys, it does make a big
difference.  
  
Q. There was no school that did not play instate anymore rigorously than
Kentucky, which plays Louisville, and it's a basketball school doing it. Do
you think it would not benefit your program to do that? Although fans would
like to see it.  
COACH MATTA: I think in Kentucky it's mandated by the state, right?  
  
Q. I think it is now.  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, I mean, that would be his choice, I guess, or it may not be
his choice, you know what I'm saying, if it is mandated by the state.  
I don't know. I think that people don't understand, in terms of what goes on
in a college basketball season, in terms of the off‑season, all the things
that you're trying to do, just the length of it.  
Our schedule, in terms of what I would like to do with it, and the Big Ten‑ACC
challenge, those types of things, it's just, in our minds, not as conducive. I
think we've played probably close to 15 Ohio schools in my ten years at Ohio
State, and I think I'm the first guy that's done that. I don't think anybody
else did that very often.  
  
Q. You're a former A ‑10 guy. Does it surprise you that this league got six
bids? Could you have ever seen a day like this when you were with Xavier?   
COACH MATTA: Yeah, I could because I think my last year at Xavier, we and
Saint Joe's, I think, were in the Elite Eight, playing to go to the Final
Four. It's been a long time ago, ten years, and in coaching dog years, that's
like 40.  
But I think it's been a great league throughout. I know they've had some
departures. I'm trying to think. Temple's out. Butler had a cup of coffee in
there. Charlotte's now out. But it doesn't surprise me.  
I think from the standpoint of you look at basketball, especially in this
region, there's great basketball in the region of where the A‑10 is located.  
  
Q. Thad, just a question about what you see out of Jordan and how he's
playing for Dayton and what may have changed or what he might be doing well
for that team.  
COACH MATTA: It looks like he's playing at a very, very high level. I think
the biggest thing with Jordan is he's getting the opportunity that he wanted.
Not saying it wouldn't have happened at Ohio State, but he wanted minutes. He
wanted that sort of thing.  
So I'm excited for him. I think it's such a hard profession, and I always root
for the guys that I know or have a relationship with, and I'm happy for him.
He's doing a heck of a job for them.  
  
Q. Just to follow up and talk about the seniors, specifically. What do they
get out of it, the experience of those things, the third and fourth year?
Besides the experience of playing the NCAA, just life experience?  
COACH MATTA: Well, I think this: All the early departures we've had, all the
guys have come back and said, Hey, the NBA is great, but, man, I miss college.  
I remember Jared Sullinger telling me last year, Probably the thing I miss the
most is just going to class and being around college kids.  
They say you can always go back and get your degree, but in essence, you
really can't go back to college.  
I think for those guys, just the daily grind, learning to budget your money,
learning to make sure you get training meal so you don't have to pay for your
food and those kinds of things, and just the value of education. That's
something where Aaron and Lenzelle are going to graduate here in a month, and
that's a tremendous feat in itself.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks for your time. Best of luck.

BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined now by student‑athletes from Western Michigan
University. David Brown and Shayne Whittington joining us.  
With that, we'll get started with questions for either Shayne or David.  
  
Q. David, there's been some talk of this being an upset. Few people seem to
like your chances against Syracuse. Clark Kellogg has been active a few times
on Twitter saying he wouldn't want to face you in the NCAA Tournament. Can you
talk about your chances for an upset.  
DAVID BROWN: I like it. We have confidence in ourselves. Syracuse is a great
ball club. We're not going in thinking we're going to win easily. They're a
top‑25 team in the nation coached by an amazing coach. We've got to stick
together as a family and play our best brand of basketball that we can
possibly play.  
  
Q. Shayne, teams in the past that have tried to beat Syracuse have tried to
do it with a three ball. I'm wondering how much are you guys going to try to
get it into the post, and how important will it be for you to get it inside
there?  
SHAYNE WHITTINGTON: Our game plan against Eastern Michigan, who runs a similar
zone as Syracuse does, we try to put the ball inside. It doesn't matter
whether or not the big has it or the guards try to penetrate and dish. I think
we'll have a similar game plan to that.  
We don't quite know yet. I mean, we do have an idea. But we'll talk to our
coaches later on today and see what they really want.  
  
Q. This is a heck of a place to have to play Syracuse as well. I realize
it's close enough for you guys to get here as well, but can you talk about the
associated challenges with that.  
SHAYNE WHITTINGTON: We were told it's going to be a road game. From what I've
heard, the venue sold out really quick. I'm not sure how far away it is from
Syracuse's campus, but I know it's not too far.  
We have huge fans that travel, but I know it's going to be very orange in the
arena when we play on Thursday.  
  
Q. Is this the sort of team that you guys relish that opportunity? You've
been to Buffalo this year, but it will be a little different.  
SHAYNE WHITTINGTON: It will be a little different. I think we play a little
bit better when we know there's a little more adversity. We like that kind of
environment. We thrive on that. So it will be fun.  
  
Q. David, you've overcome a couple of knee injuries in your career. At what
point did you start to feel like you were completely back? Was it this year or
the year before?  
DAVID BROWN: I would probably say the start of this year, the summertime when
I was told I didn't have to play with my brace anymore. I felt I'm back to
normal. Then just getting out there and playing some open gyms and doing some
stuff without it, without the brace, it made me think that I'm possibly back
to normal.  
It feels good to be back and playing the game that I love. It's even better
being able to play in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Follow ‑up real quick. What did it feel like when you were finally able
to play without the brace?   
DAVID BROWN: It was a blessing. It just felt like God gave me a second chance.
You know, it's something that many people can't come back from, and many
people are playing with their brace now. So having that chance to play without
the brace and the doctors having faith in me and my coaches having faith in
me, playing without the brace, it was truly a blessing and something that's
touched me deep in my heart because many people can't really come back from
two knee injuries like that.  
  
Q. Shayne, could you describe a little bit your style of play. David, could
you maybe augment that with the description of Shayne's style of play.  
SHAYNE WHITTINGTON: Well, I guess I developed over the five years that I've
been here. My style of play coming in as a freshman was a little bit of an
outside kind of presence because I wasn't really thick enough or strong enough
to bang in there with the post players. So I had to develop my outside game a
little bit when I was younger. That kind of helped me out throughout this
year.  
When I redshirted, I gained a little bit of muscle, and I was actually able to
play in the post, and I've started to develop my post‑game as well. So I'd
like to say that I am an inside‑out big. I can go inside. I can go outside. I
can play in the post if I need to, and I can hit a few 15‑footers if I need to
as well.  
DAVID BROWN: I think Shayne, I've been saying this all year long, is probably
in my mind one of the top big men in the nation. Many people don't give us
credit for being such a small school, mid‑major school, we don't get as much
attention as the high major schools. I think Shayne's up there with the top
big men in the nation. I think he can play with any big man.  
He has confidence in himself, and we have confidence in him. So he just needs
to bring the confidence in himself to play with anybody because I think he's
one of the most talented big men in the nation.  
  
Q. Both of you redshirted for different reasons in your career. Would you
say that redshirting has helped make you guys the players that you are this
year?  
DAVID BROWN: Yeah, a little bit. It gave me a chance to actually sit back and
learn the system and see how other players play, and it actually helped me get
stronger. I understand the game of basketball a lot clearer than I have
before.  
When I first came here, I didn't really understand D‑I basketball and how
quick the game was and how you had to play a certain way. When I redshirted, I
sat back and was able to watch everything and how everything operates. So I
would say, yeah, redshirting helps a lot.  
SHAYNE WHITTINGTON: I'd have to agree. Redshirting was probably one of the
best decisions I've made in my career. It allowed me to put mass on. It
allowed me to acclimate myself to the game and the speed. But honestly, I
think it made me into the player I am today, being able to sit back.  
The transfers that we had, Matt Stainbrook, Flenard Whitfield, and guys that
were really good in our program. I got to play with them every day. It just
kind of made me better, being able to do that every day made me better.  
  
Q. Shayne, you and David came into the program together. As he's going
through the injuries and the rehab, what was it like for you to watch him go
through all that, and then over the course of the last year, to see him go
through 11 points per game a year ago to your leading scorer this year?  
SHAYNE WHITTINGTON: I've said this a million times. It's really amazing to be
able to watch your best friend go from being down in the dumps‑‑ I'm not
saying he's down in the dumps, but down in the dumps with his knee injuries
and being one of our best and the MVP of our conference tournament a few years
later. It's an amazing feeling watching your best friend grow like that.  
  
Q. Shayne, could you talk about your development really from your sophomore
year to this year because, obviously, with the playing time last year, you had
a great year, and you took it up a notch. The next thing, you were talking
about the transfers. Obviously, the big fella left for Xavier. Darius Paul
left for Illinois. Talk about what Connar has meant to this club too.  
SHAYNE WHITTINGTON: I have said this before. Transfers really allowed me to
thrive. Coaches had faith in me and confidence in me to be the player that I
had developed into, but Connar Tava makes everything on the court better. He's
our leading assist man. You get the ball in his hands, and he'll make magic
happen. Connar has been one of the biggest reasons why we've been successful
this year.  
From a year ago, I don't know what he scored and what he assisted, but he
didn't really get that much time because of Darius. Darius is a great player,
but Connar makes things happen unlike Darius could at that time.  
So Connar's development and Connar's success this year has really helped us
propel into the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Could you also talk about playing for Hawk, and how he's helped your
development. Same thing, David.  
SHAYNE WHITTINGTON: Coach Hawk really preaches on‑the‑court stuff and
off‑the‑court stuff. He wants you to develop as a player and as a man. So
being able to be in his program for five years, I'm really kind of squeezing
everything, soaking up everything that he has to offer. It's developed me as a
player and as a man.  
So Coach Hawk has really helped me out developing as a player and a man.  
DAVID BROWN: I'd have to agree. He bases our program off of Coach Wooden, and
we all know how great of a coach Coach Wooden was. He takes a lot of things
from Coach Wooden, and he incorporates it into his coaching style, and it
works with us.  
We buy into what he has to say. We understand that he knows how to win because
he has been to the NCAA Tournament before, and he knows how to put good
coaches around you. With Coach Farmer, Coach Bates, and Coach Holland, they're
terrific coaches. He understands what it takes to win, and he knows what he
wants out of his players and his staff.  
  
Q. Shayne, if you look at some of the stats from Syracuse and their losses,
you notice that they get outscored in the paint. How important is it to have
an inside presence early in the game tomorrow?  
SHAYNE WHITTINGTON: I think in any game it's important to develop your inside
game. We pride ourselves on our inside‑out game, getting the ball in the
paint, regardless of whether it's big or guard driving the paint. So
developing that and getting their mind on that early, maybe it will help them
sink in a little bit so we can have a few three‑pointers.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, best of luck tomorrow. We'll be back out here momentarily
with Coach Hawk.  
We're joined now by head coach Steve Hawkins, Western Michigan University.
Coach, welcome to Buffalo. You're not a stranger here. Glad to have you here
to face Syracuse tomorrow.  
With that being said, Coach, why don't you make an opening statement for us.  
COACH HAWKINS: Sure. First of all, good to be here. We obviously have our
hands full tomorrow. It's a very, very good Syracuse team that spent the
majority of the year ranked number one in the nation and have some tremendous
players and a hall of fame coach, and then we get them in Buffalo.  
So there are unique challenges that will go with that in the atmosphere of a
road game as well, but we're excited about it. We're excited to be here and
looking forward to the challenge.  
THE MODERATOR: With that, we'll open it up for questions.  
  
Q. Hawk, can you talk about being back to the NCAA Tournament? You made it
in your first year. You probably thought, Oh, this is pretty easy. And now
here you are ten years later. How gratifying is it to get back?  
COACH HAWKINS: The easy part, no, that never went through my mind. As a
Division II coach for nine years before that, you have an appreciation for
getting to postseason play no matter what it is.  
But the NCAA Tournament was a blast the first year. It's taken us ten years to
get back, but we've played in every other tournament in between. A couple of
times in the CIT and CBI, Final Four last year, and the NIT. So we've been in
postseason play, but it's great to be back in this atmosphere.  
Obviously, everybody has the NCAA Tournament on their mind this time of year.
It's great to be back here. Postseason play hasn't been foreign to us, and in
a league like ours, it's very important that we recognize some of those other
tournaments because we have some teams playing in those. I don't think we
would be here today had it not been for being able to play last year in some
postseason play.  
  
Q. I notice that, when Syracuse has been beat, especially this month, if you
look at their stat sheet, they get outscored in the paint. How important is
it, number one, to have a guy like Whittington? And talk about what Connar has
meant to your team, especially since Darius transferred.  
COACH HAWKINS: The points in the paint can be misleading. One thing we've
noticed on their little bit of a slide, they've turned the ball over a little
bit more, or when they've missed shots, there's been a lot of long rebounds.  
I mean, Cooney hasn't shot the ball as well as of late. If you're going to
miss a three‑point shot, generally speaking, a long shot produces a long
rebound, and that has triggered some of these other teams' fast breaks, and
that ends up being points in the paint. Not necessarily, Hey, we're going to
grind it out against the two‑three zone and throw the ball inside and see how
this goes. It would be very difficult for us to play that kind of game with
the size difference that they have against us.  
Connar Tava is our point forward. He's kind of been our ace in the hole. He
can rebound the ball. He brings it up himself. He led the team in assists from
the forward spot. He's incredibly intelligent player, high basketball IQ, sees
the floor well, understands the game plan. So he's been tremendous for us.  
As a matter of fact, the one game we've lost in this stretch at Toledo was in
overtime, and Connar only played 14 minutes in that game due to foul trouble.
If we'd have had him the whole time, I'm not saying we'd have won the game,
but I would have liked our chances a little bit better.  
  
Q. Coach, do you think the MAC's gotten the right level of respect this
year? You guys and maybe a team like Toledo too, the 36 RPI and a sixth seed
in the NIT?  
COACH HAWKINS: No, I don't. Normally speaking, I wouldn't talk about something
like that because everybody does a terrific job. I mean, there's committees
and everything else that they're there to do these kinds of things.  
The one thing I was a little bit surprised about was the MAC's RPI this year
has been higher than in past years. I've understood a lower seed in some other
years. This year, with the conference RPI being 12, I thought that Toledo, in
particular, deserved more credit than what they were receiving all year long.  
Their RPI was very high all year long. They played a good nonconference
schedule. They ended up winning whatever it was, 26, 27 games, and they were
never mentioned in terms of a potential at‑large team all the way through the
year, and I never really understood that.  
Then to get the seed they got in the NIT, I was discouraged by that. Happy
with the number of teams that got in total postseason play, but a little
discouraged with the seeding that went on there.  
In terms of our seed, 13, 14, we knew we were going to be a little bit lower
because of our nonconference RPI. This thing is all about matchups. You can
get a 12 seed or an 11 seed and play against a team that would be a worst
matchup for you than some of the teams that are getting a 13, 14, 15 seed that
may be a better matchup for you.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about the point guard matchup in this game and
who's going to be defending who?  
COACH HAWKINS: We do so much switching, there will be different players on
Tyler Ennis. He's a tremendous player, obviously. Their guards are a handful.
Austin Richie will start out on him, but our transition defense is set up in a
way where, when a shot goes up, David Brown could very easily end up taking
him as he brings the ball up the floor. Then we'll get back to switching at
the first opportunity we can.  
But there will be several people on him, and then the matchup for them to us
doesn't really matter because they're in a zone. It's not like one certain
player from Syracuse is going to be guarding Austin or Jared.  
  
Q. You guys are 26 in the nation at limiting opponents' three ‑pointers.
What allows you to be so successful at that?   
COACH HAWKINS: I didn't know that. You know, I think our guards do a pretty
good job of applying some pressure. Our whole idea of defense doesn't have
anything to do with steals and turnovers. We're always ranked towards the
bottom of our league, if not dead last in our league, when it comes to
creating turnovers.  
We try and protect the paint and make teams beat us over the top and hopefully
take check threes. We try and be there on the catch. That's been our
philosophy ever since I've gotten to Western.  
So it would probably be the answer is in there somewhere.  
  
Q. You already said that your game plan, obviously, nor has anybody pounded
inside against Syracuse. Do you have enough firepower on the perimeter? And
can you talk about Tucker's game of late?  
COACH HAWKINS: Well, we'll find out tomorrow afternoon in terms of your first
question, whether or not we have enough firepower. I know the guys are capable
of it. If Tucker shoots the ball the way he shot it in Cleveland, that
certainly helps.  
Austin Richie and David Brown and Jared Klein are all capable shooters. The
difference for them in this game, though, is the length of Syracuse. You know,
when we look back at last year, I mean, Indiana had the firepower, too, but
shooting over that length is a whole different situation. They're not going to
allow you to just play horse out there. That's what makes it difficult.  
Tucker's game has been developing all year long. He's a very confident kid,
confident player, and he loves the big stage.  
  
Q. Coach, I'd just like to get some thoughts on your origins as a coach. You
worked at UCLA for a while? Is?  
COACH HAWKINS: No. I worked for Coach Wooden at his camps. That's probably
what you're referring to. It was called the head counselor, which is kind of
an assistant director of his basketball camps. We have a pretty heavy UCLA
influence and Coach Wooden influence on our staff between myself and the years
that I was able to do that.  
You may have heard about the stories. I've been doing a lot of interviews.
Part of my job was to pick up Coach in the morning and take him home in the
afternoon. So spent a lot of time with Coach Wooden.  
And then Larry Farmer is one of my assistant coaches, who played for Coach
Wooden. Winningest college player in the history of the game, went 89‑1, and
former head coach at UCLA himself.  
  
Q. What influence did he have on you in your coaching and on your life?  
COACH HAWKINS: Immeasurable. Coach Wooden was my mentor. Our whole philosophy
of our program is based on his definition of success. We have taken heavily
from him.  
In my early years coaching at the Division II school at Quincy University, I
used to talk to Coach all the time about not so much Xs and Os, but more about
player management, situations like this, how to handle big stages, whatever it
is. I've relied very heavy on Coach's words, and it keeps you grounded.  
The biggest influence he's had on me is it keeps you very, very grounded in
terms of what it is that we do. I really consider myself an educator first.
That comes from Coach Wooden. This is all fun, and the NCAA Tournament and
everything we're going to go through tomorrow, and everything's all about win,
win, win, win, win. Coach didn't feel that way, and that has had a huge
influence on me.  
It's all about giving your best. I could go on and on about the things that
Coach has meant to me, but it keeps me grounded, realizing no matter what
happens here, I've still got to take out the trash on Thursday night.  
  
Q. Steve, could you talk about what it was like for you and what it meant to
you to watch David Brown come back from the two knee injuries and get to the
point where this year he's your leading scorer.  
COACH HAWKINS: It's a great question. It wasn't a situation where in the
middle of it we were thinking, Gosh, I hope he can make it, I hope he can make
it, because we were convinced he was not going to make it.  
On top of the ACLs, he actually missed the great part of his sophomore year
with an ankle injury. If you take X‑rays of his ankle, the ankle looks like a
road map. It's awful. So we thought it was going to be the ankle.  
As a matter of fact, when he tore his ACL, we thought he went down with
another ankle injury. We found out later on it was the ACL.  
So the time away from basketball meant a lot to David because he was in a
situation where the first couple of years, he was a challenge to coach. I
tried to get him involved in the system, and he wanted to get out and gamble.
There was an earlier question about defense. He wanted to get out and gamble
and get a lot of steals. He'd miss, and now they'd be playing five‑on‑four.
And we're trying, David, that's not the way we do it. When he was forced to
sit out, he had a chance to sit and watch not only our system come into play,
but also probably reflect on how much he missed the game.  
So when he came back last year, he missed the entire nonconference portion of
the schedule. His first game was our first conference game last year, and then
he went on to become sixth man of the year.  
What I noticed right away, he took the floor with a smile on his face. He was
able to play basketball for the last year and a half with a smile on his face.
You know, he realizes that this is a privilege, it's not a right. I think he
had a real appreciation for college basketball. It's been an inspiration to
all of us, though, to see that and for him to bring that.  
He'll say it every once in a while to the guys. Guys, there's nothing
guaranteed here. We're fortunate to be able to practice today. Let's make a
good one of it.  
  
Q. Hawk, how helpful is it to have played Eastern Michigan twice? How
similar is the zone that Murphy uses to the one you'll see tomorrow?  
COACH HAWKINS: The zone is very similar. You know, we hope it's a help, but
the zone is very similar. The players are different. Now, Murph has done a
terrific job of bringing in‑‑ very similar to coach Boeheim. He recruits to
that defense, recruits to that zone. They actually at times could be as big as
Syracuse.  
The defensive player of the year in our league was Da'Shonte Riley, a transfer
from Syracuse. And then on one wing, a transfer from Arkansas. So they could
be very long. The difference with Syracuse is, when Eastern Michigan went to
the bench, they're bringing in a 6'5" guy. When Syracuse goes to the bench,
they bring in a 6'7" guy, then they'll bring in a 6'10" guy, then they'll
bring in a guy that's 8‑foot tall.  
It seems like it's a never ending. It's just an onslaught of size and length
and length and length and more length.  
Some of the spots you try to get to in the zone are similar, though.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned it briefly in your opening, the challenge of playing
Syracuse here in Buffalo. Are you preparing your team like this is going to be
a true road game?  
COACH HAWKINS: We have. I don't know about prepare. We've certainly talked
about it. I don't know how you could prepare them for it, but we've talked
about it. I mean, Syracuse, it's nationwide. Everybody knows about the Carrier
Dome. You can watch it on TV. You certainly understand what their fan base is
all about and then how well they travel. Basically, this will be a road game.  
I'm certainly concerned about that and how our guys are going to handle that.
I'm probably more concerned about the NCAA Tournament atmosphere than I am
that. We have played fairly well on the road. Our kids are pretty tough and
the mindset is pretty tough. What's at stake in the NCAA Tournament and
everything that's involved there, all of this, is what I'm more concerned
about.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks for your time. Best of luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 19, 2014

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [C.J. Fair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23639)

### [Baye Moussa Keita](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25953)

  
_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Syracuse student‑athletes. Closest to me, C.J.
Fair. Baye Moussa Keita is on the far end there. Welcome to Buffalo, guys.  
  
Q. C.J., what is the greatest benefit that you got from playing your entire
four years at Syracuse? Staying there the fourth year, what's the biggest
benefit to your growth and development?  
C.J. FAIR: I would say maturity. Coming in as a freshman, you don't really
know what to expect in college, and then sometimes it can be a rude awakening
for some players. For me, I wasn't playing that much, and then as time went
on, I had to grow up and adjust, and I think it made me mature in a fast way.  
  
Q. C.J., a lot of times when you face an opponent in the NCAA Tournament,
they're not that familiar with the zone. Western Michigan played against
Eastern Michigan, who obviously runs a similar zone to you guys. Does that
kind of take away some of the advantage that you guys normally have coming
into the NCAA Tournament, their added familiarity?  
C.J. FAIR: I don't think so. I believe probably everyone in this tournament
probably played against a team that ran the zone at some point.  
Eastern Michigan, they run the same style of zone we play, but I don't think
it gives us an advantage or a disadvantage really.  
  
Q. The thing about Boeheim, you'd think he never watches film, just rolls
out the balls. He really simplifies the sport. What can you tell me about the
real genius of Jim Boeheim that sort of gets underestimated?  
C.J. FAIR: I think what's underestimated is Coach Boeheim, I mean, he loves to
win. He does whatever it takes to win. So he don't really have favorites as
far as players. It's whoever can help him get the win, that's who he's going
to play.  
BAYE MOUSSA KEITA: Like C.J. said, he really doesn't have a favorite player.
He just wants to go out there and see who can help him win the games. He
doesn't really have a favorite. This is my favorite player or not.  
He's going to give it to you because he knows you can get better as a player.
Sometimes he's going to get on the bad side of you, but he just wants you to
get better. I think that he's not playing favorites or nothing. He's just
going to want to coach you, and for you to get better.  
  
Q. This question is for either one of you guys. If you could describe the
difference getting to the Final Four last year with Michael Carter ‑Williams
and then having Tyler be the point guard this year, how are those two players
similar? How are they different? Can you just kind of compare the way you guys
play with each one.   
BAYE MOUSSA KEITA: Mike was a different point guard. He was a lanky point
guard. He was 6'5", right, as a point guard, and he was a second year
sophomore point guard. He didn't play a lot his freshman year, but he got
experience from Scoop and the other guys kind of taught him what to do. Tyler
is a freshman, so it's a little bit hard for him.  
But I think as a player, they both have a plus and a minus, which is really
different. Mike was able to get a lot of steals, Tyler too, get a lot of
steals throughout the zone, and he's a really smart point guard, too, Tyler. I
think he's great. Every time he gets the ball, he knows exactly where he has
to go, which makes a big difference compared to the other point guards.  
C.J. FAIR: Yeah, I think they got two completely different styles of play.
Tyler, he plays at his own pace. He speeds up when he wants to, but normally,
he's at his own pace.  
And, Mike, I think the biggest difference, he's much more emotional on the
court. You can tell Mike's fire and drive, that he wants to win. And Tyler, I
know he wants to win as bad as anyone on the team, but he's just got a
different personality, I say.  
Both of them are great point guards. They both pass first and try to get the
team involved.  
  
Q. Baye, you guys have a little bit of an athletic advantage against them.
Is there a big emphasis on getting out in transition against this Western
Michigan team?  
BAYE MOUSSA KEITA: Coming into the game, we're just going to go ahead and play
our game. This is going to be a different team because, like I said, everybody
who plays in this tournament, they all have played a type of zone. If we can
get the ball, we're going to get it every single time. If we can't, we're just
going to hold the ball on offense. That's how we're playing, I think.  
  
Q. I just wanted to get what impressed you most about this first year in the
ACC, and what did you miss the most about the Big East?  
C.J. FAIR: You know, just you're hearing everyone, all the media saying how
you're going from physical Big East basketball to more up‑and‑down ACC
basketball. But I think the physicality of the ACC was underestimated, or
underrated, I should say. You got some teams that have similar styles, like
Virginia has a similar style to Pittsburgh. You play against Duke. They're
more up and down. It's just you get a taste of everything in the ACC, not just
one style.  
I say I would miss the most in the Big East, just the Big East Tournament,
just playing on the Garden. That's the one thing I really missed.  
BAYE MOUSSA KEITA: I would say the same thing as C.J. Everybody told us it's a
run and gun type of play. But we play different teams, and they have a
different style of play. You play Boston College, and they're going to make
you hold the ball and work the defense. If you play Duke, they're going to go
up and down.  
So I think it underestimated it. With the ACC, you have the opportunity to go
and see different places. But the one thing I would miss is the Big East
Tournament, the rivalry between us and different schools. We were just
watching the Georgetown game again, us and them, so it's just a big rivalry.
But now you have to make new rivalries starting this year.  
  
Q. C.J., what can you tell me about the experience of getting to the Final
Four last year that might help you guys and make another run.  
C.J. FAIR: Just getting to the Final Four last year, knowing how fun it was
and the great experience it was give you that much more motivation to try to
get back there again.  
We know what it takes to get there. It's not an easy road, but it's fun. So I
think us having that experience can help us in a way.  
  
Q. As a followup to that, what are the differences and similarities you see
between this year's team and last year's team?  
C.J. FAIR: It's hard. I'd say last year's team, we have more veterans on the
court at a time. This year, we have to regroup. We've got more freshmen and
sophomores playing minutes and players playing set roles, as opposed to last
year everyone knows their role and what position they're going to play.  
This year it's more of they've got to bounce around different positions. So I
would say that was the biggest difference.  
  
Q. Baye, you often say that you play like it's your last game every game.
Tomorrow it could be your last game. So what's your mindset going into
tomorrow?  
BAYE MOUSSA KEITA: Just like I said before, every game, we can play from one
game to six game, and our goal is to play all six. Like C.J. said, it's going
to be a tough road because every team you play is one of the best in their
division. Every team can beat you.  
So we're just going to go ahead and play like it's our last game. We went down
to Greenville, and it didn't end up the way we wanted. Now we're going to play
this tough because it could be our last basketball game in college. So we're
going to play the best we can, and just lead the guys because we're the
seniors and we have to lead them to victory.  
  
Q. C.J., when you see tape and stuff on Western, what style are they similar
to to a team that you might have played already this year, if any?  
C.J. FAIR: I mean, if I was to compare so far, I might say Boston College
because they've got guards that can shoot out from deep. Then they've got a
good inside presence with a couple of post players, so it keeps your defense
honest. You've got to respect the three‑point, and you've got to battle with
them inside. So I think that's like the biggest comparison I can think of off
the top.  
  
Q. C.J., could you answer that question about perhaps this being your last
game and what kind of thoughts are going on in your mind?  
C.J. FAIR: Yeah, it could be my last game, but, you know, as a team, we want
to prolong this season and not get it cut short. First game, hopefully, we win
tomorrow, get the first game under our belt, and that can get us going.  
THE MODERATOR: C.J., Baye, thanks very much for your time. Good luck tomorrow.
Be back shortly with CoachBoeheim.  
Joined by the head coach of Syracuse Orange, Jim Boeheim.  
  
Q. Jim, if you could compare getting to this point last year with Michael
Carter ‑Williams as your point guard and getting to this point with Tyler,
just how they run your sets, the differences between them as players, et
cetera.   
COACH BOEHEIM: They're different. Michael, you know, was certainly
explosiveness and size. His ability to get to the basket and score, finish. He
was a tremendous, tremendous player. He had a year of experience, so it was
his second year. I thought he had just a tremendous year, and he had a
tremendous tournament, as well.  
I think Tyler's had a great year. Certainly, going into the year with a new
point guard, a new two guard, freshman, sophomore. You know, looking at the
season, that would be a key to what we were going to be able to do.  
Those two guys have had great years in the backcourt, defensively and
offensively and really keyed the success that this team has had at this point.  
I think that was really the key for us this year, how well those guys played.
We knew the front line guys would be fine, and they had very good years. But
the guards have played very well for us.  
  
Q. Jim, does part of you as a competitor enjoy being underestimated a little
now and seen as a little bit of a wounded animal coming into this
tournament?  
COACH BOEHEIM: You know, I don't even see it that way, and I don't really pay
too much attention to that. Last year we lost five out of our last six games
and went into the tournament. The tournament's a different thing. You can
start playing well in one game, and all of a sudden, you can get on a roll.  
So I don't really look at it that way. I think we probably were overestimated
a little bit when we were 25‑0\.  
  
Q. Jim, how's Trevor's ankle been the past couple days?  
COACH BOEHEIM: He's practiced full speed both days.  
  
Q. Is he about where you expect him to be at that point?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Full speed.  
  
Q. If you're around a couple years from now, you probably win a thousand
games. Now you're going to tell me that number means nothing to you. It's not
something that you think about?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, I definitely don't think about it. I think, once you get
to 800, the numbers are pretty big, they mean something. 900 means a little
bit more. I mean, those are big numbers. They're not something you ever
thought about, but they're certainlygoing to be in the back of your mind.
You're going to see them all the time anyway. They're constantly brought up.  
But, yeah, I mean, that's a big number. I don't know. What am I going to say?
As I've told this story before, when you have about 100, you looked at 874,
whatever the number was, and you said, Well, that's not happening. That's 20
wins a year for 40 years to get to 800. So it's just not something that you
think is something that's going to happen someday.  
Yeah, the number is always there. It's kind of back there, back of your mind.  
  
Q. Jim, Steve Hawkins was asked if they had maybe any kind of advantage
having seen Eastern Michigan run your zone. Conversely, can you get any kind
of an advantage after seeing how they attacked Eastern Michigan?  
COACH BOEHEIM: We see how everybody attacks the two‑three zone. We've seen
everybody this year who plays against the two‑three zone. So we see everybody,
what they try to do, and most people do similar things. But everybody plays
against a two‑three zone.  
  
Q. Western Michigan is led by senior Shayne Whittington and David Brown,
kind of an inside ‑out duo. What are your thoughts on those two?   
COACH BOEHEIM: They're very impressive. They could play anywhere in the
country from what I've seen. They're really good players. I don't really look
at where players play or who they play for. I look at how good players are and
how good the team is and the coach, and Western Michigan's got a team that
could play with anybody in the country.  
Those two guys, their whole team is good. I think their other guys are really
good. I think those two guys could step in and play any place in the country.
I think that's the beauty of college basketball today.  
You get guys that develop as players at schools like Western Michigan, and
they're as good as anybody we have and anybody that we've played against.  
Our players understands that, we understand that. Obviously, this team has
played tremendous basketball for us all year, but in every game with a few
exceptions have been a battle. We're used to that. It's not like we had a lot
of easy games along the way.  
I don't think we played any differently at the end of the year than we played
all year. We played at Virginia, at Duke. Nobody else won there in the league
either. So that's fairly normal. We played at Virginia without Jerami Grant,
and we played at Duke, and it came down to one play that maybe went the wrong
way. But I think we've covered that play already this year.  
And then we didn't have Jerami for Georgia Tech. Georgia Tech is a pretty good
team. They're playing pretty well. We're not the same team without him. You
know, we lost to NC State in a game that we had a two‑point lead late. They
banked a shot, banked a three, and they're a pretty good team. They won last
night.  
We played pretty much the same all year long. The way the schedule's set up
and the way with Jerami going down, that's part of why the finish was what it
was. But I don't see any difference in the way we're playing or the way we're
practicing now as any time this year.  
  
Q. I don't want to put you in position to reminisce about the Big East, but
with a year under your belt with the ACC, could you just talk about the pros
and cons of your experience in the ACC this year versus the Big East.  
COACH BOEHEIM: The restaurants were pretty good. It surprised me. They were
really pretty good. The league is difficult, just like the Big East. The style
of play isn't much different. I really didn't see much difference.  
I've said this many times, but I guess it bears repeating. The Big East was
exactly what it was years ago, then I wouldn't have wanted to leave, and it
would have been a bad thing, but we didn't leave that. We left a league that
was moving all over. You didn't know who was going to be where. It just wasn't
the same.  
And so I don't have that nostalgia because that league wasn't there. If we'd
have left that league, I think it would have been harder. But knowing that
that just wasn't there anymore, it really wasn't difficult to leave.  
I mean, the Big East had changed so many times over the years, and it was just
not the same. But I think we got to a league that is going to be stable, as
stable as you can be. And given the people that run college basketball or
athletics, I think it will be stable. I think that was important.  
But from a basketball point of view, our fans, you always worry a little bit
about the fans. We had the biggest attendance here since 1993 or something.
Our fans bought into it. I think we ended up 4,000 more per game. Everybody is
happy, basically.  
I mean, yeah, it's fine. You never know how things are going to be, but it
turned out really good. Really good.  
  
Q. Jim, I just wanted to ask you a bit, if I could, about your friend Phil
Martelli, who's been through things personally this year and professionally.
He's had an issue of criticism, and you've obviously had that. How difficult
is it to deflect, and how happy are you to see him come out the other side?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I have never been criticized. I don't know about that, well,
that I would pay attention to anyway, let's put it that way.  
You know, I'm happy. I watched his team a couple of times during the year, and
I thought he had a real good team. They really have come together at the end
of the year and played great. I'm happy for him. I'm happy for his team.  
Obviously, he did have some adversity, personal adversity this year. We all
have to kind of go through that from time to time because, I mean, we are
normal‑‑ not normal, but we are people. So you're going to have those things.  
I'm just happy he got through it. I saw Jay last night. I don't know why Jay
wouldn't let Phil on the back of the plane. I think they should have. That
would have been neighborly for him to do that.  
  
Q. I just want to know what you're going to expect from Tyler Ennis when the
tournament begins tomorrow.  
COACH BOEHEIM: I don't really think about Tyler Ennis, to tell you the truth.
He'll be fine.  
  
Q. Some of his teammates were just saying that they've seen him become more
aggressive.  
COACH BOEHEIM: A little bit.  
  
Q. He's not a demonstrative person.  
COACH BOEHEIM: He listens to me. That's nice. I like that. I like that.  
  
Q. Jim, sounds like you have a pretty vivid memory of your 100th career
victory. What do you remember about your first NCAA Tournament as a coach?  
COACH BOEHEIM: My first as a coach? I haven't been thinking about this, so I
probably won't even remember. You'll have to give me a clue. Let's see, first
tournament. Is that when we beat Tennessee? I don't know. I swear to God, I
wish I could remember. I think it was. Roosevelt was a freshman. Yeah, I think
that was it.  
It was a good tournament for a while. We thought we had an easy tournament,
and then we had Charlotte, and they had a guy named Cornbread Maxwell, and it
didn't turn out so easy. I think that was it. I'm not 100 percent.  
THE MODERATOR: That was it.  
COACH BOEHEIM: That was it? Good.  
THE MODERATOR: Didn't know it was going to be an aging test.  
COACH BOEHEIM: We had to go to LSU and play Tennessee and Ernie and Bernie,
and we had an unbelievable game.  
  
Q. Overtime.  
COACH BOEHEIM: We ended up blowing the regulation, and we should have won in
regulation, then we ended up winning in overtime.  
But it was a great game. Great, great game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Good luck.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Happy to be joined by Villanova student‑athletes Ryan
Arcidiacono and James Bell. Welcome to Buffalo. We'll open it up for
questions.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, what did you learn about playing in this tournament
from your experience last year?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: Last year we kind of got off to a slow start. It's great to
be back for a second year just because we know what preparation is like the
day before a game and the day of a game. So I think that's going to help us
out.  
As for the game, anything can happen. We were down 20 to North Carolina and
came back in the second half, and we were fighting till the end. We just
learned about the preparation pretty much.  
JAMES BELL: We learned that we weren't going to quit, and we learned that it's
a long game. We've got to be ready and focused from the beginning. Playing
great teams at this point in the season, and they can jump on us, and it's
just how we respond.  
  
Q. You've had a week since you played now. Obviously, you want to keep
playing in New York, but is there a positive having that time and kind of get
some down time, getting off your feet for a couple days, and then getting back
to practice and just having that little break?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I know for a fact that we would much rather have been
playing in New York, but Seton Hall was a good team. They beat us. We just got
back to work and practice. Each day we competed with each other and just tried
to work the best we could both offensively and defensively.  
But we wanted to get back on the court, and we're happy to be in Buffalo to
play Milwaukee.  
JAMES BELL: We definitely don't want to lose. There are things that we took
from that game that will help us now. Everything matters. Everybody counts.
Everybody's a great team at this point. We understand that we're going to get
everybody's best game, and they've got to get ours. So I'd rather it happen
then than now.  
  
Q. James, this is, I guess, your third trip here. You guys are still looking
for your first win in the tourney. How hungry does that make you, having been
knocked out in the first round or second round in each of the last two times
you've been here?  
JAMES BELL: It means a lot to me to get a win in the tournament. Being my
senior year, you never want to go out. Somebody has to lose their last game,
but you never want to go out like we have in the past.  
But for us, if we play the way we're supposed to play, win or lose, that's
good enough for me. We've just got to go out doing it the way we do.  
  
Q. James and Ryan, did either one of you know anything about Milwaukee
before you found out you were playing them? These past few days, what have you
learned?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I would say, when we found out who we're playing, we're just
happy to be in the tournament. We didn't really know anything about them. No
one on our team saw them play, maybe one or two guys.  
Definitely learned they're a tough team. They're scrappy. They've got a couple
of good guards and big men that can play out on the perimeter and play with
their back to the basket.  
JAMES BELL: We didn't know much about them. Like he said, a couple of us saw
them play in the Horizon League Championship. Besides that, we knew they're a
great team to get to this point, and we were just focused on learning about
them and seeing how they were going to play us.  
  
Q. James, now that you're a senior and this is your last go round, do you
feel a little more urgency to do it, have a long run here and really play the
way you guys are capable of playing?  
JAMES BELL: Honestly, no. I just feel like I, myself, have to get the team to
play on the level that we're supposed to‑ playing hard, playing together, and
playing smart.  
If we win or lose, we win or lose. But just my goal, as a senior and as a
leader, is to get the team playing how we're supposed to.  
  
Q. When Syracuse and UConn players were in here, they said they missed
playing at the Garden in the Big East Tournament. I know it's disappointing
for you guys this year, but what does it mean to you to represent the Big
East?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I think it's just great. It's a great conference. We got
four teams in this year. Everyone knows what happened with the whole split up,
but I thought we had a great conference.  
To finish it off at Madison Square Garden means a lot to everybody. As they
say, it's the world's most famous arena. It was a good time up there. It's
always fun to play up there. Hopefully, we can get back there, but we have to
take it one game at a time.  
JAMES BELL: We miss some of those teams, and I would see how they could miss
playing in Madison Square Garden. We still have a great league, and it's just
an honor to represent the Big East in the way that we are. We've just got to
do it to the best of our ability at this point.  
  
Q. James, you said get back to the way you guys should be playing. Can you
say more about that and describe what that means for your team.  
JAMES BELL: Playing for Coach Wright for four years, he wants us to be tough
together and play with a sense of urgency and pride. Sometimes we don't do
that at the start of the games. It takes a while for us to get going.  
But me as a leader and being it could be my last game, I want to push my team
to do that for 40 minutes. If we do, win or lose, it's good enough for us.  
  
Q. Just with JayVaughn Pinkston? Can you say a little bit about what
JayVaughn has brought to the team this year and how he's improved from
previous years?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: JayVaughn is just another player on our team who just plays
hard. He's very versatile both offensively and defensively. He can guard
guards and guard big men defensively, and offensively he can play either face
up or back to the basket. He always has to be aggressive to score.  
When he's in it defensively, he's a pretty tough guy to stop when he's playing
40 minutes.  
JAMES BELL: JayVaughn is another guy that's been in this program for three
years. He knows what we're doing almost inside and out. He just gives us more
death. He can play the three. He can play the four. He can play the five
leading into. JayVaughn just gets what we're doing, and that just brings us to
another level, offensively and defensively.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, want to thank you for your time. Best of luck tomorrow.  
We'll have Coach Wright up here momentarily.  
Now joined by Villanova head coach Jay Wright. Coach, welcome to Buffalo.  
COACH WRIGHT: Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: We look forward to seeing your team play tomorrow.  
We'll open it up for questions at this time.  
  
Q. Jay, Josh and Kris seem to have had made a lot of progress this last
season. What do you see in the progress they made and the confidence that they
have? How do you see them fitting in now that this is their first NCAA
Tournament game?  
COACH WRIGHT: They've become a big part of our rotation. As you know, earlier
in the year, Josh Hart came on, he had a little bit of a slump in the middle
of the year. And then towards the end of the year, came on strong again. He's
been a great spark for us off the bench. He scores. He rebounds. He's a great
defender.  
And Kris Jenkins is just one of those guys, he lost 40 pounds when he came in
this summer. He's just gradually gotten better and better and better to the
point now where he's doing a lot of little things. He was not making shots,
which is really his greatest strength. He's one of the best shooters on the
team. Now he's making shots and really become an invaluable part of our
rotation.  
So both of them are a big part of our team and hopefully going to be a big
part of this tournament.  
  
Q. Taj was just up here talking about how he hasn't won a tournament game
since he's been with you. You know, obviously, his legacy is secure with what
he's done, but how much do you think he kind of has that hunger to really get
one of these, a couple of these, to make a nice run for him personally?  
COACH WRIGHT: I think one of the things that happened in the Big East
Tournament is I forgot how special this is to the kids because we've been
doing this for a long time. But it helped remind me that no matter how many
times we've been here to the tournament, to these kids, they want to win
games.  
Villanova has won a lot of games. James Bell wants to win. It's far more
important to these kids maybe than I've remembered. I think it's far more
important than any of us know.  
Especially to those of us that cover it, it's big. He wants to win. They all
want to win an NCAA Tournament game, and I think it's a big part of their
inspiration.  
  
Q. When I hear you say you kind of forgot about what these games mean to
these kids in certain respects, but did that loss to Seton Hall, I guess,
maybe, was that the right jolt to the system for maybe you, for this team to
sort of get back to what you were just talking about?  
COACH WRIGHT: It was. It was definitely a jolt to our system. And not just the
loss because Seton Hall played really well. They had a great game plan. They
played intelligently. They made big shots. You could lose that game and be
okay with it, but we didn't start that game ready to play, and that is the
only game all year that we had done that.  
I don't know what it was. I don't know if it was getting to New York. It
seemed like everybody got awards. Danny Ochefu, Darrun Hilliard, James Bell
was first team, JayVaughn Pinkston, everybody got something. Everybody was
talking to us about playing Creighton, and we were saying to the guys and to
everyone, We've got to play the winner of Seton Hall‑Butler first game.  
It must have gotten away from us a little bit, but it shocked us. I can tell
those guys learned a great lesson, and I can tell they've got a renewed focus
and a fire in them that I think is going to help us.  
  
Q. 30 years ago you got started in this whole coaching thing down in
Rochester, and now you're back in Buffalo.  
COACH WRIGHT: I remember I recruited Greg from Canisius Prep. I used to come
here every night Anchor Bar, get wings. And that kid, what happened? He went
to Canisius instead of University of Rochester. Greg Winik, I was in Buffalo
for him every night.  
  
Q. Being back in New York, talk about bringing this full circle, 30 years
ago Rochester, today Buffalo.  
COACH WRIGHT: The first time I ever coached was at University of Rochester. As
everyone knows, it's big in upstate New York. We were just talking in the
back, Alfred University right here, how big Division III basketball is up here
in upstate New York. I think it's bigger than anywhere in the country. Games
are on TV. Kids grow up in this area, they want to play Syracuse, Canisius,
Niagara, St. Bonaventure. But if they don't go there, they want to stay at
these Division III schools. It's big.  
I was amazed how big Division III basketball is here. I worked for Mike Mears,
still one of the brightest minds in the game. He coached over 30 years, and
now he's at Hobart and took Hobart to the NCAA Tournament.  
I love living up here. I love the wings. The one in Rochester or Anchor Bar in
Buffalo, my favorites, but there's a lot of great spots. Jeff Van Gundy was
playing at Nazareth when I was here. And John Beilein was coaching at one. It
was a great time. I have a lot of good friends from up here.  
  
Q. Obviously, you have a pretty special relationship with Phil Martelli. How
much can you kind of empathize with what he's been through this year and
fought through it? And also, how interesting would it be if you end up playing
them in the next round?  
COACH WRIGHT: You know, in Philadelphia, all of the coaches, it's a really
strange dynamic. We want to kill each other in recruiting, in games. We really
do. I mean, it could come to a point in the game where you could be rolling on
the floor.  
But when the game's over, we all do Coaches Versus Cancer together. We all
know each other's wives. We all grew up in Philadelphia. We have a great deal
of respect for each other and good friendships. We've all been there long
enough that we've all had bad years and we've all had good years.  
So you feel for everybody in coaching, but when the guys in Philly have a
tough year, or especially those guys, I'm happy for them. I really am. I don't
want to be over dramatic about it. I want to beat them every time we play
them. I'm happy for them. They've got a good team. They do it the right way.
They play smart basketball.  
I know in Philadelphia, if we played them, it would be huge in Philadelphia.
If we played them in the NCAA Tournament and this close, it would be big. No
one knows except people who live in Philly how big that would be.  
  
Q. Jay, to kind of build off that what you were talking about with Bob, can
you talk to your team about guarding against that premise of playing St. Joe's
and what that would mean. In a sense overlooking Milwaukee, you don't want to
do that. Do you have to guard against that? That's the fun of this NCAA
Tournament looking at the potential matchups?  
COACH WRIGHT: No, that's not the fun of the tournament at all. It's really
not. It's the challenge of the tournament. And I think the good thing is that,
having lost to Seton Hall in the first round, our guys getting to watch film
of Milwaukee.  
If you watch film on them in their tournament run, you can see Jordan Aaron is
a kid from the Bronx who these guys know guys like this. He can just take over
a game.  
Kelm and Tiby, those guys, they can really score. They're tough. McWhorter,
their other guard is really good. They've watched enough film. They can't even
think about that. They're very concerned about Milwaukee. Maybe it's a
different kind of team, but when you watch that Milwaukee team, you can see
we've really got our hands full. They're very focused.  
  
Q. What is it like having to defend against a quick, speedy guard like
Jordan Aaron?  
COACH WRIGHT: You know, I'm really not excited about it at all. We've
benefited probably as much as any coaching staff in the country from having
great New York City guards. Even from back in our days at Hofstra, Speedy
Claxton, who he reminds me of a little bit, and Corey Fisher and Allan Ray, he
can get a shot off any time, and he can make bad shots. Those guys are scary.
There could be a night where they miss them, and you're okay.  
But a guy that can get tough shots and make them is really scary, and that's
what he is. He's so quick with the ball that it's hard to double him. That's
why I said our guys see that. They have great respect for him. It's going to
be a challenge.  
  
Q. Do you see any of Bo Ryan's fingerprints on this team?  
COACH WRIGHT: Yeah, a lot. They use all of their players on every spot on the
floor. Everybody's skilled. Even their big forwards step out, shoot threes,
put it on the floor, pass the ball. I see a lot. They're very tough
defensively, pack line defense like Bo's teams.  
And then at the end, they always have that one guy that kind of has the
freedom at the end of the shot clock to go do his thing.  
I think Bo has a reputation of being like a controlling coach when really
there's always a guy on that team that's got the freedom to go. Jordan Aaron's
like that. I think it's very similar to a Wisconsin team.  
  
Q. Does it feel a little bit like a Big East reunion around here with all
the other teams?  
COACH WRIGHT: Yeah, it's very cool. My wife, Daryl, the A.D. at Syracuse, and
Jim Boeheim, my wife and I spent an hour in the lobby last night talking about
the ESPN special "30 for 30" and the old days. It's really cool to see
Connecticut people. It's very cool.  
  
Q. How much more enjoyable has this season been for you? Not because you're
winning and not because you're ranked, but the way this team is playing and
the personality they've assumed.  
COACH WRIGHT: All of us coaches love every year. You love every team. They're
like your children. But sometimes you have kids that are like your own kids.
You love them. They're a challenge, but you love them. Then you have kids that
are just easy. Sometimes they even go under appreciated because they're so
easy. That's what this group was like.  
It was a really fun year, kind of an easy year, no struggles. Just easy to
coach. Fun to be around. They play unselfishly. It's been a thrill.  
As I said earlier, if I made any mistake in the Big East Tournament, they were
just so easy. I had so much confidence in them, maybe I didn't jump them
enough to see it was possible they could be a little overconfident. And I feel
bad about that because I want this team to keep playing as long as they can.
It's a joy to coach this team.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Good luck tomorrow.

_BUFFALO, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Milwaukee student‑athletes Jordan Aaron and
Matt Tiby. Welcome to Buffalo, appreciate you being here.  
  
Q. For both players, you guys swept through your conference tournament, four
straight wins, two good road wins. How much do you think you could take the
momentum from there? Even though it's been over a week, momentum from that
tournament into this one tomorrow?  
JORDAN AARON: Hopefully, we can carry that into this tournament. We just want
to be gritty and just keep playing with that competitive spirit like we've
been playing with throughout our conference tournament. Just stick to what the
coaches have playing for us out there, and I think we should be fine.  
MATT TIBY: As myself, I need to bring that energy that I brought in the
conference tournament, definitely want to go out there and play some team
defense. That's what really got us here. Just getting down to the defensive
stops and playing together as one and playing for each other.  
Coach always says, Stick to the plan, so that's what we're going to go out and
do.  
  
Q. Jordan, Coach Wright compared you to Speedy Claxton. How do you respond
to that, and why do you think he did that?  
JORDAN AARON: I guess because I'm going kind of fast. I just try to go out
there and play my style of basketball and just lead my teammates the best way
I know how. I just leave everything out on the floor like the rest of my team
does.  
  
Q. Jordan, what is it like coming back home to play, and how many family
members are you expecting to be in attendance?  
JORDAN AARON: It's a wonderful feeling to be able to come back home,
especially playing in the NCAA Tournament. And have my family in the stands,
that's definitely a tremendous feeling.  
As far as how many that's coming out, I don't even know. I think about 30 or
so. Hopefully, they all make it.  
  
Q. What was different for you guys during the conference tournament? Because
you didn't maybe have the record in conference play that you wanted. So what
were you able to do differently in the tournament?  
MATT TIBY: As a collective whole, we definitely wanted to get together. We
wanted that common goal, and that was to make it to the Horizon League
Championship and to win it.  
So it started with defense, and I took pride in getting those stops. I just
let Jordy do the offensive thing because I knew he was going to go out, and he
was able to score 20 to 30 points. I've seen him do that all year round.  
I just wanted to go out there and do my part and get those rebounds so we
could secure a victory. We just went out there with that energy and that
passion that we love to play with. We really played for each other out there.  
  
Q. For people who don't have a great feel for your team, you mentioned the
term 'gritty,' but talk about the turnaround. Pretty remarkable. Just what a
ride it's been this season.  
JORDAN AARON: We've always been kind of not on the radar of a lot of people,
and that's the kind of chip that we have when we get out there on that court.
We just want to leave everything out there for that 40 minutes that we're on
that court.  
I think this team has a lot of confidence and a lot of players that are
aggressive, and we just play for one another. We always back each other up
whatever we do out there. So we just like to leave everything out on the
basketball court for 40 minutes.  
MATT TIBY: The turnaround from last year, as for myself, I was sitting out. I
transferred in from a junior college the second wave through. So seeing what
my team needed out there on the floor really gave me a perspective of how I
wanted to shape myself as a basketball player for this team.  
I knew this team needed some energy, and I knew this team needed that
rebounding presence.  
So I took pride in that, and I really rallied the troops on the defensive
side. So we really came together as a whole in the summer, and we had that
common goal to just make it and just prove everybody wrong. We had that chip
on our shoulders all year round.  
Jordy was right there next to me, and he was leading the way with us.  
  
Q. How do you plan for going up against a team that's very balanced and
shoots a lot of three ‑point shots?   
JORDAN AARON: Just definitely sticking to the plan that the coaches have for
us. We know Villanova is a great team. We're just going to go out there and
play our style of basketball and get ready for a fight out there.  
MATT TIBY: Villanova is a great team, very well coached. They have balance all
around the floor. Their guards are very well, and they have a great player,
Pinkston, down low, and it just comes down to making stops. You know we're
going to have to play in those gaps, and just put our hands up and just go
rebound the ball and don't give them second chances.  
  
Q. Jordan, you guys had a few days from when you won the championship to the
selection. Did you guys kind of maybe go through some teams that you wanted to
play or maybe even some conferences that you were curious that you might
get?  
JORDAN AARON: No, we had our practices, but we kind of just sat back and
waited for who we were facing. Just prepared for them after we knew who we
were playing.  
We knew it could be any of those top teams, and we just prepared like it would
be anybody that we would face out there.  
  
Q. What did you guys take out of the Seton Hall game, that Villanova lost?  
MATT TIBY: I didn't really mind that game. That's not the Villanova team that
I've seen all year round. They're very well balanced and very well coached.  
So I'm expecting their best coming out. We have to just get down at it with
the defensive side. We've just got to talk and communicate, and that's really
big for us.  
  
Q. Matt, are you much of a college fan to know that 15 seeds do win this
game?  
MATT TIBY: Yeah, ever since growing up, usually on spring break, I'm with my
parents down in Arizona watching Selection Sunday. It was just great to see
our name to be up there. The past few years, you see the 14 and 15 seeds come
out with victories. It's just because they have more heart and determination
than any other team, and that's what it comes down to is we have to go out
there and play with our heart. We have to be determined and get some stops and
get those defensive rebounds.  
THE MODERATOR: Jordan, Matt, we appreciate your time. Wish you all the best
tomorrow.  
Be right up with Coach Jeter.  
Head Coach Rob Jeter has joined us. We'll go ahead and have coach make an
opening statement and take questions from the media afterwards.  
COACH JETER: Thank you.  
First of all, obviously, we're thrilled to be here. I think I'm very thrilled
to have a team that's finally played to their potential. We feel really good
about where we are, and we just want to make sure that we can go out tomorrow
and just represent Milwaukee and the city and the fans to the best of our
abilities.  
  
Q. Coach, going forward from the conference tournament, two great road wins.
What clicked for you guys?  
COACH JETER: We got our team together. We finally had our team back together,
and we were able to put people in the right positions. We were able to put the
right rotations together. They've really, for the last part of the season,
played with passion and energy to get something done. I think that was the
key.  
  
Q. A couple times your players used a phrase about playing with a chip on
their shoulder. I wondered if you could maybe expound on that or address
that.  
COACH JETER: We have a lot of new faces, and the beginning of the season was
all about trying to get these guys to buy in, trying to get these guys to come
together as a team. They get some leadership.  
With all the new faces, was the season predicted to turn out this way? No, and
I think those guys recognized that. But I think they also recognized that they
had enough talent in the room to do it, but we needed to do it together and
learn how to do it together.  
As they progressed through the season, they really learned that lesson, that
when adversity hit us in some of those tough times, we seemed to play more as
individuals. Later in the season, we figured out that when adversity hits, we
really have to learn how to lean on the person next to us. I think that's what
we learned more.  
But having that chip on our shoulder because of last season and because of the
fact that no one really knew our group, they didn't know where to put us. As a
result, they put us in a position where we had to prove to some people that we
were a lot better than what they thought.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you plan on facing a guy like Pinkston down low in game
play?  
COACH JETER: I don't know. We'll have to see. He's very talented, can really
put a lot of pressure on you at the rim. He's going to attack you. I think
with the new rules that are in place, it favors a player that's aggressive
like him. We have to throw multiple bodies at him, and if we have an
opportunity to make him shoot tough two‑pointers, that's going to be our
advantage.  
We can't allow him to get to the rim. He's so good with his footwork. He's
just a tough matchup. I think he's 6'7", 240. Now, I have to wait until I see
him, but I've seen him on tape. He looks every bit of 240. He's just a matchup
nightmare because he can really move and he's so slippery around the basket.  
  
Q. Coach, if you could maybe describe the two or three biggest strengths of
your team and then a couple areas when you guys struggled this year that
really seemed to magnify themselves.  
COACH JETER: We'll start with the negative and end with the positive. How
about that?  
I think the negative for us has been just rebounding. I think that had plagued
us earlier in the season. Now, in the tournament, we solved that problem. So
we have to make sure we continue to do that.  
The positive is that our group, they're very close. They really care about
each other. They're a talented group. Sometimes, like I had mentioned earlier,
when adversity hit, they really started to go back to individual talents
rather than really trying to fall back on all the things that we really want
them to do together, is to play as a team and to make the extra passes. But
we're doing those things now. They're really trusting each other.  
And guys like Matt Tiby are willing to sacrifice a few extra buckets to make
sure that they can give a teammate an extra pass. I think that's been really
positive for this group.  
But I think the guys, I think it really comes down to one thing. These guys
are talented enough, but they really care, and they're really sticking to the
plan of just making the extra pass and trying to make sure their teammates
look out for their teammates rather than themselves.  
  
Q. One of the things Jay said was he recognizes Bo Ryan's fingerprints on
your team. That seems to be a high compliment, first of all. Secondly, can you
just maybe quickly talk about the influence that Bo had for you.  
COACH JETER: Well, when you spend 15 years with an older, gray‑haired guy,
some things are going to rub off on you, and luckily for me, there was a lot
of positives to rub off when it comes to Bo, with Coach.  
I think the best thing to sum up Bo is that he really cares for his players. I
think that's why his players work so hard for him, and that's why his teams
play so well together because they trust him and they care about him.  
I think that's the one thing that I've tried to pass on to our guys, let them
know that we do care about them. When they believe that, then they'll trust
you. They might give up a few shots every once in a while to make the extra
pass because they care about you and they know that they can trust you.  
But when it comes to basketball and the Xs and Os, Bo keeps things really
simple, and we try to do the same things. It's just a simple game. You've got
to take care of the basketball. You've got to get more shots than the other
team, and there's ways to do that. Statistically, we want to take those higher
percentage shots, free throws and layups, if you can. So that also lends to
get more shots. I think that's what we try to do.  
Now, we do it a little differently. Our plays and our schemes are a little
different, but the principle behind what we're trying to accomplish is the
same.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about some of the strengths and weaknesses. If you
could expand and tell me about your offense and defense by describing the
style of offense you play? Also, defensively, are you predominantly man to
man, zone team? Describe that as well, please.  
COACH JETER: Our offense is all about tempo, and it's going to be very
important against Villanova. Tempo, we have to control that tempo. We want to
make sure that we're getting good shots. Not that we won't take quick shots,
but we want good shots. Good shots for us are the percentage shots.  
We really believe passes that come from the inside out are shots that we can
make. We really believe that if we get the ball closer to the rim, then now we
can bring in the X‑factor, and that's the officials. We can bring those guys
into play, and hopefully they'll reward us with extra shots from the
free‑throw line.  
Those are the things we try and do offensively. We try to spread the floor,
make extra passes, and attack the paint with the pass or the dribble. That
sums us up offensively.  
Now, defensively, we're a man‑to‑man team. Now, we have played some zone, and
there are situations where I think it's necessary at times, but we really want
to be a man‑to‑man team. We're going to play 90 percent of the time in man. We
have played some zone, but as of late, we've had one possession of zone in our
last six games.  
That's not a secret. Villanova's watched every tape of ours, I'm sure.  
But it's still all about accountability and just making sure guys understand
that, as a group, we have to guard. A good man‑to‑man is a zone anyway the way
you have to get off of gaps and be around on the back side. But there's a
little more accountability in man‑to‑man.  
  
Q. Rob, you talk about the rough year last year and not being thought of
very highly this year. You have a real good season, real good tournament. Is
there a feeling in the locker room of 15 seed, why not us?  
COACH JETER: Well, I think, first of all, talk about last year, just it
happens. It's a rebuild year. Just a blip on the radar. And the good news is
that we had some opportunities for some younger guys to grow and mature. I
think we're seeing a lot of that progress this year.  
15 seed, we're deceiving because of our last four games before we head to the
tournament. We just didn't have one of our best players, or our best player on
the court. You take anyone's best player off their team, and that changes
things.  
But we knew, once we got everyone back together, it's just a matter of, well,
could we rebound and get ourselves back to playing like we were before we had
lost Jordan? And we did. We did that pretty quickly. And as a result, we got
back to playing at the level that we were.  
So being a 15 seed, 14 seed, 12, 11, you're going to play good teams in the
tournament. You're going to run into them first round, second round. It just
happens for us we're running into a Villanova team that's very talented.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach. Best of luck to you tomorrow.

_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  

Wisconsin  85  
Oregon - 77

  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome student-athletes, Frank Kaminsky, Josh Gasser, and Ben
Brust and Traevon Jackson. A very thrilling comeback win. Opening remarks from
Coach Ryan, and we'll take questions from the student-athletes after that.  
COACH BO RYAN: In the back I had a chance to listen to Coach Altman's comments
and all. What a class individual. This was a tough environment for their team.
They played hard, they played really well, but for our guys to be able to have
the regular season that they did, as he mentioned, and get the seeds, it was
definitely earned. And in order to get something done here tonight, we
definitely had to earn that and our guys did. I'm awfully proud of them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. You guys talked about after the Michigan State game, the Big Ten
Tournament, how you guys wanted to learn from that deficit. Safe to say you
guys kind of exorcized some of those demons with this comeback here tonight?  
JOSH GASSER: Definitely. I mean, we were obviously upset at the Big Ten
tournament. We didn't achieve what we wanted to obviously but, you know, it's
a brand new season coming into the NCAA Tournament, and all I can really say
is I got to thank our crowd. That crowd was unbelievable. When we were up or
down, we'd make a little run or they make a run, they always seemed to just
get us back into it somehow. In the NCAA Tournament, not many teams get that.
We're pretty darn fortunate to have that.  
  
Q. For Frank, Frank, you really seemed to be in a groove there tonight and
just knocking down shot after shot. What do you think it was that put you in
the possession to do that, and can you speak a little bit again to the crowd
and their reaction to you?  
FRANK KAMINSKY: I think it has a little bit to do with the pressure they were
putting on the guards. I tried to release it sometimes, and they were able to
find me with the post open, and it was one-on-one, and I was looking at some
easy buckets there. They did a great job of find meeting.  
The crowd was unbelievable. We were feeding off the energy of the crowd and
try to get them into it, and they were into it the whole game. That's
obviously an advantage for us.  
  
Q. Traevon, you get the run in the first 20 seconds of the first half. Did
you feel that was the jolt that you guys needed for the second half?  
TRAEVON JACKSON: Yeah. Just from coming out at halftime, Coach gave us a --
you know, he kind of ripped into us a little bit just telling us, hey, we can
do this. And I think we responded well. I'm just proud of our teammates
because we've been down before, but today we kept taking it one possession at
a time and I'm just proud of our teammates.  
  
Q. To all four of you, what was said at halftime and by whom?  
JOSH GASSER: All of us kind of talked. We were upset with the way we played.
We just didn't follow the game plan that we knew we needed to do. They had a
ton of transition points and they were just taking it to us. Fifty points
speaks for itself. Coach Ryan obviously had a few words to say to get us
going. We responded pretty well, like Traevon said.  
  
Q. This is for any of you guys. At this time of year, good teams have to
prove that they can take a punch and come back from it. How important do you
think this performance is going to be for you next weekend and if you would
make it to Dallas?  
THE MODERATOR: Ben, why don't you take that one.  
BEN BRUST: I got this. Yeah, it was good to come out in the second half, and
we just talked in the locker room. We can do it, but we got to believe in each
other and have faith and also do the things that made us successful to get the
comeback, which was you get some charges, get some stops, and just take care
of the ball and get good shots. And just we worked it around, did all the
things we talked about that we should have done for 40 minutes, but luckily we
were able to do a good enough job in the last 20 better to get the job done.  
  
Q. Question for Frank. To say the least, it looked very physical underneath
tonight. Can you talk about all the pounding and pounding that went on
underneath? They were really going after you tonight?  
FRANK KAMINSKY: It's tournament time and no one wants to go home. You're doing
whatever you can to stay in. If that means being physical down low with
anyone, it's a battle. For 40 minutes we were going at each other, both teams.
And like I said, it's tournament time. People are going to be physical with
you.  
  
Q. Question for Ben. Ben, on the three-pointer late in the game, what was
going through your head as the ball was swinging around to you and how did it
feel after you hit that shot?  
BEN BRUST: It was a wild sequence of events there. I think Sam got it, threw
it to Trae, and Trae just found me, and as soon as I let it go, I knew it was
going down, which was a good feeling. Just knew we had to get back and play
some defense because the game wasn't over.  
  
Q. Ben, as a senior, what was kind of going through your head there at
halftime knowing you were maybe 20 minutes away from your final game here, and
how satisfying was it to hit that shot to give -- help give this team another
40 minutes of basketball?  
BEN BRUST: Do whatever it takes to not make it your final game. I'm thankful
to have some great teammates. We believe we can do it and we went out there
and did it. Forty-nine points given up in the first half to 28, that was a
battle of will and getting the job done and did it with all these guys.  
  
Q. Guys, at this time of year, you really see teams coming together. Can you
talk a little bit about the chemistry you guys have among your team?  
TRAEVON JACKSON: I just think that we try to have a lot of faith in each
other. I think that, you know, we go through ups and downs throughout the
game, and encouragement is huge for us in terms of picking each other up, and
whether that's just, you know, encouraging through speaking or doing
something. I think today, I think it would play right away, I was thinking
that Duje's charge. The whole bench was just going wild. That really kind of
got the team going. To see a guy do something like that, those are the type of
things that bringing the types of teams together. Just proud of our team for
doing it.  
  
Q. Ben, going back before that three, you were on the bench with foul
trouble. What was going through your head at that point? And then what kind of
might does it take to be able come off the bench and not only hit that shot
but just the act of taking it after you've been sitting for awhile?  
BEN BRUST: Coach told me to be ready. He wants to get me in whenever possible.
I don't know. I played the whole game, so kind of had a feel of the rhythm out
there and Trae found me and caught it and I knew it went.  
  
Q. Josh, interesting sequence at the end of the first half. They were upset
with the technical foul. Did that help you guys get fired up, the way the
crowd kind of responded to whatever was going on at the end of the half?  
JOSH GASSER: Well, like I said, the crowd was awesome. At that moment, you
know, we were obviously struggling then, down by double digits. Just to see
the will of the crowd had, the energy they had for us, doing whatever they
could to help us out.  
That's just -- we got in at halftime, let's just do this. We got to take care
ever business here and can't -- after I want to thank every individual in the
building, but I know that's impossible but they were awesome.  
  
Q. Josh, can you talk about just defending Joseph Young tonight? Was that
kind of frustrating for you at all with some of the shots he was hitting
tonight?  
JOSH GASSER: Yeah. A bunch of shots hit my face. Definitely frustrating
(laughter). He's a heck of a player. We had one day to prepare for them. I
wasn't able to watch too much film on them or get too much feel for them. I
knew what I had to do to shut him down. My teammates helped me out a lot. But
he's still just a really good player. He's really confident in that game.
Again, just a great player.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? Ben, Josh, Frank,
Traevon, thank you and congratulations. Good luck in Anaheim. We'll entertain
questions now for Coach Ryan, please.  
COACH BO RYAN: If you're going to ask what I said at half time? (Laughter).  
  
Q. I want to ask, that timeout that you called, two offensive rebounds. Can
you call it specifically to get Ben back in the game and what was the thinking
behind that timeout?  
COACH BO RYAN: Well, I just wanted to -- sometime you get offensive rebounds,
the juices are flowing, but we didn't have any alignment. We didn't have
spacing. So, I used the time out to get that. And they knew he was going back
in in a short period of time. He took a fatigue three. He took a shot that
wasn't the highest percentage shot, not his normal shot. So, he just needed to
get down a little bit.  
"Get down" meaning sit down. In the first -- all those timeouts, it's amazing
how much rest -- you can play seven, eight guys so easily now because of the
length of the timeouts and the monitor checks and everything else.  
So, Ben was okay. He wasn't even close to being tired.  
  
Q. I'll ask what you said at timeout. Similar to what I asked the players,
how important was it for you guys to show that you could with stand getting
down by that much and then come back from it as you go forward in the
tournament?  
COACH BO RYAN: A lot of times when you get down, it's, okay, how did you get
down? Their quickness was on display. How many fast break points did they get
in the first half? How many did they get in the second half? That stat right
there will tell you that it's the old "fool me once, shame on you, fool me
twice, shame on me." If they did the same thing in the second half, we're
going home and not playing anymore, Ben and the other seniors are finished.  
So, the idea was, do you know how many fast break points they got in the
second half? Zero. Oregon. One of the quickest teams in the country.  
So, you got to give the players a heck of a lot credit -- you don't stop fast
breaks by just the crowd making noise, which was fantastic, but you have to
get your bodies in position, you have to get your bodies shutting off the
driving lines, things like that, and covering three-point shooters. That was
the big difference and to be able to handle that smack in the face in the
first half and come back and deliver one of our own says a lot about this
group.  
At halftime last thing I said before we went out was, who is the best
defensive player in the room? Guys were looking at me. I'm the best defensive
player in the room. I got a technical. They made their 14th straight free
throw or 13th and then they missed the second one. I'm the only guy that got
them to miss (laughter).  
I think some of the guys looked at me like, did he just say that? Because I
can read groups pretty well and teams. After I said a few things maybe in a
little hyper state of mind, I can see that they were -- I just said that to
loosen them up. I did. Maybe it worked. Maybe it was part of it.  
  
Q. What happened in that sequence toward the end of the first half?  
COACH BO RYAN: I'm not exactly sure. I looked around at my assistants. I was
trying to clap to get my guys ready to go. Sometimes -- I kept asking what was
it for, but I never got an answer. They don't have to give you one. It's over.
I was probably getting a little too rambunctious on the side line. I probably
wasn't behaving. So, we had to pay. But they only made one of two (laughter).  
  
Q. After the game you had a couple of hugs with Josh Gasser and Ben Brust.
How special was this comeback?  
COACH BO RYAN: You know, Josh is playing in front of a lot of his friends,
family, acquaintances, alumni. He was pretty excited and rightfully so,
because he really doesn't show a lot of emotion. So, I could tell that he was
pretty pumped and the rest of the team was, too. You have to be in their shoes
to know that feeling, and, you know, I know I was feeling it. I was pretty
pumped up, too. I think I actually acknowledged the crowd once and I -- my
wife always tells me don't do that stuff that those other guys do, salty with
his (indicating). Salty looked good doing that. Didn't get a chance to do it
today.  
Anyhow, our guys were really pumped. That's a lot of emotion for our guys to
show. It is.  
  
Q. Why did Frank, was he able to get so many good looks tonight, and did you
see something there that you could capitalize on?  
COACH BO RYAN: Some of the things that they had shown proclivity for on their
defensive man sometimes with the man guarding the 5, we felt we could get some
looks. He can knock down the outside shot a little bit better than that. What
did he hit, one, one for five? I'm hoping in our next 40 minutes it's a little
bit better percentage than that.  
Frank's looks were because the 5 man was maybe helping on some other things,
but that's something you'd have to ask their coach, what was their game plan.
I don't know. We just try the make sure we're finding the open guy, and Frank
was open quite a bit.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys go on a 59-11 run on Thursday and 17-6. Can you maybe
explain what's gone gotten into your guys with their backs against the wall
here this weekend?  
COACH BO RYAN: We've had explosions in other parts of the season, too. We've
had some dry spells. So, again, that's what so unforgiving about this time of
the year. If you don't have some of those, you're going home. I mean, if you
don't stay offensively in the race, you can be playing defense -- we were
playing hard defensively. It just wasn't good enough for their offense in the
first half. Their offense was better than our defense. Fortunately, we turned
that around in the second half.  
  
Q. How big was Traevon's three-point play to start the second half? And then
just how much did the crowd kind of give you that extra jolt that maybe you
would not have gotten in a normally NCAA Tournament atmosphere if you were on
a neutral court?  
COACH BO RYAN: Three-point play to start a game definitely gives a lot of
energy. How about a teammate saying probably the play of the game was Duje
taking that charge, and without a doubt if you saw our bench, if you looked at
our bench when that happened, you looked at our guys, that was the play of the
game.  
Trae's three to start the half was obviously huge and you say about the crowd.
You know, our road record that Patrick keeps tabs on, us being in hostile
environments has been pretty decent, and for Oregon to be able to be in a
hostile environment, that was a tough task.  
So, obviously I think the energy helped us to get us over the hump.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for coach? Thank you. Congratulations. Good luck.  
COACH BO RYAN: Thank you.

_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  

Michigan  79  
Texas - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: So on to the Sweet 16 for the Wolverines. We have Michigan
student-athletes Glenn Robinsonn III, who had had 14 points; Nik Stauskas, who
had 17 points and eight assists; and Jordan Morgan who had 15 points and ten
rebounds. We'll hear first from Coach John Beilein with an opening statement
and then questions for the student-athletes at that time. Coach, please.  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I was able to listen to a little of Rick's comments there,
and that's really -- when you have a program, you can see a program back on
the rise again with what they were able to do today. Those 21 offensive
rebounds. We're not a great rebounding team, but the talent he's assembled
right there and the year they had this year, it's a credit to them what a
great season they had.  
Really proud of our guys because we knew that number, that rebounding number,
we probably weren't going to win that today. We had to win the other numbers
to win the possession number. Proud of only four turnovers. I don't think we
had a turnover out of the backcourt in the entire game.  
So, huge win for us and guys believed and did a great job and it all starts
with the guy next to me right here, our only senior.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions for the student-athletes, first,
please.  
  
Q. To any of you guys, the first nine minutes without a whistle, how much of
an advantage do you think that was for you to get them running to pace the
game up?  
NIK STAUSKAS: I don't even know if that was an advantage for us because we
were all pretty tired by that time. We never went that long without a whistle
or timeout or anything. We just figured that we'd keep it going and keep
running and play to our pace because we were hitting shots and we were feeling
good.  
So obviously we were a little bit tired, but I think we did a good job of
pushing through and making shots when we were open.  
  
Q. Nik, when you're creating for everybody else a career high, eight
assists, what kind of different dimension do you think that gives you guys
offensively when you're looking for everybody as well as hunting your own
stuff?  
NIK STAUSKAS: Well, in the second half when they started playing that zone,
you know, I just found it really easy to just put my eyes on the basket. And
as soon as I put my eyes on the basket or pretend like I'm going the raise up,
a lot of people would start running at me. That would leave some of the other
guys wide open. So I just tried to be aggressive, and if that's me getting
shots at the basket or shots from the other side, that's great. But, you know,
a lot of time it just leads to guys getting open shots under the rim and from
three.  
  
Q. Jordan, you guys did a real good job of taking Cameron out of his game
and challenging him inside. What was your strategy coming in? How did you feel
about the way you guys performed banging him inside?  
JORDAN MORGAN: Somebody like that, you know, he's got so much size. Can't let
him get close to the basket. So we wanted the make all his post touches, you
know, away from the basket as much as possible, make him have to dribble and
really, really be aggressive with double-teams and swiping at the ball and
things like that.  
  
Q. Glenn, this is a Milwaukee question. Your dad had a lot of big games in
this arena. Wondering what it was like for you to have a really big game in
this arena?  
GLENN ROBINSON III: It's an honor to be able to play in the same arena he has.
He had a great career here. You know, for me to be able to come out and have a
big game is important, you know, and reminds people a lot of my dad. But, at
the same time, I wanted to come out and play and do what I had to do to help
my teammates out and win.  
  
Q. What in particular did Texas do to cut the lead down to six with about
seven, eight minutes left in the game?  
JORDAN MORGAN: They did a good job of changing the pace of the game. They
really started to attack the offensive glass, get finishes and get fouls, and
they kind of gave us different looks with their defense, with their zones, and
made it hard for us to kind of get in a rhythm or stay in a rhythm, I should
say.  
  
Q. Glenn, kind of building on that question, you guys -- the lead was six
when you had five quick points in row, the drive and then the three-pointer.
Did you want to step forward at that time, or was it just kind of a function
the way the offense was going at that point?  
GLENN ROBINSON III: I wanted the ball. They were kind keying in on Nik, and
some of our other guys. I hadn't scored in awhile. I figured they were kind of
sleeping. I got a couple cuts that I didn't finish, but I went to the rim
strong, finish over Cam Ridley, and then knocked down that shot from Nik.  
Like he said earlier, people are really keying in on him. Once he goes up for
that shot, they're trying to block it. That's leaving other guys wide open. I
think that was just my job to knock it down.  
  
Q. For any or all of you guys. You guys are a 2 seed and playing at a very
efficient level right now as evidenced today. Why do you think it is that you
sort of seem to be flying a little bit under the radar? Everybody is talking
with Michigan State nationally?  
JORDAN MORGAN: At this point, I think people like to kind of say that we can't
accomplish things. We embrace that.  
  
Q. Nik, this might be stating the obvious, but I think you hit your first
three-pointer 30, 40 seconds into the game today. How important is it to try
to nail that first one to just get the rhythm especially in a big game like
this?  
NIK STAUSKAS: It's important for my confidence. It helps me get going, but at
the same time, I think the rest of the team feeds off it when we hit our first
shot. So, you know, Coach had a good play for me come off a ball screen and I
was trying to be aggressive and my shot was there and fortunately it went in.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? Glenn, Nik, Jordan.
Congratulations. Good luck.  
Questions for Coach Beilein, please.  
  
Q. Coach, that fast start you guys had, do you attribute that at all to your
kind of tournament experience in they looked a little tired at the start
compared to the way -- after that emotional win in the first round?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I think everybody's tongues were hanging with eight
minutes of straight basketball with no media timeout. We're in really good
shape, and we're not as big as some other teams sometimes. Sometimes that
helps you get off to that start. But you still got make shots.  
But Glenn and Nik and Jordan told me, we have this thing we call "the
gauntlet" where you run and it's really very difficult to accomplish, and they
felt like they were running the gauntlet in those first few minutes. They
fought through it and got it done. And so we've been up and down with good
starts this year. But throughout the game, we usually get some consistency
somewhere. I'd rather have the quick start.  
  
Q. Coach, you had four guys in double digits today. Do you prefer that type
of distribution as opposed to one guy kind of taking over?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Yeah. I really don't care. I just want to score more
points than the other team. If we play the way we practice, we have lot of
pass serves and have a lot of shooters. And so if you look -- if you get into
the lane, we had a couple just beautiful plays where we got in the lane,
landed on two and we found open people or found a different shot for
ourselves, something we work on endlessly.  
So there's some big points today where what they practiced transferred over to
a game.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about Jordan's game today, the chip on his shoulder he had
and not following and just the way he played against the bigs.  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: As we went through our pregame routine of two days, we
were very concerned about Ridley. How could we stop him from getting rebounds
and how we could stop him in the post. And Jordan just said, "I got him,
Coach, don't worry, I got him."  
So, he's got some pretty players. He's guarded some pretty good players. You
see why last year he was named to the first team of the all defensive team. He
did a wonderful job. Now, they did get 21 offensive rebounds. He's 6-8, we're
probably lying there. The big fella is much bigger than that. But he just does
a wonderful job. You can see his engineering degree all the time. He works
angles that probably other opponents don't know he's working at.  
  
Q. Coach, Rick talked a little bit about Nik has improved dramatically since
his freshman year. What areas do you see the improvement? Would you include
the passing skills we saw today?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: He has the ball a lot more than he's had before because of
the fact we had Tim Hardaway and Trey Burke last year. So the ball was going
to be in their hands. Now -- but we do know he could pass a little bit. What
he's worked at is seeing the whole floor.  
I think there was one time last year on a ball screen early in the year he had
thrown the ball -- he had shot it or thrown the ball to the roll man like 95
percent of the time. He wasn't seeing the corners, so people keyed on that.
Now the game has slowed down and he has a great ability to see the floor and
he's unselfish.  
  
Q. John, you guys got on the run last year all the way to the National
Championship game. When you look at this team and the way it's come together
and a where your right now, do you see similarities? Is there a comparison you
can draw?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: It is tough to ever make comparisons between teams.
Thirty-seven teams that I cherish. It's tough to do that. What I do like about
this team is they've never lost two in a row. They've been resilient. They get
better both in victory and defeat and they have -- it depends on a lot of
draws and lot of luck and a lot of things, but this team has an attitude that
is similar to that team about just, you know, picking themselves up when
things don't go well.  
And like Glenn Robinson, Jordan Morgan, they've been making big plays all year
long. Spike Albrecht had a huge shot. There's another guy ready to step up all
the time. That's where the similarities are.  
  
Q. You got some really good looks in the middle of their zone that didn't
go, short ones. Those are probably the looks you want?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: When they went zone, we really felt good about our zone
offense. Then they started following cutters through in zone offense. There's
basically half man, half zone, figuring it out right. We had to run more man
stuff against them because they're really matching up with us.  
So we had a couple nice shots, and neither of them went in, and it didn't
bother us a little bit, but as their zone got more accustomed to what we were
doing, there was a challenge there for a little bit. And Nik hit a huge three
and then Glenn's two plays when it was a six-point game, that's five times now
Glenn Robinson, the game was sort of going the other way and Glenn fixes it.
That was tremendous time for him to step up.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach?  
  
Q. Just the culture. Two Sweet 16s in a row. How proud are you of that?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I'm really proud of it. We've had a lot of help. It's not
just our coaching staff and the team. We've had great help from the
university, from the president all the way down. We've had great support from
our athletic administration, Dave Brandon, et cetera.  
When we came to Michigan, this is what I envisioned it could be, and compete
for the Big Ten Championship, and you do that, the Big Ten is going to be
really strong. You compete for the Big Ten Championship, you can compete at
this level like we did today.  
  
Q. I'm guessing 700 doesn't mean a whole lot to you?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I didn't even know it until I was presented the ball
today. It's a lot of games, counting junior college wins, which I think are
harder to get than some of these wins at the same time, but it means, as most
coaches will say, we've had a lot of good players and great staff and support
and means I'm coaching a long time as well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Congratulations, good luck.  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Thank you.

_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  

Michigan  79  
Texas - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Barnes will make his opening remarks, and thank you for
your time. Isaiah Taylor, 22 points, five assists; John Holmes, 9 points, 9
rebounds; Martez Walker, 14 points, 7 rebounds. Coach.  
COACH RICK BARNES: I'm really proud of my team. We missed a lot of shots
early. Really got the tempo where away wanted it. I told -- I kept telling our
guys, we keep getting those shots, I told them right up to the last, I guess
minute, two minutes, that I thought we would win the game. We missed a lot of
close-in shots, getting rebounds as well, obviously, in the first half, but
second half, you know, we wanted to get it at on the boards.  
Second half we shot the ball great. Some of them in the first half were shots
we knew they might make. We had some breakdowns when they got the open 3s,
that was really from a couple breakdowns defensively.  
People are going to talk about the 3s. Again, that's not why we lost the game
was their 3s, because that's what they do. We had it to six a couple times and
played some pretty good defense and didn't come up with a couple loose balls
that we have to come up with. We started the half really -- we knew we were
going the play some zone and felt like we had to do something to change it and
we were effective enough in the second half defensively. We just didn't finish
some of those plays that really could have put a little more pressure on them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Coach, offensive rebounds kind of kept you guys in the game. Was that a
point of emphasis especially with the way were you shooting or something you
guys have been particularly good at?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Again, we told our guys again early we're going to get
shots. We were able to get some good shots, but we wanted to rebound it and we
can rebound the ball. We didn't do as good enough job in the first half. But
yeah, that's what we do and -- but again, we -- when you have 21 offensive
rebounds, you should shoot better than 37 percent. We missed a boatload of
shots right around the rim.  
  
Q. As far as Cam, Cam didn't have his normal really good game. Do you feel
like maybe he got gassed during that long time without the play stoppage in
the first half? Did you wish maybe you had called a timeout in there?  
COACH RICK BARNES: No. We felt -- when you're playing against a three-point
shooting team, we feel if we can push it and go at it and, you know, make that
part of our game plan, I think our players will tell you they know we want to
run. We do. But at that point in time, again when you go back, they were going
to make us shoot the ball. That's what I told our team. If they're trying to
make us shoot jump shots inside their defense, we'll get what we want. We got
to go get it.  
Plus, Cam is a big part of what we do. We also, you know, he gets tired, I
thought Prince, Jon, Connor, it goes back really and truly some of the loose
ball rebounds we had chances to come up with it, and we put ours it's right
there. I really felt we get it under six with the way we fought back. We had
chances twice to do that and didn't do it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please. Coach will be here
afterwards.  
  
Q. Martez, you talk about the period right after the second half started
when you guys made your run. Did you feel like you guys had gotten back into
it? Did you feel like you provided something during that time?  
MARTEZ WALKER: Yes. I felt like it was a team effort thing. Isaiah and the
rest of them guys, we just came together, trying to pull it through. Like
Coach was saying, we had to get it under six and we was right there, and like
he said, we missed a couple shots that we should have made, and that's it,
really.  
  
Q. Isaiah, what do you feel like going to the 1-3-1 zone to frustrate
Michigan a little bit?  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: I just felt like on the zone we had to be aggressive, just
attack the elbows and also look for our big guys inside. The 1-3-1, it
probably stole a couple possessions, but we attacked it well.  
  
Q. Jonathan?  
JONATHAN HOLMES: Our 2-3 extended -- we just wanted to slow them defense and
put pressure in the backcourt, just steal a couple possessions. We wanted to
take away the three-point shooters, also, but they put a person in the high
post and brought the big men out to the perimeter to offset our zone, and they
actually hit a couple 3s when we were just itching off the game where we got
to eight, they might hit a three. We got to six, they might hit a three.  
  
Q. Jonathan, that early part of the game when it went on forever without a
stoppage, were you guys gassed at that point and were you a little bit
overwhelmed by how they started the game?  
JONATHAN HOLMES: I don't think we were overwhelmed. I think we got a little
bit gassed because we're not used the playing that. We were playing our tempo.
We're used to that. We weren't overwhelmed. They came out doing what they
wanted to do. We came out at the beginning doing what we wanted to do
somewhat, so it was -- I thought we started decent.  
  
Q. Martez, you got a lot of extended playing time. I was curious what the
confidence in your offensive game was tonight and leading forward to next
year?  
MARTEZ WALKER: Like Coach been telling me, not to hesitate. I try to make
shots and just go after offensive rebound because I know that Michigan, they
can't box out like that. I just try to run to the rebounds and get what I can
get there and just play a better defense that I can for us to win.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Jonathan, did you feel like y'all's height advantage inside would have
been a bigger factor in this game? Do you feel you weren't able to maximize
that?  
JONATHAN HOLMES: Yes. I think we passed up Cam more than we should have. I
think we attacked the offensive glass. I think we had to realize that Cam was
down there and he's a force and we could have used him more tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: With that, we'll let the student-athletes go. Thank you.
Questions for Coach Barnes.  
  
Q. Coach, the fast start that Michigan got off to, did you guys have any
residue from the emotion the other night or just a matter of Michigan's
tournament experience sort of taking over in that first part of the game?  
COACH RICK BARNES: No. They made some 3s. We had some great looks inside. I
mean, we knew we were going in there. We missed really some shots that you
want to make, but again when you breakdown all that, the turnovers that we
had, I mean, they get 15 points off our turnovers. And right there -- there
was no reason that we had to turn it over.  
But, again some of them, they were self-inflicted. But, again, the pace and
the shot, I was telling the coaches, I told the team after that long stoppage,
we're going to continue to get those shots, we make those shots, we're going
to win this game. I really felt like that. You look at the second half, they
shot 34 percent in the second half. That's a team that shoots, what, 45, 46,
whatever percent.  
So defensively in the second half it was good enough, but -- and that's with
us giving up two, three rebounds when we had played great defense where they
got some stick backs.  
And so I know defensively in the second half we were good enough, but when we
got it down to six, we didn't make a couple plays that we needed to make on
offense. But, it goes back again, the nine turnovers, I don't think we had --
we came down in transition, Isaiah a couple times, we know he pushes it. Took
a couple tough shots in transition when we were really trying to go at it and
trying to get to the free throw line.  
But, overall, the shots early in the game that we missed, I don't care how hot
they come out making shots, we had the ball where we wanted it. We didn't
finish some shots, and that's what got us down. And even with all that said,
we fall back, and then if we would have finished just three possessions on the
defensive end, it -- who knows what might have happened.  
  
Q. Javan obviously his shot wasn't falling and you stuck with Martez Walker.
Was that because you felt like maybe he was giving you two way player both
ends more than Javan?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Size. Really a two, three. We extended it, and I thought
our players made a few really nice adjustments. We had talked -- we planned on
playing zone and we went through a few times, but we also a few times we
weren't in sync in terms of what we needed to do. They're going the make some
shots and score some points.  
It will go back in the second half to those three possessions that are vivid
in my mind where we just gave up. We got the shot we wanted, and we gave up --
really it was a loose ball. It's not like they beat us on the glass. It was
there we just didn't -- and something had to do with the fact we extended out
to the three-point line. We've got to run those down. That's where you've got
to finish those plays.  
  
Q. Rick, times when Cam did get the ball down, he wasn't his usual self how
he was finishing. He walked to the locker room there for awhile. Was he okay
or a little bit off?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Again, I think he's okay. Somebody asked me at the halftime
about his back. Cam never complained. He wants to play and such a competitive
person. Again, we knew that that's -- that's why it was so important that some
of those shots we took early, that we needed to knockdown and give him some
room in there. We knew we could penetrate on them. We knew that.  
Like I said, in the first half defensively they -- that's what they do. Again,
our offense is what got us down in the first half. They're capable of scoring
43 points, but again, if I could go back, again, we had a lot of closing shots
that you got to make, and we didn't do it. But I'm proud of these guys because
they kept fighting, and we'll learn some things. Like Isaiah on the
intentional foul at the end, couple times we didn't have to foul when we were
double-teaming because they definitely didn't like that, and -- but we brought
them out a little bit by fouling in the trap, which we didn't have to do.  
But this group has done some great things, and I'm really proud of them.
Again, there's no doubt we thought we could win this game. If we turned around
and played again tomorrow, I'd think the same thing. The team I have is good
enough to do that. Today, they were a better team and beat us.  
  
Q. Rick, you mentioned how talented a shooting team Michigan is. When you
look at them, how far do you think they can run in this tournament?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Again, I'm going to say this: I don't think 14 3s is what
beat us. I think if you go back to the points off turnovers and some of those
stick backs, that's what beat us. I think perfect example of that was I think
Duke hit 14 3s the other day.  
We told our team for every three they hit, we wanted two offensive rebounds.
That's what we do, that's what they do. It wasn't the 14 3s that beat us, it
wasn't. It was not finishing a couple times defensively and the shots in close
that we didn't get to go down. How far can they go? You know, who knows about
anybody? I don't know. I have no idea. I think that you look at their records.
They're obviously an outstanding team.  
Jon does a great job, but, you know, again, 14 3s can win a lot of games, but
we told our guys, if they're making 14 3s, what we can't do is not rebound the
way we want to and we can't have the nine turnovers that we had right there
because when you're playing against a team and that's a great equalizer, but
second half we got more aggressive and got to the free throw line. We didn't
finish defensively. I look at the fact that they shot 34 percent in the second
half, and it could have been lower than that if we had come up with those
three possessions in my mind.  
  
Q. Two-prong question, Rick. One, on the going to the zone, was it just to
throw something different at them or extend it and make them look for that mid
range jumper?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Yeah. They come inside and we're going to go at it. Yeah,
we were going to make them play inside the three-point line and we would like
to have done it a little bit earlier, but we didn't, because in trying to
think -- you know, we want the stay with what we're doing and what we've done
most of the year. We got big and, yeah, we wanted -- we're going to run them
off the line.  
Those scramble situations, the offensive rebounds, when you think about it
where they picked up, kicked out for I think one or two of them, but a big
play was when we, I think we had a block and -- on the baseline, they lost of
it on the baseline away from their bench and right there in the middle and we
didn't react to it. They picked it up and dunked the ball. That was a huge
play right there.  
  
Q. What do you feel like the best thing you did with the program this
year?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I told them what I appreciate what they've done, put our
program back where we should be. I mean, you go back, I can assure you this:
We were picked to finish eighth in the Big 12 this year. We won't be picked to
finish eighth in the Big 12 next year. I'm sure we'll come out -- I told them
what's going to be fun for you guys a year from now, you're going to
understand what it's really like with the, what the Texas program has been
built on, and the fact that next year we will be hunted.  
And that's the way we've always liked it, and that's what I really appreciate
these guys. I know they've worked hard. As a staff, we've expected a lot from
them. They've responded. And the one thing they have a lot to be excited
about, and they're very disappointed. They were hurt because they thought that
we could win this game.  
And I think they still think that and they should. There's something about
this group of guys that all year they've believed in themselves. It started a
year ago with the older guys the sophomores and Jon coming back. I expect
these guys to get better, but they put us back where we need to be and it's
going to be fun to watch these guys continue to grow.  
  
Q. Rick, when Stauskas is creating for others as well as looking for his own
thing, how much stress does that put on a defense, how much more difficult
does that make them?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, it does, obviously. I would have liked -- we know
he's the guy going to hang out a little bit own defense. You want to make him
defend if you can. We got him up top once, I know, and Isaiah went by him, but
he's a terrific player. You're not the Big Ten Player of the Year, and he's
one, he's improved a great, deal which you have to admire as a coach, his
freshman year to his sophomore year, you have to admire that. But what most
impressed with is the fact that you look at what he did, he was eight assists,
no turnovers. There's another, whatever, 38 minutes.  
Again, he can shoot the three and -- but the fact -- eight assists, no
turnovers is impressive. And that's where I think he's improved his game. He's
more of an all-around-type player. And we could say, we can always look and
think about whether or not you double-team on the ball screens. We were trying
to play a couple different ways. We sometimes didn't get the coverage we
wanted. They're an excellent offensive team. They know what they do, they have
the reads out of it.  
I do think -- I don't know, they played against a zone a lot this year, but we
got what we wanted in the second half in terms from our defense other than
those -- the ones we didn't finish.  
But they're an outstanding team, and you got to love the efficiency that they
play with. And again, you ask me, they're as good as anybody and they're
capable of winning the National Championship as much as any other team that I
can guarantee goes to the Sweet 16.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you.  
COACH RICK BARNES: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS:
MILWAUKEE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+MILWAUKEE)

  

## March 22, 2014

  

### [Dana Altman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20487)

### [Johnathan Loyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25072)

### [Mike Moser](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23394)

  
_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  

Wisconsin  85  
Oregon - 77

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have an opening statement from Oregon Coach, Dana Altman,
and questions for Oregon student-athletes, Mike Moser and Johnathan Loyd.
Actually, we'll start right away with the questions for the student-athletes,
please.  
  
Q. For Johnathan or Mike, I mean, this is simply, what happened in the
second half compared to the first?  
MIKE MOSER: We didn't get stops and we didn't rebound. Simple as that.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes? While you maybe think
of some of those, we'll hear from an opening remark from Head Coach, Dana
Altman. Coach.  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: Well, it was a really disappointing loss. We played pretty
well the first half, had pretty good control of the game right before the
half. Didn't finish the half as well as we needed to, and then we started the
second half very poorly. Gave up a lot of easy baskets, which really got the
crowd in the game and the momentum switched there pretty quick.  
So, kind of boiled down to us not getting stops that we needed to and then
with the one-point lead late, the inability to get a big rebound. Rebounds
were close at half, and we got out rebounded in the second half. So, our
inability to get stops, to start the second half and then definitely we didn't
get a rebound there to finish the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Johnathan, when they go 70, 75, it looked like a couple guys you had guys
in position and were almost fighting yourselves. What was your take on those
possessions and seemed like kind of the effort was there, couldn't get your
hands on one?  
JOHNATHAN LOYD: I didn't come up with the ball. I should have grabbed the
rebound and I didn't. So, it's on me.  
  
Q. Johnathan or Mike, did you kind of think Wisconsin would come out as
aggressive as they did in the second half? Seems like they really came out
punching to start the second half.  
MIKE MOSER: Yeah, we definitely knew they were going to make a run. We thought
we were going to handle it better.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Mike or Johnathan? Thank you, guys. Questions
for Coach Altman, please.  
  
Q. Coach, same question for you that I asked the players, expect what did
you expect Wisconsin to do to start the second half?  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: Well, they're a veteran team with a veteran coach. You
know, had the crowd excited at the end of the half there. So I knew that, you
know, they would come out, and we talked about it at halftime, that they would
be really emotional to start the second half and we had to do a good job. We
just didn't get the stops. You know, they got easy baskets there and our
energy that we played with in the first half, we just didn't get those stops.
Then when we finally kind of got the ship righted and got back on course, took
the lead there late, Joe gets the three and we take a one-point lead, and then
we just couldn't get the rebounds.  
So, as most games against good opponents do, they come down to getting some
stops and some rebounds and, you know, we didn't get it done. And it started,
like I said, we didn't finish the first half very well. Thought we had a
chance to go up a few more. Didn't get a rebound there and didn't get stops
and then start of the second half, you know, they really came out swinging.  
  
Q. You've been involved in a number of NCAA games, can you speak to the
crowd in terms of how loud or one sided? Have you ever experienced anything
like it in an NCAA Tournament game as a coach?  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: You know, not like this. You know, in 2002 we played
Illinois in the United Center, but the game, the crowd wasn't nearly as vocal
as this one. You know, like I said earlier, Wisconsin earned, you know, the
opportunity with a No. 2 seed.  
But, you know, it was a great crowd for them and, you know, they really got
into it, you know, on both ends. They were very vocal.  
  
Q. With that in mind, did you kind of feel that maybe you had less wiggle
room to make an error in case there was some kind lapse at the start of the
second half because the crowd was so one sided?  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: Sure. Once that momentum swung, we were in trouble. They
started hitting some 3s and getting easy baskets inside. Our defense effort
was just not good, and those easy baskets fueled their energy and then we're
in big trouble.  
I was proud of the guys for getting back under control and, you know, fighting
back and taking the lead there. But we just could not get a big rebound there.  
  
Q. Dana, Kaminsky in particular seemed to really give you guys some trouble
there. Can you talk a little bit about his role today?  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: Well, you know, the start of the second half there, they
got it in deep, and, you know, we just didn't do a good job. One time we
didn't rotate on a pick and roll. Other times we settled behind and he caught
it deep. I wish there was more to it. We just didn't do a good job guarding
him. He's a good offensive player when he gets it that deep and we're in
trouble. So, we did a poor job.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach?  
  
Q. How impressive was Joseph's shooting, given the Wisconsin defensive
reputation and the attention he got in the game?  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: Joe has had games like that for us before, you know, where
he gets it going. He's a good offensive player and thought he played really
well. You know, we didn't move the ball like we needed to, and we probably got
too stagnant in a number of spots. You know, we had some shots that we usually
finish, you know, that we just didn't finish, and that's part of the
tournament.  
You know, you play hard, you want to win, you get a little tight and miss some
shots that you normally hit, you know, and when they got the momentum swung
the other way, you know, we didn't play as loose and as free as we needed to.  
THE MODERATOR: Last call for Coach. Thank you Coach.

_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Student-athletes, Nigel Hayes, Sam Dekker, and Traevon Jackson.
Thank you for joining us. Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Guys, you and Oregon had remarkably similar seasons. Rough spot in
January and then recovering really well. Can you break down some of the
breakdowns when you hit the skids and what you did well to rally and get back
on track?  
SAM DEKKER: I mean, that's what -- when I saw on the scouting report they won
the first 13 and lost of eight of ten, kind really took me -- started to see
-- made a lot of similarities. The things they did to get back and just by
playing hard and getting back to what they're doing best. Very talented team
they have. They're a matchup nightmare for a lot of teams. We got to do what
we do, and our coaches do a great job of preparing us. They're a team that
plays hard and smart and plays aggressive. We have to handle that.  
  
Q. What about you guys, what were the breakdowns for you guys in January?  
SAM DEKKER: I think defensively we got away from doing what we do best. Our
defense translated so well into our offense. We were playing well and getting
stops on D and make sure our offense is a little more uptempo and stuff like
that. When we can do things like that and stay focused, we're a much better
team.  
  
Q. Sam, the teams tried to run on you guys this year, and what's been the
outcome of that if they have?  
SAM DEKKER: Well, there's been goods and bads for our team against it.
Sometimes we don't do a good job in transition and we give up too many easy
things, and other times we've been able to stop them. So I don't think we have
to worry about one thing in particularly too much. We got to do what we do
best, because there's teams in our conference that run, teams in our
conference that slow it down. We played against all types of different paces.
This is another team that's just a little more uptempo, and we got to be able
to handle it.  
  
Q. Nigel, last night Oregon had 36 points in the paint. It's been a bone of
contention for you guys this season. Just talk about defending the paint
against the Ducks.  
NIGEL HAYES: They're a team that likes to drive the lane. They have big guys
down there as well. We have to not let them establish post presence. Once it
happens, it forces the guards to help. That will put us in a quandary with
them trying to help down and kick out and defending it. We have to make sure
we guard that pretty well.  
  
Q. Traevon, I was wondering, how much of a challenge is it going to be to
get the ball inside to your big guys with Oregon's lane and speed? Is that
going to be one of the challenges?  
TRAEVON JACKSON: Yeah, I think everybody does a pretty good job of pressuring
the ball and getting the ball into the post. That's something we have to
stress is just doing what we want to do regardless of how they play, and we
got to make adjustments throughout the game, and, you know, whatever is to our
benefit we have to do.  
  
Q. Sam, when you face a team that doesn't have another seven-footer or 6-11
guy, got a guy like Frank, how much do you encourage him to go down in the
post or how much is related to what your game plan is for that game?  
SAM DEKKER: We like going to Frank, obviously. He's first team all Big Ten
performer, so you want to get your best players touches. Frank is another guy
we're comfortable going to, no matter who is on court, whether it's seven-
footer or, you know, tallest guy is 6-5. Doesn't matter. We want to go to
Frank a lot of times. When he's playing well inside and scoring buckets and
finding open guys, just opens up the court for our prolific outside shooters
that we have.  
So a lot of times when we see Frank inside, I think he does some things that
some other guys can't do. When he gets going, we're a much better team.  
  
Q. Sam, are you familiar with Elgin Cook from AAU days, anything like
that?  
SAM DEKKER: Yeah. I've seen him play a lot of times, growing up 45 minutes
from each other. We were in a lot of the same gyms growing up, AAU stuff and
travel teams. I always loved watching him play because he's so athletic and
such a good player in the city of Milwaukee, really respected in our state.  
So, I don't really know him on a personal level, but I've seen him play
multiple times and he's a guy I enjoyed seeing play.  
  
Q. Nigel, Sam, and Traevon, can you kind of take yourselves away from what
you're concentrating on the Oregon game, that sort of thing, and just watch
the tournament as fans, do you enjoy those upsets that happened like
particularly today Mercer and Duke and the ones yesterday?  
NIGEL HAYES: I personally fear upsets because of us being a 2 seed (laughter).
That's something I don't want to think about too much. As far as that goes, we
have to make sure we come out every game and take care of business.  
SAM DEKKER: We were talking last night. It was the North Dakota State game,
and we know some guys at North Dakota State and watching that game. We were
saying, you know, lot of these games during the season, there's no way these
would all go to overtime. We said no way these all go down to the last
possession, but it's just what happens in March. The teams don't want to go
down, they don't want to lose. And everything just gets turned up to another
level, and teams fight to the end, and they're always going to be close games.
Always going to be games when you're wondering what's going on. Once you get
on the court, you throw the seeds aside.  
TRAEVON JACKSON: The seeds really go after everyone. The talent is so spread
out from high Division I to low Division I. It doesn't matter. So many guys
are talented. You see any team can be beat on any given night. And regardless
of who is a better team throughout the season, it's who is better on that
night. That's the focus that we have to -- we've been trying to develop as a
team, and you have to come with that up right now in this tournament.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, during the season a good deal was made about
Wisconsin getting a high enough seed to end up in Milwaukee. First part, was
that a goal to end up here? And secondly, once you've gotten here, is there
truly a home court advantage of playing in Milwaukee, or does it really not
make a difference at this point?  
TRAEVON JACKSON: I think that, you know, our goal was, you know, to be as best
as we can be, and we came up little bit short. But I think with our body of
work during the season, we're pretty satisfied with being in Milwaukee. And
it's good to have our fans here, to be somewhat close to home. But, you know,
still at the end of the day, we're still on the road.  
We want to treat it as a road game, just because we don't like being too
comfortable in terms of thinking that all our fans are here so it's going to
be easier. It's not going to be easier at all. You know, we still got to play
basketball. You know, the court is still there. The fans don't shoot the ball,
we do. We're the ones who shoot and pass and dribble. We still got to handle
business on the court.  
  
Q. This is for any of the three of you or all three of you. After your game
was over yesterday, did you spend a lot of time, did you come out and watch
Oregon? Did you get a personal scouting report, or do you just rely on seeing
what you see on film and in the scouting report?  
SAM DEKKER: No. We didn't go back up and watch. We want to get back to the
hotel, just relax. I watched some of the game right after that, but I didn't
look too much into things last night. I just wanted to relax and enjoy the
games.  
This morning it goes into full effect, scout mode and worrying about the
Ducks. Yesterday I didn't think about it too much right after the game, just
wanted to relax a little bit. Just play the game, mentally and physically worn
down. Today is fully go time.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? Traevon, Sam,
Nigel, thank you.  
NIGEL HAYES: Thank you, everyone.  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome Wisconsin Coach, Bo Ryan. Coach, maybe some
opening thoughts about facing Oregon tomorrow, and then we'll open it up for
questions, please.  
COACH BO RYAN: Well, just did a radio interview and I threw out the question
of, has anybody ever faced two more opposite teams in back-to-back games in
the NCAA Tournament?  
So, first thing I threw out is a hint, was who did Princeton and Georgetown --
who did Georgetown play after they played Princeton? Anybody know? Anybody
look it up already?  
Somebody went -- it was no Notre Dame, but it wasn't a Notre Dame. It was
Kelly Tripucka was back there. Wasn't Notre Dame that really ran up and down.
I think our team might be the biggest contrast in preparation. I'll just throw
it out there until somebody finds two other teams in back-to-back games
(laughter). That's my opening statement.  
We have to face a team that gets it up and down, they can score in half court,
they can score in full court. They put a lot of pressure on you. Very
athletic. Dana has done a heck of a job with them. That's our task.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Questions.  
  
Q. Bo, a little bit off topic. I was just wondering if you were able to
enjoy the reaction to that game last night?  
COACH BO RYAN: Those are bison horns, so people know. I had to answer that
question. Some of my guys. Yeah, I texted, talked with my son, Will, who is
one of the assistants for North Dakota State and Saul Phillips, who played for
me at Platteville, for those who don't know, and who coached with me at
Milwaukee and Madison.  
My wife was just -- she was the one that gets really nervous watching the
game. I could just tell I was watching Oregon and Arizona on my DVD player and
listening to my wife's comments, and I could tell what was happening with the
North Dakota State game. Yeah, we were pretty excited.  
  
Q. Bo, do you get a chance, because you played your early game yesterday, to
actually watch a little bit of Oregon? Or do you have obligations and you just
stick to your film watching?  
COACH BO RYAN: Oh, no, we have an assistant that's watched 20-some of their
games and I've watched about seven. Watched some more tonight, watch some
tomorrow. We're always looking for something. But, you know, you're not going
to change much at this time of the year. It's points of emphasis, bullet
points that you make when you're talking to the players.  
We just finished a practice where we went over, you know, their tendencies and
more importantly things that we need to do, things that we have more control
over.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned watching the Arizona game. Are there other games of
theirs that you feel like stylistically will help you prepare, the same token,
the way they get up and down, is there somebody you faced this year that you
can fall back on in preparation a little bit?  
COACH BO RYAN: Each Coach is different and each personality of the teams are
different. You can see some tendencies of maybe certain teams. Illinois played
them earlier in the year in December. Saw that game. UCLA, Oregon State,
Washington. Just saw a lot of those. And, you know, they have a way they want
to play.  
And if they can do that, especially the way they started out, they were kind
of like us, a hot start, maybe a rough spot, and you catch fire a little bit.
Just seems the way college basketball is nowadays, other than maybe a very
small minority of teams.  
  
So, yeah, we get a little bit of info from every game.  
  
Q. Bo, with you now being one of the godfathers of college basketball, 700
wins and all that, you've got a coaching tree out there now with Rob and Saul
and those guys, how much pleasure do you take this time of the year when you
see guys have success with that?  
COACH BO RYAN: How did you know I got into the olive oil business? (Laughter).
I don't explain them.  
You know what, it's nice to have lasted this long. It's hard in this
profession. I don't know if anybody told the media, but winning is hard,
surviving is hard, but it's a labor of love. It's what you choose to do. And
as I said before in a question that was asked about getting in the profession,
mine was as a teacher first and I was hired as a teacher and given the
basketball job at a junior high school.  
So I'm really happy where I am in this profession, because it's still all
about teaching and coaching. And to have guys that either played for you,
coached with you, worked with you, worked at your camps, did this or that, to
see them out in the profession now doing things, that's pretty neat. That's
really fun to see.  
  
Q. Since the beginning when you started going to the tournament and you
played these Thursday, Saturday games and Sunday games, has your approach
changed at all in terms of what you learned over the years and how to prepare
the team? Do the legs get tired after a game like yesterday, or have you
changed anything over the years?  
COACH BO RYAN: Just think back to when you have three practices to prepare for
a team. You usually get three maximum for 90 percent of the season.  
So, we have a number of possessions that we use the day before a game. So what
we did today was the number of possessions that we do the day before the game
is less than what it is two, three days before the game. But you still get
some shooting in, you still do that.  
And also there's -- we don't stand around a lot, but there's more stoppages in
play to make a point about the other team, this is what they're going to do in
this situation, this is their out of bounds, this is their full court
pressure, this is what they do on free throws.  
So, it's not as much on the legs on a day like today. But you still -- I've
never -- people talk about walk-thrus. Never had a walk-thru in 42 years
because you don't walk-thru. Every time you run a possession, you never go
half speed. That's when people get hurt. That's when things, you know, the
guys start to not pay attention as much.  
So, we always do everything at game speed. It's just we stop the action and
then go back and everything is done as quickly and as game speed like as we
can.  
  
Q. Coach, Andy Glockner of Sports Illustrated suggested that UNVL versus
Ball State and Loyola Marymount in --  
COACH BO RYAN: That's not a contrast. Ball State ran it up and down.  
  
Q. Said the score was 62-60. The next one was in the 90s or 100s. Something
to think about.  
COACH BO RYAN: Who was at Ball State then? Rick? Ray? What year?  
  
Q. 1990.  
COACH BO RYAN: Ray McCallum, Rick Majerus.  
THE MODERATOR: I would think Rick. Not official.  
COACH BO RYAN: Dennis isn't going on the record. You can go on the record.
Okay. At least we got a contender out there. 1990.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about your familiarity with Elgin Cook and him being
a Milwaukee native and seeing him play in his youth and now at Oregon?  
COACH BO RYAN: I'm happy for a young man that can go the route he did, be able
to compete, work towards a college degree on this level. Every player from
Milwaukee, Wausau, Madison, anybody from the state that gets a chance to go on
and further their education, I'm all for them. He's another example of that.  
  
Q. Bo, if we get back to Saul Phillips for a second. When he played and
worked for you, was there something about his basketball IQ or work ethic that
made you think he might eventually be a pretty good head Coach.  
COACH BO RYAN: When I saw him play in high school at Reedsburg, which ended up
being a hot bed for us at Platteville and then at Madison, it was UWM, Clayton
Hanson asked out of his scholarship at UWM when I took the job at Wisconsin,
but when I saw him in Reedsburg, always hustled, good leader, and I understand
recently he told the story of because he always -- I always said he was one
injury away from being a starting point guard on an undefeated game of 31-0 in
1995. He says it's more like the whole bus having an accident away from being
the point guard, but I try to humor him as much as I can.  
He told the story, I guess, about -- we were playing somewhere. Must have had
a lot of his family there, whatever, they started chanting, "We want Saul, we
want Saul."  
So "Saul, come here."  
Saul starts taking off his warmups. He comes running over.  
"Saul, you see those people up there who are yelling? Go up there and see what
they want (laughter).  
So he did. Saul, he's pretty -- his wit doesn't compare. I don't know if
anybody's wit compares to his. He enjoys doing what he's doing. He always
tells people, "Hey, I could be running my dad's hardware store now. Look, I'm
doing this. This is a lot of fun."  
You've heard all those. He was always a hard worker, smart, great personality.
I'm glad my son is with him. My son is learning a lot with him.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you. Good luck tomorrow.  
COACH BO RYAN: All right. Thanks.

_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome Michigan student-athletes, Jordan Morgan, Caris
LeVert, and Derrick Walton, Jr. Questions, please.  
  
Q. Jordan, what do you think when you look at the challenges that Texas
presents inside with Ridley and Holmes?  
JORDAN MORGAN: I think it's just the whole front line in general, a lot of
length. Something we're not necessarily used to seeing. I think there's some
size in the Big Ten, but, you know, especially at the power forward position,
you see a lot of teams that we played against kind of go smaller. So it will
present some challenges for us, especially boxing out. I think they average 15
rebounds a game. It will be a big focus to try to keep them off the glass.  
  
Q. Jordan, could you just talk about just the bulk and the size of Ridley
and have you played against any guy like him this year and the problems that
presents for you?  
JORDAN MORGAN: Yeah. He's really long. So, I mean, we've had some players, you
know, close, but I don't know, AJ Hammons, Adreian Payne, and those players
with a lot of length down there, but I don't know if it's the same. I haven't
really stood next to him, so I don't really know.  
  
Q. For Caris or Derrick, when it comes to their backcourt, basically the
same question. What do you see when you look at their players that you guys
might be lined up against in the backcourt?  
CARIS LEVERT: Two guards, they pass the ball really well and attack well in
transition. They shoot the ball pretty well. That will be a good matchup for
Derrick and I going forward.  
THE MODERATOR: Derrick, take a whack at that as well.  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: Like Caris said, they really got a good backcourt, so me
and Caris are up for the challenge.  
  
Q. Jordan, all season long, everywhere we went, we had to hear coaches and
players talk about, oh, how great the Big 12 is, you know, No. 1 RPI, all that
type of stuff. Tell us a little bit about what your take is on Big Ten
basketball. I'd like to hear from your guys about how good y'all feel y'all
do?  
JORDAN MORGAN: We feel it's the best league in the country. When you look at
top to bottom, there's no team -- when you're playing in the Big Ten
Conference, there's no game you can take easily from top to tomorrow. You see
teams win night in and night out. There's no game you take for granted. We
lost of at Indiana, who finished eighth in the league. And you just see teams
like Illinois finished ninth, win at Michigan State. There's no games you can
take for granted. This is a fight all year long. I mean, that's the nature of
it.  
  
Q. One of the most memorable matchups between Michigan and Texas in any
sport was the 2005 Rose Bowl. Do you guys have any memories of that game and
what that matchup was like?  
CARIS LEVERT: Was that Vince Young? Vince Young is one of my favorite players.
I remember that pretty well.  
JORDAN MORGAN: I've been a big Michigan football fan growing up, and so I
remember that as well.  
  
Q. Caris and Derrick again, Jordan talked about the importance of
rebounding. Obviously they have a lot of length and size. How important is it
for you guys to come and crash back for all the tipped balls and all the
scrambles that come when you have that many long players inside?  
CARIS LEVERT: It will be really important for us. Jordan, John, Glenn, and Zak
will be tied up all night boxing out the bigs, our 4s and 5s. Me and Derrick
need to get a lot of rebounds.  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: Jordan has a big task on his hand boxing out a guy with
that size and length. It's going to be point of focus for us guards to go in
there and clean up the rebounds.  
  
Q. Just for anyone, is it a little bit weird to have another Big Ten team
here and you don't get to play them in the building? Do you run into those
guys? Do you know them? Is it kind of strange for that?  
JORDAN MORGAN: We stay in the same hotel, so we see them almost every day. But
actually last year when we played in the first two rounds last year, we played
at The Palace and Michigan State was there as well. So it's something we kind
of get used to.  
  
Q. Derrick, when you see Texas beat Arizona State 87-85, is that the kind of
uptempo game that the guards that you dream about and hope it is tomorrow?  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: Texas doing a great job of playing up and down the floor.
Like I said, we're up for the challenge and going to try to limit them to no
points in transition as much as possible. That's kind of it.  
  
Q. Do you want that kind of game?  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: I guess so. You could say that.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. People have said yesterday and the first day of play, March Madness did
not disappoint with the upsets and whatnot. As y'all are here as a 2 seed and
you see the higher seeds falling one by one, how is that affecting your
confidence and is it even in your consciousness at all?  
CARIS LEVERT: We're trying to go out there every night and play to win and
play not to lose. We're just happy to be here. We're really excited and trying
to win the whole thing.  
THE MODERATOR: Jordan, Caris, Derrick, thank you. Next up will be John
Beilein, Michigan coach. Please welcome Michigan coach, John Beilein, and
we'll take your questions in a moment. Coach, first of all, facing a Texas
team off a very emotional buzzer-beating win last night, your comments on
that.  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I was watching the game back in the room. I watched the
first half and had no idea who we were going to play. I'm more familiar with
Arizona State because they have a former Big Ten player in there, a couple
kids we recruited. I had seen the big kid play during this summer in World
University games and learning about Texas all the way.  
So, I didn't know what to really feel until I watched video on Texas today,
and they are very talented team. You can see why they were able to beat -- Big
12 is a very strong conference this year. You can see why they had success.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions, please.  
  
Q. John, how concerned are you about their size inside?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Well, it is good size. They always have two and sometimes
three big guys there. So, since Mitch McGary was hurt way back when, we have
been playing really with big 6-6 three different positions, a six-foot guard
and then one 6-8 big man or maybe a 6-9. So they are going to out man us at
one of those positions.  
We've seen this a few times this year. I don't think we've seen the talent at
the four and the five that we're going to see in this particular game.  
So, concerned about it because the ball needs to bounce our way. We got to box
out and really do a good job, but I mean it. Sometimes you win games, that
ball goes off the rim and you are boxing out hard. With the ball straight up
over the rim, they'll be getting a lot of those no matter what we do. So you
got to be in position to be in position, but offensive put-backs are a
concern.  
  
Q. After your experience after the game last night, walking back to the
hotel, I'm wondering when you got back to the hotel did you play around with
the GPS on the Smart Phone or have someone show you that?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: No, because I still didn't have my phone. It was good.
Jason helped me out yesterday when I got lot of going to three, four blocks.
But I'm going blame the police officer with me, but thank you.  
  
Q. You told me you enjoy walking to the hotel after a game. What does that
do for you?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I just need fresh air after a game. You know, we spend the
whole day in the hotel, we spend the whole day in an auditorium. I did go out
once. There's something about -- I wouldn't probably -- I'd walk back either
way. There's something about after a game going outside, even if it's cold and
it's five, six blocks away, and I don't -- really not bothered at all. Good
for me to go out and walk and get fresh air.  
  
Q. John, did seeing Texas hit a buzzer-beater bring back any bad memories
for you?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: The one in Atlanta?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: There was two buzzer-beaters that year. It was the one
where I think LaMarcus Aldridge blocked Mike Gansey shot in Kansas City that
was -- but that Tucker or something scored at the other end. Then later on in
the year, Pittsnogle hits a three and within five seconds at the buzzer a half
court shot.  
So, yeah, Texas deserved those wins. They had a really talented team. Rick has
been a friend of mine for a long time. We'd like that ball to bounce a little
bit differently tomorrow.  
  
Q. John, some of these upsets around the NCAA Tournament are matchups
between high profile teams with players that are likely to stay one year or
two tops versus smaller schools that have four-year players.  
As a coach of a major program, how do you balance the pursuit of those one-
and-dones, so to speak, with the value of having players that are going stay
three, four years in your system?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Well, it's ironic you ask that, because we have lost three
in the last couple of years. I think a big difference is that that wasn't -- I
don't think that was the plan with any of them coming in, that they be gone in
one, two years. Maybe it was their plan, but it was probably not what others
thought would happen. The young men that we calls "pros at the prom." You
know, in high school you could tell they're going to be in the NBA.  
So, it's happened to us. You just got to keep going. And attrition is part of
college basketball, whether it's that way, whether it's transfers. You just
got to continue to recruit like you're going to need players the next year.  
And, for example, Wofford team, how would you like the see them in two years
after they guys have all been together?  
There's a distinct advantage, believe it nor not, to some people of the
smaller league that guys are coming there, yeah, they think they're going to
be in the NBA but after four years. Those teams play with juniors and seniors
are really difficult to play against.  
  
Q. Lots of talk obviously about Texas's size. I'm wondering how much more
importance that puts your guys shooting from the perimeter because of that and
more specifically how important it is that Nik Stauskas try to get his stroke
going early tomorrow?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I think anybody that we play really, that we have to
spread them out and we need to make shots from the outside. So, whether
they're bigger -- you take their perimeter players, they play small with the
one, two and three a lot of their minutes.  
So, they're still going to be into some guys. But it is important that we can
stretch people, we can penetrate. Love the way Glenn Robinson shot the ball
yesterday because he is a good shooter and his numbers may not reflect that.
He can shoot.  
So it's important that we just hit outside shots, but we have to have a
mixture. You just can't go into this game and say, okay, we're only going to
shoot from the outside. You certainly have to drive the ball as well, throw
the ball inside.  
  
Q. Coach, I apologize if this is a repeat, just got here. When a team like
Mercer beats Duke today, does that allow you to hammer home to your team that
on any given day that can happen? Because you always point out that the number
to the left of you does not matter at all.  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Oh, yeah. The whole time going into this game -- I'm
watching the NIT game where Princeton beats Tulane, where BU is beating
Illinois the whole game. There was another shocker right now -- Robert Morris
went to St. John's. Those are similar to these NCAA games.  
So, our kids were well aware of that going into our Wofford game, that it is
-- that anybody can beat anybody. They made a couple 3s last night and it
would have been a much tighter game.  
So the Mercer, while the brands are certainly different, the Mercer and Duke
-- you look at all the really good coaches out there, certainly Coach K is one
and Coach Boeheim and Coach Self. They've lost to Bucknell, lost to Lehigh,
lost to Vermont, lost to Richmond. They have lost those games because on any
given day, those schools can beat these schools and -- the larger school.
That's why everybody loves March.  
  
Q. John, you brought up Mitch McGary earlier. What's his status and also
what does he bring for you? I know he's on the bench all the time. You see him
there. Is he able to do anything physically yet? And then also what does he do
for your team just being around him?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: He's been terrific for our basketball team. We brought him
-- we just wanted him to concentrate on his rehab after his surgery. And so he
basically was on a rehab schedule that was involved in our -- during our
practice time. So that way he could attend study halls and do everything.  
He's been involved very little until the last couple of weeks. Last three
weeks he's been very involved in practice, just from a standpoint he takes
some charts, he watches it. He's made some suggestions to me in games about
the big men and what he's seeing. He's helping us maybe a little bit as
assistant coach, maybe as an honorary captain in games just to make -- keep
the team charged up.  
If anybody watched him last year, he's got a lot of enthusiasm both on the
court and on the bench. So he's been helpful.  
  
Q. Coach, at this point in the season, you could say a freshman is really no
longer a freshman anymore, but what do you make of the matchup you've got
between the two freshman points guards?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I didn't see Isaiah play in AAU or high school. I saw
Derrick play a lot. Just watching Isaiah right now, you can see he's another
great freshman point guard. These two young men will have great college
careers.  
When a coach gives the ball the a freshman and gives them that trust, forget
about how they play in games, they must see things in practice, the
intangibles that lead to success. They must be young men that go to class.
They must be young men that have good work habits, that earn that. No coach is
going to ever give that ball to a guy who hasn't earned it.  
And those two young men, that will be a great battle tomorrow because they're
really quality young point guards.  
  
Q. Coach, these guys average 15 offensive rebounds a game. Have you seen
your group come along in ways that have gotten better against giving them up
this year?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Yeah. Once again it will depend sometimes where the ball
bounces a little bit. I think we went and played Minnesota, it was getting 16
at one time. I think Purdue was getting 15 a game at one time.  
So, we have seen those type of teams. It's just -- I don't know if we have
seen a big guy get three and a half a game. That's a rare number. And then
Holmes is getting two and a half a game or something like that. They're just
really good at it. And we got to put a body on people and the ball, depends
where that ball bounces, because they are -- we're a good rebounding team and
they're a great rebounding team.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you and good luck.  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Thank you.

_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome to the stage Texas student-athletes, Isaiah
Taylor, Javan Felix, and Jonathan Holmes. Thank you for joining us and
questions, please, for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Johnathan, they've been playing a little bit smaller all year with Mitch
McGary out. Do you think you guys can take advantage of that inside
tomorrow?  
JONATHAN HOLMES: Definitely a point of emphasis going into the game. Just
getting the ball inside and attacking off the glass, trying to take advantage
of that. We know they're going to try to take advantage of our size, make that
a negative thing on them when they go on offense.  
THE MODERATOR: Maybe Isaiah and Javan, just talk about what you've seen today
as you prepare for Michigan.  
JAVAN FELIX: Michigan is not really a traditional team in transition because
they have four guys that can push it and whichever one of those guys gets the
rebound, you know, takes it. And so it's a point of emphasis for us to get
back on defense and try to get set and get matched up as quickly as possible
so that, you know, we can stop the advantage.  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: We know that Michigan is an athletic team, you know, from their
two to their four, they can shoot the ball, and anybody can lead the break. We
know we have to get back, and they're a team that likes to get a lot of fast
break points and penetrate and dish it for the open three. We got to watch out
for that.  
  
Q. How do you describe the emotional high of last night and how you rein
that in and get back to preparation mode and look ahead?  
JAVAN FELIX: Definitely felt good, you know, to get that win and especially
the way in which we got it. Definitely a big thing for Cam going into this
game. We know we're going to need him a lot. We know his confidence level is
there. It's something we can't be too happy about. We got to be hungry for
more. And I feel like me as well as my teammates, we all feel that way and we
just trying to get ready for it.  
  
Q. Isaiah, continuing, it's probably safe to say a lot of folks would say
you stopped being a freshman a long time ago. Has it dawned on you or does it
seem kind of special to you for you and Walton to be going up against each
other tomorrow and the fact that there's so many young guys on the floor on
both sides?  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: It's the first time I played against another freshman point
guard in a long time. But just going against another freshman point guard,
just a great opportunity for me, and we know that Michigan is going to come
out tough tomorrow. And, I mean, I have my guys behind me. So, we're looking
to get the win.  
  
Q. Johnathan, you guys have been asked a lot about the difference in the
atmosphere on the team between this year and last year. One thing that Coach
Barnes talked about the other day is how much more welcoming the returning
players were to the freshman like Isaiah and some of the other guys. Why is
that so important to you and why did you guys really make an effort to turn
that particular part of the atmosphere around?  
JONATHAN HOLMES: I think by doing that you build relationships and you build
trust with one another. And that's a key thing with building a successful
team, knowing that your teammate has your back and knowing that you can trust
your teammate. And the thing about doing that, we've gotten really close, the
whole team.  
  
Q. Guys, Arizona State was able to be effective on the perimeter, they made
four threes. What do y'all want to do differently against Michigan knowing
they live and die by the three?  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: I think we just want to play the pick and roll better, getting
over or under the screens, how we play it and just stay in front of the ball
and not let the guards and the wings, that they have an opportunity to kick it
out for people to hit shots.  
  
Q. Lot of games in a short amount time. Does last night's win, very
emotional, does that give you more energy going forward instead of blowing out
a team like Arizona State?  
JONATHAN HOLMES: I mean, I think just getting a win in the tournament provides
energy for you. I mean, going back to last night, I mean, it was a good way to
start the tournament off. It was a good win for us. We got to put that behind
us. We got to -- we've got a tough Michigan team we're playing tomorrow.
That's the focus, that's where our minds are at.  
  
Q. Javan, you were asked quite a bit about the quote/unquote shooting slump
or whatever. Come out last night, you knocked down two shots real quick and,
of course, the foul difficulty happens. The difficulty of the fouls when it
looked like you had your shot falling early? How do you deal with that?  
JAVAN FELIX: It's definitely difficult to sit there and watch for a long time,
especially as long as I did last night and starting off on a bit of a rhythm
and, you know, it's tough. But like I've been saying all along, my job is to
take open shots and be aggressive. And I knew when I came in the game, I had
to do that and I was able to do it. And actually John, he helped me out on one
of them at the end and I count that as an assist (laughter).  
  
Q. Jonathan, we talked a little bit about the size advantage you guys have
inside. They have banger kind of similar to you guys in Jordan Morgan. What do
you see when you see him, watch him on film?  
JONATHAN HOLMES: Kind of similar to Cam. He's a load in the paint and pretty
much dominates the paint. It's going to be a good matchup for the big guys,
especially Cam tomorrow, to go against another really dominant post player.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? Thank you. Good
luck. Please welcome Texas Coach, Rick Barnes. Keeping in mind. Coach, I guess
first of all, just the emotional high of last night and then getting back to
work today on Michigan.  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, it was, as we talked last night, we were fortunate to
win a great, great college basketball game.  
We got back late, had a meal, and I'm sure our guys had their time with their
social media. But got up today and debriefed a little bit about our game last
night, what we did well and didn't do well, and turned our focus to Michigan
and know that we've got an opponent that you look at them, they do a lot of
great things. We know it's going to take an effort from everyone to play the
way that we need to play.  
THE MODERATOR: What specifically concerns you the most?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Transition. They're not a traditional-type transition team
where they will, say, run the same guy to the rim all the time. They run to
different spots. Different guys can bring the ball down the floor. So we have
to really work hard in transition to get back and get our defense set. And
then from there, they run a lot of different things and they flow extremely
well. And we know we're going to have to handle a lot of ball screen
situations where they -- again, the floor can be balanced, could be an empty
side, locality of different things that they do, but it's got to start with
having really good transition defense.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Rick, obviously as you noted, it's going to take a team effort to beat
Michigan. How important will Cam be tomorrow, given that matchup inside?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, everyone is talking about that we could have a size
advantage inside. John Beilein has coached a long time. He's played in a
league where there's a lot of big people as well, and we've always tried to
play in through Cam. We have. We need to do that. We've always want to play
inside/out and Cam was terrific last night and he's been good. He's been good
all year, really. But for us to do that, we've got to -- we really have to get
everybody, the timing and all that and, you know, Michigan will -- we know
they're going to play some 1-3-1 a couple times a game, which we played that
this year and handled it pretty well. They could play a little two, three
zone. Their man, they play more of a contain-type defense. We know all that.
For us to do what we need to do, we need to have all five guys in sync the
moving and timing has to be there. Cam has to really fight hard for his space
as well.  
  
Q. Rick, a couple of the major upsets today were a case of a major team with
a lot of the top level one-and-done type of recruits versus a smaller league
team where they've got three or four-year players. As the head of a major
program, how do you balance recruiting in terms of the top players that you
may only have for a year or two versus the guys you could have for three, four
years in your system and how important is that this time of year?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, I think you see where older teams have been around
play well and can handle a lot of different things. Our first win of the year
was against Mercer, and we knew as a coaching staff that it was going to be
maybe as hard an opener as we could possibly play with this group at the time
because of the youth that we had and the fact that they had so much success
the year before. But when you talk about one-and-done guys, there's not a
coach in the country that's not going to recruit the best and most talented
players that he can.  
But we also know that experience and time, especially when you get a group of
guys that played a lot of games together, it's -- I can't even begin to tell
you how valuable that is when you get a group like that.  
I think you look at Florida. I mean, they've had so much success because you
look at their experience.  
With that said, I do think there's a balance, and the way you get that balance
is that you try to keep an older program where you're going to have seniors
and juniors as opposed to those one-and-done guys being on a team where
there's no experience that can really teach them what you're really up
against.  
  
Q. Rick, is there a benefit to playing such a tight game like you did last
night and getting through it with this group, given their experience level?  
COACH RICK BARNES: We played a lot of tight games this year. We've been in a
lot of games decided by less than six, seven points, and we've been in a lot
decided by two, three and we've won a bunch of them and -- but I think the
experience of being in this tournament and getting the feel for it, if you
look back, like Jon made the comment to the coaches, "Freshman did great. One
guy had the experience and I didn't play so well."  
So we always try to analyze the experience, but the fact is like three, four
of our games so far, we've seen a lot of different things. They guys handle
themselves pretty well in close games.  
  
Q. Rick, you mentioned the size disadvantage for Michigan. They also have a
banger of their own in Jordan Morgan, got a double-double in the first game.
He seems sort of similar in style of your players. What kind of challenge do
you think he presents for your guys?  
COACH BARNES: When you look at a team like Michigan, if you think you're going
to concentrate on one guy, you can't because they're not where they are, we're
not where we are because of one guy.  
You go back and look, even with our team, I can -- I don't think Herb Sendek
probably thought that a guy like Martez Walker could come in and have the
impact that he did, and this happened to us throughout the year.  
We've had -- played against a team, and when we go through a scouting report,
we take their team very seriously, not just the guys we know that we need to
really focus and game plan for, but you've got to be so aware of the guys that
are the impact players and how they can affect the outcome of the game.  
On every team you're going to have somebody that maybe doesn't get the
attention that you know as a coach this guy is a really key guy. When you
watch the Michigan team, they've got a couple guys like that that I think that
do a lot of really good things for them. And as you mentioned, they've got a
big guy that can bang and he's not afraid to go in there and use his strength.
And so we have to -- we have to deal with that ourselves. We got hurt last
night in the post.  
We got -- our post guys will tell you that they were a little bit surprised
probably by how playing against a 7-foot-2 guy, how hard that was and the post
up he got and his agility.  
So this time of year when you haven't played against some of these guys, the
game just started, just like Prince Ibeh told me, "Hey, I was surprised a
little bit." I don't know what we should be thinking, but we weren't thinking
the right thing. That's why we hope our players have the mindset that every
guy is a person that we have to be on the edge with.  
  
Q. Last night you joked in the news conference about how the winning play
was drawn up and they executed it the way it was drawn up. There's been a
couple of situations like that this year, the Kansas State game when Jon hits
the game winner and comes after you inbound again when Javan was open on the
baseline early and got it back to Jon who hit the game winner that time. Does
it say something about your guys that they're still able to find a way to get
through it, even when it isn't properly executed the way it's called or drawn
up?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, we've always told our guys, our players, this is a
players' game and players have to make plays and we all -- obviously we're
excited when Cam made that layup. When you go back and really look at the
tape, Javan Felix made the play. We were actually going to work a set we never
got into, but he was down on the baseline where he isn't a lot and that ball
was really pretty much in the hands of two Arizona State players and he
reached in and broke it loose where Cam was able to pick it up. Those are kind
of the plays that players make. And so with that said, I do think that we have
struggled -- they did a great job obviously keeping us off the glass.  
We had one offensive rebound. We shot a high percentage in the first half,
too, but when we were really struggling, we kind of went back and Javan hit a
three off an offensive rebound and then off that last play, John made another
great three-point play off an offensive rebound. And that's kind of how we've
played a lot this year where we just found a way to go get it and make
something happen and -- but last night was an example of that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the contributions that Martez has given you and how
he's helped with your depth and given you another scoring guard?  
COACH RICK BARNES: We knew that with Martez, he's a player that's very
competitive. He's a player that when you take him out of the game, he looks at
you like, why are you taking me out? Then while he's on the bench, he maybe is
not in the game, he's looking at you, here I am, I'm ready.  
But what he is, he's very somewhat unorthodox in his style, but he's a player
that has continued to improve. When he first came in, he didn't -- he didn't
have very much of an idea about the concepts of defense. He knew what to do
with the ball, and it was, if you score on me, I'm going the try to score on
you. But he's grown so much and he's really grown in the last month a lot. I
think our players and his teammates have a lot of confidence in him. Because
the one thing they know is that he's fearless and he'll play, he'll go play
and it doesn't matter where. He just wants to be out there playing.  
  
Q. As a follow-up from Martez, can you take us through how you came upon him
originally?  
COACH RICK BARNES: We knew that we wanted to add some things to our program,
obviously. And so my assistants had heard about him, and couple years ago we
had the same situation had come up late in the year, you don't ever stop
looking for players, and someone had called us about someone from Detroit and
Greg Kampe, coach at Oakland, called me back then asked me were we going to
recruit this young man. I really don't remember who it was.  
I said, "I don't know. We haven't really evaluated it yet." But I asked him,
"what do you think?"  
And he said, "I don't know if this guy can play for you. We like him, but we
don't know. I'm not sure he can play for you."  
So, we evaluated him, decided not to do it. Same thing happened with Martez.
Coach Kampe called me and said, "are you guys going to offer Martez Walker a
scholarship?  
I said, "well, you know, Coach Lanier is coming up this week to look at him
and see what we think. I'm going to ask you what I asked you a couple years,
should we?"  
He said, "well, I don't want to tell you, but I'd love to have him." I think
they had already signed a point guard off the team. He said, "I don't know
what it takes to play at your level because I hear all these people saying
there's a difference between your level and my level, which this tournament
proves there's not a lot of difference.  
You got to have a body that's already made. He doesn't have that. But he is
one of the toughest kids I've ever seen. And if you need a shot, he'll find a
way to get it done.  
And he says, "I hope you don't like him, but I can't tell you anything, but
the kid is a player that I can understand why you would like him."  
Rob saw him and did like him and liked the program he came out of. And he came
in on his visit. Immediately the players would tell you that, just from their
time with him, "Coach, we don't have anybody like this, and we need somebody
that's got his swagger and his attitude."  
And like all freshmen coming in, you know, they're going to have to work at
certain things. He's changed his body a lot, and he's just getting started in
terms of how good a basketball player that we think he can be.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you. Good luck.  
COACH RICK BARNES: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS:
MILWAUKEE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+MILWAUKEE)

### [Jason Calliste](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26640)

### [Johnathan Loyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25072)

  
_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome Oregon student-athletes, Jason Calliste and
Johnathan Loyd. Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. While we wait for these shy reporters, just your initial thoughts about
facing Wisconsin, what you've seen on tape?  
JOHNATHAN LOYD: I know that they play really fundamentally sound basketball,
lot of shooters, versatile big man inside, good four man, also versatile,
athletic, and they like to slow the game down and try to bang you inside. So
we're going to have to play strong and try to speed them up.  
JASON CALLISTE: I know they're a well-balanced team, good offensively and
defensively, real athletic. So we have to pay attention to detail and I think
we'll be okay.  
  
Q. Johnathan, have you been in a lot of tempo games like this where you
expect it to be a battle of tempo?  
JOHNATHAN LOYD: Yeah. Since running our is our strength, a lot of teams trying
to slow it down. We've going to have to try to speed them up.  
  
Q. Was yesterday's game a typical game for you guys?  
JOHNATHAN LOYD: Both us and BYU both like to run, so we tried to cut off their
transition while keeping ours still going. I don't think it was a battle of
tempo. We wanted to limit their transition. We both wanted to play fast.  
THE MODERATOR: Jason, from your experience, what do you need to do to get the
pace you want when a team doesn't want that pace?  
JASON CALLISTE: We just got to stick to our principles. As long as we rebound
and run, I think we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Johnathan, with you, I guess, you guys went through a similar stretch as
Wisconsin, really good start and went through some bumpy times and then fought
your way through it. What was the difference, what allowed you guys to get
things straight after you lost a few there?  
JOHNATHAN LOYD: We just battled through adversity. We were -- we tried to pay
attention to rebounding. We know our offense will come every day. We try to
focus on defensive rebounding, and it paid off for us.  
  
Q. Have you played a team as well balanced as Wisconsin offensively and
especially defensively that you can compare them to that helps you at this
point, or are they so unique to themselves it's a whole new entity?  
JASON CALLISTE: We haven't faced anybody like this in the PAC-12. We'll be
ready for them with practice today. Whatever the coach wants us to do, we'll
do. We should be fine.  
THE MODERATOR: Both of you, maybe Johnathan and then Jason, as Mercer showed
today, you can beat a team even if they're playing in their home state. Facing
Wisconsin in Milwaukee, does that add to the challenge?  
JOHNATHAN LOYD: Definitely going to be a home game for them, away game for us.
You know, going to try to keep the crowd out of it, get our fans rocking a
little bit, and, you know, it's tourney time. Got to try to survive and
advance. Can't worry about this.  
JASON CALLISTE: Got to keep the crowd. As long as we play the way we're
capable of playing, keep the crowd out of it, we'll be all right.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? Thank you very much.
Good luck. Up next, Oregon coach, Dana Altman. Please welcome Oregon Coach,
Dana Altman. Coach, maybe a few opening words about facing Wisconsin and the
we'll take questions, please.  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: It will be a difficult challenge for us. Bo does a great
job, got a great, talented team. Lot of guys who can score. Their ability to
shoot it from three will spread our defense out a little bit more than we're
comfortable with. It will be an uphill climb for us. I'm sure the atmosphere,
you know, will not be neutral.  
So, it will make the challenge a little bit tougher. We'll have to be more
focused. We won't be able to waste possessions offensively or defensively, but
our guys are going to swing away and we're really excited about the
opportunity.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. People talk about this being a little different Wisconsin offensive team,
but is it still a tempo battle when you play them?  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: You know, we've never played -- in the years that I've
coached, we've never played against Wisconsin. I've had an opportunity to
watch them over the years. It is maybe a little quicker paced team than what
they've had. They spread the floor a little bit more. Other than that, you
know, you don't change your identity. We've always pressed, we've always run,
you know. Bo has always grinded it out, pick the heck out of you, put their
hands all over you. That's just the way they play. It's a physical game. He
recruits to that.  
We recruit to our style. We recruit quickness, and we've always run, we've
always pressed. That's just the way we play. So, I don't think you change your
style. But it will be two different styles tomorrow, and it will be
interesting, you know, how they react to ours. It will be interesting to see
how we react. You know, Arizona has kind of played that style this year.
They're really hands-on, physical defense. So in our league, them and Stanford
are probably the two that most resemble what we'll see tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, you're obviously familiar with the Milwaukee area a little bit. At
Creighton you had Rodney Buford, Ben Walker, guys like that, and now Elgin
Cook obviously yesterday. Can you talk about what he's meant to your team,
what do you expect from him tomorrow and his performance yesterday a little
bit?  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: Milwaukee has been a great area for my teams, for our
teams. Rodney really got us started at Creighton, and Ben Walker, Larry House,
three really good players from Milwaukee that were critical to a stretch there
where we went to a lot of NCAA Tournaments. Elgin is in that mold. He's
athletic. You know, had a great game yesterday. He's had a lot of big games
for us this year. It's his first year in Division I, and so his consistency
hasn't been what we would like it to be, what he would like it to be. But I
think he's got tremendous upside because of his athleticism. He's got a
toughness about him. He can take a physical shot and doesn't shy away from it
at all.  
So, I think he's got a lot of upside, and I really look forward to working
with him in the next two years because I think, as his offensive skills
improve and gets more comfortable bringing it every day and little -- being a
little more consistent, I think he's really got a lot of upside and I think
he'll be a very good player for us.  
  
Q. When you guys had it going on offense, what kind of a challenge does that
pose for a defense? What does it do to them?  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: I think we have the ability to spread a defense out, also.
You know, if Jason and Joe, Dot, Johnny, DA, Mike Moser, we've got three-point
shooters. When we're shooting it well, we can really get the floor spread, and
that enables our guys to drive it at the basket, opens up some driving lanes.
We're not a particularly good scoring team in the post. Those guys have
finished some plays. We don't throw it in there a lot.  
So, driving the ball to the basket is important and, you know, it really makes
it a lot easier to drive it if we're hitting shots and extending the defense.
We were able -- you know, if somebody would told me going into the BYU game we
were only get to two 3s and Mike Moser is only going to score seven points, I
would have been concerned. I don't know where our points would have come from.  
That was the lowest we hit all season. So, we're going to have to shoot it
against Wisconsin more. We're going to have to get some shots because they
don't extend their defense. It's not like they're going to do it -- they want
to stay packed in there. They want to protect the basket. They want to make us
shoot over the top. So we're going to have to hit some of those shots to
extend our defense a little bit.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions, please. Coach, what about Kaminsky
specifically, how much of a challenge is he inside?  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: He's a big matchup problem for everybody because he has
ability to go outside, he can put it down on the floor and he does score very
well around the basket. He's a unique challenge for someone 7-foot to be able
to go outside and draw the defense out, puts the ball on the floor, and then
his post moves inside are pretty good.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, good luck.

## March 20, 2014

  

### [Tyler Haws](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25306)

### [Dave Rose](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13817)

### [Anson Winder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26784)

  
_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  

Oregon  87  
BYU  68

  
THE MODERATOR: Again, we'll have an opening statement from Coach Rose and then
questions for the student-athletes so we can release them, and then after
that, questions for Coach Rose.  
Coach Rose, please.  
COACH DAVE ROSE: Well, first of all, I'm really proud of our team. I think
that we had really exciting week as far as our invitation to the tournament,
but it was extremely difficulty with the injury to Kyle. And I think that our
ability to fight through some real adversity, and we cut it to three there in
the second half and had some momentum. Oregon was too good.  
I think that -- congratulate Dana and his team for advancing in the tournament
because it's a difficulty thing to do. That's what we want to do is to be able
to advance. And I'm proud of our guys and look forward to getting started on a
new season, and so with that, we'll take any questions.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Tyler, you get it down to 3, as Coach mentioned. What did Oregon do to
really run that lead back? I know they got five quick points, and where did
they drive the rest of the game?  
TYLER HAWS: Well, I mean, they just got in the lane and got easy buckets, got
to the foul line, and they just kept making plays. And you got to give them a
lot of credit for answering our run.  
  
Q. For either Anson or Tyler, did you have a scouting report on Cook at all?
He seemed to get inside and get a lot of points. Hasn't been a big scorer for
them.  
TYLER HAWS: Yes, we did have a scouting report for him, and he's a really good
player. Got to the foul line and found a way to get easy buckets.  
  
Q. Anson, there were stretches where you played real well defensively and
kept the guys in front of you and then others where there were lapses. Can you
kind of describe what happened there to the perimeter defense?  
ANSON WINDER: I think we just got a little lackadaisical, myself included. I
think sometimes in the course of a game, you kind of expect things to happen
and you don't go out and make them happen yourself, and, you know, I take
responsibility for that, and our team and, you know, I give credit to Oregon
because they played a really good game and executed their offense well.  
  
Q. Tyler, were there times during the game where you thought wow, we really
could use Kyle here, and what impact did him not being here have on you
guys?  
TYLER HAWS: Yeah. No, Kyle, he's a guy that you can't replace, and he brings
so much to our team but, you know, even with him out, I thought we had chances
to win this game. We cut it to three, and I thought we had momentum and guys
stepped up. Even when shots weren't falling, they stayed in mentally. So, even
with him out, I'm proud of the way we fought and thought we had our chance.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes? All right, gentlemen.
Thank you and we'll release you. Congratulations on your season. Questions for
Coach Rose, please.  
  
Q. Coach, Cook was mentioned, and there had been a number of games where
maybe an unexpected guy has gone off for a season high. Is it maybe you guys
losing track of lesser non-players?  
COACH DAVE ROSE: Well, I think that, you know, in this case it all came down
to their ability to penetrate the ball. I didn't matter if it was Johnathan
Loyd or Joseph Young or Calliste. They all took turns penetrating the ball in,
and then as soon as we would step up and help, they would find whoever it was.
Cook was the man that seemed to be in the -- who benefited most of those
assists from Johnathan Loyd and Calliste. But it probably would have been
Moser, but he was in foul trouble most of the time.  
They're a very talented team. Really, the scouting report was pretty thorough,
and I think that, you know, our guys were just overwhelmed at times as far as
being able to control their penetration. They just keep coming at you, and I
think that's what really hurt us.  
  
Q. Dave, you did mention about Moser. If you had known that he prior -- that
he would have four fouls and practically not play in the second half, do you
think you would have had a better chance?  
COACH DAVE ROSE: I thought that would increase our chances, yeah, but you get
to this time of the season, you get to this point, you're going to play a
really good team that's overcome a lot of adversity to get here. It doesn't
happen with one guy. And they had a lot of their players step up and really
play well. And it's a team, it's a really good team. You take maybe 10 or 12
points on the season and add it to Oregon's total at the right time, you might
have a 2 or 3 seed.  
They got beat during a few games in the season where they're all close games
and came kind of back to back to back when they started the first part of
their league. But this is a really talented team. Should be a great matchup up
on Saturday with Wisconsin and Oregon.  
  
Q. Dave, what were the differences between this game and the game in
December as far as the pace goes and your getting into attack mode?  
COACH DAVE ROSE: Well, I think our perimeter defense was a little better in
that game. I think that we were -- we were a lot more confident in the times
when we got open shots. You know, we shot a few rushed shots and forced shots
tonight, but even the shots that were in rhythm and in our pace seemed to be a
little bit maybe more contested.  
I think that we didn't have quite the space to operate in at our -- in our
rhythm like we normally do.  
It seemed like even Tyler, when he got a little open, it was kind of rushed
and I think maybe that affected our shooting percentage. We shot 33 percent
from the field and we're a much better shooting team than that. You got to
give Oregon a lot of credit for how they contested us.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions.  
  
Q. Dave, you had mentioned the other day how the team was really emotional
practicing for the first time without Kyle. In huddles when things weren't
going well, could you kind of maybe sense that guys really missed him at that
point or were they at least separated from the fact that he obviously --  
COACH DAVE ROSE: We had a great feel in the huddle after the first 12 minutes
of the game. I thought we had a little bit of lull, and we were able to come
back and cut it to eight at the half and had a really good chance to be six
points at half.  
So, our guys went in with a good feel to them, and then the second half, you
know, it got up a little bit, but our guys fought back and we hit the three to
cut it to three and then called timeout. I mean, it felt real, felt right, and
our guys were encouraged and they were pulling for each other. Just, you know,
like the normal huddles that we have most of the time.  
Didn't really kind of feel different until the four-minute timeout. The four-
minute timeout it was a lot of encouragement from our coaching staff to try to
get our guys to get back up and finish it, because they were pretty down
there. But that was probably the only time I noticed a real difference in the
huddle.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Thank you Coach.  
COACH DAVE ROSE: All right. Thank you, guys.

_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  

Michigan  57  
Wofford  40

  
THE MODERATOR: First, we'll hear from Coach Young and then after his opening
statement, questions for the student-athletes. And then when they're excused,
we'll have questions for Coach Young. Coach Young.  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: I've been doing it a long time, 28 years. I wanted a
different outcome. We thought we could come over here and we had some specific
things we could do, needed to do to win. You know, we guarded them really,
really well. We couldn't make a shot. And, you know, last time I checked,
that's pretty important aspect of the game is to get it in the hole and puts a
lot of pressure on your defense. Talking about guarding Stauskas and Robinson
and others, makes it awfully hard, but I'm beaming with pride with these guys
sitting to my left and their accomplishments, our program's accomplishments,
and we got a pretty good team coming back. So, we'll walk out of here with our
head high.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned that you guys couldn't shoot the ball particularly well
from the three-point line. Was it the shooting back drop, Michigan's defense,
what was it that led to the struggle there?  
LEE SKINNER: I don't shoot from the three-point line.  
KARL COCHRAN: Some nights, unfortunately, the ball just doesn't drop in the
basket. I will give some credit to the style of defense that Michigan played,
though. They were really intense all night. Some nights aren't as good as
others. Unfortunately, we just faced a tough night from the three-point line.  
LEE SKINNER: Yeah. Going along with that, we had really good looks. We had as
good of looks as we had all season. Inside, they were a bigger team, real
physical, just -- we got good looks and didn't get a couple of those to go
down.  
  
Q. Karl, usually you can shoot your way out. Did you feel at that point they
were going to start dropping and dropping fast?  
KARL COCHRAN: You always have to keep an optimistic mindset, especially on an
off night. If you start to doubt yourself and start to hunch your shoulders,
there's no chance that you'll ever come out of a shooting slump or even get a
W, especially with your team, because all that negative energy, your teammates
see that in you and see it on your face and kind of start to feed off of it.
If the ball is not going in, you got to keep your shoulders back and find
something else to do.  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: Man, I love you. Man, I love you.  
  
Q. Coach what were your thoughts about how Robinson played? What made it
tough to defend?  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: With all the ball screen hand-off actions with Morgan, we
were going to come off of Robinson and try to absorb some of that. 22 percent
from three -- correct me if I'm wrong -- pick your poison. You're certainly
not going to blink off of Stauskas. LeVert had a great year for them. Walton
is 39 percent from three, and there's got to be something in the middle lane
to take care of some things. I told a couple of friends earlier today in our
staff meetings that that was a big matchup. If he shot it, he scored, you
know, 14, 18, 20, we had some problems. And he's a very talented player. But
we felt like it was our best opportunity to guard them, and that's how we
went.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please, then we'll have
more for the coach later. Maybe if we can go down the way for the student-
athletes, just about this experience and just the great season that it was.  
JUSTIN GORDON: This experience is one of a kind. I personally, actually
everybody up here, has never been on this type of stage before. Pretty much
the only person is Aerris Smith, and he unfortunately wasn't able the play
with us tonight. Any type of events like this is going to help us in the
future. So we just got to learn from this and hopefully we can get a W next
year.  
KARL COCHRAN: Feeding off that, like Justin is saying, this stage is one of a
kind. It's great to be in an environment like this, small school, you're
really not going to play in front of thousands, especially when you play on
CBS and even more are watching. It's kind of great to get that publicity.
Unfortunately, tonight wasn't our night. We'll probably be back next year, and
the outcome is probably going to be better.  
LEE SKINNER: Overall, was an awesome opportunity for us to play a great team
in Michigan, and just we all appreciated the support we got from our school,
Wofford College, and it was beautiful to see the city and school just rally
around us.  
And then on top of that, it was awesome to just stick around and play in a
post-season tournament and keep playing with this team, and every single one
of us in this locker room loves each other. We'll do anything for each other,
and that's how it's going to be next year. Next year in and off-season we're
going to go back at it, and hopefully we'll be by the back here next year with
a better outcome.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? All right. We'll
release you. Thank you very much. Congratulations on your season.  
Questions for Coach, please.  
  
Q. Coach, while some reporters file in, I think it was the seven in the
second half and got very interesting for awhile. What did you think tipped the
game back Michigan's way?  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: Cut it to seven and Cochran got a stop. He had a shot that
Cochran makes with regularity and didn't get it down. And then Morgan on a
slip down the middle of the lane and it was a block, exceptionally well-
officiated game. It was a block. Morgan got it down. So, there's a swing.
Instead of five, it's back to ten and you got different dynamics.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
Thank you, sir. Congratulations on your season.  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: Great city, great tournament. Thanks.

THE MODERATOR: Coach?  
COACH BO RYAN: I was just telling Mike, Coach Brennan, that I watched 23 games
-- I have an assistant that knows the Princeton offense better than anybody, I
think. But I never watched as many films of an opponent as I did this one,
because every time I kept watching, I kept looking at some things that they
were doing and I was extremely impressed with them. I have so much respect for
an opponent. I think the players can tell you, we even had to go solicit the
coaching help of one of our players who knows the Princeton offense very well,
too, because he's a transfer from the Air Force in Zach Bohannon.  
The thing about their team, you have a great year, you win the conference
tournament, and then it ends so fast. And I heard in the back one of the
questions you asked them about their season. Those guys can keep their heads
up high. They had an unbelievable year, and I think Coach Brennan got every
bit that he could get out of those players. I have a lot of respect for them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. In the first half when you guys got down by a few there, at any point did
you think, "Oh-oh, it's the NCAA Tournament. How do we break out of this
offensive funk? How do we stay level-headed and make sure we play through
it?"  
BEN BRUST: You do the things you've been doing. We had a lot of help from our
teammates. We had to settle in and guard with their running and made some good
things happened as we got some stops and got out and ran a little bit, opened
up the floor, and just stayed with what we were doing and touch the post and
got some good looks inside out.  
SAM DEKKER: Against a team like that, the more you freak out, you know, try to
play possessions ahead of yourself and being patient, they're going to really
work you. So, we just had to stay disciplined and do what we do. Coach never
got overheated, keep doing our things we'll be fine and it happened to work
our way.  
  
Q. Traevon, what was the Coach's message to you guys at halftime? You were
on a 19-3 run to close off the half. You got the tempo and the leave. What was
Coach's message?  
TRAEVON JACKSON: Nothing like do in particular. Coming out, just executing
well, taking care of the ball, obviously, and really just, you know, stay
aggressive and being smart. I think we did a good job in terms of getting the
shots we wanted and one possession at a time. That's what we did, one
possession at a time.  
THE MODERATOR: Maybe go down the line as far as student-athletes. What was it
like to have that sea of red support from the home fans?  
TRAEVON JACKSON: It was great. We knew coming in we would have a lot of fans
there. But, you know, at the end of the day, really didn't matter because we
still -- this is an away game still for us. Even if we were a home game, we're
still playing basketball. We had to come ready to play. And I thought they
helped us out a lot and we executed well.  
BEN BRUST: It was good to get the building loud. I heard them when we were
down in the first half. Hey, we better wake up. We started to hit some shots
and got going, and it will be nice to have that on Saturday.  
SAM DEKKER: It was cool to see our fans come out and support us. Got such
loyal fans and do a great job. They come and fill out the Bradley Center here
in Milwaukee. It's great to have them come and support us.  
  
Q. Ben, do you think it's helped you and the rest of the shooters down after
you hit the first three after the first six-minute drought you guys had going
on?  
BEN BRUST: Sorry? What was that again?  
  
Q. Did it settle you and the rest of the shooters down, hitting that 3 after
that seven-minute run you guys went on?  
BEN BRUST: Once everyone sees one go down, it kind of spreads and everyone
started hitting a couple. And Frank had some open looks that he normally hits,
and, you know, he's going to hit them next game. Touching in the post inside
and having some inside presence really helps open some things up. And as you
said, got a couple to go down and kind of spread through there.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes? Last call.  
  
Q. Ben, your ability to get inside post touches, as were you just talking
about with Kaminsky earlier, did that open up some of the perimeter game for
you throughout the contest?  
BEN BRUST: Yeah. There was a couple times where we through it in Frank and a
couple guys would pinch or raid a little bit. It's also good to have a guy
like Nigel who can come in there and open some stuff, too. Touches in the post
help because our bigs make good decisions with it.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Sam, Traevon, Ben, thank you very much. Questions for
Coach, please.  
  
Q. It's the NCAA Tournament, but in your wildest imagination, did you ever
think you're going to go on a 46 run and win by such a decisive margin
today?  
COACH BO RYAN: You should see my imagination (laughter). I woke up -- first
time I woke up last night, we got beat back door. Next time I woke up,
Wroblicky made two straight left-hand jump hooks and followed it up with a
third with his right hand. I woke up again.  
You know, to go on a 40-6 run, no, you can't -- that doesn't usually happen,
but our guys, if you told them it was 40-6, I don't think they would -- they
just took care of each possession and that's what you have to do, whether
you're down or whether you're up.  
You notice I'm really impressed again by what American did. They got down 20,
25, 30. They were still running their half court offense just the way they
were running it when they went on that spurt in the first half. That tells you
a lot about a team. I mean, they needed to get some shots a little quicker
when you're playing from behind, but they still ran their stuff.  
So, you know, we've had teams like that. I'm hoping that we don't get behind,
but when we have gotten behind this year, our guys have sometimes got a little
anxious and got away from the offense and tried to do things too fast.  
So I will point that out to our players, and I already have, saying, "Watch
how this team -- they're down, but watch how they still run their offense,
still do the things that got them here." We don't concern ourselves with those
runs other than they're nice to have.  
  
Q. Obviously it was a tale of two halves. Struggled a little bit in the
first half. What was the biggest difference between the way you started the
game and that big run in the second half?  
COACH BO RYAN: Hitting shots and stretching it and you stretch it a little
more. Just for the players, they sense something, they felt that if they could
do the things that we had talked about, then the assistant coach was right.
Fortunately for us, we felt defensively we could do a decent job against the
Princeton offense because of the Northwestern teams of old.  
So, other than Nigel and Bronson of that first group, everybody else had faced
the Princeton offense. That helped us. And we had days to prepare. When we
play this game Saturday, in no way will we have the same number of hours with
our players on the court to teach them things that we can do to help us
Saturday. It's going to have to be fast, and our guys are going to have to be
quick learners.  
  
Q. Coach, similar question to what Dennis asked the players. A lot was made
this week about you guys are playing close to home, but not at home in
Milwaukee. Was there any extra juice seeing the red out there, and especially
as things went well in the second half, hearing that crowd behind the guys?  
COACH BO RYAN: You almost blew it for me with the question about the red. I
told my team, "When we go to Indiana, they're rooting for us" (laughter). At
Nebraska, I told our guys, "Hey, see those people out there in the red,
they're rooting for us." Problem is, we took a bump at both places. It didn't
work.  
Of course, it helps. Of course it's great. What these players earned, it's
good in return to have parents, relative, fans, alumni, everybody have a
chance to make a short trip for a game for alums in this area and for the
families in this area.  
So, that's what we went through the 30-some games for during the season to get
this here. It's what the players say. I never care about the sea. They wanted
to play here so we get another 40 minutes here.  
  
Q. Bo, is it the mark of a good team, particularly this time of the year,
that you can take a run or a bump like you guys did early and not get
flustered, not get behind, and is that what you need to do to keep going
forward?  
COACH BO RYAN: Yeah. I'll tell you, having coached two undefeated teams to
national championships, I only say that not to be vain, but going through
those seasons as a coach really helped me for when like at Wisconsin we had a
38-game win streak at one time and we had this 16.  
So, I try to defer -- when people start asking when we were 14-0, can you guys
go undefeated? Can we go undefeated? That's a heck of a question. We're going
to go to the next game. So, I think we didn't panic when we took some bumps.
Are you asking like when we hit the rough spot this game?  
Well, it goes back to where we weren't playing well and we had to make some
adjustments and guys had to get better and get them focused. On the mini
level, rather than the bigger level with the parts of the season, in a game,
in a half, you don't get flustered, you don't get down. You just stay the
task. We've got some really smart guys. We've got some tough guys. So I think
they've handled it well when we've gotten behind.  
  
Q. Coach, every single one of your players got on the floor tonight. How
special is that at the big game?  
COACH BO RYAN: Are you kidding me? If I'm one of those guys, that's why they
jacked shots right away (laughter). Right away when a couple guys took shots,
they knew right where the camera was (laughter). Oh, it didn't go in. No. Turn
them loose, play. The only time we don't shoot is when the shot clock is off
and then we have the last possession, then we don't shoot. That shot clock and
game clock are running, those guys in there can play, can shoot.  
  
Q. Coach, going back to one game at a time, one possession at a time, how do
you as a coach in the tournament keep this team focused, especially the young
guys like Nigel and Bronson with all the other distractions like media and
stuff like that that could potentially get in their heads and change their
play on the court?  
COACH BO RYAN: He said media was a distraction, I didn't. Put it on him
(laughter). Inside their jerseys on these new uniforms is "next." You say one
game at a time, one possession at a time. I know it might sound old, but to me
it's still about what's coming.  
So, we talked about that, we talked about being close to home, relatives
around, friends around. I told them to treat it like we were playing an away
game. And we have our times, we have our meeting times. We did our thing, and
they've been real good about that. Good leadership with the upperclassmen. So
I'm not concerned about any distractions. I get the distractions because I get
a lot of media request. You said it, I didn't.  
  
Q. How much of this next game do you have to personally pay attention to in
live time? How much of this do you want to see?  
COACH BO RYAN: The assistants are out there now. Coach Paris has one, Coach
Close has the other. I'll watch the game probably when I'm done with my
obligations, go back and catch the second half on the tube, and they'll have
the game in my hands in my room and I'll have watched it by 7:00 tonight, 8:00
tonight, and have watched some other games of the winning team.  
I don't think I'll get through 20-some like we had time for with American. But
I really didn't need to, like I said. I just enjoyed watching them run their
offense.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions, please. All right. Coach, thank you,
congratulations. See you tomorrow.

_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  

Wisconsin  75  
American  35

  
THE MODERATOR: Again we'll have opening remarks from Coach Brennan and then
questions for the student-athletes from American. Coach?  
COACH MIKE BRENNAN: Well, obviously Wisconsin is a really good team. You know,
I wish we could have made it a better game today representing ourselves and
the league a little better, but Wisconsin has dismantled some really good
teams this year. They're No. 2 seed for a reason. But I give our guys a ton of
credit for the year that they had, and it's tough loss, but these guys had a
terrific year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for the student-athletes, please, then
we'll have questions for the coach later.  
  
Q. Pee Wee, how are you going to remember this season?  
DARIUS GARDNER: I'm going to remember Tony being our guy -- being the head guy
of our team and overall leader. You know, the transition he made from last
year to this year, you know, just everybody and the team chemistry. That's
going to be one thing I take for the rest of my life.  
  
Q. Tony, what was the thought, you guys get that lead with 11 minutes left
in the first half, the nice run, what was the message in the timeout there and
what happened after that?  
TONY WROBLICKY: We were excited. We were playing well. We were making them
take tough shots and we were scoring. Then, you know, after that we just kind
of hit a rut and just extended throughout the rest of the game.  
  
Q. Tony, you had a great year defensively. They seemed to come right out
after you at the opening tip. Kaminsky had those couple early baskets. Were
you expecting them to come after you or did this surprise you a little bit?  
TONY WROBLICKY: You have to expect that. Their best player is going to try to
attack you from the opening tip. He made some good moves and scored, the first
three buckets. After that, you know, I think I did a reasonable job on him.  
  
Q. John, can you just put into perspective, aside from this defeat, what the
season has been like for this team and looking ahead now?  
JOHN SCHOOF: Yeah. We've had a great, great group of guys from the start. I
love playing with these guys. We've taken the season one game at a time. Did
very well at the beginning of the year. We all worked hard. All of us love
playing together. And as for looking ahead, we're obviously going to miss Tony
a lot. Tony was a huge part of our team offensively, defensively. He did a lot
of things for us.  
So, definitely going to miss Tony, but looking ahead, all the guys coming
back, we're ready to pick right back up soon and keep working for next year.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes? Okay. We'll let you
go. Thank you very much and congratulations on a great season. Questions for
Coach, please.  
  
Q. Mike, where do you start with your game planning against Wisconsin? Where
do you start, where does it begin, and how do you flow out from there in terms
of how you define it?  
COACH MIKE BRENNAN: We concentrated on defense the latter part of the year.
Trying to figure out how to stop them. You know, we weren't able to do it.
They do a lot of good things really well. Coach Ryan, he's won 700 games.
There's a reason for it. They got terrific players. They played really well
today. Trying to figure out how to score so you're balancing defense and
offense. We just couldn't score today. Couldn't figure out a way to get clean
looks and get -- make open shots. So, they're a tough team to play, obviously,
offensively and defensively.  
  
Q. How valuable do you think this experience is going forward for the rest
of the team?  
COACH MIKE BRENNAN: I mean, they've had a terrific year. They worked really
hard all year. They learned a lot throughout the year, and, you know, you just
keep learning as you move along here.  
So, this is new for all of them, playing a team of this caliber. It's
different when you're playing a team like this in November and December. They
get better, too. It's a good learning experience for our guys, and I'm sure
they'll remember it. But I'm proud of what they were able to accomplish this
year.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Mike, did the Wisconsin crowd play a factor in anything at all? Obviously
a sea of red out there.  
COACH MIKE BRENNAN: No, it was mostly their team (laughter). Mostly their
team. Obviously that can affect little swings here and there, but, I mean,
they're a good team. They got so many different weapons, they play so well
together and take such good care of the ball inside, outside. They're a
really, really good team and they defend. That's the biggest thing today. We
couldn't score and they stopped us stone cold.  
  
Q. Were they overplaying your back cuts a little bit or were they just
defending it well?  
COACH MIKE BRENNAN: They sort of give up, like pull up jump shots so we got a
few early on. Then we missed a few. They don't give you any easy shots at all.
So, really have to work for anything that you get, and you're not making
shots, a team like that can just completely shut out a team, a team like ours.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you, Coach.  
COACH MIKE BRENNAN: Thank you.

_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  

Michigan  57  
Wofford  40

  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations to Michigan. We'll hear from Coach Beilein
first and then take questions for the student-athletes. Glenn Robinson III,
Nik Stauskas, and Jordan Morgan. Coach.  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Congratulate Wofford on a wonderful year. I've been on
that side of it, winning -- going through your whole season and winning a
conference championship is the experience I'll never forget. Even I was at
places like Canisius and Richmond in the CAA. Hats off to them. I was a coach
that was today very concerned about how well they would guard us, and they
did, and very concerned about the three-point shooting. And they guarded us
well. They held us to 57 points, but we did a terrific job on guarding
Cochran, Garcia, all their three-point weapons. Jordan Morgan did a great job
in the post. We were able to get a win basically with our defense today. And
that's something that a lot of people wouldn't say as they watched us play
this year, but these guys made a commitment to it today and it paid off.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Nik, just wondering how it was to get out there this year after having
played so much and got out there last year? Was there a little different
feeling with all the experience you had?  
NIK STAUSKAS: No, not really. Anytime you get to this time of year, you're in
the tournament, it's just all exciting. So it was the same feeling this year
as it was last year. And, you know, my teammates did a great job of coming out
today ready to play, and, like I said, just really excited.  
  
Q. For Jordan, why do you think they whittled the lead down from 18 to seven
and then when you heard the crowd getting into it, too, any nerves?  
JORDAN MORGAN: No. We had a few open looks that we normally look. Caris and
Nik had some good shots that we normally make. We knew they weren't going to
go away. They kept playing good defense and they were excited to play, so they
made some good shots, too.  
  
Q. What was the seven-point burst to make it 50 to 37 and how would you
describe your team shooting up to that point?  
JORDAN MORGAN: I'm not sure, what burst?  
  
Q. When he made it 50 to 37 late in the second half.  
JORDAN MORGAN: I think we just kept sticking to go our principles, and the
same shots that we had early in the second half didn't necessarily fall, they
fell for us. Caris had hit a three. Nik hit a one. We just kept playing good
defense. I think we played good defense all game long, made them make tough
shots and sticking with that, eventually went in our favor.  
  
Q. You came out aggressive in the first half. Was that something were you
looking to do going into this game, Glenn?  
GLENN ROBINSON III: Yes, sir. I just wanted to get myself going by attacking
the rim, trying to get an easy layup, but they were playing off me, so I felt
confident enough in my shot. Coach been staying with me after practice,
getting up some shots. All my teammates have confidence in me and they set me
up in good positions.  
  
Q. Glenn, you spoke a bit yesterday about your father's career here and how
much were you looking forward the playing in this building where he starred.
You played pretty well. How much was that on your mind beforehand, and did it
really feel as comfortable as it looked?  
GLENN ROBINSON III: You know, I actually didn't think too much about it. I
knew that he played here. You know, I seen him before the game. He was out on
the court. But I just wanted to go out and play my basketball like any other
time he's at the games, just play for this team.  
  
Q. Question for all three of you. Now that you've made a Final Four run,
you're a No. 2 seed, do you feel there's a target on your back this season?  
JORDAN MORGAN: I mean, I think that's kind of been like all year long. People
get up to play Michigan and, you know, I think that just comes with the
territory. It's not something new to us at this point. At this point in the
year, it's something that we've been dealing with pretty much all year long.  
THE MODERATOR: Glenn and Nik on that as well, please.  
GLENN ROBINSON III: Like Jordan said, I feel like we've had a target on our
backs ever since we got to the National Championship game last year. Whoever
we play, especially being the No. 2 seed, everybody is going to come out the
attack us. We have to be on our A game at all times because this might be our
last game. We want to go out and prove to everyone and just keep this thing
going.  
NIK STAUSKAS: Just piggybacking on what they said, people get up to play
Michigan, you know, with the way Coach Beilein has built this program, people
are excited to play us, and, you know, we just got to be up for every game, no
matter who we're playing, and I think we did a good job of that today.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Sorry if this has already been asked, was there a special emphasis on
defense going into this tournament, not just this game but into this
tournament, and how you think you performed tonight?  
JORDAN MORGAN: Yeah, I think so. We know we're pretty efficient offensively
and most times we don't have very much trouble scoring the basketball from
different people and different games. So, we know we're only going to go as
far as our defense carries us, and we never know which game is really going to
be our last. So we just want to play every game defensively as best we can.  
  
Q. Nik on this one, the other guys can jump in, too, and hope I'm not
putting you on the spot with the coach sitting there, but after today's game,
do you have any inkling what you guys might be working on tomorrow, the Coach
will have you working on to get ready for Saturday?  
NIK STAUSKAS: At this point just really -- it's really going to depend on who
we're playing. We got good trust in our coaches. They do a really good job
with all the scouting reports. I'm sure they're going to scout whoever we're
playing very well and we'll prepare for that tomorrow.  
  
Q. Glenn, it looked like you came out fairly aggressive attacking the
basket. Was that a point of emphasis for you coming into the game?  
GLENN ROBINSON III: Yes, personally I wanted to get myself involved. Like I
said, I don't think I played the best game I could. I missed a lot of easy
buckets and missed some shots, but, you know, stayed with it. I don't think
overall we had the best offensive game ourselves, you know, but my teammates
stayed confident in myself and I stayed confident in them.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? Glenn, Nik, Jordan,
thank you.  
Questions for Coach, please.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the job they did defending your actions and did
you kind of expect that a little bit?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Yeah. We watched them play in some tournament games, and
they would select guys that they play off of. They had really hard hedges that
we knew we had to try to counter at different times, and they're just a really
good defensive team. They're not real tall, but they're underneath you and
they don't let you get in front of them. You can see that.  
The thing that separates them from a lot of teams, including ours, everybody
stands in there and takes charges and they're a really good defensive team.  
  
Q. You're a coach who obviously doesn't like turnovers and sloppy play. On
the flip side, your defense was good. What will you take out of this game
more, the positive or the concerning things?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Couple of the turnovers, they didn't really create them.
We had some sloppy just plays. I mean, we just threw the ball away a couple
times. And then Cochran got the two steals in the first half. We had three
charges would be in there.  
So, that was -- that call is still one that is difficult for everybody to
understand, and those charges cost us turnovers as well.  
So, we really told them that, we emphasized this week, we can't talk about
defense after a loss anymore. It's going to be your last game. So, we got to
make another commitment to make sure that you understand we're going to have
to do that, and that probably was our best defensive performance overall by
everybody.  
  
Q. Of the year?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: It may be. It's tough to compare them, they're four months
apart, but you know, Cochran can score on anybody. He's averaged four 3s a
game. We were trying to think who guards him. We put the freshman on him. He's
a great defender, you know, off the ball and made Cochran take tough shots.  
  
Q. You had some guys quick on the trigger a little bit. Were you okay with
the shot selection for the most part?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I definitely wanted Glenn to shoot in those situations. As
Mike said, you expect that when you look at just percentages of what they may
do. But they don't see Glenn in practice every day. And that's what we want
Glenn to shoot those when they leave him that open. It's the only way we want
him to play. And I was really happy with his with his first half. That's how
we got out in front.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach?  
  
Q. Just wondering, Coach, if could you comment. I know it's kind of -- you
could do the whole season comparison, but for Nik Stauskas, can you say how he
looks in his first game in the tournament this year as opposed to how he was
last year?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: You know, he has a much different -- he has a much
different role on this team than he did last year. So it's a role that he's
created and we've created for him. He's playing sort of a residual role with
Trey Burke and Tim Hardaway last year. Now he's replaced them in those roles.
He's going to have lot more opportunities. He's going to have a lot more
playing time.  
And I thought he really played well. He hit some tough shots tonight. That
corner shot to start the second half, holy cow, that was a heck of a shot. He
missed a wide open one later on. The young man is growing every day and seeing
different action and getting better.  
  
Q. You talked about the charges a little bit. What do you approach now going
forward the way they were called today compared to how it's been all year?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I don't want to get in trouble (laughter). It's a
difficult call. And, like I said, it's a difficult call for the players, for
the officials, for the coaches all to understand, and so we just continue to
move forward and adapt.  
  
Q. Follow-up on last answer, would you say obviously a lot has to do with
his confidence in Glenn?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: If the coach is saying, hey, listen, 25 shots graduated
last year, we want you to take a lot of those 25 shots, we give him confidence
and we expect him to shoot. We expect him to score, but what Nik has really
done this year, and he did it a couple times today, we weren't able to hit the
open one. He hit several of our ones for wide open 3s because he was double-
teamed. That's something that really helped him grow his game this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you. See you tomorrow.  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Thank you.

_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  

Texas  87  
Arizona State  85

  
THE MODERATOR: From the victorious Texas Longhorns, Cameron Ridley and
Demarcus Holland and Coach Rick Barnes. Coach Barnes will address the game
first quickly, and we'll have questions for the student-athletes and questions
for Coach Barnes. Coach.  
COACH RICK BARNES: It was a great, great college basketball game. I thought it
was really unfortunate that either team has to lose this game. We were
fortunate. We were really fortunate. We didn't have great execution at the
end, but we found a way to make a couple plays.  
And I can't say enough about Arizona State, the job that Herb did with them.
We thought we could really come in and do some damage on the boards, and they
out rebounded us and we got again fortunate at the end to pick up two really
-- balls that were -- they really defended us, but we were able to get
something out of it. Proud of my guys, obviously, because again we had control
of the game and they, again, we turned it over three straight times in a row
in ways you can't turn it over.  
At the end of the game we found a way, too. Our guys didn't flinch. They
stayed with it and happy for us, but just a hard game when you play against a
person as well as I know Herb. His team was great, and I wish we both could be
opposite each other, both still be playing.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Cameron, when Jonathan shot that ball, did you realize right away he
missed it as badly as did he? And kind of go through what your adjustments to
corral it and getting it up there.  
CAMERON RIDLEY: I mean, I knew it was about five seconds left when I was there
and called the play. I expected John to make it, but, I mean, I went to the
glass as hard as I could, and the ball came to me, so I tried to get it up as
I possibly could and it went in.  
  
Q. Cam, what was it like just for this team, the way the game kind of
unfolded down the stretch and for you to be end up getting mobbed like that.  
CAMERON RIDLEY: We all stayed focused. We all had great energy throughout the
game. We all stayed confident, too. I mean, them doing at the end showed how
much character we have on our team and how great of a team we can be.  
  
Q. Demarcus, obviously you're known as kind of a defensive specialist, lock-
down defender. You had a big offensive night tonight. Did you feel they kind
of forgot about you and feel like you an Martez and some of your other points
came off transition buckets early before they could get set up?  
DEMARCUS HOLLAND: Well, we focus on getting stops and we know we wanted to
run. And I know once we got the rebound, I was going to run my lane and
execute the game plan. And Isaiah was able to get to it me sometimes and kick
it early, and I was able to go in and finish.  
  
Q. Cameron, if you talk a little bit about physically playing against a guy
that big and what it was like to go up against a guy like that?  
CAMERON RIDLEY: It was a tough matchup. I never played against a guy 7-2, so
it was something new. He has great foot work. He knows how to get around the
defender to get what he wants. He's a great player. Really tough to match up
with.  
THE MODERATOR: While we wait for another question, Cameron, I know you're
obviously a very low-key guy, but how would you compare that moment tonight
with your whole career? Is that the highlight to this point?  
CAMERON RIDLEY: To this point it's the highlight. I've never made a game
winner in my life. To walk off the court and know that you're the one who made
the play to take us to the next round was a great feeling. Next game we don't
want to come down to a game winner, but anybody on the team could have made
that play, but I was just so happy to be the one who did it this time.  
  
Q. Cameron, it didn't look like there was any, but was there any doubt on
the final shot that it had gone in?  
CAMERON RIDLEY: There wasn't any doubt. I shot the ball with confidence. I
really tried to get it out of my hands as quick as possible because I knew the
shot -- the game clock was going out. I kind of -- I mean, I had confidence
going in when I shot it.  
  
Q. Demarcus, how did it affect y'all's offense when Javan got in foul
trouble and had to sit so much of the first half and Jonathan didn't seem to
have his game offensively in the first half?  
DEMARCUS HOLLAND: Although we didn't execute as we would like to, Martez
Walker came in and he ran the floor and he hit some open shots and was able to
pick up some fouls. We were okay.  
  
Q. Cameron, I'm not sure if you actually remember, Herb Sendek said he
thought maybe the ball actually hit the ground before someone grabbed it or
before you grabbed it. Is that what happened?  
CAMERON RIDLEY: Yeah, it looked like one of the Arizona State players actually
probably caught it and dropped it and hit the ground and came -- I seen it hit
the ground and just tried to get it as quick as possible and put up a shot.  
  
Q. Demarcus, six players finished in double figures tonight. Martez again
had another big day. Was this the type of total team win y'all have sort of
been building towards?  
DEMARCUS HOLLAND: Yeah. We like when everybody can get touches, and we didn't
have one guy that we feel like we have to go to every game to win. To win
games, we feel anybody can step up any night, and I think just us having six
guys in double figures just shows how much depth we have.  
  
Q. Demarcus, just talk about your feelings when you saw that go in, because
obviously there's a scramble, ball is on the court, you don't know if you're
facing overtime or not. Next thing you know, the ball is going in, the horn is
going off. What was that like for you guys?  
DEMARCUS HOLLAND: It was great. First of all, I thought Jonathan Holmes' shot
was going to go straight through. I crashed anyway. The ball bounced Cam's
way. So from that point on, I knew the clock was low and everybody was
reaching for the ball. I just saw Cam muscle it up and get it up on the glass.
It was a great feeling. It was like a welcome to the March Madness.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Demarcus or Cameron? Thanks guys, appreciate
it.  
Now questions for Coach Barnes.  
  
Q. Coach, this is a little random, last year at Iowa State, two seasons ago
when Demarcus really kind of came on, played really well, you seemed to have a
lot of confidence, can you talk about how he's come from then to where he is
tonight and the kind of performance he put together?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I think every coach in the country would like to have
Demarcus Holland because what you've seen him do night in and night out, he
does it every day in practice. He's learned a lot this year in the way people
at times, they don't guard him, but I think he's a big-time impact player. He
finds a way to affect a game every time he's on the floor. He did a really
nice job tonight at point. We put him there. We used him there.  
We know that, I'm looking at right here where I think he played 35 minutes, he
could go out right now and play another 35 minutes. He just never stops. The
team, you ask any of the young guys, they will tell you what an inspiration he
has been to them in terms of the way that they've watched him do it every
single day and when he gets on runs -- our transition game was early. He
thrives on that. When he's really good is when his teammates take the shots
they should take, that's where he can really impact plays and run down balls
and do those type of things.  
THE MODERATOR: You've had a lot of great wins at Texas and other places. How
sweet was this one?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, again, I'm humbled because my feelings for Herb and
his team and -- but for our guys, we had one guy that had NCAA experience and
we were really good for the most part, and then we went through a period on
offense where we really bogged down, we lost our flow. But you always -- you
know they're explosive. Knew they were going to break loose a little bit and
get some things. They were so well coached, took advantage of some mismatches
we were having to go back and forth.  
You come into the game and you would expect two guys, John and Javan to play,
and Javan was terrific. He really set a good tone for us and picked up two
fouls. But the one thing that came out of the Big 12 Tournament was the play
of Martez Walker and even Kendal tonight. He's the guy that we wanted to keep
the shooters out there as much as we could. Great team win. Really a great
team win.  
And, like I said earlier, obviously delighted and excited for our team, but
tough when you have so much respect for the other team and the coaches.  
  
Q. Rick, what play were you looking for on that last possession center? Was
it just one guy go and take the shot, or did you have something really set
up?  
COACH RICK BARNES: It's the way we drew it up, yeah (laughter). And the one
before that, too.  
We've struggled at times this year with the clock, and what happened was we
did have a play on. We weren't going to use a timeout. We wanted to go from
there. Isaiah in that situation has to get to Javan's side. Most of the time
we work from the right side. In that situation, he's got to get the ball over
there and then, you know, he waited too long. He waited and goes and puts John
in a really tough situation.  
They really defended that really well and just a loose ball, and Cam does have
great hands. If he gets his hands on the ball, most times it's the way he
finishes. I've watched him miss some of those, but that's where his instincts
take over. We were fortunate. I mean -- and in bounces in basketball. It's a
shame because that game you guys watch it. A great game. I'm looking at the
numbers and stats. They had one, two, three -- four guys in double figures, we
had six. Just teams making shots and -- but we were fortunate. There's no
question there at the end and -- but for my guys, I'm obviously excited
because I do think they had prepared well, and when it wasn't going well, we
still found a way to make some plays.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you. Congratulations. See you
tomorrow.  
COACH RICK BARNES: Thank you guys.

### [Jordan Bachynski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25038)

### [Jahii Carson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24953)

### [Herb Sendek](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19594)

  
_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  

Texas  87  
Arizona State  85

  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Jahii Carson and Jordan Bachynski. We'll have an opening
statement first from Coach Herb Sendek, and then we'll release them and then
questions for Coach Sendek.  
Coach, your opening remarks. A great game, but obviously a painful finish.  
COACH HERB SENDEK: I'd like to congratulate Texas on a great win and a hard-
fought basketball game. I have nothing but the highest regard for Coach Barnes
as a person and as a coach, and he's done a remarkable job at Texas for a long
time.  
I'm extremely proud of the men to my left as well as all the guys in the
locker room. I thought they played their hears out, hung in there when we were
down at different stretches of the game, and gave themselves a chance to win
at the end.  
These two men to my left have had outstanding careers at Arizona State. It's
been an honor and a great pleasure to coach them as well as all of our
seniors. So, thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you just -- that last defensive play there, seemed like maybe
the shot -- I don't know if it hit a different part of the backboard, but what
did you see on the last play?  
JORDAN BACHYNSKI: It's a tough one. It's a tough way to end the game. It's a
tough way to end my career. I was playing for -- most rebounds come off long,
and I was playing for that. Like you said, it just took a funny bounce and my
man read the ball better than I did. He got the rebound and the bucket.  
  
Q. For either of you, what was the biggest problem in the second half that
you couldn't get over the hump there by the end?  
JORDAN BACHYNSKI: They're a great team. Like Coach said, they battled hard.
They played hard, they rebound well, they shot the ball well, and it was a
tough game.  
  
Q. Jahii, did you get the sense you kept having to come back and come back
and come back? Did you ever always feel the sense that right at the end it
would come down to the last shot?  
JAHII CARSON: We knew when we were confident that our teammate was going to
knockdown the two free throws that he made and we knew that was going to come
down to one stop. Rebound has basically been our Achilles heel the whole
season, but I thought we rebounded pretty well the whole game, you know. You
know, every team has a little bit of mental lapses. Yeah, coming down in
March, every game is pretty much decided by one possession and that one
possession didn't fall our way.  
  
Q. Jordan, just wondered, Jordan, you said you would be focused for the
game. You also would try and soak it in, knowing that your four years kind of
led to this. I know it's probably hard right now, but are you able to reflect
on the kid who played at Centennial High School in Calgary who was able to
spend his four years at Arizona State and take yourself all the way to March
Madness and that far in your one game here?  
JORDAN BACHYNSKI: No, I haven't really had time to reflect yet. The game is
still really fresh. I was just going to go out there and work as hard as I
could and do what I could for my team. It was a tough one. Over the next few
weeks, I guess I'll have time to reflect, but I'm not there yet.  
  
Q. Jahii, with 12 minutes to go, you guys were down 14 points. Things were
coming pretty difficult for you on offense. What changed it?  
JAHII CARSON: We decided that the game wasn't over, there's a lot of time left
on the clock, and that we have more energy and effort to give both offensively
and defensively. We started doing a lot of double drags, which was causing
them to switch off me and John, and the big fella hit shots and we were
playing with a lot more energy. And that's when we got back into the game, we
was playing with a lot more energy back and forth between our defensive end
and offensive end. We gave a lot of energy on the defense end, which fueled
our offensive game and fueled our energy. So playing good defense, that pretty
much fuels your offensive game. Guys are confident. That's what happened when
we got back in the game.  
  
Q. Jahii, could you tell us some of your emotions as that shot went in? To
lose a game in that fashion. It with a heck of a ballgame, but a disappointing
end.  
JAHII CARSON: It's tough. We felt we were keeping them off the back boards
pretty much down the stretch and in the second half, and when we had -- when
they got the ball coming down for the last shot, we felt confident. I saw
everybody in a great defensive stance, and everybody had the look their man
wasn't going to score. He took a long contested three. The ball didn't bounce
our way and, you know, things happen that way. But, it was tough, especially
on a game when the buzzer, last second shot for any game is tough, but
especially for this one since it's March Madness that we wanted to get this
win so bad. It's just very emotional for all of us.  
  
Q. Jahii, you said several times during the season this would be your last
season. So with this, I guess, being your last game, how would you look back
on your career?  
JAHII CARSON: Very happy and pleased with my career here at Arizona State.
I've had great coaches, I've had great mentors, people to help guide me, just
not in the basketball aspect of my life, but outside, my personal life. I've
had great teammates, great supporting cast. My family supported me. You know,
it's great. I look back at it and I have no regrets.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you just describe you played against some pretty talented
post men all year. Cameron Ridley has some size to him. What was it like
banging inside with him?  
JORDAN BACHYNSKI: You know, he's a great player and he's tough. He's a big
body, like you said, and he posts well, and he finishes the ball around the
hoop. He's a great post player.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Jahii or Jordan? Thanks guys, appreciate it.  
Now questions for Coach Sendek, please.  
  
Q. Coach, what were the efforts that the guys staged to come back from that
14-point lead? You finally got over the hump to get yourself a lead. What's
does this say?  
COACH HERB SENDEK: It's really a high character group of men. They've been in
this position before. We've been down double digits in the second half, and
they've rallied the make good comebacks. They just keep playing, and then the
next play, next team all day season. Right now, I can tell you it's a very
emotional heart broken locker room.  
  
Q. Herb, I know you were trying to focus on Ridley and maybe Felix a little
bit. Did y'all not pay enough attention to strike Demarcus Holland on the wing
and Martez Walker and they were able to take advantage of that?  
COACH HERB SENDEK: Ridley does command a lot of attention and sometimes even
if you're not trapping a second defender, he's really an impressive young
front court player. Likewise, the bookend, Jonathan Holmes. But those are good
players. They have a good team. It's not like we were unaware of their talents
but, you know, sometimes Ridley does draw an extra defender, more attention.
But as much as anything, especially in the first half, we were hurt in
transition. You know, we didn't do a real good job of getting matched up in a
couple instances, and, you know, they really took advantage of our early
turnovers. And I thought, you know, the transition game that Texas had,
especially in the first half, was as significant as anything.  
  
Q. Herb, I think there were 116 shots taken in the game. Was that the kind
of game you wanted to play today?  
COACH HERB SENDEK: Well, I think you had two uptempo, fast-breaking teams
going against each other, and, you know, even early on, you know, I know our
defense could have been better, but both teams were making shots. I mean, even
sometimes if you have a defensive lapse or a breakdown, you know, they let you
off the hook and miss the shot.  
You know, you got to credit both teams with really shooting the basketball
very well tonight. Guys made shots and sometimes they made challenged shots.  
  
Q. Herb, the first half the team only gave up one offensive rebound in the
second half, nine offensive rebounds. Now you say before coming to this game,
how you knew how good this team was on the offensive rebounding end. What went
wrong in the second half?  
COACH HERB SENDEK: I think all things considered, it was actually one of our
better defensing rebounding efforts. The numbers a little skewed because they
shot such a high percentage. There aren't as many opportunities to get
offensive rebounds, but I think the last five points that they scored were off
offensive rebounds, and in each instance a very unconventional offensive
rebound.  
You know, one was an air ball that they happened to catch and score three-
point play on, and then the last play of the game -- correct me if I'm wrong
-- but I think the ball even hit the floor and Ridley just corralled it and
went up and scored.  
So, the last five points of the game, you know, came on, you know, if you
want, bounces or flights that, you know, didn't land in our hands. I don't
know if it was a function of us not blocking out or anything like that, but
typically you point to it rebounding. But we got them to take two pretty tough
shots and it resulted in five Texas points. That's a tough swallow.  
  
Q. Coach, the guys talked about the 12-minute-mark timeout and the refocus
right there to start the comeback. Can you talk about what was discussed to
help refocus the team?  
COACH HERB SENDEK: I think our guys did a great job of staying together,
staying positive, you know. Their hearts were always in the right place. They
had tremendous communication and timeouts with each other. They encouraged
each other. You know, they believed in each other. We had really good,
positive timeouts, even when we were trailing, and the guys just kept
battling. And, you know, basketball is a game of runs. The other team has a
run, you have a run, and this one ultimately came down to the wire.  
THE MODERATOR: Herb, despite the disappointing ending, how would you assess
the season for the guys?  
COACH HERB SENDEK: Obviously I'm really proud of our team, Doug. I think our
guys had a really good season. Obviously, you know, they're going to realize
that once the emotion of the moment subsides. But our guys had a really good
basketball season, and I think, you know, our basketball program has a lot of
positive momentum, and we've made a lot of progress, and ultimately I'm very
proud of our men.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you.  
COACH HERB SENDEK: Thanks.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS:
MILWAUKEE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+MILWAUKEE)

  

## March 20, 2014

  

### [Dana Altman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20487)

### [Johnathan Loyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25072)

### [Joseph Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26639)

  
_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  

Oregon  87  
BYU  68

  
THE MODERATOR: Oregon Coach Dana Altman will open with a statement and take
questions for Oregon student-athletes, Joseph Young and Johnathan Loyd. Coach,
congratulations. Your statement, please.  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: Well, we had some guys really play well in the second half.
Elgin Cook had a great game and really finished everything down low, and once
they made the run and got it to three, I thought he made a big play there and
got a three-point play. Then we got some stops and we were able to pull away.  
BYU is a very good offensive team and Dave does such a good job, you know,
Collinsworth being out, you know, did hurt. We had a heck of a game with them
at our place and the difference was Collinsworth not being in there, because
he is a really talented guy, does a lot of things for them.  
So, you know, it was a benefit for us that he wasn't able to play. The fact
that Elgin, who had a good game in Eugene when we played them, had a great
game today. So, I think that was the difference in the ballgame.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. For either of you two. Could you tell that Elgin was pretty fired up
about being home and would you have expected this from him, based on what you
saw in practice and the locker room?  
JOHNATHAN LOYD: Yeah. I knew he was fired up right from the selection show. He
found out it was in Milwaukee. He's been hyped ever since then. I expected him
to play, play inspired basketball. Every time you have a homecoming, you play
in front of your friends and family, you get inspired. I was expecting this
for sure.  
THE MODERATOR: Maybe if both the you, Johnathan and Joseph, can talk about --
I know it's fresh in your mind, but facing Wisconsin in their home state on
Saturday.  
JOHNATHAN LOYD: I can say it's going to be a road game, obviously. But, you
know, we're a pretty good road team. Just from watching them a little today,
they have good inside presence, you know, guards can shoot the ball. They play
real disciplined basketball, real fundamentally sound.  
We'll have our work cut out. We'll have to play good basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Joseph.  
JOSEPH YOUNG: Good team. Just got to come out and have the intensity on
defense. They're at home. We're a good road team. We come in as a family and
as a whole team. It should be good.  
  
Q. Joseph, what did you guys talk about in the huddle after they hit the
three-pointer and cut it down to three, kind of a big run for them?  
JOSEPH YOUNG: We just -- everybody got together and said, we've been here
before, don't put your head down. We need to go back out there and play team
ball and just execute, commit to defense, and get the rebound off the
defensive end. And I felt like we did a good job on that part and came out and
got stops, and we won the ballgame.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes? All right. Thank you
very much.  
Questions for Coach Altman, please.  
  
Q. Dana, could you see this coming with Elgin, or was this just a matter of,
you know, as Dave Rose said, there's a lot of the penetration and he got
open?  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: I thought we did a good job of hiding him along the
baseline. They went to the zone and we got some penetration and lot of good
passes to him on the baseline. Richard hit him for one. I think John had six
assists, couple of them were to him. I thought our guys did a good job of
finding him, but I thought his movement in finding the holes in the zone was
really good and then he finished. I think he was eight for nine from the
field.  
So, not only do you have to get the ball down there, but he was in traffic and
he finished, and I think he went five for five from the free throw line in the
second half. He missed a couple free throws that first half, but the second
half I thought he hit them all. I think he really got going with those two
offensive rebounds in the second half that he got and got put backs on. I
thought that really helped him get going.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you haven't had much time to prepare yet. What are your
initial thoughts about Saturday's matchup with Wisconsin?  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: We know they're a very good basketball team. They're very
well coached. Bo does a great job. They're talented. We're going to have a
hard time matching up with the big fella inside, you know.  
So, it's going to be a tough matchup for us. We won't have a lot of people
cheering for us, and so the atmosphere will be tough, but that's okay. You
know, our guys will look forward to the challenge. You know, they've earned
the right to play in their region as a No. 2 seed, and so we've just got to
overcome that.  
It's going to be a great challenge for our team, but, you know, our team has
been bouncing back all year and I think they'll be ready to go on Saturday.
We're going to have to play really well. They're a good team, and when you
play good teams, you got to bring your A game and we're going to have to play
really, really good basketball.  
  
Q. Dana, what does it say about your team, your inside defense, that Moser
has four fouls and hardly plays in the second half and you're still able to
play the way you did?  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: I thought Richard stepped up and really gave us some good
minutes. Ben didn't play very many minutes, but his seven minutes were pretty
good. Wave did okay. Those three guys held down the five spot pretty well. And
then when Mo didn't play real well, Elgin stepped in and played great, you
know. So from that position with Mo only getting seven, we still got 30
points, you know. So the four spot was pretty good for us because Elgin played
so well.  
You know, that's what you like from a ball team, that you got some depth so
that one player gets in trouble and -- foul trouble, that you have somebody
else step up, and in this case, with Mike with his foul trouble, Elgin really
stepped up.  
You know, I think we had 49 points off the bench, you know, so that's a heck
of a stat with Jason coming in, Rich coming in and Elgin, obviously getting
sponge points, but we had 40 some points off the bench.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you. Congratulations. See you
tomorrow.  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: Thank you.

_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Tyler Haws and Anson Winder from Brigham Young University.
Questions, please.  
  
Q. Tyler, when you guys got the bid and were in the tournament, there were
some national experts who basically said you didn't belong, that you shouldn't
have got the bid. What would your reaction be to that and is that going to be
any kind of motivation for you guys?  
TYLER HAWS: You know, we don't pay attention a lot to what people say about
us, but we're pretty confident we should be in the tournament and we've got to
go prove ourselves.  
  
Q. Tyler, how important is it for BYU's program to be recognized as an NCAA
Tournament team? This is seven out of Dave's nine years, and to be able to get
in. Is it important that everybody perceives BYU as an NCAA Tournament team?  
TYLER HAWS: For sure. That's our goal at the beginning of every year is to get
in this tournament and to make some noise. And so I think it's really
important for our program, and we're definitely proud to be in the tournament
and want to win some games.  
  
Q. Anson, as far as what you guys are seeing of Oregon on films since you
last watched them, where are they a different team?  
ANSON WINDER: Well, coming in we know their guards score a lot of their points
along with there three man, Mike Moser. We know we're going to have to guard
them and guard the three-point line like we have through these last few weeks.
They score most of their points and that they're tough down, all their bigs
are strong and aggressive. We have to contain their guards overall.  
  
Q. Both you guys, how much did that loss stay from December and how much is
it an incentive for you guys? And as a follow-up, how different is it going to
be not having Kyle with you and how did you make up with the loss of him?  
TYLER HAWS: That loss definitely it stung a little bit definitely, because we
were up, I think, 8 or 9 in the second half. So we know we can play with these
guys. We're looking forward to the game. You can't replace a guy like Kyle. He
does so much for our team, but I think our guys are ready to step up and
excited for the challenge.  
  
Q. For both guys, a little bit along this same lines, how has the team
regrouped in the last week or so without Kyle and collectively how do you
replace the different things he does?  
ANSON WINDER: I think in practice coaches have been stressing for us to be
more aggressive and just to make plays when we have the opportunity. We're
losing so much without having Kyle that we'll have to make up for rebounds,
assists, and points. It just means that everyone has to be more aggressive and
step up to the challenge. I think we're all pretty excited about coming out
and playing and hopefully going on a run.  
  
Q. Tyler, has it felt like four years since you yourself have been on this
stage at the NCAA Tournament? Long time? Short time?  
TYLER HAWS: You know, it doesn't feel like that long ago, actually. I mean, it
was 2010, but lots of our guys have NCAA experience and hopefully we can use
that to our advantage.  
  
Q. For either one of you, what can you take from that earlier loss to Oregon
and apply to this game, if anything?  
THE MODERATOR: Maybe Tyler first and then Anson, please.  
TYLER HAWS: I think just the fact that we know we can play with them. We know
their guys, we know their stuff they've, run and so it should give us
confidence that we can go out and win a basketball game.  
ANSON WINDER: Yeah, I think like what Tyler said, coming down the stretch we
were up, so I think that's a good sign coming into the game. It shows that we
can hang with them and we had a chance to beat them. It's an exciting feeling.  
  
Q. Anson, you guys struggled from three-point range in the West Coast
Conference Tournament. How important is it to get that shooting back from long
range in this tournament?  
ANSON WINDER: It will be important, especially because that's such a big part
of our offense, especially now with Kyle out, we'll probably shoot a little
bit more 3s. We didn't shoot as well as we would like in the conference
tournament. We're trying to get our confidence up and hopefully shoot better
in this tournament.  
  
Q. Anson, if you could answer the same question I asked Tyler about
motivation, and then also will you be looking to be more productive
offensively in the absence of Kyle? Is that one role they've asked you to take
on?  
ANSON WINDER: Yeah. I think our whole team has to be more aggressive, myself
included. Like I said before, we're losing so much without having Kyle that
we'll have opportunities to step up and make plays and we'll have to be more
aggressive in transition and in our sets. That's a challenge we'll have to
step up and have to deal with, and overall with the motivation of this
tournament and having a loss, it's a competitive factor. We want to come in
and compete, and that's what we've done all year and we're excited for the
challenge.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions? All right. Gentlemen, thank you very much.
Good luck.  
Please welcome BYU head coach, Dave Rose. Maybe a general comment or two just
about your team and your expectations for this weekend, and then we'll open up
for questions, please.  
COACH DAVE ROSE: Well, we're excited to be here in Milwaukee. I think that
it's more like March here in Milwaukee as far as the weather is concerned than
it was in Utah. When we left Utah, it was 60 degrees. This feels more like
basketball weather, so we're excited to be here. I think our team is really
looking forward to our first round -- second round match-up with Oregon. It's
a team we've played, and it was a little surprising when the brackets were
released, but in a lot of ways, I think it's kind of beneficial to be able to
play somebody that you've already prepared for and you have a scouting report
for and familiarity. And as we go back and watch films of the last eight, ten
games, Oregon keeps playing really well and will be a lot of challenges for
us, but we look forward to it.  
THE MODERATOR: Question, please.  
  
Q. Coach, of your seven NCAA Tournament appearances, would this have been
the season with maybe the most in-season adversity to overcome and how will
the characteristic of resiliency serve you ideally against Oregon in this
tournament?  
COACH DAVE ROSE: I think that as far as challenges during the year, we've had
quite a few this year. And I think that's the thing that this group is
probably, you know, most proud of is the fact we've overcome quite a few
challenges to get here to the NCAA Tournament, and now hopefully we can
overcome another hurdle, which is the loss of Kyle Collinsworth, our starting
point guard, one of our leaders in points scored and assists and rebounds. But
what we've always said going through the season and the issues you have to
deal with is that basically what that is is an opportunity for other players
to step up. And we have good players and we're fortunate that the position,
you know, we'll start a guy in a position who started over 70 games for us in
Matt Carlino. We're bringing experience into that position, and hopefully we
can have some guys on the bench that will really step up their play here in
the tournament.  
  
Q. Dave, this is seven out of nine for you in the NCAA Tournament. How
important is it for BU's program to be recognized as an NCAA Tournament team
and also how critical was the non-conference schedule to get you to this
point?  
COACH DAVE ROSE: Well, I said this before and what I really want for our
players who come to BYU is to be able to have this experience. I remember as a
player, the two NCAA tournaments I was able to play in, it's like nothing
else. It's a life experience that you relate to forever. And I think that
that's what I want for our players, and the fact that we've been able to get
back here seven of the nine years is, I think, a real tribute to the guys and
to our assistant coaches. And I'm happy for this group because this group went
through some real challenges in November, December, and we flew from one end
of the country to the other, playing really good basketball teams. We had a
lead against Wichita State in the second half and that gets away from us and
we don't win that game. Our guys were kind of crushed. At the time we didn't
know Wichita State was going to win 34 games in a row. We played UMass back in
Springfield and Stanford at Oregon. So we had quite a few road games where our
guys were really tested. The Iowa State game at home always sticks with us
because it was a two-point game an one we thought we could win, up 12 at one
time in that game. They've gone on to have a great year. The challenges that
our guys have been through, I think there's confidence in that, but hopefully
that will help us in this game on Thursday.  
  
Q. Dave, can you talk a little BIT about Carlino's season, kind of ups and
downs, ebbs and flows, kind of what you expect from him stepping back into the
starting role?  
COACH DAVE ROSE: Personally I think Matt has had his best season since he's
been here. When you come off the bench as a sixth man, it seems from a public
opinion or from a media opinion that maybe his season has been tarnished, but
in reality I think his play has been so consistent and so steady for our team
that he's been a huge factor in our success. And we need Matt to play well for
our team to be successful, and that will probably step up a little more
because he'll get probably get a few more minutes.  
But his ability to be able to not only score the ball, but he can really
deliver passes on time in our half-court sets and in transition, and that's a
huge -- a big key for the other players around him, and that will be Matt's
biggest challenge is trying to get the ball to the guys at the right time.  
This Oregon team is so long and so athletic and they're just really quick to
everything, and Matty is going to have do a really good job of finding our
guys at the right time so they can deliver the ball and be able to score.  
  
Q. You mentioned some of the other kind of heartbreaks and losses that stuck
with you. How long did the Oregon loss stay with your guys and how do you
think that that can serve them tomorrow?  
COACH DAVE ROSE: Oregon is a bad loss, one of the worse of the season because
it came right at the Christmas time, and so you leave the guys at the locker
room and send them back to where they're going to go to spend Christmas and
brought them back Christmas night.  
The fact that we had a lead late in that game and kind of got away from us.
But what they did to us the last few minutes in regulation and the last -- and
in the overtime is what they kind of have done the last ten, 12 games in the
Pac-12, is where they have really dominated the glass, shot the ball at a
great percentage especially from the three-point line, and then Johnathan Loyd
has been terrific at running that team and getting the ball anywhere he wants
on the floor and being able to deliver to it scorers in prime positions.  
That will be a big key for us, trying to control his penetration, his ability
to get the ball to their scorers.  
  
Q. How has the practice time helped you since Kyle's injury in terms of
getting the guys past what happened and putting them back into what you want
to do without Kyle?  
COACH DAVE ROSE: Well, I think we've been fortunate in that way because the
first day of practice when Kyle wasn't there, it was an emotional wreck with
our guys. Everybody would try to go through the motions and play hard. The
feel in the gym was basically everybody feeling sorry for Kyle or maybe
feeling sorry for themselves or whatever the problem was. But the fact that
we've been able to have three, four practices and then the shot of adrenaline
on Sunday being in the tournament and having a second round game instead of a
first round team, everybody talked about us being one of the last teams in and
the last couple practices have been really great.  
The guys have been enthusiastic. I think we felt way more like ourselves. Kyle
had surgery yesterday. And so coming out of practice a lot of the guys were
really interested in how the surgery went and how he was going to be. But for
the most part, I think hopefully physically and emotionally in our practice we
have moved on from the loss of Kyle and hopefully we'll play well.  
  
Q. Coach, what are some of the ways specifically as a team collectively you
can compensate for what Kyle does that you're playing the first game without
him?  
COACH DAVE ROSE: I think the most important thing is the aggressiveness of our
guys, and I think that the NCAA Tournament lights are really bright and you
get kind of an interesting game from all your guys, all your players, and what
you hope is we get a real consistent feel from not only the starters but the
guys who are going to get a few extra minutes. Skylar Halford who started for
us, had a 28-point game at our place against San Diego this year. So the guys
are capable of doing of job. Josh Sharp is another guy who can help with the
rebounding issues. He's a really athletic, explosive guy, and hopefully he can
perform well in his minutes. Frank Bartley who played really well for us early
in the season and then during conference didn't get as many minutes will get a
real opportunity. And what you want is just the guys to play their best. And
if we do that and we kind of manage the personnel and these guys are playing
their best basketball, then we'll be able to kind of maybe compensate for the
loss of Kyle.  
If we get into a different situation and we just rely on five guys, those five
starters, then it can be really tough for us.  
  
Q. I know Texas is not top of mind for you, but you guys beat them in non-
conference before they really got things figured out. Does anything stick out
to you about that game? And did you keep up with them as the season went on?  
COACH DAVE ROSE: Yeah. I think that the thing that sticks out the most is that
we played almost 40 minutes of zone, which is not like us at all. They're
athleticism and their size and strength really caused us some match-up
problems.  
We got in that zone and we kind of fought through that game the whole way,
then at the end really played well and closed the game out.  
The Texas win was absolutely huge for us in our resume late in the season
because of how they played. And really what I remember most about the Texas
game is the fact that we were on a roll, we played so well, and then we played
Wichita State the next night and had them down 13 at one point in the game and
let that get away. And I don't know why I remember that when you asked me
about Texas, but that's what I can remember (laughter).  
  
Q. For obvious reasons.  
Dave, if you could reply to some of these national guys who have said that BYU
is either overseeded or doesn't belong, would you reply, and if so, what would
that be?  
COACH DAVE ROSE: Probably I'd just tell them that if you would spend five
months with our team, you would have a whole different understanding or
reasoning or interpretation or feeling about our team because these guys
deserve to be here.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Coach, thank you. Good luck.  
COACH DAVE ROSE: Thanks a lot guys.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS:
MILWAUKEE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+MILWAUKEE)

### [Mike Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20740)

  
_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome Wofford student-athletes, Karl Cochran and
Skinner. Your questions, please.  
  
Q. Carl. Just talk about the experience. Has it hit you that you're in the
arena? Is it starting to hit you, the magnitude of the moment?  
KARL COCHRAN: Certainly. Ever since we punched our ticket last Monday, we knew
this time was coming. It was just a wait, and now the wait is done. We got a
few more hours, and then it's going to be game time.  
  
Q. For each of you, I guess when you look at the tape of Michigan and kind
of see what they bring to the table, what are kind of keys to pulling
something off tomorrow?  
LEE SKINNER: I mean, we've been studying film. They've got really good
players. They play some 1-3-1. Bigger than us. That's been the story all year
around whoever we play, we're a little bit smaller. So we'll have to do a good
job at rebounding, playing team defense how we do. Other than that, we're
going to play as hard as we can and enjoy the opportunity.  
KARL COCHRAN: We know they like to push the ball a little bit from what we
watched. Controlling the tempo is going to be a really big part of what we're
going to do. We can't let them speed us up. We certainly have to stop them in
transition. Other than that, we have a few more keys that we've been going
over all week. So as long as we stick to that, I'm pretty sure we'll be fine.  
THE MODERATOR: People on the outside looking may say, this mighty Michigan
from the Big Ten against Wofford, do you play on that, underdog status, do you
like that?  
KARL COCHRAN: They've been telling us that ever since the selection show. I
guess the mindset our whole team has had is we're not going to play the
numbers game. 15-2. Oh, well. 1-16. Oh, well. It's a basketball game. That's
our mindset. We're not going to overestimate them. They're just a team. They
can lose, we can lose. So, we're going to go into it with a nice humble
mindset and stick to what we do.  
  
Q. Have you guys saw, this happened twice last year, two 15 seeds win it?  
LEE SKINNER: We haven't talked much about it. Our mindset is that we're
focused on the next game, biggest game of the year. Just like every other
game, the next game is the biggest game on our schedule. We're not playing --
like Carl said, we're not playing to the numbers game. Our focus is what we
got to do, and we're just going to go out there and play our game and play as
a team and do exactly what we know how to do.  
  
Q. Either one of you, some of the Michigan players said they had never heard
of your school before. How did you -- I see the smile. How did you both come
to the school? Did you have other options? Was it a first choice for you? A
second choice? How did you end up there?  
LEE SKINNER: I played at prep school in Virginia where Coach Young played for
the same coach. I had a few other offers. I took one official visit and that
was to Wofford College, and that was during the time they went to the second
tournament. I met a lot of guys on the team, and it felt like just a community
and a family that I wanted to be a part of. I didn't have to go anywhere else
to know that Wofford was where I wanted to play. On top of that, the academics
at Wofford is like no other.  
It was pretty easy for me. I went one-on-one visit, met everybody, and I fell
in love pretty much. So, it was an easy choice for me.  
KARL COCHRAN: Hate to say it, home is where heart is. When I came to Wofford,
I played with some of the older guys like Cameron Rundles and Jamar Diggs,
they kind of like adopted you even though you were on a visit, they adopt you.
You kind of fall in love with the team chemistry. It's nice when people flash
like the records, how many times they've been to tournament and all that. But
when you see a team that loves each other, loves everybody like a brother,
it's hard to walk away from that.  
  
Q. Is it intimidating at all to be on the big stage, national television and
in the NCAA Tournament, or is there a certain sense of pride being a number 15
seed coming from a small school and representing that?  
LEE SKINNER: I love it. I love, you know, being underestimated and people not
knowing who we are, giving us the chance to spread our name.  
It's not really intimidating. We're just really lucky to be here and we're
enjoying every second of it. So, I mean, we're not -- I mean, as much as
nerves go, they'll be some butterflies and there has been just thinking about
the game. Other than that, we're just excited. We'll really excited.  
  
Q. Would you guys talk about what it's like to have two coaches that have
played in the NCAA, Tim Johnson and Kevin Giltner?  
KARL COCHRAN: They can help you a lot. They've really been giving us a lot of
knowledge, lot of experience from that aspect. It just helps a lot. They tell
you the necessary things you need to know when you get to a stage like this. I
mean, it helps a lot, especially when they've been here twice, especially two
times in a row. We're going to feed off the knowledge that they have and try
to bring that to the game.  
LEE SKINNER: I have to say we're pretty lucky for Tim to have played the
position I'm playing and Giltner played the position Karl is playing. Not only
them telling us how it's going to be in the tournament, they've been here and
done that, but just the playing part of it. Also, like, you know, they could
help us in practice and what to work on and this didn't work for me, I'll give
you a couple different ideas what you can do. You use the best one that works
for you, stuff like that. It helps so much. And then just more than coaches,
they're like brothers to us, too, at the same time.  
So there's kind of a link between players and coaches there that we get that I
don't know if a lot of other teams get. We really admire that.  
  
Q. Is there a team that reminds you of Michigan, especially what they do
offensively that you've faced this season and before?  
KARL COCHRAN: Certainly in our conference, I guess, the team that's kind of
the best is Elon and Davidson because of how they like the play as far as
their speed. Doesn't matter if you make a shot or pull a rebound off the rim,
they like to push in transition and try to get a basket as quick as they can.
So it's nice that we've seen kind of their game style before, but I guess our
biggest challenge will be to try to play up to that level of skill that they
have being a Big Ten team. I mean, it's good that we've seen it before, but
now we're going to have to upgrade our defense tenfold to try to match their
offense.  
  
Q. Some of the Michigan players kind of compared your style to Wisconsin and
slowing the game down, kind of valuing possessions. Is that kind of the key
maybe to an upset tomorrow, is prolonging the game full and really dictating
your pace, your tempo?  
KARL COCHRAN: That will probably be one of the biggest factors, especially if
we can cut down their baskets in transition and force them to try to score
points in the half court set versus our defense.  
As far as that, another big part of the game is just going to be who wants it
more. We're going to try to go out there and be the tougher team. We know
they're a tough team. We've seen them on film. We're going to have to play
that much harder and try to fumble them into our style of play.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Karl and Lee, thank you. Good luck.  
Please welcome to the stage Coach Mike Young. Maybe a few introductory words
and we'll open up for questions, please.  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: Excited to be in Milwaukee representing Wofford college, the
Southern Conference, great city of Spartanburg for a third time in five years.
We have our hands full obviously playing the terrific Michigan Wolverine team,
but we've about done with our preparations and ready for the thing to go in
the air and look forward to getting over here tomorrow and getting after it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions.  
  
Q. Mike, do you in any way try to latch on to the history of 15s versus 2s?
I mean, obviously a 16 has never beat a 1. There is a track record, or at
least a precedent, for 15.  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: I haven't. I haven't. You know, we've been a 13, we've been
a 14, this year a 15. You know, there are basketball people, I'm sure they've
heard that in the myriad of, you know, broadcasts that they've seen and things
that they did leading up to it. But it's not something that I've tried to
force upon them.  
We're going to try like crazy to do what we do and do it well, and it's going
to have to be awfully, awfully well tomorrow, and do everything possible to
give ourselves a shot and try to win one of these things. We been close a
couple times.  
Tomorrow I will be -- it will be an uphill climb as well simply because it's
Michigan and it's Coach Beilein. Last time I checked they've got pretty good
players.  
  
Q. What's the thing that impresses you the most about them?  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: You know what impresses me most about them is their skill.
They pass the ball well. They cut really well. They shoot the basketball one
through four and then off the bench with Albrecht and Zak Irvin. I guess
there's a lot of things that impress me. I'm most impressed with how skilled
they are. I'm just -- we've watched a lot of tapes since Sunday. They do not
turn the ball over. They do not beat themselves. They take great shots and
just good basketball players. That impresses me most.  
  
Q. Coach, Lee and Karl were here talking about getting recruited to Wofford
and talking about how much they love your program and that has got to mean an
awful lot to you as a coach?  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: You know, we've got -- you know this, we have a great place
with really nice people. They all graduate. They're taken care of. We're not
afraid to clear our throat on them when need be, but those two guys are
indicative of the type of person that we attract, high character guys that are
team first people. They love that college, and the college and Mike Young
certainly thinks the world of them. They make it a lot of fun to come to
practice every day. They make it a lot of fun to come to special times like
this, to enjoy the greatest tournament on earth with folks like those two
guys. That's what all about, great fun.  
  
Q. One ever your guys talked about how he loved being underestimated I guess
playing these types of games. I'm wondering how they've taken to the underdog
role the whole year and how that translates to their style of play on the
floor?  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: We talk about it being a journey, and this has been a real
journey for us. This kind of came upon -- we weren't very good -- weren't a
very good basketball team early on. We really took awhile to get our feet on
the ground and get squared away. And then as though a light switch came on, we
started playing good basketball and we won four in a row and then it was six
and then eight, nine. And then you wake up and it's late February and you
haven't lost in a long time. But for me as a coach, I've got my head down just
trying to win one more, and it's all a blur, as it typically is for me.  
You know, the underdog deal, you know, that's the way it is when Wofford comes
to games such as these and competes against the Badgers of Wisconsin and the
cougars of BYU. And in here tomorrow Michigan and our club, you know, you draw
upon whatever you can draw upon. I don't think we need any more motivation
than that, a storied program with a terrific coach and we're all on this
stage, you know. Let your hair down and you fight, you go at it and our team
will do that.  
  
Q. Coach, could you comment about your staff and what they meant to the
program this year?  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: We had an entirely different staff. We had -- Paul Harris
got a head coaching job at Division II level. We had an entirely different
staff and that -- I was concerned about it simply because we never been
together. But what those guys have done, I think they've made a -- made it
great fun for me and done a heck of a job with our team and player
development.  
Darris Nichols who played for Coach Beilein has been just a real blessing for
me to have him. He's a brilliant basketball guy, kind of taken a couple of
them under his wing. He's like with them all the time, Cochran and couple of
the others, Garcia, which has been a real shot in the shot in the arm.
Freshman point guard, we expected him to play a lot, and for him to be with
Darris, who was a terrific point guard in the Big East at West Virginia, that
was a big deal. Dustin Kerns is as good as I've ever been around and was
responsible for the great ones that we had back, you know, three, four, five
years ago. And then to have two former players, two great former players in
Kevin Giltner and Tim Johnson, who love the college, love our program, knows
the things that need to be communicated in the locker room when things aren't
going very well, when things are going well.  
You know, add all of that together, it's been a great chemistry within that
program, and I think teams recognize that. I think that's something that kids
see and recognize and becomes a big deal.  
  
Q. This day and age, the way coaches jump all the time and changing jobs,
you've been at one place for 25 years. What has kept you there?  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: Nobody else will have me (laughter). I love the school. I've
been there since 1989, some of the, you know, most wonderful people that I've
been around. You know, I came there as a wet-behind-the-ears assistant coach.
I was 25 years old when I came there. Our president at the time, Joe Lesesne
who now coaches football. Lot of neat silly stories. Danny Morrison was the
athletic director and now the president of the Carolina Panthers. Mike Ayers,
dear friend of mine, has been there 27 years as a football coach. My wife has
a great job in Spartanburg. She's a partner with Price, Waterhouse Coopers.
There's a number of reasons why I stay.  
I love, I absolutely, positively love the caliber of person I recruit. We have
the opportunity to recruit to Wofford because the academic standards, and
those are the type of young men that I want to surround myself with. I got an
11-year-old running around out there like a wild person. Those guys have a lot
of influence on him at this stage.  
When you're dealing with these guys that were just in here, those are great
representatives of our college and our community, and that's why I've stayed.  
  
Q. I saw something you posted on Twitter after you guys won the Southern
Conference the other night. Somebody said that buildings don't matter, Wofford
just made the NCAA Tournament. Do you think at some point they're going to get
you guys a new gym over there (laughter)? I think it's a fair question.  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: I think it's a fair question. I hope, I hope sooner rather
than later. We're in an age kids, bells and whistles sell, and we're heading
in that direction, I feel very strongly.  
  
Q. Coach, all the things you said just a moment before, has recruiting
gotten easier for you? You have kids from the Midwest, Colorado. Do you still
have to say "Wofford is" and explain it to the parents or do some of these
kids know now?  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: It's amazing, it's amazing with social media and the
exposure associated with this tournament. It's just -- it's fascinating to go
me, but at the end of the day, it's still recruiting. It's still knockdown,
drag out hard. But to be here and to text kids and call kids, boy, guys are a
lot more receptive. Kids understand the significance and kids want the play in
this deal for us to have done it three of the last five years. That speaks
volumes, to have done with it two different teams. But, has it made recruiting
easier? No. But it certainly doesn't hurt, doesn't hurt. But it's still tough.  
THE MODERATOR: Maybe the biggest lessons you've learned from the previous
trips to the tournament, and are you doing anything differently this time?  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: I'm not. Thinking back that experience in Jacksonville and
the experience in Denver, I liked our approach. I liked our kids' approach and
how they felt and behaved, you know, body language, that sort of thing going
into those. And this team has been no different. You walk out there in the
middle of that Bradley Center floor here in a moment and, you know, maybe you
see a little jitter here or there. But I want them to get lost in the game. I
want them to get lost of in that unbelievable environment and allow
themselves, you know, continue to do what they do, be great teammates, enjoy
-- take a moment to enjoy this and I'll tell them to do it. I'm going to do
it, enjoy this day, this environment.  
There's a lot of blood, sweat and tears that have gone into getting here, but
when the thing goes in the air, you know, I let it rip. Let it rip. We're not
going to be perfect, but we're going to have great time. We're going to play
really, really hard.  
  
Q. Coach, I had one more. I think you came here in '99 to play Marquette.  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: We did. Didn't turn out very well.  
  
Q. Marquette also had to get a new practice facility that helped the program
a great deal. Is your gym, your facilities, back home --  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: It's not the Palestra. It's not the Palestra. I'll put it to
you that way. It was built back when the rocks cooled, a long, long time ago.
Our facility presents some challenges. Let's put it that way. We've had kids
come on campus, walk in to our gym, the floor, the lighting, there's some
things about it that I love. Think of the hours that I've spent in that
building over 25 years. It's pretty mind-boggling. We do need a new facility.
We've had kids walk in in this era, we practiced in Marquette's practice
facility yesterday. My gosh, to have something like this, my stars, this is
unbelievable. We've had kids walk in and ask if this is our practice facility.
No. No. We compete right here and we practice here. So, yeah, it is our
practice facility (laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach?  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: Thanks, everybody.

_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  
THE MODERATOR: From my left to right it will be Ben Brust, senior, Josh
Gasser, a big reason for their success this season is he came back from injury
and first team all Big Ten member, Frank Kaminsky. Questions, please.  
  
Q. Frank, the big success you had this season, how hard was it waiting for
that success to come the first couple of years in the program here, and how
much are you your own toughest critic?  
FRANK KAMINSKY: If you look back at this program and see the people who have
come before me, you'll see it's a learning process with this program. You
know, you come in here your first couple years and get some experience, and
then as you get older, you're given more opportunities to play. And I waited
for that time since the moment I got here, and, you know, like I said, I am my
own toughest critic. I get down on myself a lot. I think it helps me in the
long run.  
  
Q. This is for all three of you guys, can you just give your opinions on
what makes Bo a good coach, and what is your funniest Bo story, if you've got
one?  
THE MODERATOR: Start with Ben and go right down the line.  
BEN BRUST: Coach Ryan demands a lot from you, and that's why we come here to
play. We know we're going to play good basketball. He wants us to play tough
and dive on loose balls and try to get 50/50 balls and try to do things to
help make the team successful.  
Funny story. There's so many every day that I can't pinpoint one for you right
now. I'll let them go and I'll brainstorm (laughter).  
JOSH GASSER: I think what makes Coach Ryan to special is he learns from the
past but he's always looking at what's next, the next practice, the next
possession. Just takes them one day at a time, one possession at a time, and
doesn't get too high or too low. And Coach Ryan is a really funny personality.
Not many people get to see him behind closed doors. He's got a great
personality, funny. He doesn't know how to pronounce names. I think that's
probably the funniest thing for me.  
FRANK KAMINSKY: With Coach Ryan, I will tell you he's so detailed oriented.
With everything we do, it's -- if we don't do it to the perfect details, you
know, he's upset with it. He's just so into everything. He examines everything
and really gives us the instruction from what he sees, and he sees everything
really well. Like Josh said, I think his funniest is his pronunciation with
names. It's pretty bad sometimes.  
  
Q. Josh and Ben, kind of following up on Bo, now that he knows what Mario
Kart is, are you going to challenge him? He had the controller upside down
with Nigel. Didn't know what to do.  
JOSH GASSER: I love to challenge him. He's a lot like us two. He doesn't like
to lose. He would do anything in his power, even if he's not as good as us, to
come up on top. That's just his personality. Hopefully we'll give him some
time on it off-season.  
BEN BRUST: He definitely sees me and Josh throwing controllers at each other.
He would want to join right in with us. That's the competitive guy he is. And
if he wasn't good at it right away, I'm sure he would want to get to our
level, which can't happen.  
  
Q. Josh, this question is for you. Being more of a hometown guy than these
other guys, can you quantify a home-court advantage now that you're here and
see all the Badger fans around your facility?  
JOSH GASSER: It's awesome. It just means that you did something special during
the year to get rewarded to play close to home. And it's great for my family,
these guy's family, to be semi close. Just to be able to experience NCAA
Tournament atmosphere is awesome for my family and friends and other people as
well.  
It's kind of a home-court advantage in a way, but, at the same time, once the
clock starts, once you get between the lines, it's all what we do and we
control that.  
  
Q. This is for all three of you. What did you know about American University
before you found out you were going to play them and what have you learned
about them since?  
BEN BRUST: Right away when we saw the matchup, Josh and I went to our phones
and went to their schedule to see who they played, you know, what their guys
were doing points-wise, rebounding-wise, just kind seeing their roster from
what we could, and then got right to try to get our video coordinator to send
us some stuff and just go from there.  
JOSH GASSER: Yeah. Now we got better understanding, obviously the Princeton
offense, which a lot of people notice right away. They run that really well.
It's a tough offense to defend. It's pretty hard to simulate. You got to have
time with it. They're going to be really crisp and fast with their cuts. I
think one underrated aspect of them defensively, they're pretty strong even if
you look at the schedule and scores, they limit opponents to a pretty low
amount. That means they're a pretty good defensive team.  
FRANK KAMINSKY: We got a couple practices under our belt now with them. So I
feel like we're way more familiar with them than we were maybe when we saw who
we were playing, and, you know, just familiar with their players, familiar
with bunch of their sets. So it's been nice to be able the see them, watch the
video on them. So we'll be ready for them.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions?  
  
Q. Frank, when were you high school and hit a growth spurt, how hard was it
to adjust to that and how did you keep the skills that you had when you were
shorter now that you're taller?  
FRANK KAMINSKY: You know, just -- it was -- I got into high school at 6' 2"
and left high school at 6' 10". I had a lot of growing to do both physically
and mentally, and, you know, I just -- I wanted to work hard, because, you
know, it didn't come easy. Sometimes I would just be running down the court
and trip over my own feet because I was just getting awkward. And I think just
growing into my body took a little bit of time because I did kind of have a
later growth spurt than most people. Keeping those skills just came with hard
work and trying to fine-tune everything.  
  
Q. Can you guys fathom what it would be like to win 700 games as Bo got with
the Minnesota victory? And do you think that enough people around the country
appreciate him or know everything that he's accomplished?  
BEN BRUST: Yeah. It's very special to be a part of that, and I think the
number 700 just shows if you're getting that many wins, you're doing a lot of
things right. As players we'd be smart to listen to a guy who has won that
many games because he's successful for a reason. You don't get 700 wins with
luck. He's doing something right, and, you know, Coach doesn't care what other
people think. He's the type of guy who wants to get stuff done and get it done
the right way, and we're just looking to continue what we can do.  
JOSH GASSER: Yeah, 700 wins is just ridiculous. Like Ben said, I'm just
honored to be a part of that, even a really small chunk of that. To help out
in any way. Just shows the consistency of him year in and year out. He's
always been successful, no matter how guys leave or coming in, what type of
roster he has. He's always successful. And I think consistency is probably the
best part about him.  
FRANK KAMINSKY: Also, I think he's got the system that's worked for him and
he's recruited people into his system and good people who he's always had a
good Staff around him and they've always been there for him and he's been a
great coach through all of that. And I think when you have a system like this
that works and you can keep going with it, you'll be successful and get 700
wins like that, it's a great accomplish.  
  
Q. Ben and Josh, when you guys went through that stretch of losing five of
six, how did that help you mentally getting ready for this point, going
through that adversity and still fighting through to get a two-seed and
getting you mentally prepared for a tournament run?  
BEN BRUST: Yeah, I think we did a good job of rebounding from that, but when
we were -- during that stretch, I think we did an even better job of staying
together and sticking together. And this group has stayed tight and didn't shy
away from each other at all. I think that kind of brought us through that and
is going to help us during this stretch right now.  
JOSH GASSER: Yeah. Losing five of six is never fun, but before that we were
16-0, feeling pretty darn good about ourselves and kind of thinking we're on
top of the world, can't be beat. Really, when you win 16 games, you think
you're doing everything perfect, but there's a lot of things we were doing
wrong. Sometimes losing a couple games can get your head back on track and
realize you can learn more from a loss than a win sometimes. I think we were
able to learn a lot about ourselves especially defensively, and I think that's
where the growth has come with our team.  
  
Q. Ben, last couple years Wisconsin basketball has kind of been known as
control the tempo, slow pace. This year's team, when you've had to, you've
been able to score in the '80s, '90s, even over 100 in one game. What's
different about this year's team that allowed you guys do that might have been
different from the past?  
BEN BRUST: We're not changing too much, but it definitely helps having guys
like Frank who can go inside and outside, guys like Nigel coming off the bench
to give a good inside presence. That opens up a lot for all the guys who put
out there, because every guy -- I don't want to say this to be mean to Nigel,
other than Nigel can really step out and shoot the 3. So it does help to have
an inside presence and be able to kick it out. Trae has done a good job of
controlling of the tempo. If he sees the opportunity to run, we'll do that.  
Ultimately when it's March, everyone is going to bring it. So got to get stops
and then got to try to put the ball in the hole. Simple game, but whoever does
it best will advance.  
  
Q. Looking at your schedule, specifically beginning of the season playing
against a lot of teams that are in the tournament now, specifically the one-
seeds, has that tough schedule prepared you guys for this tournament or is it
just the score or it's 0-0 going in here, the record?  
JOSH GASSER: It is a brand new year, obviously, but definitely you play in the
grueling season of Big Ten, playing road games at Michigan and a bunch of
other teams, I could go on and on, and then you challenge us a tough nine
conference schedule, you're definitely prepared for everything. We've been
through a lot as a team. We've played everyone anywhere so -- like I said,
it's a brand new season. All that stuff, we learn from it but it's kind of a
start over, refresher now.  
I think we can take some things in the past but also we've got to be ready for
what's to come.  
BEN BRUST: If you look at where we started, we played a lot of games in
different places. We played neutral site game to start off the year against
Saint John's team from the East. We played conference champions early on at
home and also we played Green Bay on the road. We played all these different
types of games and again some high seeded teams now.  
So you got to use all that of what you've been through. But as Josh said, you
got to take what you can from that, but also remember that you got to move on
and stay focused for this new season that we have and it's getting ready for
American.  
FRANK KAMINSKY: We've been prepared with a lot of different scenarios in
games, too. We've been up in games with big lead where we have to maintain it.
That there's been games where little bit of lead. There's games we've been
behind and step on the gas and come back. All the games in the conference and
non-conference schedule has really prepared us for what we can see in the
tournament.  
  
Q. Nigel Hayes, what has he brought to the team as a freshman and how do you
see him contributing on the court and the team chemistry?  
BEN BRUST: Nigel has done a good job of coming off the bench and bringing
spark and energy. Makes a lot of positive plays, whether it be defensively
getting a hand on some balls, or offensively when we touch the post with
Nigel, usually good things happen. He can make a pass out of there. He'll get
fouled or he'll score and get fouled. Pretty much when we're touching Nigel,
lot of good things are happening. It's good to have some good energy off the
bench.  
JOSH GASSER: Nigel is a beast. Anytime he gets the ball something good
happens, usually. As a freshman that's just a rare trait. I don't think he
realizes how good he can be sometimes, but yeah, on the court everyone sees
what he does. Off the court he's a great personality, fits in great with us.
Fun guy to be around, funny. Pretty much everything you want in a teammate, he
is.  
FRANK KAMINSKY: He's done a great job of just playing with confidence and
swagger, going out there and bringing energy off the bench and sometimes
completely taking over a game, and when we needed him to, so he stepped in a
lot of different ways this season.  
THE MODERATOR: Frank, Josh and Ben, thank you. Good luck.  
Coach, great to see you again. Maybe an opening remark or two and then we'll
take questions, please.  
COACH BO RYAN: Well, I've said so many times I'm proud of our guys and the
fact that they accomplished what they did over the whole season. If you look
at our record and all the different factors there involved in seeding and
everything else, I think they deserved to be here, and now we got the make
something happen when we we're here.  
Somebody mentioned 0-0. Yeah, there aren't any records coming into the NCAA
Tournament, it's all -- you got 40 minutes. That's all you're guaranteed. Do
you want 240 minutes? Well, you got to earn those, too. So, we're happy to be
here and can't wait to get started.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Bo, it's been a couple days. Has the fact that you've got 700 wins sunk
in? And when you started out in coaching, would you ever imagine getting --
becoming a member of that club?  
COACH BO RYAN: No. Maybe some of the other people in the room have heard this,
but, you know, I was an economics major in college. Was a good enough player
to get drafted by the Army in 1969 (laughter). It took a little while, didn't
it?  
And while I was in the service, I realized how much I missed athletics, team
sports. I had been playing since I was a kid on a team in football, baseball,
basketball every year, and my dad had coached kids for 40 years, not receiving
a penny. Did it because he wanted to try to help them and have a childhood
different than his when he grew up.  
So I decided to coach and teach. I had to go back and get my teaching
certification. When you say 700 wins, I did not get into teaching and coaching
for the number of wins, for the money, for the -- it was a passion for trying
to help young people. And I started in junior high school in 1972, right
outside of Philadelphia in Chester, at Brookhaven Junior High School.  
Then things have just moved on from there. But 700, that seems like a high
number. Jokingly my first response when I was asked in a post-game interview,
I said because I'm old. I never received more text messages or e-mails in all
my coaching career than I did after that, and it was 50/50.  
Some people said, "yeah, you are," and the other 50 said, "hey, you're not
old." So I must be somewhere in the middle. But lot of good players, lot of
good assistants, lot of great fans, like of great administrators, and just all
of it coming together and putting a lot of numbers on the left-hand side is a
fun achievement. But it's fun because I think back to the very first game that
I coached at UW Plattville in 1984. And every game since then still there's a
memory there somewhere, and it's a nice feeling, but the feeling is because of
all the people that you've had a chance to touch.  
  
Q. Coach, when the team is going through that stretch of losing five of six,
do you feel like they came out of that, did you see that they came out of that
maybe had a tougher team mentally, bonded together in that moment and helped
for that run at the end?  
COACH BO RYAN: Again, I'm going to say it this way, and you might want to
dwell on this for awhile. If you take our 16 games in the Big Ten, shuffle
them up and put them out in some other order, we could have been 12-6, no
matter how you sliced it. The teams that we played when we took those bumps
were playing well. We weren't shooting it that well. We went through a little
slump. But the teams that beat us were good teams. And I mean Northwestern was
playing as well as anybody in the country when they came into our place. They
had won three, four in a row. They went through a stretch.  
You know, in losing on the road to a couple teams, Ohio State was playing
pretty well, playing real well at that time against us.  
So, they didn't fray, they didn't tear apart. They stayed together because
they knew that if we did certain things, and you could tell that from the
video sessions, if we do these certain things, we're going to get it back. And
then to win eight of the last ten and get back on that way, we lost to two
pretty good teams Boca Raton, and then Nebraska at Nebraska, and Michigan
State when they had everybody healthy in the Big Ten Tournament. So now we
start the third season.  
  
Q. What challenges does American present to your team and what have you seen
when you watch them on tape?  
COACH BO RYAN: American Magazine?  
  
Q. American University.  
COACH BO RYAN: Coach Brennan has done a great job of installing his offensive
philosophy. Anytime -- you can always tell if somebody can coach and teach
based upon how players read and react to the vision that a coach has. He
played in the Princeton system. I coached against Princeton-type high school
teams in the '70's back in Pennsylvania because of Petey Carril being from
Pennsylvania and having coached high school in Pennsylvania before he went to
Princeton and there were a lot of disciples back then when I was coaching.  
So, now I see his team running it and it's obvious he played in the system,
knows how to teach -- knowing the reads is one thing. Teaching people to use
them and to understand them, that's the next level. He's definitely got his
players at that next level. They run that offense better than just about every
other teams.  
Coach Carmody had some teams that ran it well overall, I would say American
runs it better than any team I've seen. And one of my first games was at the
Palestra was seeing Bill Bradley, but I think van Breda Kolff was coaching
then, right? So I didn't see the Princeton offense as a youngster when I went
to the Palestra, but I did see it later on and some of the people who running
it in the '70's in Pennsylvania.  
  
Q. You've never been one to jump at the next best thing or the -- the latest
thing, whether it's a school or a system of play. What taught you that early
in your career that you stick with what works?  
COACH BO RYAN: I remember personal happiness, do you enjoy your environment,
and I always tell young coaches when they're asking for advice, you know, take
a job at a place where you can coach for five years or 50 years. Because if
you take a job and you're always looking left, right, behind you, in front of
you, if you're always looking in different directions, you're not going to do
as good a job with the people who believed you in the first place and hired
you.  
So, if you're hired to do a job, for a nickel, give them a dime's worth.
That's been my philosophy that I learned from my parents. I'm sure they
learned from their parents. And to me, it's all about practicality. But, you
know, you still have some fun. I'm old school, but we still have fun playing
the game and I got some zingers. I got some one-liners I use every once in
awhile to keep the guys loose. I'm not one of those guys to get caught up in
fads or anything like that.  
I think this is the same top I had in '04 when we played here against Richmond
and Pittsburgh. I just thought about that when you asked about -- this might
be the same one. I'm not sure.  
  
Q. Where does Frank rank among most coachable players that you've ever come
across? You talked to some of these old coaches, they all say how coachable he
is. How did the light go on for him this year?  
COACH BO RYAN: All the other coaches said he was coachable?  
  
Q. Some of them did, yes?  
COACH BO RYAN: Frank Kaminsky?  
  
Q. Yes. Yes.  
COACH BO RYAN: He's perceptive, he's smart. He sees more than you probably
realize about the game. He understands the game. He knows it. Physically and
mentally when are you taller than most people and your body is trying to --
you can't tell Frank Kaminsky he's not quite developed yet because he still
wants to play the point because they let him in high school a little bit.  
I don't know how he got to do that, but he can pass, he can do all that. He's
developed so many different parts of his game because he cares. He wants to be
the best player he can be and play on the best team that he could possibly
play on.  
So, even though sometimes you might not think he's listening, he gets in
Frank's world, so to speak, he's listening because you can see it the next
time out and can see it in the next possession. You can see it if you give him
some constructive criticism. He's not going to be one of those guys that looks
at you and goes, "Yeah, yeah, Coach, you're right, you're right."  
He might look at you like, "Coach, do you know what you're talking about?"
It's not a sarcastic look. It's just have you looked at Frank? Sometimes he
has a face that looks like he really is somewhere else, but he's not. So I've
learned not to interpret it that way. So, he is a good listener. He's a hard
work worker, and you haven't seen the best of Frank Kaminsky yet. He's going
to get even better over time.  
  
Q. Bo, just curious how much stock you put in a lot of the offensive and
defensive analytics that have become popular in the last couple years.  
COACH BO RYAN: Well, I think it's good because I know people who have those
types of minds need something to do, and that's a good channel. That's a good
way to channel your love of numbers.  
I think it's information that can be used like any other bits of information,
and, you know, I don't know if you went back to all the national championship
games or the NBA championship teams, I don't know how all that computes. But
it's just the beginning. They'll be more and more. They'll be -- if a guy wore
goggles and he played in 40 games, then he miss passes because he couldn't see
peripherally as well as somebody else, they'll have a number for that. It's
not because you have glasses on.  
  
Q. Thank you.  
COACH BO RYAN: You know what I mean. If he touched the ball in the paint 15
times, 13 times this happened. There's a lot of different ways to use
information, but I've been using points per possession forever from the '70's.  
  
Q. First of all, I was wondering if we could hear some of your one line
zingers and also to the program's 16th trip here. I was wondering if you guys
take the time to kind of, you know, enjoy some of the perks or smell the roses
a little bit or it's strictly a business trip for you guys?  
COACH BO RYAN: Well, business trip is not a good term to use because these
young men have four years for the most part on their timeline where they get
to do this. I've had a chance to do it more because I'm very fortunate.  
So, I try to give them the opportunity to appreciate what their surroundings
are, how fortunate they are to have used their hard work to get something. But
this is part of the getting.  
I use the term a lot, it's fun to want. Every season starts and that's -- I
had to explain this the last time. Want, W-A-N-T. It's fun to want. As my
parents always said. You got to have -- like what is it out there you would
like to get? Every basketball player starts a season with the idea they want
to be the last team standing and it's very difficult in basketball. Every high
school kid, they want to win the state championship.  
So we talk about the experience, we talk about making sure you understand that
so-called fame is fleeting, meaning, okay, you're in the tournament, you're
going to hear a lot of nice things said about you and the team and -- but you
have to understand that American doesn't care. Your next opponent, it happens
to be American. So what they want to do is they're trying to get to be as good
as they can be tomorrow.  
That's what we're trying to do.  
The one-liners, I'm on at 8:00 tonight down at the -- no. With the players.
It's like you see something happen and you say something and they go, "Coach,
where did you get that from?" I got a guy that beats me, and old line is
obviously the early bird catches the worm as we're done with our video
session. Nigel always tries to beat me to the court. I said, "good, Nigel, the
early bird catches the worm."  
"Coach, the second mouse always gets the cheese." I never heard it (laughter).  
I said, "All right, Nigel, you got one on me." What do you call about a
hundred crows on a fence? A murder of crows. What do you call a hundred owls
on a fence? Come on, you're with the New York Times. You're supposed to know
that.  
  
Q. Didn't realize were you talking to me.  
COACH BO RYAN: I wasn't. Do you know what it is? It's a parliament. Geese
everybody knows. Gaggle. Okay. That's enough. I'm not giving you any more.
You're going to have to look up the rest of it.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you and good luck.  
COACH BO RYAN: Thank you.

_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  
THE MODERATOR: This morning, Darius Gardner, Jesse Reed, and Tony Wroblicky.
With that, questions, please.  
  
Q. Darius, with a new coach this year, a new system coming in, how long did
it take you guys to get comfortable with the transition?  
DARIUS GARDNER: It took us awhile. In the summertime he came in, a couple guys
wasn't there already so we kind of started then, and it took us awhile to -- I
would say Christmas break, over the Christmas break, and after the Christmas
break, I think that's when we started to really jell as a team.  
  
Q. Tony, for you, I guess the preseason prediction was for you guys to
finish ninth in the Patriot. What were your expectations going?  
TONY WROBLICKY: I thought we could have a good team. I didn't know, you know,
how it would all work out. I knew we had talent that other people really
didn't know about. You know, obviously, you know, I could see it personally.
We finished maybe third, fourth, something like that. So we obviously done
very well for yourselves.  
  
Q. Tony, beyond thinking that you guys had talent, why you think you would
be better an a ninth place finish?  
TONY WROBLICKY: Well, I mean, you just -- you have to believe that you're
going to be better than the next to last place. You have some hope in
yourself. You know, I was believing in the system that Coach Brennan was
implementing with us and, you know, it worked out for the best.  
  
Q. Tony, again, a guy like Frank Kaminsky can shoot inside and out. What's
the key defending him and having faced a guy like him that you can draw
experience on?  
TONY WROBLICKY: He's a great player. He's very talented. He can -- he can
obviously shoot very well and a creator. It's all about, you know, taking away
his open 3s and stopping his touches in the post. If I can do that, I think we
have a chance to limit his scoring.  
  
Q. Tony, you're a senior. What's the atmosphere being around campus after
the Boston game?  
TONY WROBLICKY: It's been great. The students were on spring break that
Wednesday when we played the game, so when we came back on school Monday
everyone was very excited. The community has shown us a lot of support. Lot of
pats on the back. Everyone is very thrilled for our school and our team.  
  
Q. Jesse, your coach brought in a new system. Obviously a little different.
How difficult was that transition and what has it given you? Has it been a
part of the revival of this team?  
JESSE REED: Yeah, it was very difficult to learn at first, but once we started
over the summer, kind of learned the basic movements and then working our way
up through the preseason, learning everything, we finally started to get it
together as a team, figuring it out, learning how to play with one another in
the system. I think it worked out really well, and it was able to give us new
life from a team that struggled the year before and kind of give us a new
look. Found a way to get all of our talents together and work together on the
court well.  
  
Q. Darius, everyone talks about the offense you guys run, but your defensive
numbers are outstanding. What's the key behind the defense?  
DARIUS GARDNER: Just helping each other, team -- team defense is a big key for
us. Then we have to limit the guys for one shot. Taking away a lot of 3s.
We're going at defending the three-point line. If we can do that and limit,
you know, the 3s and taking away an easy bucket, I think we have a chance.  
  
Q. Last years Florida knocked out Georgetown. That was a 15-2 matchup. Two
of you guy's names, your know, you saw that obviously being fans of the game.
What does that make you think going into tomorrow?  
DARIUS GARDNER: I think anyone is beatable at this time. March Madness is just
one of those times where anything can happen, but, you know, we can't compare
ourselves to Florida Gulf Coast. We have to stick to the things we do and do
the things we've done all season. Hopefully we can be the next team that can
make an upset tomorrow. So if we stick to what we've been doing, I think we
have a great chance of winning tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: As you study tape, what specifically impresses you about
Wisconsin?  
DARIUS GARDNER: I would say they've been a top team all season. They have
great offensive team, but people don't really talk about their defensive team.
I think they're very physical, but, you know, we have to do the things that
we've been doing all season, and then we do those things, defend and rebound,
and, you know, do the things that we can control, which is those two, and
limit our turnovers, I think, you know, that will be the key for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Jesse, does it make it harder that they're playing in their
home state?  
JESSE REED: I guess a little bit, but we've been used to playing on the road a
lot all year, so we're just going to go into it like every other road game we
went into. We know we're the underdog, backs against the wall. Go out and try
to pull out a win.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Tony, how tough is it to prepare for this Wisconsin offense? They seem to
have six, seven guys that can put it in the basket?  
TONY WROBLICKY: It's very tough. The offense is very fluid, and it makes it
that much more difficult that all five guys usually on the floor can shoot the
three-ball fairly well.  
So, you know, it's a lot to guard and they run it very well. It's going to be
a definite challenge to stop them.  
  
Q. This is sort of a repeat of the question that was asked. How did you guys
feel about knowing that you're going into the NCAA Tournament, you're playing
Wisconsin, but basically it's in their own backyard? They're an hour and a
half from the Kohl Center where they play, the fan base tomorrow will be
obviously Wisconsin more so than American. How do you feel about that?  
DARIUS GARDNER: We have to tune it out, do the things we've been doing,
playing together, you know, just focus on what we have to do. I'm sure it's
going to be American fans there, too. It's not just going to be -- it's going
to be our way, definitely Wisconsin fans. But, you know, in Boston we didn't
think we would have that many fans. They showed up and supported us. We have
our families, friends, and everybody around the country watching us. We know
we have that and we have our team, everybody in that locker room and everybody
came on the trip with us and our prep band and all the fans, that's a big key
for us, getting that excitement for us and making sure that we have people
there that supporting us, too.  
  
Q. You guys won at BU. I'm curious if an experience like that will carry
over here, where you were not the home team, they were the home team, and it's
probably going to be that way tomorrow.  
TONY WROBLICKY: Yeah, we hope that it does. We've played in tough environments
all year. Playing BU on the road I think is a big step forward in our
confidence on the road, and that was huge game that we played very well. So,
hopefully those carry over.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Jesse, going back to the defensive line of questioning here. As well as
you guys have been playing, especially lately on that and the floor, have you
noticed that opponents are getting a sense of frustration, knowing they're
going only to have X number of possessions. Have they started to rush,
anything along those lines?  
JESSE REED: Yeah. I'd say some opponents have gotten a little frustrated not
being able to find the openings that we're normally used to. Wisconsin,
they're a lot better team than what we've been playing in recent games. So
hopefully we're able to cause that same frustration for them and stick to the
tangibles we've been with all year.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? All right, Darius, Jesse, Tony. Thank you very
much. American student-athletes. We'll have the Coach, Mike Brennan here
momentarily.  
Coach, welcome to Milwaukee. Congratulations on the season. Maybe an opening
remark or two before we open up for questions.  
COACH MIKE BRENNAN: Thank you. We're excited to be here, proud of what our
guys were able to accomplish this year and, you know, it's a great group of
guys, and we're looking forward to representing American United States and the
Patriot League the best we can and come out and compete tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Mike, you've been in this role as an assistant coach. What's the
difference being the head coach of a team in the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH MIKE BRENNAN: Well, being up here for one. But actually I'm lucky, I
have good assistants. You know, I've had great help all year long. Obviously
there's lot more decision-making, you're the final, sort of ultimate decision-
maker as the head coach. I've been lucky to coach such a great group of
players all year long and, you know, I have a great staff with me, so it's
been a team effort. I'm lucky to have -- be surrounded by the people that I
am.  
  
Q. Two seed, 15th seed, you're basically playing in Wisconsin's backyard,
their home court. How have you prepared your team for this moment to go out
and perform to the best of their ability?  
COACH MIKE BRENNAN: We've been preparing since we got here in the spring. The
guys worked really hard. We knew we were going to play one of the best teams
in the country. We knew it would be a difficult environment. We played in
difficult environments all year long. I think the guys of that been pretty
even keeled with their emotions. We've kept it simple and so they've competed.
We won the championship at BU. It wasn't quite the environment that we'll
probably see tomorrow, but at least it gives them a little taste of what to
expect.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you had the great start in Patriot League play, but was
there a stretch maybe in that run or at any other point where you started to
feel like this team was getting it and could be a lot better than a lot of
folks seemed to believe?  
COACH MIKE BRENNAN: Lot of close games in that run. You know, our league is
very good from top to bottom. So, you know, the 10-0 record was a little
deceiving because they were all hard fought games. And the league, every team
we played it was a two-point win or three-point win. So, you know, the league
was challenging. But our guys have embraced everything that we've asked of
them from the very first day that we got here. And I told them early on we
weren't going to necessarily, you know, judge our progress on wins and losses
at the beginning of the year, you know, as long as we're improving, getting
better every day in practice and a lot of the early losses were close games,
but we were competing and we were getting better.  
So, you know it was a gradual process. It wasn't necessarily one moment.  
  
Q. You talked about your situation here, the underdog playing Wisconsin. Do
you want your guys to feel like underdogs or do you want them to take the
court with a different attitude tomorrow?  
COACH MIKE BRENNAN: I just want them to compete. I know they will. We've
worked hard all year to get to this point. You know, they've put in a great
effort on a daily basis, and we just take it step by step and day by day. So,
we're just going to continue to do what we've been doing, be prepared for the
-- we've prepared for the last couple days knowing we're playing Wisconsin.
We've got one more practice right after we're done here, and I'm confident
that our guys will come out and compete.  
  
Q. Mike, what are your impressions of Bo Ryan and can you just fathom what
it's like to have somebody get 700 wins in a career?  
COACH MIKE BRENNAN: No, it's incredible. We have so much respect for Coach
Ryan and his program and everything he's done, everywhere he's been. His teams
have always been one of the most disciplined teams on the country on both ends
of the floor, offensively and defensively, and they compete. It's going to be
-- we knew it was going to be a very difficult game on both ends of the court.
So, we're looking forward to hopefully -- we know what we got to do, play
almost a near perfect game and do so many things right just to be in the game.
So, we know it's a big challenge, but like I said, our guys have worked really
hard to be here. So, we're looking forward to competing.  
  
Q. What's going to be the biggest challenge facing a team with so much
balance offensively?  
COACH MIKE BRENNAN: That's probably the biggest challenge right there. I mean,
you can't key on one guy. They're all very good offensive players. They can
all sort of score on their own, and then they work obviously very well
together, you know, collectively as a group to get a good shot.  
So, it's going to take a team effort defensively and they're very physical.
They're scoring a ton of points this year, they're getting out in transition.
It's more than just the offense that everyone talks about, the swing offense.
They're multifaceted and do a lot of things well.  
  
Q. I don't know how American played before you got there. How radical were
the changes you made on offense and defense and how did that transition go?  
COACH MIKE BRENNAN: I think it's pretty different for a lot of guys, probably
especially for Tony Wroblicky, our senior. Probably asking him to do a lot of
things that he wasn't necessarily asked to do before. But the guys, you know,
as soon as we got here, everything that we were asking of them they embraced.
They were the most coachable group I've been around. We couldn't have couldn't
have been here if it wasn't for that. We have awesome leadership from John
Schoof, Peewee Gardner, and Tony from the very first day and the rest of the
group just followed suit. They've picked things up. I give Tony a lot of
credit. It takes time to sort of pick up the things that we're asking guys to
do. It takes more than a year or two, and he's done it, you know, very
quickly. I give him a ton of credit.  
THE MODERATOR: How many game tapes did you study of the Badgers?  
COACH MIKE BRENNAN: You can get tapes pretty easily these days. We're watching
as much as we can.  
THE MODERATOR: Just the most recent?  
COACH MIKE BRENNAN: You go as far back as you can and try and -- things what
you need to do, what you need to see, and obviously all the assistants are
watching tapes. So we've watched a ton of Wisconsin.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Yes.  
  
Q. Can you flip around what you went through with the Florida Gulf Coast
upset last year and use it as an inspiration for these guys?  
COACH MIKE BRENNAN: I'm not much on the bulletin-board-type stuff or anything
like that. This is a different group and different team. They had nothing to
do with that game or experience. We're just going to rely on experiences that
we've had, you know, this year in practice and in games because that's what's
probably the most vivid in their minds.  
  
Q. There have been three 15-2 upsets the last couple years. Does that
indicate anything to you in a big picture how the tournament may be
changing?  
COACH MIKE BRENNAN: It's more competitive. There are no bad teams, you know,
in this tournament, and I guess there's still sort of descriptions of high
major and mid major, but I think those lines are being blurred a lot more. Lot
of good players out there, lot of great coaches. So I think, you know, there's
-- there are no bad teams. When you look at the scores in everybody's leagues,
the leagues everywhere just so competitive all year long.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Coach, thank you, good luck.

### [Nik Stauskas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24438)

  
_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Michigan student-athletes, Nik Stauskas, Jordan Morgan, and
Glenn Robinson III. Of course, Glenn's dad played in this very building for
the Bucks. We'll open it up to questions.  
  
Q. I'm curious, this is for all three of you, had you heard of Wofford
before this draw came out?  
GLENN ROBINSON III: No, we hadn't heard of them, you know, but I think our
coaching staff did a great job of, you know, showing us film and game tape on
them. So, you know, did a great job scouting them.  
  
Q. Nick, what do you see of Wofford on film? What kind of team are they
compared to Big Ten teams you've played?  
NIK STAUSKAS: I think they're just a really high IQ basketball team and their
offense has a lot of actions. Not a lot of ball screens, but they do a lot of
fade screens and stuff like that. Always kind of tricky to guard and also
defensively, so I'm sure it will be a good game.  
  
Q. Jordan, this is going to be your last go-round for the tournament. Your
emotions before the last home game. Talk a little bit about keeping your
emotions in check, knowing this is your last time going around?  
JORDAN MORGAN: This time little bit different. You don't know which one it's
going to be. It's a different focus now. It's a different level of intensity
when it comes to the game. It's going to take a lot of focus from everybody.  
  
Q. Nick, I'm curious, the 15-2 game, historically there haven't been a ton
of upsets in that game, but there have been three in the last two years. Does
that sort of make you sit up and pay attention a little bit more despite the
small conference team?  
NIK STAUSKAS: You know, I didn't really pay any attention to what the history
says. We don't want to take any team lightly and, you know, they made it to
the tournament so they're definitely capable. Looking at the NIT, you see a
lot of small school teams beating on bigger schools. We're not going to take
anyone lightly and prepare as we would for any other game.  
  
Q. Glenn, picturing backing off that question, lot of people have y'all
picked to go deep in in this thing. What is the mentality of that and facing a
team that you don't really know anything about and could easily overlook.  
GLENN ROBINSON III: Stay focused one game at a time. I thought this team did a
great job of not thinking ahead all year and taking it game by game and
preparing the best we can for Wofford.  
THE MODERATOR: Glenn, obviously here in Milwaukee your dad is so fondly
remembered. Talk about playing in this building and maybe your relationship as
far as not just being dad but what he tells you about basketball.  
GLENN ROBINSON III: You know, I talk to my dad a lot. He gives me tips and
pointers about the game of basketball, and just something that everybody
doesn't really get to experience is having a dad who played professionally.
So, you know, as far as him playing in this arena, I've been to many practices
when I was younger and coming back and kind of remembering some of those
memories is great, and, you know, I can't wait to step foot on that floor and
get to play here.  
  
Q. I wondered about that, what were some of your more memorable games that
you attended and maybe how old you were at the time?  
GLENN ROBINSON III: I can't remember how old I was. I was pretty young, but I
just remember him playing on a team and I was at the practice arena with those
guys, and I believe it was when Sam Cassell, Ray Allen, my dad were all on the
same team. Great experience, I got to go in the locker room. I remember a lot
from practices with George Karl.  
  
Q. This is for Jordan, after Michigan went out, you and Jon pretty much had
kind of combined roles and filling in for him. You guys were roommates, too.
How much did you guys -- have you guys talked about your roles and your
responsibilities and how things have gone this season?  
JORDAN MORGAN: You know, I don't know if it's as much basketball, but I think
that we did a lot to just support each other, you know, on and off the court,
just encouraging each other when the other guy is in there and trying to do
our best to give corrections in game situations, and we've always had each
other's back throughout this whole year. Whatever the other person is dealing
with, whether it be adversity in practice or a game, we're always the one
that's kind of there to pick each other up. So, that's where that comes from.  
  
Q. Glenn, your dad was "big dog," right? Does he call you "little dog" or
your teammates call you "little dog"?  
GLENN ROBINSON III: I have a lot of different nicknames floating around. Lot
of people like to call me "little dog" and things like that. My teammates
mostly call me "G."  
Q.What are the nicknames?  
GLENN ROBINSON III: Everybody calls me "little puppy" or "little dog" and just
different nicknames floating around on Twitter and things like that. They call
me "Glenn," "G-Rob."  
Q.Do fans on the road give you a hard time because of your famous father?  
GLENN ROBINSON III: Just like Tim Hardaway last year, we both heard lot of
different chants about our fathers being better than us and all the normal
chants that we'll hear. Nothing really affects me anymore. I've heard it all.  
  
Q. Your dad doesn't taunt you on the road?  
GLENN ROBINSON III: No. Only thing he says he can still beat me one-on-one.  
  
Q. Nik, lot of people are giving you a chance to go a long way. Giving the
loaded region, a lot of people aren't. Do you guys use that as a chip on your
shoulder?  
NIK STAUSKAS: Not necessarily. I don't think we're going to look into too much
how analysts or fans think we're going to do, but this has been a really
confident team all year. People have doubted us all along. We realize as long
as we stick to the game plan that Coach gives, really pay attention to what
they're saying and stick together as a group and just play Michigan
basketball, I think we'll be all right.  
THE MODERATOR: The wars in the Big Ten, you've had some Great games with
Wisconsin, Michigan State. How has that toughened you?  
NIK STAUSKAS: I think you see a lot of different types of basketball play
throughout the Big Ten, and this year we've had so many games that have been
decided by five points or less. We've really played well in those last few
minutes to seal those games up. So I just think those games have done a good
job of preparing us for this tournament because you're not going to blow teams
out and you're going to have a lot of games where it comes down to the last
few minutes. I think we're ready for that.  
JORDAN MORGAN: I think if you look at our schedule all year long and the teams
that we've had to play against and the venues we've played at, at Iowa State,
at Duke, against Arizona as far as non-conference goals and then you talk
about obviously the Big Ten schedule, I think that it's done a lot to help our
team mature.  
Outside of our sophomore class, we went to the national championship game last
year. They had that experience on top of this year, and young freshman that do
play having been in all of those situations in close games and every type of
environment, we've been in almost any position we can be in as a team, and I
think that shows our composure late in games where youth might come in to
play.  
GLENN ROBINSON III: Just like these guys said, each game we play in the Big
Ten and non-conference definitely helped us how to prepare for this
tournament. Same as practice. Coach does a great job of helping us with
situations into the game and things just like that.  
The biggest thing that we learned is to value each possession because that's
what each possession during the tournament is going to be like. We can't just
take lazy shots or play lazy defense sometimes. We have to do what we have to
do.  
  
Q. Jordan, how does the intensity of the Big Ten Tournament compare to the
NCAA Tournament you've guys have been through? You've been through plenty of
those.  
JORDAN MORGAN: I think the biggest difference is probably the rest. Three
games in three days is not easy for any team. I think that the day in between
an NCAA Tournament is very beneficial for everybody to get that rest and --
but I mean it prepares us well for this tournament in that every team in the
Big Ten is a good team and it's kind of the same mentality you got to have a
tournament, which as the one seed even though we had eight/nine matchup. It
wasn't a bad team, but it wasn't the top tier teams in the league. But it's
still a team you can't sleep on.  
That's the position we're in now. It might not be a team that jumps off the
paper, but somebody that you have to respect and take very seriously.  
  
Q. Question for Nik. Nik, when you're playing out there, looks like you're
having a lot of fun. You like to revel in a hot streak or revel in opposing
fans getting on you. How much fun are you trying to have out there and how
does that affect the rest of the team, do you think?  
NIK STAUSKAS: You know, I hope when I start doing things like that, that my
teammates can feed off my energy and kind of brings everyone up. I just love
playing basketball. This is what I've been doing my whole life. The fact that
I have an opportunity to play on one of the biggest stages in the world, you
know, I just try to enjoy every minute and have as much fun as I possibly can
have.  
  
Q. Jordan, do you root for the other Big Ten teams or hope they lose,
especially Ohio State?  
JORDAN MORGAN: It is a balance. You want them to do well, but just how well
you're not really sure (laughter). All right, you done good. You want to see
them do well. We've been beating up on each other all year long, and it's kind
of nice for everybody to get a chance to play against new teams.  
  
Q. Even Ohio State.  
JORDAN MORGAN: Even Ohio State, yeah.  
  
Q. With the Big Ten teams, everyone is making a production. It's almost
going to be like a neutral court but a home game for Wisconsin. They're kind
of maybe overlooking -- you guys ought to have a pretty good fan following
too.  
JORDAN MORGAN: I think we've been given a good draw as far as locations go. I
mean, being in Milwaukee, I mean -- there's Michigan fans everywhere. We went
to Dallas and we had a ton of Michigan fans out there. I don't think it
matters that much, but I think it's just good for our fans to be able to make
a short trip, and I know we got a lot of fans in the Chicago area and it will
definitely be a good showing by Michigan fans.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? All three of you, thank you.  
Welcome to the podium the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines, John Beilein,
who obviously is familiar with this building from your days at West Virginia.
Coach, if you would open us with a remark or two and we'll take questions.  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I don't have fond memories of this building. I came in one
time and got it pretty good.  
No, we're thrilled to be in Milwaukee. It's so good how the NCAA has done a
great job right now of trying to keep people as close to home as possible and
for our many alums throughout the Midwest and the footprint of the Big Ten,
this is terrific and it's not that bad of a drive from Michigan as well.  
So, our kids are thrilled to be able to play. We have very high respect for
Wofford. I've known Mike Young for probably about 20 years, one of his
assistants is a former great point guard for me, Darris Nichols. So we know at
this time of the year we'll have to really play well to win, and that's what
we're going to try and do and do our best.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions, please.  
  
Q. John, what would you say the biggest difference is from this team and
last year's team that made it to the final?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: There's really a lot of similarities. We're younger than
young in so many different areas. Again, we have one senior that -- only one
senior on the team and one junior on the team.  
And so last year we had five seniors that did not play. So, we were young.
They have a lot of the heart. Obviously we have a freshman point guard and a
backup point guard, Spike Albrecht, that are sort of learning their craft on
the fly. Last year we had Player of the Year running our team and a really
good player for the New York Knicks right now, Tim Hardaway, standing next to
him.  
So those are the two guys that been through the wars a bit more than our
backcourt. To go through the Big Ten schedule that we have, we have persevered
despite the youth in the backcourt. Really proud of the way they conducted
themselves with poise during our season.  
  
Q. The senior and the junior that you've referenced combined to basically
play one position with Mitch out. They've taken it upon themselves to really
do a nice job there. How has their play been able to keep you guys rolling?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Believe it or not, and obviously we really miss having
Mitch McGary there. We'd love to have him here, but if there was one position
that we could afford that, it was probably at that because those two have had
a lot of experience playing and you can call them "Morford" or "Horgan," they
have combined to give us almost double-doubles on many occasions, and that's
Mitch McGary numbers. So we've really been fortunate to be able to have those
two. Not only are they good players, but they bring great poise and experience
to this lineup for such a young team.  
  
Q. Does it ever bother you internally when you go home after hearing the
draw and some of the players are like, you know, who the hell is that, you
know, to get them ready and mentally?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: No. Coming from this -- where I come from, yeah, it
probably bothers me a little bit because I know how good those teams are and
as I watch NIT scores yesterday and I watched Davidson lead Missouri the whole
game at Missouri right from the same league. Or we watched Robert Morris beat
the heck out of St. John's at St. John's. A guy who came from that territory,
I reminds them all the time how everyone this time of the year is really good.
You got to come ready to play.  
South Dakota State showed us that a lot last year in the first round. That was
one of our tougher games getting to the Final Four, that and Kansas were our
two games we probably had -- was close right till the last five to ten
minutes.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, realizing that each year is different, each team is
different, some of these guys were not with you last year, many were, how does
that experience of going to the final last year help these guys?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I think that when they looked back at last year, there was
different people in every game. The outliers, we call them, that put us in
that position to go to the final game. Most people didn't know Spike Albrecht
had probably 1,000 Twitter followers, and all of a sudden he had 20,000 in one
night. There's outliers out there. Jordan Morgan took a huge charge against
Syracuse. The guy didn't play in our VCU win. We all add something to this
game. We all have to stick together and be ready if our number is called.  
  
Q. Are you a big Twitter guy, John?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I do Tweet. Not as often as maybe I probably people think
I should. Maybe once a month or once every two weeks.  
  
Q. Who the Tweeting champion among Big Ten coaches?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I don't follow any of them. I would not know.  
  
Q. You don't follow them.  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I follow -- it's more I follow Twitter to follow my
players and make sure that they're doing and following the right things.  
  
Q. How long did it take you to get over the loss of the championship game?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Given our season and the type of young men that we have,
you know, it did not take long. I think as time goes on, believe it or not, it
will probably bother me more because you know you could have a heck of a team,
better team, and the ball bounced our way a couple times during that run. We
had two last second wins over Syracuse and Kansas that you might have a better
team and the ball is going to bounce your way and you don't get back.  
It was a great -- it was a great run for us, and I enjoy that and now I just
sort of move on. I've never been big at living for -- living in the past on --
whether it was a win, dwelling on great wins and saying, "oh, man, this is
wonderful," or letting a loss bother me for very long.  
But we love to have another opportunity, and this is the first step, but we
got a lot of obstacles to jump through to get there again.  
  
Q. Coach, sorry if this is a repeat. Just got in here. Talk to me about I
guess one of the big question marks with Michigan is how quickly would they be
able to get past losing go their rival in the Big Ten Championship. How
quickly do you guys get past that?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I don't think it's even an issue right now. I think
Michigan State just showed why they were a preseason number one with many
people. They've been banged up all year long. We were fortunate enough to win
twice and we were proud of that. At the same time, they're really playing
well. We don't make excuses. We just take our hat off and say, "great job,
Michigan State," represent our league well, and now we're on to our third
season.  
You know, we love the way the regular season turned out for us in the
conference. Getting to the championship game in the Big Ten tournament was
something we hadn't done. We paved some new roads in different areas. Now
being in the NCAA Tournament, we're thrilled and now it's -- just like we did
all season long, next game.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for coach? Yes.  
  
Q. John, I wonder what you remember about your game with Iowa State, the
third game of the year. They started 14-0 and lost their first three Big 12
games. Did you have an idea they might be this good?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: When we really originally scheduled them, there was a year
separation. We looked at the roster, and of course you're looking at, usually
when you schedule something, what are they going to be like when we plan the
following year. We said, oh, they're going to lose their point guard, going to
lose these other guys. They're going to probably struggle in the backcourt and
that may be one we can get if we're really good. We're always probably
thinking Trey Burke and Tim Hardaway be in the backcourt. DeAndre Kane king
came in and changed that team. Ejim and Niang are tremendous players, but Kane
was so good for them as well, even other guys played. We led for 30 minutes,
and when they got it going and Hilton magic took over, we couldn't catch up.
One of Mitch McGary's first games back at the same time they beat us fair and
square.  
  
Q. You already got your schedule for next year?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Well, we will not be playing Iowa State next year. No. We
haven't completed it yet. It's still a work in progress. But we will not be
playing Iowa State.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Thanks Coach, good luck.  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Thank you.

_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to the stage, if you will, University of Texas student-
athletes, Jonathan Holmes, Javan Felix, and freshman guard, Isaiah Taylor.
Questions, please.  
  
Q. Jonathan, you're the only guy on the roster right now who has actually
played in a NCAA Tournament. What is different about this time of year and
what have you shared with your teammates about what to expect?  
JONATHAN HOLMES: Every team we play against is an elite team. They've made it
this far. You've got to be ready to play mentally and physically. You've got
to execute even more so now than early on in the year.  
  
Q. Isaiah and Javan, kind of counter to what Jon is talking about, what's
it's like to be here now?  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: Just excited. This is our first NCAA Tournament game, and for
most of us outside of Jon, s our first NCAA Tournament. We're just anxious and
ready to play.  
JAVAN FELIZ: This is a great feeling for me, especially since last year we
missed the tournament, and, you know, it's just something that you dream of as
a child watching on TV and stuff like that. And, you know, we look at it as a
blessing, but we know we deserve to be to be here, so we're just ready to go
out and play.  
  
Q. Isaiah and Javan, I assume Demarcus gets the role of defending Carson. I
was curious if that's true and what does he look like on tape when you watch
him, Carson?  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: We don't know who is defending him yet, but he's a fast point
guard such as Juwan Staten from West Virginia. He likes to get into the lane.
We'll just look to contain him early.  
JAVAN FELIZ: Like Isaiah said, we don't really know who is guarding him yet.
We watch film on him, watch some of his clips, and just see some things that
he likes to do. He's very fast, likes to get in the lane, likes to attack in a
transition, and, you know, he definitely does a good job of getting his
teammates involved in getting them open shots when he does create and drive to
the lane.  
  
Q. Jonathan, much has been made of the turnaround that you guys have been
able to go through this year. Can you talk a little bit about just how that
transition has been from an attitude standpoint for the team?  
JONATHAN HOLMES: We've all had each other's backs all year. We've gone into
practice every day trying to get better and we've held each other accountable.
When do you that and work hard, you have the talent that we have, it turns out
to success and that's what we've experienced this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Maybe if the three of you, one at a time starting with Isaiah,
can talk about what you've seen on tape from Arizona State.  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: We've seen Arizona State, they have a good point guard in
Carson. We know he's fast and likes to try to attack in transition. Also has
two good wings and a seven-footer inside that likes to use angles and get the
big men in foul trouble. We know he likes to run the floor and get back early.  
JAVAN FELIZ: We saw on tape that they definitely attack in transition. They
get the ball out fast. They run to their spots quickly, and it's a big thing
for us to get back in transition and definitely they move the ball well.  
Carson, he really makes them go, and, you know, they have two good wings that
he does a good job of getting them shots and they do a good job of running
sets to get those guys the ball in spots that they're effective. It's
something we talked about, especially going into this game and this morning.  
JONATHAN HOLMES: I think to add to what they just said, they play together and
know what they're looking for on offense. They play as a team on defense. Got
to be on top of your game if you get them because you can tell they play
together.  
  
Q. Javan and Isaiah, breaking down the numbers from the last five losses. I
know you know them as well as anybody. Both you guys are shooting under 30
percent in those games. During the layoff since the Big 12 tournament, what
have you worked on, how much breaking out of a shooting slump is mental, how
much is mechanics, how much is just finding right shots?  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: We just been working on the shots that we've been taking the
whole season, just getting back in rhythm, just open jump shots. We know that
we haven't been consistent throughout these last five games, but we're looking
to get that back on track tomorrow. But in practice we just take repetitions
and just take the shots that we usually shoot and we'll get out of our slump.  
JAVAN FELIZ: Like Isaiah said, I feel like it's more mental than anything,
just to keep shooting, have the confidence that keep you going and, you know,
we've worked all year on the shots that we take in the game and it's no
different now. Just got to keep putting your reps up and staying true to what
you've been doing the whole year.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions?  
  
Q. How much do you hate the late start time like maybe almost 9:00 at night?
What do you do all day?  
JONATHAN HOLMES: Tomorrow there's going to be a lot of good games on. We'll be
watching those games and get our minds right. We played, I think it was like
8:30 game in the Big 12 Tournament. We're used to this. It's not going to be
an excuse or anything for us to come out and play bad. We'll be ready to play.  
  
Q. What do you think about how Martez kind of gotten going here the last
couple weeks, going back to Tech and he wasn't afraid to put it up in Kansas
City, either?  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: Anybody on our team, Martez plays with a lot of confidence.
He's coming off the bench looking to score. He's 6' 5" winning. He's long.
Gets his hands on ball. He's a good shooter when open. We try to get him the
ball in transition and get him an open look in half court. That's what he's
been doing the past couple games.  
  
Q. Isaiah, what would you say is the biggest thing that you come away with
this year learning from your teammates about just during the maturation
process and getting ready for this tournament game?  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: Just playing with confidence and just playing with a chip on
our shoulder. Early in the season, we played with a chip on our shoulder like
we had something to prove. Coming into this tournament will help us. Playing
with a chip on our shoulder and playing with confidence, I think we'll be a
very hard team to beat.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else?  
  
Q. Jonathan, just out of curiosity, what do you remember about that
Cincinnati game in the NCAA two years ago? Obviously it didn't turn out the
way you guys wanted. What stood out about the game, the atmosphere, the
feeling, all that kind of stuff?  
JONATHAN HOLMES: It was exciting. Like they said, you dream about it your
whole life and it was an exciting moment. It didn't feel like we scored for
like the first 11 minutes, something like that, but we made it a game and had
a chance to win at the end. Couldn't pull it out. But it was a fun game. It's
a good experience and a good vibe around the whole thing, just to say that you
got the play in the tournament, it's a good feeling.  
  
Q. Quick follow-up, can you believe just looking back on the lineup from
that game just how much things have changed in terms of the roster here at
Texas since that game?  
JONATHAN HOLMES: Yeah. It's a lot -- it's completely different. I'm the only
one from that game that's still around. I mean, it's completely different, but
these guys, we've worked hard all year, and I think this is something we
deserve to get a chance to play in a game like this tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Javan and Jonathan, I wonder if you heard from any of your former
teammates from last year now that you're in the NCAA Tournament?  
JAVAN FELIZ: Not recently, but we all keep in contact. We all talk. We haven't
nerd nothing from them in these last couple days about the NCAA Tournament,
but, I mean, we're still friends and stuff like that. We talk every now and
then.  
JONATHAN HOLMES: We're like in a group message. I was talking to them this
morning, saying good luck. Those are my guys. We came in together. They didn't
find this was the best place for them. You can't look down on that.  
  
Q. Who did you talk to?  
JONATHAN HOLMES: It was a group message -- Jalen, Myck, all those guys.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Thanks, guys. Good luck.  
Please welcome Texas Longhorns Coach, Rick Barnes. Coach, welcome to
Milwaukee. Maybe a few general remarks and open it up for questions.  
COACH RICK BARNES: It's really good to be here. The short time here in
Milwaukee has been great. Our team is excited being in this tournament. I
think it's a really a great accomplishment for these guys to do what they've
done this year, young group that really they've done everything that we've
asked them to do. For them as a coach, we're extremely happy to be here.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions.  
  
Q. Rick, with Jonathan being the only guy with NCAA experience on the
roster, how do you try to prepare this team, not only for the opponent but for
the moment, the atmosphere, everything that goes into playing tomorrow?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, Chuck, I think you do what you've done all year in
terms of your preparation. They've grown up watching this tournament. They've
seen it. They've grown up dreaming about being in it. I think that what every
team has to do is embrace it and understand that you're really a part of
something that's going to be with them a long time in terms of being able to
tell people they participated in it. They've seen it. They know what it's
about. It's a matter of just understanding that -- I know they're excited
about being here, but they understand, too, that you've got to win if you want
the keep playing. And so they have to embrace it. I think they will.  
  
Q. Rick, can you talk about how well you know Herb and about what you
remember about that one season where he worked for you in Providence?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I met Herb in 1978 when we were both working the University
of Pittsburgh camp while Tim Gurridge (phonetic) was the head coach there.
Herb was a student at Carnegie Melon. That same year I met John Calipari who
transferred back from Wilmington. Sean Miller was -- I coached his team. He
was seven years old, I think at the time. So it goes way back.  
When I got the job at Providence, Herb was the one guy that was on the staff
that stayed with me and did a great job. And he -- at the time he wasn't
married and he literally was in the office 16, 18 hours a day. He was a very
thorough, as you can imagine. Everyone loved him on campus.  
When I got there, I can't tell you after the press conference how many people
at Providence College told me that they hoped I'd really keep Herb. Everybody
loved him.  
So, from that point, he was with me I think a year maybe and he went back to
Kentucky, and under Rick Pitino and through the years again, ACC, coached
against each other in the ACC. He's one of those guys that -- great basketball
coach. He's played a lot of different styles. He's done a great job and did an
absolutely unbelievable job at North Carolina State.  
Then he's done a great job here at Arizona State, and as much as I can rave
about him as a coach and all that, he's a guy that in this business anybody
would tell you his character, his ethics are above reproach. He's truly what
every school should want to have represent their program.  
  
Q. How gratifying is it for you to be back here in the tournament after all
the program went through last year and how confident are you that you've got
things back on track for the long-term now?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, yeah, after being it in for all total, what, 14
years, I think, and three at Clemson, 17 years. After every one of those bids,
I told our team not to take this for granted because it's really, really hard
to get here. It is an accomplishment to be one of now 68 teams playing, but
you don't ever take it for granted.  
I am extremely happy in the fact that because a year ago I wasn't very happy
because of the way we were at all. I knew we had to make changes. I knew that
before the end of the year. We made those changes, and for us to get back
here, it really started probably close to a year ago when we got knocked out
of the CBI tournament and returning players that were coming back, it was
amazing how just real quickly the whole attitude in the program changed. The
way they started working and really helping each other carried on through the
summer. And then when the young guys came in -- first time I can ever remember
the first session of summer school, we only had one incoming freshman at that
time. It was Kendal Yancy.  
Second semester all the other guys came in, and I knew we were going to be
pretty good at that point because of the way the guys were returning embraced
those younger guys which they didn't get. As we get into the workouts in the
fall, you could just feel that it was a group of guys that understood a team
chemistry and you could just tell they liked each other.  
Once we started the new rules that we were able to get started earlier, we had
some guys, Javan Felix missed the entire preseason. Jonathan Holmes went in
and out. The young guys got a lot of reps. We went into this year thinking
we're going to have to rely on Javan to score a lot of points for us. As time
went on, we realized that we could have great balance.  
But it's been great, and the reason being it's always fun to be around a group
of guys that you know they respect each other and are willing to come to work
and play every day. And they had a lot to learn, but they've continued to do
that. This is going to be a great experience for them and my -- am I
confident? Absolutely. I think we're coming out of a league that has prepared
us. It's like any basketball game, you got to win it. You're not going to talk
your way into it. You've got what Chuck said, it's what they dreamed of, this
moment. How do you handle it? You got to go after it. You don't want to have
any regrets with it and that's how -- we approach it.  
  
Q. What's made you guys such a good offensive rebounding team this season?  
COACH RICK BARNES: We're big and got two guys that are pretty relentless in
Jon Holmes and Demarcus Holland does a lot for us that way. It's something
that we always try to emphasize, and we haven't been at good as it lately as
we need to be, but lot of that has to do with the way we're holding the ball a
little bit too much. We need the take our shots and give us a chance to
rebound it. That's effort. It really is. I can talk about it, but it's really
just a mindset that somebody wants to go get it.  
  
Q.For Carson, Do you put Demarcus Holland on him? What does his style remind
you of?  
COACH RICK BARNES: In our League we played against some outstanding point
guards. Juwan Staten to mind. And the fact that he just creates so much
offense and does such a great job of getting the ball to the rim. And they're
similar, but I don't know they're totally similar in every single way.  
But I'm not going the say we're going to put one guy on him. I think a lot of
guys could be guarding him because the way we play defense. I don't think one
guy can stop him. Just like -- he's too good a player. It's going to take a
group effort. Great transition defense is going to be very, very important.
There's not one guy that can stop him by himself.  
  
Q. Rick, what were some of the conversations this week with Javan and Isaiah
about what happened in the Baylor game? You got to know your role, take those
shots if they're there?  
COACH RICK BARNES: You said it.  
  
Q. How did they respond to that?  
COACH RICK BARNES: We've had some good practices, we have, but we've had some
pretty good practices most of the year, but when the lights come on, you got
to go. So we need -- but you guys know, we came out of that tournament knowing
Kendal and Martez showed us some things. Demarcus Croaker has had a couple
good days here. This time of year, you got to be doing it or we got to
advance. You have to use our bench, there's no doubt about it.  
I think those guys, they've learned, I hope from it, and we've got -- none the
less, right now you've got to be ready to go with whoever is getting it done
for you.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, many people regarded your conferences as the best in the
country. How did that help shape your team for tournament time?  
COACH RICK BARNES: It is. The round robin, oh, boy, it's tough. You feel like
you're in a grinder from January on and you're playing against outstanding
teams with some outstanding coaches with a wealth of experience and everybody
-- there wasn't a team in our league that didn't get better from start to
finish. But it was a night-in-night-out grind, knowing if you let down, you're
going to get beat. I think every coach in the league would say that. You
better be ready the play every single night. If you weren't, you're going to
lose. Really, it's just going through that round robin from January up until a
week ago, it's tough. But with that said, I think our guys know we've seen
about everything that we can see and we played teams that spread the floor,
against size, played the post players. We've seen a lot of different things.
Now we've got to be able to go out and react to changes, but it goes -- it
always goes back to fundamentally you got to respect the game, play the game,
and as a group execute.  
  
Q. Everybody wonders about young players in the tournament for the first
time, do they get butterflies and deal with nerves? Do you ever have to teal
with that?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I think it's good. I think butterflies and nerves. I think
I'd probably be a little concerned if I had a group of guys that didn't get
have a little nervousness in them, because I think that, all told you ask any
athlete that's played at any high level, they all feel that, whether you want
to call it a bit anxious, whatever, but I also think these guys, I'm not going
to say they all, because I've seen guys not be able the shake it. The fact is,
you want them -- I think get butterflies.  
I know as a coach, you can tell guys that are tuned in, focused in, in terms
of the way their approach is. I think if they were really honest, I think any
coach would tell you that from a coaching standpoint, you get butterflies,
whatever you want to call it, because this is what you do and you want your
guys to be able to respond. And if you feel that from a player sometimes,
you've got to know your player, what can you do to try to jolt them out of it
is what you hope and -- I do want them to be a little bit -- I don't want them
uptight, but I do want them to be on edge. That means butterflies or whatever,
you do want them on the edge.  
  
Q. How did it go last week with the killing off the whole day? You have to
do that again. The game doesn't start till 9:00? What do you do all day here
in Milwaukee?  
COACH RICK BARNES: The same thing. We're going -- probably give them a couple
hours to enjoy the sun.  
  
Q. You've seen it. That's good.  
COACH RICK BARNES: Enjoy the sun a little bit, get outside. Might go play sand
volleyball, something like that. The fact is, I think what's good is they
will, if you want the look for -- like they're going to get a chance to watch
some of these games early. That's what they'll want to do. we'll do our normal
preparation. We have a schedule that we follow.  
We played great at West Virginia. The time didn't bother us there. But I think
with this being said, it's going to be exciting to them watching the games
that come on before us. And that's what, if you ask them what they want to do,
that's probably what they want to do.  
  
Q. You seem more understated than you used to be in your wild days at
Clemson. Do you feel like you're less emotional as a coach on the sideline?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Probably more mature. I don't know I would say less
emotional. I don't think that. I think I'm -- yeah, I'd say the word is
"mature." I think that I am. The game has changed so much, too. One part of
that being officiating. I think if I go back to when I was younger and out of
control, always most of it was vented as officiating.  
But I do think that the NCAA has worked really hard, I know our league is the
best at really officials, and you're more confident that way. I'm confident.
Again, coaches make mistakes, players make mistakes, officials make mistakes.
There's a lot more accountability across the board. Thinking back to being
younger, it would be probably more emotional was ranting and raving for no
reason, really. So, I'd like to think I've matured a little bit.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you. Good luck tomorrow night.  
COACH RICK BARNES: Thank you.

_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome to the podium student-athletes, Jordan Bachynski
and Jahii Carson. Questions, please.  
  
Q. Jahii, it's always difficult for point guards, especially scoring point
guards, to kind of figure out when to try to get everyone involved and when to
take things over. Just how difficult has that been lately for you, given the
fact that you guys have kind of struggled offensively?  
JAHII CARSON: Now, you know, I just got to let the game come to me. I got to
be aggressive. I think that helps my teammates get in their rhythm and get
better shots. When I'm aggressive, I think it's better for us offensively
because we can get other players other shots as well, because the defense
can't sit and help on me, they have to help my team. They have to guard my
teammates. Being aggressive helps us.  
  
Q. Jahii, no matter how much basketball you played before this and how much
play after, you'll never have the opportunity to play in the NCAA Tournament.
Knowing that this is your first and only shot at it, your thoughts at how
important it is for you to play in the tournament but also play well and even
try to make some noise?  
JAHII CARSON: Yes, definitely. You know, this is a dream come true. As a kid
growing up, I definitely watched all the NCAA Tournament games I could, and
with this being my first time here, I definitely see it's a main goal for our
team the make some noise. We've played some good teams. We can compete with
anybody in the country. It's going to be a big stage for us to finally show we
can play with everybody.  
THE MODERATOR: Jordan, what do you see from Texas?  
JORDAN BACHYNSKI: They're a really good team. I mean, they're really big on
the inside, and it's going to be a great test for me and the test of our team.
I mean, we've got a game plan and we're going to stick to it.  
  
Q. Along those same lines, Jordan, how many teams have you played with not
just the big front court, but as many bodies as they have there that they can
throw at you?  
JORDAN BACHYNSKI: I think the only team that really kind of compares with them
is Marquette. They were really big and something different than we had faced
all year up until then. And I think we responded well as a team, and we
figured out how to attack that, and I think we're going to do kind of the same
thing.  
  
Q. What would you say about the job Herb has done this year in getting you
guys back to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2009?  
JAHII CARSON: I think he's done a fantastic job of, you know, preparing us for
this moment. He's been talking to us about taking it one step at a time, one
game at a time, and just being focused and connected as a team. I think with
him guiding us, that we followed his lead and he's never been scared of
anything. He's just always game by game and ready to lead us. We follow his
lead, and now we've been here, we're here now, and I just want to give my hat
off to Coach Herb. He's been a great coach to us all season and a great
leader.  
  
Q. Jordan, much has been made about Herb's record when he has five or more
days to prepare, he's six and one in the first round of NCAA Tournament games.
What do you attribute that to, that program-wide starting with the top at
Herb?  
JORDAN BACHYNSKI: He's a great coach. He knows what needs to be done to
prepare. He uses everyone around him. He isn't the guy who just sits in a room
and comes up with schemes of his own. He really does include everyone in the
coaching staff and we'll go at it in practice. If something doesn't work, he's
willing to change it to what best fits our team. I think just taking advantage
of everything around him is what makes him a great coach.  
  
Q. Jahii, their backcourt has not been a great shooting team all year. Do
you play much zone? Do you sag off people or sort of press the action, extend
the defense?  
JAHII CARSON: We keep our defense the same. We're going to pressure the
basketball, make it hard for them to get it to the post to finish. We're going
to stay in our gaps and make it also difficult for them to throw the ball
inside. The more pressure you have, I think it's the more difficult they have,
and once they swing it, we'll jump in our gaps and make it that much harder to
get it to the bigs.  
  
Q. How do you pace yourself, Jordan, both mentally and physically being the
last game of the day?  
JORDAN BACHYNSKI: We've had a few games this past year that have been really
late, and we like it. I mean, you just got to kind of shorten the day a little
bit and just treat it like any other game.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Jordan, one more. Given Texas's ability to rebound the basketball, how
important is your role going to be in the game tomorrow, especially when it
comes to staying out of foul trouble? You have to be on the floor.  
JORDAN BACHYNSKI: Yeah. I think it's not only my job to rebound, but in order
for us to be successful, yes, I do need to rebound, but it needs to be
everybody on the floor. They don't send one guy, two guys to the backboards.
They send everyone on the team. Unless we have everyone on our team boxing out
and going after rebounds, that's what we need to be successful.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Gentlemen, thank you. Good luck. Herb Sendek has
been the coach at Arizona State since 2006. Counting his time at Miami and
Ohio and North Carolina State, this is his eighth trip to the NCAA Tournament,
his second with the Sun Devils. Coach, congratulations on the season so far
and welcome to Milwaukee. Say a few words before we take some questions.  
COACH HERB SENDEK: Well, thank you very much for the introduction. Obviously
our team is very excited to be here, to be part of March Madness.  
Two of the guys on Selection Sunday when we paused for just a second to catch
our breath after the announcement that this experience certainly will be
something they can treasure and cherish the rest of their lives.  
  
Q. Herb, talked to you a little bit about this, but Rick was talking earlier
about the Providence days and how you like to work 17, 18 hours days. When you
think back to those times, what do you remember most?  
COACH HERB SENDEK: They really were the best of times. I was so fortunate as a
young coach to have tremendous mentors and teachers, to be afforded
opportunities, and certainly included would be my experience with Coach
Barnes.  
He was a young coach at the time, had already done a miraculous job at George
Mason. Came into Providence and helped continue the great tradition that that
school has in men's basketball and, you know, just -- it just always was a
great reminder being around him that, you know, you could stay grounded and be
an ultimate gentleman.  
I've said it over and over, he's the kind of guy that if you have a son who
plays basketball, you want him to play for Coach Barnes because he's that good
a person, and when you look at his track record at Texas, it's absolutely
remarkable what he's done.  
  
Q. He dated your guys first meeting back to 1978. He was really crystal
clear about it to 1978 Pittsburgh basketball camp. Do you remember the same
thing? Any idea of like how you -- why that was -- that particular thing was
so memorable to him?  
COACH HERB SENDEK: Back in that day it was kind of preclub basketball. And so
camps were huge, and so all the coaches spent the summer working at camps. And
if you were an aspiring coach, if you were in college, you worked as a
counselor. If you were a player, you maybe picked a camp or two to go to in
the summer. And the head coach at the University of Pittsburgh at that time,
dear friend, great mentor, Tim Grgurich, had a fantastic basketball camp
called Play Basketball Day Camp. And he also had Coach Shae, Coach Maloney,
two great coaches that I'm very close with, working together with him.  
Coach Barnes, even though he was from North Carolina, came up and would work
the camp. And that's when I first had an opportunity to meet Coach.  
  
Q. He also raved about you. He said obviously even more than basketball
coach, he said you were a better person. What's your reaction when you hear
something like that from someone obviously you respect a lot?  
COACH HERB SENDEK: Obviously I'm humbled and flattered by it, but really as a
young coach with an opportunity to work for him, you know, he showed me a lot.
He taught me a lot, and he was just somebody -- he just always thoughtful,
always kind and considerate. I think it's best summed up by what I said a
second ago. You know, as much as this time of year, anytime of year, for that
matter, in sports people focus on winning. If you win, did you win enough? I
mean, he's just the ultimate gentleman. He's a good person, and I think he
sees his vocation as stretching beyond winning a basketball game. He realizes,
you know, that he has a greater mission as a teacher and a leader. And there's
some guys who talk that way, but they don't fulfill it. He does on a daily
basis, and that's what I take away from Coach as much as anything.  
  
Q. Herb, six and one all time in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.
Your record with five or more days to prepare is especially outstanding. What
have you found works for you and why have you been successful in those
scenarios?  
COACH HERB SENDEK: I don't think there's any rationale or logic. If you turned
it on us and said, why has your team gotten off to such a slow start the last
three games, I'd be like, I don't know. How could I possibly be mystical
enough to tell you why?  
You know, I think things just happen sometimes and it's hard to have a reason
or an explanation. Sometimes, you know, if you're fortunate, you can put
together a statement like you did that maybe puts us in a positive light and
-- you don't have to look very hard to put a similar statement together that
would make us look, you know, far less deserving of a compliment.  
  
Q. Herb, just looking over your roster, so many of the guys started their
college careers elsewhere. How did this come together as a team, what were the
challenges, and did it happen right away or a process for you?  
COACH HERB SENDEK: It really is a unique group, to your point. Maybe more so
than any team we've ever had. Because we do have so many new players that have
come together to form this year's team and they've come from so many different
paths. And so we didn't have a lot of time, you know, to come together as a
team. It's not like this group has been together for years. But we have a high
character team, good guys who I think generally like each other, and I think
that has helped tremendously.  
  
Q. Are you worried that Steve Patterson is giving a scouting report and the
inside story to Rick?  
COACH HERB SENDEK: I am. I'm certain they've had some late night strategy
sessions. Obviously Steve worked at Arizona before taking the job at the
University of Texas. And, as you may know, he has a long background in
basketball, so given all our top secrets away.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Barnes was asked about being able to draw experiences from
the League, the Big 12, obviously one of the top leagues in the country.
Pac-12 is another top league in the country. What can you draw from your
league play, taking it into this game?  
COACH HERB SENDEK: I think both teams played in outstanding leagues. We both
have just finished a gauntlet of a schedule. Doug told me recently that I
think our last 16 games were against teams who finished in the top 100 of the
RPI. I'm sure Texas has a similar type of schedule coming from the Big 12.  
Obviously when you have a lot of those kinds of experiences, you know, it
requires you to get better and requires you to improve. Sometimes it brings
out the best in you and other times it does get the best of you.  
But I think by this time of the year, not just the players on our team or
Texas, everybody has been through rigorous schedules. And just occurred to me
as the names were going up on sun afternoon, that almost regardless of what
bracket you were in, no matter who were you matched up, as a coach you
wouldn't look at the team sitting across from you and say, boy, we got a good
draw. They all in their own way present great challenges. There's just so many
good quality teams.  
  
Q. Herb, I wanted to ask you about Jahii Carson. He's been such a special
talent. At the end of the day, this will be his first and only crack at the
NCAA Tournament. I want to get your thoughts on how nice it would be to see
him not only get opportunity to play on the stage but perform well and maybe
even advance along the way?  
COACH HERB SENDEK: Sure. I think the first step for our team came Sunday when
we actually earned a bid to a NCAA Tournament, our guys were filled with joy.
That was something that they really worked hard to accomplish. And, you know,
to have this opportunity I know means a great deal to them.  
Now that we're here, you know, I think they're intent on playing their best
and everybody wants to advance. To do that, you got to be at a really high
level. But it's great that Jahii, who has certainly brought a great deal of
attention to our program, gets this opportunity to perform on this kind of
stage, you know, like any other in college basketball.  
You know, I would dovetail and say the same thing for the other guys on our
team, especially our seniors.  
  
Q. Herb, when you see Texas's front court, what do you see and how do you
mitigate any advantage they might have there?  
COACH HERB SENDEK: I've been tremendously impressed with their front court,
obviously. Cameron Ridley to me has a very, very bright future in basketball.
He's one of the best college front court players that we've seen in some time.
You know, he's got great size. His hands are unbelievable. He seems to me to
catch everything. He finishes around the basket. He has a presence on defense
blocking shots. He moves well when he defends ball screens. He just really is
impressive, and there's no way to simulate what he brings when you try to
prepare for Texas.  
Jonathan Holmes, the young man we tried to recruit a little bit, we didn't get
very far, we're equally impressed with his versatility. At 6' 8", 230, he
scores inside, he scores outside. He can shoot the three, he can post up. He
puts the ball on the floor. Both of those guys do a terrific job rebounding
the ball.  
So, we have tremendous respect for their front court, and I know it's going to
be a great challenge for our team.  
THE MODERATOR: With all your previous tournament experience, what have you
learned about what makes the difference in tournament time, winning and
losing?  
COACH HERB SENDEK: Yeah. There's a lot of variables. I don't know if there's
any one special ingredient. I think it always serves you well to have good
battles, to have a team that can win in different ways. Obviously at the end
of the day, whether we think back to Bill Walton's great performance, Jack
"Goose" Givens, so many wonderful memories through the years. Players step up
and do amazing things this time of year. And that's really what it comes down
to, you know, just talented guys playing at a high level, and if you can get
in a groove and maybe get a break or two, who knows.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach?  
  
Q. The fact that you lost three in a row, Texas lost five out of eight, does
that kind of mean anything?  
COACH HERB SENDEK: I don't think it means anything at all, because both of us
sit here because we played a whole season. You know, just, not the make an
excuse or to diminish the point that you make, but like four of our last six
were on the row at really tough places to play.  
So, sometimes those numbers indicate, you know, something that's there and
sometimes it can just be, if you dig a little deeper, and they lost, look who
they lost to, look where the games were.  
You know, very few teams maybe other than Wichita, right, have had some ups
and downs by this time of the year.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Coach, thank you. Good luck.  
COACH HERB SENDEK: Thank you Coach.

MILWAUKEE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+MILWAUKEE)

### [Mike Moser](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23394)

  
_MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Come to the podium, please, Oregon student-athletes, Mike Moser
and Johnathan Loyd. Guys, thanks for coming. Welcome to Milwaukee. Questions,
please.  
  
Q. This is sort of, you know, you guys having played this team earlier in
the season, what do you think still applies from that earlier game? What can
you take forward from that win and apply it tomorrow?  
MIKE MOSER: BYU is a very talented team. We learned that up in Eugene when
they scored about a hundred points on us. They can obviously score in a hurry.
But, I mean, we definitely grown since that game, so obviously they've grown
and come a long way, too. It will probably be a really different game.  
  
Q. Jonathan, this question for you. Were you surprised at how quickly Mike
was able to fit in and adapt to you guys. Can you kind of describe what all it
is that he brings to you guys?  
JOHNATHAN LOYD: I wasn't surprised at all. He knows how to play the game of
basketball. When you have a high IQ, you can fit into any system. He's
unselfish. He can really stretch the floor for us, shoot the ball, and when
you can make plays at the power forward position, it gives you a new -- gives
you a new aspect to your offense.  
  
Q. Mike, you guys beat BYU, beat Utah, and then kind of went on a skid
there. What did you guys get away from and what did you rediscover over the
course of the past few weeks?  
MIKE MOSER: Over the past few weeks of our skid, how important defensive
rebounding is to our team. We can score. Don't really have trouble doing that
at ALL. We've only really been in a situation where we haven't scored for
five, six minutes in a game, maybe one, two times this year. So, that's never
going to be really the issue for us.  
We just feel we take care of defending and rebounding, which we weren't doing
consistently at that time, which I feel like is why we kind took those skids
and some of those losses. We started doing that on a consistent basis, we
started really winning games.  
  
Q. How much did BYU change without Kyle Collinsworth and how much did the
defense prepare differently knowing he won't be able to play?  
JOHNATHAN LOYD: Kyle is a great player. He made a lot of plays for them, and
without him on the floor, just going to have another person step up, you know.
When we were in Eugene, they had bench players come in and play well for them.
So just going to have another bench player have more time and step up. They
have more talented players that can do that.  
  
Q. Johnathan, how much interaction did you have with Anson Winder over the
course of the season about either your own games, your teams and everything?  
JOHNATHAN LOYD: Every time I catch him to play, I'll text him after to let him
know what I saw. Every time he sees me play, he'll text me. Right after we saw
the draw, we both immediately texted each other like five minutes after we saw
it. Still my guy. We still talk a lot. And once all this is over, we'll
probably, you know, get back together over the years.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Both of you, if you could answer, how did
the Pac-12 prepare you for this test?  
JOHNATHAN LOYD: It's a very deep conference and a lot of teams who can score
just as well as BYU. So, it prepared us a lot just playing against good
competition.  
  
Q. Level of familiarity being on the tournament stage. Does it feel kind of
like getting back on a bike when you go through the process again?  
MIKE MOSER: Maybe to a certain extent, but, I mean, I don't think we're used
to the excitement of coming to this atmosphere. Right now I know our guys were
so anxious to get on the court and fill out the arena more. Tomorrow I'm sure
it will be heightened times two. I don't think you ever really get use to it.  
JOHNATHAN LOYD: Like Coach says, he's been here 18, 20 times, something like
that, but every time he feels excited, you know. I know what he's saying
because it's my second time and I'm still excited, just like last year. So, me
and Mike are -- both have experience here, but like he said, the excitement is
still there. It's at an all-time high.  
  
Q. Can you guys tell me how excited is Elgin? Has he bent your ear off about
Milwaukee and telling you everything about the area?  
MIKE MOSER: He's definitely really excited. He's been hounding us for our
tickets all week. So I'm sure he'll have a big following out there tomorrow,
but he was super excited even before selection Sunday, he was hoping and
praying we were going to make to it Milwaukee. As soon as they called our name
and said we're coming here, he jumped up and he went crazy.  
  
Q. Going back to that game in December, can you guys take me through the
last like, say, 30 seconds. You trailed almost the entire game. What it was
like to finally get the lead or closing it on getting the lead after being
down?  
JOHNATHAN LOYD: I think we were down seven with about two minutes to go, and,
you know, we just kind of got some stops and guys made big shots and Mike
ended up tying it up with about 30 seconds to go or something like that. And
then in overtime we just kind of pulled away.  
So, like Mike was saying earlier, they're a great offensive team. They really
get out in transition, and Tyler Haws was feeling it against us that game. So,
we're going to have to do a good job of stopping him so we don't see a repeat
of that.  
  
Q. Johnathan, what clicked with Calliste against BYU, a career high? And was
it the matchup or simply the game? What do you guys need to get that kind of
output with him tomorrow?  
JOHNATHAN LOYD: Before that game he just told me he was feeling it, actually,
and when he's feeling it, he's really feeling it because he can always shoot
the ball. I think he's only -- I don't think he's had a game where he hasn't
shot the ball well, maybe one. So, I don't know if it was a matchup or what,
but when he came out and hit the first shot off the bench, I knew it was going
to be a big game for him. He kept it rolling. They tried to go under the
screens on him. He kept knocking down that trey.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions. Mike and Johnathan, thank you. Good luck.  
Oregon Coach, Dana Altman is here. And maybe, Coach, if could you just say a
word or two, and then we'll open it up for questions.  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: Well, a month ago, this didn't look like it was going to
happen. So I'm real happy for the guys that they got things on the right track
and were able to participate in this year's NCAA Tournament. Got a good group
of seniors that have worked awfully hard, and I think that, you know, we have
an opportunity to play a BYU team that we played early in the year, and we
know it's a tough matchup. Offensively they're an explosive team, and so we
know we're going to have to play well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. What can you take from the earlier game that still applies? Obviously
it's been a long time and they're playing different. I'm sure you guys have
progressed. What still can you learn, what did you learn from the first game
that you may apply to tomorrow's action?  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: Well, I think that, you know, their transition was really
faster and quicker than we anticipated. They jumped on us pretty early. We
were unable to keep up with them, their speed and the way they got it up and
down the floor, you know, really surprised us.  
So, I think we'll take that from the first game that we know we got to put our
defensive transition together quicker. I think that will be a big, big key in
the game.  
You know, Tyler really hurt us. He got 32 in the game, but he hits a variety
of shots and so, you know, he's getting almost 24 points a game. So it's no
accident. He scores against everybody, and he's a great mid range player. Gets
to the basket and inside, he really offensive rebounds very well.  
If you look at their numbers, they're a very good offensive rebounding team.
Those three things are critical for us, you know, of getting back defensively,
making sure that Tyler doesn't have a huge game, and then making sure that on
the boards we stay close to them, because they're a very good rebounding team.  
  
Q. How much of a different team is BYU without Kyle Collinsworth and how
much differently do you prepare for them without him?  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: That's a really tough question to answer in the fact it's
kind of been our experience when someone goes down that first game, the team
really gets together and, you know, somebody steps up and has a big game. You
got to be real fearful of someone who loses a player, especially Collinsworth
is very good. He does a lot of things.  
They've got a lot of guys sitting there waiting for an opportunity and will
jump in there and try to help the team, try to show that they can do it, and
they've got people there that are very talented.  
So, I think it will make some difference. I think they may be a little more
perimeter oriented. I think they'll have a couple guys that maybe shoot the
three a little bit better. He was versatile for them. He played the three and
the four and even brought the ball down the floor sometimes.  
I'm sure they'll miss that. But I'm sure there are a lot of guys sitting over
there anxious to get an opportunity, and it's the NCAA Tournament. They'll be
anxious to get in there and show everybody what they can do.  
  
Q. When Brandon Austin transferred to Oregon, what were your conversations
like? You said you knew that the suspensions weren't that serious. Can you go
through what your conversations were with Providence?  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: Ed and I had some conversations. You know, we felt
comfortable with the fact that Providence wanted him to stay, and at the time
we gathered all the information we could and felt comfortable with our
decision.  
  
Q. Has any of your information changed?  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: We haven't received any information, no.  
  
Q. What is his status with your team now that a lot of the allegations that
have come out?  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: I haven't received any information, so I'm not sure what
those are. When we get back to campus, I'll sit down with our athletic
director and decide what direction we go.  
  
Q. Ed Cooley said wasn't able to share very many details. Do you know what
details were shared with you at the time?  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: No. We talked, but specifics we didn't go into. I'm sure
there's some legal things that he had to be very careful of.  
  
Q. What did you learn about your team during that slide in the middle of the
year where you guys were sputtering a little bit and how did you kind of snap
out of that?  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: Well, it was a tough stretch. You know, a lot of teams
would have folded, lot of teams could have gave into it. I was really proud
the way the guys fought it and stayed with it. We had four, two-point losses,
two at home to Stanford and UCLA and two on the road at Arizona and Arizona
State. It was a long month, and the guys could have folded, but they didn't.  
So, I was pleased with the leadership we got from John Loyd and Mike and the
seniors, Jason stepped up, did a good job. So we got some good leadership and
the guys, you know, got a roll going and able to fight back.  
It was a long, hard month for the players, the coaches, our fans. It didn't go
very well there for awhile.  
  
Q. Coach, you sensing a little familiarity for at least half the guys that
are back here, is that helping at all?  
COACH DANA ALTMAN: I don't know. We didn't have anybody went to the tournament
last year and it worked out okay. So, you know, I'm not sure, you know, how
important experience is. It should help. We've got guys that have gone, and
the six guys that were with us last year got a couple games under their belt
Mike and Jason both played. We do have a number of players who have played,
and hopefully that will help us.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions, please. All right. Coach, thank you good luck.

RICK PITINO: These guys here have had a lot of wins under their belt, a lot of
great tournament experiences, conference tournaments as well as NCAA. We
talked about this game tonight, and they watched Pittsburgh‑Florida, and I
said, guys, that's the exact game you're going to be in. And you're going to
have to be the prettiest team in an ugly game because that's the way it's
going to be.  
The emphasis we put on taking the three‑point shot away was big, and we just
wanted to grind out a W. I said, it's not every game that you can play up and
down like if it's Houston or Connecticut, the teams that run. So this is a
team that will turn you over, they'll grind it out, they play everybody close.
So we were real proud of our effort defensively. We grinded out a win, and
that's what the NCAA Tournament is all about.  
  
Q. Luke, you had four fouls about midway through the second half. Did you
have to change the way you were going to play to make sure that you could stay
in this game throughout the whole duration, or was it just keep on the same
way?  
LUKE HANCOCK: I just thought about not making any stupid fouls. My fourth foul
was not the smartest play ever, and I felt like I just needed to play smart
for the rest of the half. I didn't change too much.  
  
Q. Montrezl, with the focus on taking away the three ‑point line, that means
you and the post are going to have to be a last line of defense and help kind
of muck things up in there. What did you do to take away the scoring
opportunities in the paint, and how much more pressure did them not hitting a
three put on their offense to score tonight?   
MONTREZL HARRELL: We knew coming into the game this was a big three‑point
shooting team and they were a big duck‑in team. We knew if we took those two
things away from them they'd have a hard time scoring the ball. Their plays
are pretty much designed for their big man Loe to pop out and shoot threes, so
every time we tried to get into our down, we made sure that most of the time
we ended up switching because the guard would try to attack us and they wanted
are guards to start following the other guards so Loe could pop back for a
three so we did a lot of good switching. And the last line of defense really
wasn't my call. It was more Stephan Van Treese, he had some big‑time blocks
for us towards the end when we got beat baseline, so it was really his last
line of defense, and I think he did an excellent job with making some big time
blocks for us towards the end.  
  
Q. Luke, what does it say about your team when Russ doesn't have his best
game but you guys are still fairly efficient and effective?  
LUKE HANCOCK: Just gives you confidence. Russ knows that he needs to play and
prepare just like Russ Smith does. He's got to make a couple tweaks but Russ
is one of our leaders. We have faith in him. We know what kind of player he
is. We know his scoring ability and we know how he affects the game
offensively and defensively. It feels great to get a win, and Russ is going to
be Russ.  
  
Q. (No microphone)?  
LUKE HANCOCK: Right, absolutely. We had other guys step up big. Chris Jones is
playing well, Montrezl down low, Stephan down low, Wayne Blackshear coming in,
Terry Rozier, and just playing off those guys. He might not be scoring a lot
of points, but Russ found me several times. He always is looking for
teammates, and he's just a playmaker. He's Russ Smith.  
  
Q. Is there a player that Luke reminds you of?  
RICK PITINO: Not really. I mean, I think he's a terrific player. I just can't
think off the top of my head.  
  
Q. Luke had two threes there right around the 12 ‑minute mark that cut the
lead to two. What did that do just to keep Saint Louis at arm's length and
give some cushion there?   
RICK PITINO: Well, it's important but we had to go to him at that time because
he's our clutch guy. You know, the most difficult‑‑ Russ Smith has grown so
much as a basketball player, but he still has one thing left, and I tried to
explain this to him at halftime, but he has a very difficult time, he's a
distracted young man, understanding this. I said, Russ, there's a lot better
coaches than me in the other locker room, but picture if I was in the other
locker room. Do you think I would even let you breathe any time down the
court? Do you think I would let you breathe? He says, no, Coach, you would
double me, you would trap me. I said, so don't you think the other coaches are
doing the same thing? All the great ones from Michael Jordan to Kobe, they
don't try to score 20 points in the first quarter. They get everybody else the
ball and they let the game come to me and the other team fatigues and things
open up. So his last lesson is to play like he did in the second half and not
come out. He doesn't understand the scouting of the other teams. He's all
Michael, all Kobe. But he doesn't get that those guys in the other locker room
are a lot smarter than me. He doesn't get it. So we're going to give him shock
treatment on Monday. (Laughter).  
  
Q. You called a time ‑out there when Saint Louis took the lead early on in
the second half. What did you tell your guys‑‑  
RICK PITINO: I just wanted to get the right shot to the right person in two or
three options.  
  
Q. Why did you think this game would be ugly based on the way Saint Louis
played, and did you have to change your style because of that?  
RICK PITINO: You know, the NCAA, the one thing I've known throughout the
years, being in this business, is people get very conservative, and they talk
about‑‑ I've always felt‑‑ you hear the expression defense wins championships.
A lack of offense keeps you from winning a championship. All these teams can
guard. And it's really, really important‑‑ we beat Michigan and Wichita State
and the teams before that, and we were a very good defense because of our
offense. We didn't win because of our defense. Every team can play defense at
this stage. So you've got to have great offense to win, and you've got to
really execute and make free throws, do smart things.  
So it's really the offense that's going to‑‑ if you watched
Florida‑Pittsburgh, you knew how that game was going to be played, and the
better defensive team, both teams were going to play great defense, but the
team with the best offense was going to win the game. So we looked at Saint
Louis, we knew it was going to be this type of game. If you play a Cincinnati,
if you play a Pittsburgh, you know what type of game it's going to be. VCU
couldn't speed up Saint Louis, and so we knew that it was going to be this
type of game, so we had to be as good as they were defensively, take away the
three, and wear them down with pick‑and‑rolls, because they take the wings
away.  
  
Q. Did you talk about Chris Jones yet?  
RICK PITINO: Chris Jones is playing terrific basketball. The only thing he's
struggling with right now is we change a lot defensively based on what we do
offensively, and he's struggling a little bit with that, and he's just
struggling picking it up. Outside of that, he gives us big steals, he's
playing well. I told him in one situation, I said, Chris, when teams trap you,
you've got to take on the bigger guy, go by him and then make the pass. You
can't back up and then try to split it because now you're 5'10" trying to be
5'5". So he did that, he lost the ball there, he took the guy on, made some
good plays, made big steals. He's playing great basketball for us right now,
it's just he's adjusting to all these multiple defenses.  
The past three years have been one of the more wonderful experiences of my
life in terms of the quality young men I'm coaching, but this is a difficult
team to coach, very difficult.  
  
Q. What sort of things does Chris do for you?  
RICK PITINO: You already know those. You know, it's tough to fathom for all of
us that‑‑ I didn't grow up with a privileged life, but compared to Chris, it
was very much privileged. So it's tough in recruiting when you go around and
you see these young people and the danger of the areas they grow up in, it's
very difficult on them. Wayne Blackshear saw his dad killed. So it's very,
very difficult for them. It takes a lot of nurturing for them to become young
men, and Chris has come‑‑ from where he was, light years in the type of person
he's becoming, and that's the joy of college coaching.  
Look, we all teach the fundamentals, we all teach the game, but the joy of
college coaching is the nurturing of young people. It's really fun to see Russ
and Luke and VT grow up into young men that are really wonderful people.  
  
Q. Your defense held them without a three ‑pointer and you talked about that
was an emphasis. Is that a stat you allow your defense to hang their hat on or
is it on to the next one?  
RICK PITINO: Well, we went to a different type of zone, almost like a
one‑one‑three, to make sure there were no bumps where they could pop out and
get a three, and what we would give up at times is maybe a high‑post pass. We
wanted to smother the three. This team reminds me of Colorado State last year,
extremely well coached in all phases of the game, and we felt if we gave up
the three we could get beat tonight, so we will take that away. That doesn't
mean we're going to be successful. We were just successful tonight, but we
weren't going to give up the three. We were going to hand our hat on taking
away the three‑point shot, and VT, in crucial situations, I looked up, I said
to my assistant, was that VT blocking those shots? He really got up, timed it
beautifully, and we really need him to play well down the stretch. He's
playing terrific, and Chris Jones‑‑ now if I can just get Russ to understand
what the other coach is saying in the locker room, we'll come of age and move
on and be very successful. But that's something he hasn't grasped. That's the
last hurdle for Russ Smith.

BILLY DONOVAN: We knew it was going to be a challenging, physical basketball
game, a low‑scoring game, which it was. I was really, really proud of the way
these guys came out and responded from our game on Thursday. I thought the
difference in the game for us, one, I thought 10 steals, which means there's
live‑ball turnovers, which kind of got us out on the break some, we got some
points off turnovers, even though I thought Pitt did a very good job against
the press, I did think the press was effective in terms of just getting the
pace of the game going up‑and‑down the floor.  
I thought Scottie coming down the stretch of the game before I took him out,
banged knees, really got in the lane, made some things happen for our team,
made some great plays, and then I thought Will got back to being who he was
for most of the game.  
You know, it was interesting last game Frazier didn't get very many looks, and
I'm not so sure he's had the kind of looks he had today. He goes 2 for 9 from
the three‑point line, and I thought we had very, very good looks. Our
frontcourt, I thought Patric and Dodo in particular really had some decent
shots. Patric in particular in the first half just couldn't finish around the
basket, but we overcame that, and I thought our defense in particular, both
halves it was good, but I thought in the second half it really, really was
good, and these guys did a really terrific job from start to finish.  
  
Q. Scottie, two questions: One, take us through the end of the half when
they fouled you intentionally and then for some reason didn't foul you, and
secondly, the last four minutes of the game or so when you just took over?  
SCOTTIE WILBEKIN: Yeah, I expected them to foul me, too, but they didn't, and
I was just trying to get a shot up, and at the end of the game just trying to
get a good shot. They were kind of pressuring out, so I was able to get into
the lane and the bigs weren't really stepping up on me, so I was able to
finish.  
  
Q. Scottie, could you talk in particular in the end of the sequence of the
game on the shot where you drove in the lane and made the tough one with the
left hand? Did you think that was going in?  
SCOTTIE WILBEKIN: Yeah, I mean, I thought it was going in. I just‑‑ it was
kind of a weird‑‑ I think if I remember what you're talking about, it was kind
of a weird finish. I had to twist my body a little bit. But I mean, it went
in.  
  
Q. Scottie, can you talk a little bit about yesterday, how much of this game
was won in your preparation and how hard Billy was on you guys, and can you
talk about the start of the game? Were you going to let this team come out
with less energy than it needed to have?  
SCOTTIE WILBEKIN: Yeah, Coach was really getting on to us and challenging us
and just asking us if that was the team that we wanted to be in these last
couple of games that we have. We just wanted to come out and not let them play
harder than us or not let us play as hard as we can, and I think we did a good
job of having our energy up at the start of the game, and we played together
on offense and played together on defense.  
  
Q. Will, a long way from Florida Air Academy days, but talk about your
aggressiveness tonight. For me it was one of the more aggressive games that
I've seen you play. There was a sequence where you had a blocked shot, a steal
with a behind ‑the‑back pass for an assist and then a deflection all in
sequence. Talk about your aggressive play, and Scottie, did you feed off of
that energy?   
WILL YEGUETE: I was just trying to be aggressive defensively. I knew they were
going to be a really good team. On offense I was trying to make plays and help
my teammates, and I was able to shoot the ball sometimes and able to make
plays, and that's really what I wanted to do today because I knew they were
going to be a really good team from the get‑go and I had to be ready to go.  
  
Q. Will, along the same lines, what did you do on Talib Zanna and a hobbled
Mike Young? What were you able to do to prevent them from getting offensive
rebounds and muck up the paint?  
WILL YEGUETE: We knew going into the game it was going to be a battle. Pat and
myself, Dodo and Chris, I think we did a good job boxing out, and the guards
got in there, got a lot of rebounds. I think Frazier got a lot of rebounds,
Scottie had three rebounds as well, I guess he had six rebounds, so that would
helped us move those guys to get in there and rebound the ball and help us
out.  
  
Q. Scottie, how would you characterize your personal development over the
last several months since the suspensions, and how do you think that's kind of
translated on the court for you?  
SCOTTIE WILBEKIN: I think just trying to get better in little areas, the small
stuff, trying to be a better leader. As far as how it translates on the court,
I think it's helped me become a better leader, be more connected with my
teammates and coach, and just‑‑ it's helped me play with a freer mind.  
  
Q. Scottie, at the end of the game you were almost subdued. Was it because
of the banged knee? You looked exhausted there at one point.  
SCOTTIE WILBEKIN: Yeah, I was kind of tired, but I don't know if I banged
knees or what happened, but after the tie‑up is when I started to feel it. I
think it's just a bruised knee, so I'll be fine.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about this team's defense all year? What makes a good
defensive team, and why do you think you guys are such a good defensive
team?  
SCOTTIE WILBEKIN: I think it starts with Coach and the rest of the coaches
really making that an emphasis in practice and us buying into it as a team.
And I think that we have good individual defenders and we've bought into
playing team defense and really helping each other, and it's something that we
value and we take pride in playing good defense. It energizes us when we get
good stops.  
  
Q. Scottie, just before the half when you made that shot from about 35, 40
feet, you wanted open looks and three ‑pointers, did you ever expect that kind
of an open look? Talk about that. It looked like you jumped, you lofted, you
really moved it.   
SCOTTIE WILBEKIN: Yeah, I mean, that's the look that I hoped for in that
situation. I don't really shoot too many runner threes, but it went in, and I
was pretty happy about it.  
  
Q. Scottie, when you think about that last six ‑minute sequence where you
got the 13 points, did you consciously make an effort to kind of try to take
over because you seemed to have spots in games where you do that for two or
three possessions and then you kind of let the game flow the other times, but
did you make a conscious effort to try to do that or did it just happen?   
SCOTTIE WILBEKIN: I would say that it just happened. Our offense isn't really
designed for one player to do something. The ball was in my hands, kind of a
late‑clock situation, and I was able to get down the lane. I think with phrase
spacing and I think we did a good job of having good spacing, so I was able to
finish the play, whereas if they would have stepped up I would have tried to
find Pat or Will or somebody else.  
  
Q. Billy, we've seen time and time again you guys make adjustments during
the break, but what allowed Scottie to go off in the second half, and when was
the last time you saw a player really dominate down the stretch?  
BILLY DONOVAN: Well, you know, Pitt, they're very, very disciplined. You know,
they guard pick‑and‑rolls in a unique way in the fact that they really run out
there with their big people and really try to disrupt the guard coming off.
And then they really do a great job with their protection, they are three guys
that are protecting, and they rotate a little bit more uniquely than maybe
some other teams we've played against this year in the backside.  
And what happened was I thought as the game wore on we were able to make their
big guys late to get all the way out there like they normally do, and Scottie
was able to turn the corner, Kasey Hill was able to turn the corner and we
were able to get the ball down the lane. They're very, very difficult to score
against, Pitt, when you try to post feed from the lane, when you try to run
offense from side to side. You've really got to play, in my opinion, down the
lane. If you look at a lot of Patric's post feeds were high‑low passes where
they couldn't double as much. It was pick‑and‑rolls in the middle of the floor
to get down the lane and distribute.  
I thought Scottie did a great job several times finding Frazier on skip passes
because of the way they rotate. We just didn't make those shots. But a lot of
times it was the movement before Scottie got any screening action that allowed
him to get some space around their big guys, and for a guy like Zanna and
Young and their frontcourt, it is physically demanding what they do, and then
they gotta go down there and they got to play post defense, they've got to run
back and run offense, and I thought as the game wore on they were not quite as
good or able to get out there like they normally were maybe earlier in the
game.  
  
Q. You guys outscored Pitt by 12 in the paint and held Zanna to 10 points.
Was that a point of emphasis coming into this game, controlling the paint?  
BILLY DONOVAN: Well, Pitt is a really, really good rebounding team. I'm not so
sure that Zanna, in my opinion, is a go‑to guy for them offensively. The thing
I was impressed with, because obviously I saw Pitt play a little bit during
the year, actually I saw them, I think I said this on Thursday, when they
played against Albany. He is a great energy guy. He's a great offensive
rebounder. I think he had 21 offensive rebounds against North Carolina in the
ACC Tournament, 10 of which were offensive.  
He's good at kind of driving from the elbows. He's good at sealing when they
can find him. But Jamie, the way they run their offense with a lot of
screening, a lot of motion, a lot of times when he's a screener and you've got
Patterson coming off or Wright coming off, he gets a lot of dump‑down passes.
So there wasn't a lot really for him, I didn't think, where they were just
post feeding him and going to him to score. He's kind of an opportunistic
scorer but he also scores based on offensive rebounding. I thought a big key
for us was at least we out‑rebounded them and we held them on the glass. We
didn't give up a lot of offensive rebounds.  
  
Q. You didn't have Will a couple years ago in the tournament and he was just
recovering from an injury last year. How different is this team when he's
healthy?  
BILLY DONOVAN: It's huge. He's big. And again, he's one of those guys that
look down at the stat sheet and he's probably going to take anywhere from two
to five shots per game, but he just does so many different things in the
press. He's such a great cover guy with our defense. He's a great help
defender. He's the epitome of a guy that when you look down at the stat sheet
it's hard to have a level of appreciation for him.  
You know, for me as a coach, I've always tried to talk to Will about how much
I appreciate, because he really impacts winning. He really impacts the game in
a very, very positive way for us, and what he does is really, really rare.
It's hard to find. It's hard to find guys that really kind of hang their hat
on being kind of a dirty‑work guy, and it's hard sometimes because certainly
it doesn't really give them a lot of headlines. He's not a headline guy. But
he really does a lot for our team.  
  
Q. With all the talk about the slow starts and letting the lead slip away
toward the end, how important was it to start off fast and solidify the win?  
BILLY DONOVAN: I think getting off to a good start was important because if
you look at the way Pitt got off against Colorado, they really did a great job
defensively creating turnovers, getting out on the break and really opened the
game up within the first eight minutes of the start of the game. If you look
at them against Carolina in the ACC Tournament, they jumped on Carolina and
had them down by 19, so I think when you're playing against a good team like
Pitt, you want to at least ‑‑ not that you're going to jump out to that many
points ‑‑ but you don't want to get down eight, 10, 12 points to start the
game and then try to play catch up. I thought for the most part in the first
half, it was really back and forth. You know, we got up by a few points, they
got up by a few points, we got up by five, Patterson makes a three, cuts it to
two, we got up by four. It's a two‑point game in the last position, Scottie
throws a tough shot at the end of the half, we go up five, and then we slowly
build a bigger lead as the game wore on there in the second half.  
  
Q. Can you describe yesterday's practice and how you got everyone's
attention, and Scottie is a guy you've tried to get the attention of for
years. Why do you think it's sunk in so well with him?  
BILLY DONOVAN: Yeah, you know, I was‑‑ I think after the game on Thursday, as
a coach you always want to play to your identity and who you've been and who
we've been the entire year. I didn't feel like we did that. We didn't play to
our identity there and I was disappointed by that because we really hadn't
done that all year long. That's why I was disappointed. And I think it's very,
very easy just to kind of say, okay, hey, win, survive, we move on, everything
is okay. I saw things inside of our team that I just did not like. And I say
that in a way, there was nothing bad like in terms of bad attitudes or guys
having a problem with one another, there was just this frustration, personal
expectation, game not going the way they wanted it to go, and that's not who
we've been. I just wanted to make sure they understood that and we got back to
who we were. Yesterday, physically, we didn't do very much at all. I don't
think you could do a whole lot. It was a 12 o'clock game today. We found out,
basically, first thing that morning, late that night, that we were playing at
12:15. There's not a whole lot you can do.  
But I did through film and through clips and different things that I saw try
to bring it to their attention, areas that I thought we needed improvement.
And I think to their credit they kind of got back to‑‑ I don't think any of
them disagreed with anything I had to say. And I think that they understood
where I was coming from and hopefully that in some way helped us get prepared
for this game.  
  
Q. (No microphone)?  
BILLY DONOVAN: Yeah, Scottie‑‑ listen, for me, it's been one of the great
experiences for me as a coach going through what he and I have gone through
together. People get a chance maybe to see him grow as a player, I got a
chance to see him grow as a person. It was a struggle and a battle for me
because I had to do two things. One, the long suspension for him had more to
do with, for me, he needed to regain credibility inside of our team. He had
lost all his credibility. So I tried to put him in a situation where he could
show his commitment to the rest of those guys. And also he needed to start the
season‑‑ I think you heard him say it. He had a lack of awareness of how
choices and decisions he made affected or impacted other people, and he never
understood that.  
Now, obviously he served a penalty and he looked at it like, well, I'm the one
being punished, how is that a problem. But these younger guys on our team that
look up to him, there's other people that are looking at how he acts and what
he does. I think he is a kid that learned some valuable lessons and didn't
have a lot of awareness of things today that he has an awareness of maybe
earlier on in his career.  
And I think he realized that I was serious when I told him he needed to
transfer and just move on and start fresh somewhere else, and I think once he
made that commitment that he wanted to finish out his career here, he wanted
to work his way back, he's a guy that loves challenges, and in his own way,
what I was presenting in front of him was a real, real challenge because I'd
kind of painted a picture that said I don't believe you can do it or you will
do it. I said, time will tell. And I think he thrived on that. And it was hard
for him. He went through a very, very difficult time because he was separated
from our team for so long.  
  
Q. Bill Belichick was in the stands in a Gator visor. Talk about your
relationship with him, what you've kind of taken from him, and also, he's
known as a defensive coach. Talk about your defense, as well.  
BILLY DONOVAN: Well, he put the scouting report in today. (Laughter).  
Coach has been great to me. I don't know how many years it's been, I went to
Boston and met with him maybe after their third Super Bowl and have developed
a very, very good relationship with him and got a great respect for him. He
was in Gainesville, I guess it may have been a pro day or watching practice,
and he called me and said he wanted to come down for the game. I left him a
couple tickets. I didn't get a chance to see him today. We text messaged back
and forth, but I've really enjoyed my relationship with him. It's interesting
you get a chance to talk to a guy like that, most of the stuff that we're
talking about is the whole coaching perspective of just dealing with people
and motivating people and inspiring people and just different things. I always
appreciate the amount of time over the years he's given me and the amount of
time we've spent with one another.  
  
Q. Today on defense the emphasis seemed to be on staying down, staying in
the lane, forcing Pitt to have long possessions, making them work, just wear
them out and affect their shooting that way late in the game. Was that what
was really happening, or was I just imagining that?  
BILLY DONOVAN: No, I think that that happened. I think we had long
possessions, too. I think when you go against good defensive teams it's hard
to score early in the clock, and I thought our guys did a good job of
awareness wise of not trying to force things and jam things that weren't there
because I think really good defensive teams, early shot clock are great. They
may be a little bit more vulnerable as the shot clock starts to wind down.
Same thing for us, we're really good generally early in the clock, and through
movement you get more vulnerable. But we put them in some late‑clock
situations.  
A big key for us, I thought Patterson got loose a couple times there in the
first half. He was 0 for 3, he made one late there in the first half, but we
kind of dodged a bullet with him on some shots. He didn't shoot it
particularly well, and probably he and Frazier offset themselves because I
thought both of those guys on the floor were the two best shooters and neither
one of them had a great shooting game.  
  
Q. The play at the end of the half, were you assuming that they were going
to foul Scottie, and what did you pretty much say? And then secondly, you're
talking about the SEC Player of the Year there, but was that his best game?  
BILLY DONOVAN: You know, they fouled, and I don't know what there was,
three‑and‑a‑half, four seconds there, and I just told Scottie you're going to
have to go and get away from the shot and get a shot up because they may foul,
and I don't know if they were trying to foul or not try to foul but he was
able to turn the corner and at least get a clear path there and gave us at
least a five‑point lead coming in.  
Again, I thought‑‑ I did not think Scottie played particularly well in the
game against Albany. It was good to see him come back and respond the way he
did today. I thought all the way around he played very well. You've got to
understand, with what he did and I think you mentioned about him being tired,
he was worn out. He was chasing Patterson all over the court and he went down
the stretch and scored 13 or 14 points in a row for us. I mean, he was great
on both ends of the floor because he really gives it up on the defensive end,
and when you give it up like that and you're the point guard there's a
physical toll that your body takes over a period of time.  
  
Q. Talk about the team discipline. It was 9 ‑and‑a‑half minutes before the
first team foul was committed. I believe it was at the 10:33 mark, only two in
the first half. Talk about how key that was to this game and then going on,
Sweet 16 and beyond.   
BILLY DONOVAN: I thought for both of us it was a pretty clean game defensively
as it relates to defensive breakdowns. There were not a whole lot of them
really by either team, especially in that first half. And I think when you're
disciplined you play clean on that end of the position. You're in position,
you kind of take yourself out of harm's way of picking up a lot of fouls. The
first half there wasn't a lot of free throws. I think it says a lot about both
teams in the fact that you've got two physical defensive teams, physical
frontcourts, and it could've been a game where there was 20 free throws by
both teams in the first half and it didn't happen that way, and I think a lot
of it had to do with both teams doing a pretty good job discipline‑wise.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS:
ORLANDO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+ORLANDO)

  

## March 22, 2014

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [Lamar Patterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24439)

### [Talib Zanna](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25958)

  
_ORLANDO, FLORIDA_  
  

Florida  61  
Pittsburgh  45

  
JAMIE DIXON: Well, first of all, congratulations to Florida. They're obviously
a very good team, and the most physical team we've played all year long. They
beat us on the glass and beat us to loose balls and we got to give them
credit. I'm very proud of our two seniors who had great careers and really
finished up strong as the year went on. That says a lot about them, guys have
improved all year long, Lamar and Talib, and they had great years and great
seasons. They provided great leadership for us.  
Simply put, I was extremely disappointed in how we played. We're a better team
than what we showed today, and we have been playing better basketball. We just
didn't get it done, and I take responsibility for that. We didn't execute well
enough, we didn't rebound well enough, and as I told the guys, I'll take
responsibility for that. We didn't block out as well as we needed to, and we
didn't execute offensively as well as we needed to, and again, I take
responsibility for that.  
We lost to a very good team, though, so take nothing away from Florida.
They're good, and there's a reason why they're the No.1 seed, the most
physical, oldest team we've played all year, and they showed it.  
  
Q. Lamar, can you talk about the end of the half and the job that Wilbekin
did overall?  
LAMAR PATTERSON: He's a great point guard. He took care of business. He led
their team to a W.  
  
Q. Lamar, about Wilbekin, also, the whole Gators defense, especially in the
second half, you have Young and Yeguete with their strong post play. What did
they do after the break that caused that confusion for you guys?  
LAMAR PATTERSON: I don't know. Like I said, they just got it done. The coach
said they out‑rebounded us, they beat us to loose balls, and those are their
recipes to victory, and they did it.  
  
Q. Talib and Lamar, you guys have had long careers. Lamar, you're the
highest player in terms of games played. Kind of reflect on your career and
what the man sitting to your right means to you and kind of how big Zanna
especially this has been for you coming here from Nigeria.  
LAMAR PATTERSON: Talib is a brother to me. Couldn't ask for a person to spend
five years with. He worked hard. He improved over the course of his career,
and it showed out on the court. Our career, like you said, it was long, but
now that it's over, I felt like it wasn't long enough. There's not much I
really can say. I just appreciate that everything I had at Pittsburgh.  
TALIB ZANNA: As Lamar said, I mean, I have a really good relationship with
him. We've been through a lot since freshman year until now. I just want to
thank the school, University of Pittsburgh, for everything, and just being in
our corner and just giving us the best career they can.  
  
Q. Talib, now that you've actually played Florida, could you just describe
the problems they present and how good they can be moving forward in this
tournament?  
TALIB ZANNA: What did you say?  
  
Q. Could you describe how tough Florida is and how far maybe they can
advance in the tournament?  
TALIB ZANNA: I mean, the numbers doesn't lie. They outplayed us. They
out‑executed, everything. They got to the loose balls. We didn't get it done.
We just have to move on, and for the younger guys, they have to step up and
just come back next year and try to prove people wrong.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Wilbekin in that second half? What did he do
offensively that made it such a problem for you guys to defend him?  
JAMIE DIXON: Got in the lane. Constantly, we handled the first ball screen,
second ball screen and just kind of got into the lane at the end of clock and
made some plays, made a couple tough shots, the one runner on the left side,
that was a tough shot, and you know, I think it just became a struggle for us
because of our offense. We weren't scoring so we became harder‑‑ we had to get
a stop every single time down defensively. That led into it. But obviously
he's a senior, he's a really good player, he's been through some ups and
downs, obviously, and he's had a great finish to his career, and that's what
you hope happens to a kid that learns and gets better. They played well. I'm
sure they're proud of him and what he's become, a local guy that's done well.  
He played really well, and we didn't do a good job on him. But you think he
has a lot to do with it. He's been doing a pretty good job all year long.
There's probably a trend there.  
  
Q. Could you talk about a lot of people think that you guys are kind of
almost like the kings of the grind ‑'em‑out style of basketball. Could you
talk about how Florida was able to play that style with you today?   
JAMIE DIXON: Yeah, it's something that gets talked about, but it's often times
not accurate. Offensively we've been pretty good. Our offense has been far
ahead of our defense this year, but perception is often times, people actually
look at the numbers and the facts and‑‑ but yeah, that's what they do, and I
think people try to find something wrong with this team at 34‑2, and there's
not a lot wrong with them. They're old, they're experienced, they're by far
the most physical team we've played. They just banged us around all game long
and the bodies are evident, their size, their experienced, they're old.
They're well coached, all those things, and we just didn't execute. We tried
to cut, we tried to curl, we tried to go to the basket, and we just bounced
off of them. That was something we talked about throughout the game. We just
couldn't get it done.  
They were more patient offensively, made a lot of shots at the end of the
clock, at the end of possessions, and we didn't.  
  
Q. What makes Florida such a defensive team, and what goes into good
defense?  
JAMIE DIXON: Experience. I mean, generally your older guys are your best
defenders, and we hope that we can get old again and become a better defensive
team. But that's something we've been trying to work on.  
Again, I think their physicality is evident, and like I said, they're the most
physical team we've played all year long. They're big across the board.
They've got size all the way through, and they use it. So I think that's part
of it. Their patience offensively I think helps their defense, as well. I
think that's a big thing.  
You know, they change how they guard ball screens, and at times I thought that
was effective against us. The other day they got the rebounds, and it seemed
like we had some opportunities in transition to go on, we had some turnovers
where we fumbled the ball and didn't make the play, and that's where we needed
to open up on some transition baskets on their missed threes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the play right before the end of the half when you
made the substitution, what Wilbekin did, whether you felt like that was a
turning point?  
JAMIE DIXON: I don't know if it was a turning point. We lost by 16 points, but
it's my fault. If there's anything that goes wrong it's my fault, and I take
responsibility. We know what happened, but we can't blame anybody else but me.  
  
Q. It didn't seem like you used the 2 ‑3 zone as much today as you have in
the past. Was there a reason?  
JAMIE DIXON: We haven't been doing that. We've haven't been playing zone.
We've been playing better with our man and so that's something we haven't
played in the last six games or so. We've really decided to make that decision
was to our defense, our rebounding, we had to be more accountable defensively
with the glass and know what we were doing. You know, our defense wasn't good
enough today, but I think they had a lot to do with it: 14 offensive rebounds,
we were getting beat on the glass from the first play of the game, and that to
me was the biggest issue. I don't think that was a concern. I mean, they shot
43 percent. We needed to get some transition baskets, score some more at the
end of the press. That would have helped us. But I think that would have been
more of a factor.  
But it's obvious the game just got away from us. But the things that were
there early were the rebounding, the offensive rebounding, and even though we
were down a couple and up, we were still getting out‑rebounded early, and I
think that eventually got to us.  
  
Q. The play at the end of the half, originally you fouled and then didn't
foul. Can you take us through what the plan was there?  
JAMIE DIXON: I just spoke on it earlier. Obviously I'm going to take full
responsibility for it, but I think we all know what happened, and it's on me.
If we don't get it done, we don't get it done, and that's where it's at.
Again, we didn't get it done. Kid made a running shot from 25 feet, but we
didn't do what we‑‑ I didn't get it done.

## March 22, 2014

  

### [Jim Crews](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25045)

### [Dwayne Evans](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23453)

### [Rob Loe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26790)

  
_ORLANDO, FLORIDA_  
  

Louisville  66  
Saint Louis  51

  
JIM CREWS: Well, concerning the game, we didn't play particularly well today.
We knew if we weren't strong with the ball, that would lead to good things for
Louisville, and that certainly played out from that standpoint because we just
weren't good enough with the ball. I think we had 17 or 18 turnovers. And that
leads to points for them.  
For the most part when it was in the half court we did a pretty good
defensively, and they did, too. We weren't very good offensively or efficient.
Louisville was good defensively half court, we were good defensively half
court. But we did turn the ball over too many times and so forth.  
But with that being said, one game certainly is not going to dictate one thing
or another, and I certainly don't want that to overshadow‑‑ it won't
overshadow in our program what these seniors have done. They've had an amazing
career. They're the winningest group in Saint Louis history. They won a couple
championships, more than a couple, three championships in the last two years,
the number of games they've won in the last three years, three NCAA
Tournaments, which is really hard to get into. They've been good, all of them
are graduating this spring, they've been great ambassadors within the
community and really the world. Dwayne went on a world trip and we've had a
couple other guys go on world trips.  
Big picture, I couldn't be more proud and salute these guys for having a
wonderful, wonderful career.  
  
Q. Early in the second half you guys made a run where you guys tied the
game. Did Louisville make adjustments after that that ended up changing the
way the game was going or were you guys ‑‑ was anything else attributed to
that?   
ROB LOE: I don't know if they made adjustments or not. We got loose with the
ball there. I think we had a few turnovers right in that stretch. We didn't
have any go in when we caught up to them and tied the game. You know, like
Coach said, we were loose with the ball throughout the game, and that really
didn't help us.  
DWAYNE EVANS: Yeah, right along those lines, once we tied it up, I don't know
if we took the lead or not, but had a couple turnovers down there, a couple
offensive rebounds and put us in the hole.  
  
Q. For Dwayne, 0 for 15 from three ‑point range, first time all season you
guys haven't hit a three. How frustrating is it to see all those shots miss
and how key was it in the game?   
DWAYNE EVANS: I thought we took a lot of good shots today. They weren't
falling, but we had the right guys in the right spots. I guess you have days
like that. Obviously we would have wanted it another way, but they were good
shots.  
  
Q. Dwayne, the team again struggled from the free ‑throw line. Did you guys
kind of focus in on that a little bit more after the struggles you had
Thursday, and playing from behind again, how much confidence did Thursday give
you that you could hang in this game even with the team struggling from the
field?   
DWAYNE EVANS: Towards the end of the game we still had a chance to get back in
it. I mean, guys were pressing, we were subbing, doing everything we could to
get back into the game. Obviously free throws hurt us down the stretch and
throughout the course of the game. When you miss that many free throws and
have turnovers like that, it's hard to win.  
  
Q. Coach, Louisville switched it up, they were pressing, sometimes trapping,
sometimes just man on man. Can you talk about their defense against you guys
today?  
JIM CREWS: Well, they're very good defensively. They change things up. They do
press, and they play zone and have different shifts and so forth, and they mix
it up with man. They keep you a little bit off balance with that, which is a
good thing because basketball is a rhythmatic game and they keep you out of
rhythm with it, but we just couldn't generate‑‑ right at the start of the
second half we kind of got a little thing, but we couldn't generate and kind
of get over the hump with a little rhythm offensively in particular with it,
and that's how it played out. That's why we lost.  
  
Q. If you could kind of analyze Louisville for a little bit, are they a team
that has an opportunity to repeat again when you watch them and coach against
them?  
JIM CREWS: Well, obviously they've got a chance to repeat. They've got‑‑ how
many teams are left now? So they're going to be in the final 16, so they got
better than the other 340. A lot better chance than us right now. So yeah. I'm
not going to make them favored, but I don't know who I would favor anyway.
That's why you've got to play the game.  
They've got a very good team. They're solid, a solid team. I know it's fun to
speculate and everything else, but I haven't even seen all the teams that are
going to be left. I haven't seen them play, so I really don't know.  
  
Q. Luke Hancock with 21 today. What are the challenges that someone like him
presents?  
JIM CREWS: Well, he's really smart. He reads screens, so it's a cat and mouse.
If you play it this way, he goes the other way, if you go the other way, he
comes the other way. He's smart. He reads defense. Most guys just watch the
ball. He doesn't watch the ball. He watches the defender on him and it's like
playing tag with your little sister or little brother growing up. If they go
under the table, you go over the table. If you go right, he goes left. So he
does a great job, and he's got length. I mean, he can shoot the ball, but he's
got length that shoots it over, so you've got to really have good pressure and
get him off the shot spot. They've got some big bodies setting some good
screens. He's really good, a really good basketball player.  
  
Q. Your team goes 0 for 15 from the three ‑point line. When you're trailing
and not making three‑pointers, is there anything else your team can do or do
you have to tell them to keep going out there and keep trying to take those
shots?  
JIM CREWS: No, we're going to keep taking shots if they're good shots. We
don't have a plan before a game to say, OK, we're going to take X number of
threes in this game and that game. We don't do that because I think that
you've got to have a balance to be really good. You've got to be able to score
inside, you've got to be able to drive the ball, you've got to be able to
shoot threes, you've got to be able to run the ball and you've got to be good
defensively and offensively. Now you can be really good at one of those things
and you'll win some games but you're not going to win championships, so there
has to be a balance. Just like life, it's tough to get a balance sometimes,
and certainly in an individual small sample size of games, you're always going
to have a problem with that at times, also.

_ORLANDO, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Chris, I know it's tough when you're playing a team that you
necessarily haven't seen a lot of. What have you been able to find out about
your opponent tomorrow? What do you think they do best?  
CHRIS JONES: They've got five seniors in the lineup, so obviously going to be
a veteran group who have been through a lot. I think we just need to play how
we've been playing the whole year. I think we need to change up defenses like
we've been doing the whole year, just don't stick with one defense against
those guys. If we do, they'll make changes at halftime, I think, and we'll get
better during the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Terry, your thoughts on what you see in Saint Louis?  
TERRY ROZIER: Like Chris said, they've got five seniors so that's always tough
playing a team with five seniors. They've been running the system and running
the plays for four years now, and it's going to be a great game, a hard‑fought
game. It all comes down to who's more well‑coached and who wants it at the
end.  
  
Q. Coach Pitino talked about the benefits of having a tight game the first
round. Why do you think you're better off having the game and the test you had
last night?  
CHRIS JONES: Because I think if we would probably have gotten settled, we
would beat them by 40 last night and probably lost to Saint Louis tomorrow.
Being in a tight game like this to start the tournament is great for everyone.
That shows us it's not going to be a relaxed game. Every game is not just
going to beat people by 30 every game. That really woke me up for my first
NCAA Tournament game because I see everybody play hard every second, but it
came down to possession and who made stops at the end of the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Terry, your thoughts on a tight game?  
TERRY ROZIER: Like he said, if we would have easily won this game, it could
have got us relaxed for the next game, and then it would have been a tough
one. We would have dug ourselves a deep hole. We've got a lot of teams that's
going down early because they're not preparing themselves well. I think that's
what we need and I think that would be probably our toughest game in the
tournament, so we just want to keep preparing like we always prepare and just
play Louisville basketball.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, you've waited a long time to be a part of the NCAA
Tournament. What's it like to be here and be on the podium after all the time
you've put in?  
TERRY ROZIER: A lot of people know my history. I was supposed to be here last
year, so I'm just honored to be part of a team like this. We've got nice
seniors that have been leaders since I first came in, NCAA Tournament they
said would be nothing like this and a great experience. Hopefully we can keep
winning games and go far, very far.  
  
Q. I want to ask you if you were able to watch the end of the Saint Louis
‑NC State game and what that shows you about staying in games until the end.
  
CHRIS JONES: That shows us we're going to have a battle the whole game, no
matter how many points you're down, the team is going to play until the buzzer
goes off. NC State didn't make their free throws down at the end of the game,
but it just showed us Saint Louis never go away. So it don't matter if we're
up 20, 22 points, this team is going to fight until the end of the buzzer.
We've just got to close out the game tomorrow.  
TERRY ROZIER: We got to watch the end of the game of that. Nobody wants to go
home early. Nobody wants to go home at all, from seniors all the way down to
freshmen. No matter how many points you're down or up, everybody is going to
fight until the end of the game. I think anybody could have did that, anybody
would have fought, no matter if you're down by 14. Any team would have did
that.  
  
Q. What time did y'all get to bed last night?  
CHRIS JONES: We left here at 2:00. Us young guys, you get to your room, you're
very tired, but once you get into your bed and take a shower, you really can't
go straight to sleep. I really didn't go to sleep until 4:00 but coach let us
sleep in because he knows the benefits of the NCAA Tournament. He let us sleep
in, and we needed that too much because I think during the game someone is
going to get sleepy on the bench. I'm happy coach let us sleep in. I think
that will help us in the long run.  
  
Q. Coach, it's hard to believe that you've never coached head to head
against Jim Crews in all your years. Your impressions of Coach Crews and the
job he does at Saint Louis?  
RICK PITINO: Well, I think it's quite confident. Anytime you watch him, it's
like watching one of Larry Brown's teams this year. You weren't quite sure
whether his team executed better on offense or defense, and that's indicative
of Saint Louis and Jim's teams. They execute at both ends of the floor in a
terrific fashion. Obviously they've got seniors, and seniors execute very
well, and they're very impressive.  
  
Q. Much has been made about Billy Donovan being here and almost coaching in
Orlando. When he was about to make that NBA jump, did he consult you at all
for advice?  
RICK PITINO: Yeah, we talked. My opinion at the time to him was to stay put.
He was ready to make a move, and it was an interesting story about him when he
did left, then right back. I think Billy made the right move for the right
reasons. That doesn't mean that down the road some day he may change his mind,
but at that time he made the move for the right reasons, and you've always got
to go with your heart.  
  
Q. How important was it for you guys to win a game when you were down late,
to have guys have to make shots down the stretch, as much as you've been
blowing out people this season?  
RICK PITINO: I thought it was really, really important because I knew we
weren't going to blowout Manhattan. I knew that game, regardless of what you
thought, I knew the way that game was going to be played. I knew it would be a
tight, hard‑fought ballgame. What was impressive to me is that Russ, Montrezl
were having nightmarish games, and down the stretch with the game on the line,
they both made great plays. And that tells you something about their
abilities. Russ made a great three to tie it up, made a great pass, another
great pass to Montrezl inside, free throws, and to block out the fact that
you're having a bad game and to just make all the right plays speaks volumes
of two veteran basketball players who have been through it. So I thought it
was crucial for us to move on because this is not last year's team. Last
year's team, although we were in a tight, hard‑fought game with Davidson, as
well, this is a totally different type of team that needed a close,
hard‑fought game.  
  
Q. Obviously a lot of emotions involved in last night's game, given the
particulars. How difficult is it for you guys to bounce back, not only for an
NCAA Tournament game, but then to bounce back from what was such an emotional
game?  
RICK PITINO: Well, I think that's the easy part. We've been to two straight
Final Fours, and we played four games in the Big East Tournament championship
the year prior to this, last year and now this year with the AAC. So we bounce
back quickly. We got in very, very late last night. Judging from what somebody
told me with Steve Fisher, it could have been worse. It could have been New
Mexico State having to fly back. You heard about that, right? It was his idea
to do that, so it was‑‑ no, it's not difficult. You're on adrenaline right
now. The coaches, we've had literally two‑and‑a‑half to three hours' sleep. We
watched film and got up early and watched more film, but we're on such
adrenaline, we don't need 5‑Hour Energy to stay up.  
  
Q. So much has been focused on your relationship with Russ and throughout
his career and all. How tough, though, is Russ Smith as a basketball player,
for a guy of his stature who gets bumped on every screen, his thumb was
bothering him, his knee, and he's not that big of a guy and takes a lot of
hits and still keeps ongoing.  
RICK PITINO: How tough is it for him or for me?  
  
Q. Just how tough is he?  
RICK PITINO: How tough is he? I was disappointed in him last night, no
question about it, the way he was playing. But he showed me more last night in
the way he responded in the waning minutes of the game than at any time in his
career because nothing was going right, I was upset at him, and he just
totally blocked his game out, the way he was playing, made all the right
plays.  
What Russ has to understand, and it's what makes him great but it also makes
him have some bad nights, and he found out in the last few minutes, Russ is
most dangerous as a passer than he is a scorer, even though he's a great
scorer because everybody keys so much on him. They know they've got to stop
him, and he's going to draw two or three people, so what does that mean?
People are going to be open. And that's where he's at his best, when he finds
people when he draws double teams.  
  
Q. In the Big East it seemed like every team you would play in the
tournament you could draw a frame of reference to somebody you saw during the
season. I don't know if you can do that this year, but who is Saint Louis like
at all? Are you able to explain to players it's similar to this?  
RICK PITINO: I don't know. Saint Louis would be like a tall version of
Marquette, extremely well coached, tough kids. It's not often that you get a
great team that has five seniors starting, and when you look at Mercer right
now, I think, what did they have, seven seniors in their lineup; is that
correct? You know, that didn't surprise me. I mean, Warren Buffett probably
saved a lot of money with that game.  
You know, it's very difficult coaching young players. It's very easy coaching
older players. It was very easy coaching my team last year, and it's a lot
more difficult coaching this team than it was last year, even though we do
have some veterans. But when you've got five and seven seniors, they know what
to do in situations. You don't have to call timeouts. They know what to do.
They know how to play the situation. They've been there before. Fundamentally
they're as sound as can be.  
  
Q. It's very rare to see two coaches of you guys' experience of you and Jim
cruise who haven't really coached against each other. Having watched Saint
Louis on tape what do you take from what he's been able to do there?  
RICK PITINO: Well, Jim coached at Evansville, right, before this? So the
likelihood of us playing was not great, so that's not a big surprise. I think
what you're alluding to is the fact that we're both old.  
You know, I said it last year because I've already seen six games of his, last
year I was just blown away with how good a coach Gregg Marshall was when I
watched tape. I was blown away with how good Dana Altman was at Oregon, had
never coached against him. Blown away with the coach at Colorado State, Larry
Eustachy who was at Southern Miss before that. The more you go against guys
you haven't seen before, you realize what a big country this is with great
coaches.  
Jim Crews is as good as it gets when you watch his team playing on film.
Defensively they don't let you run your things, which is what you try to do as
a defensive team. Offensively they get high‑percentage shots with great duck
ins, pick‑and‑rolls, slips, they step their big men out to shoot it, and
one‑day preparation, Jim Crews‑type teams are nightmarish to go against. We
have a little advantage in this game, because he'll try to break down Russ
Smith and he won't have a clue how to play him.  
  
Q. Billy said today there's still some aspects of the NBA coaching that are
alluring to him. I'm just wondering, he's been a college coach for almost 20
years now. When you've been a college coach for that long, what are the ‑‑
what is the pull of the NBA, and do you think he'll ever coach in the NBA?   
RICK PITINO: Billy? Do I think Billy will ever coach in the NBA? He's like a
son to me, but I couldn't answer that question. The last time around his dad‑‑
what shocked me the most, his dad and his wife were all for him going to the
Magic, which was shocking to me. I was the only one against it, I think, in
his inner circle.  
You know, it's always been not a dream of Billy's but a dream of mine to see a
court named Billy Donovan Court. I thought it would happen a while ago, to see
his name on the court. I still very much want to see that some day because of
what he's meant to Gator basketball.  
That being said, if he wants to try it someday, that would be great. He'll do
a‑‑ just like Brad Stevens, Brad Stevens will be a great Celtic coach, but
he'll be a great pro coach. Billy if he wanted to do that will be a terrific
pro coach because he's always thinking of plays, defenses, and he'd be great
at it. Me personally, you know, I just want what's best for him and his
family. Florida is very lucky to have somebody like that for a long period of
time. How many years has it been?  
  
Q. 18.  
RICK PITINO: That's amazing. I really feel like I just left him in Providence
like seven, eight years ago. It's amazing.  
  
Q. He grew up a Knicks fan. Do you think the Knicks job would be alluring?  
RICK PITINO: He would never coach the Knicks. I know him. He grew up in New
York but he's not a New Yorker.  
  
Q. You mentioned that Harrell is one of the most improved players you've had
in the year, a year's growth. What are some of the specifics where he has
improved?  
RICK PITINO: Well, as I said, like Gorgui Dieng, he came in a great athlete, a
great runner and dunker with very few skills and fundamentals, wasn't a very
good passer, wasn't a very good ball handler, didn't shoot the ball real well,
and he's really improved in all those areas. He's a very good passer. He's a
very smart basketball player, picks up scouting reports quickly, makes good
plays. He didn't have a good game last night, but like Russ, made big plays in
the final minutes of the game.  
You know, like I tell him, he was getting beaten up in the low post by
Manhattan's players and when I tell him, son, if you have pro aspirations, you
better be able to guard those Manhattan Jaspers, and he got the message late
in the game.  
  
Q. You talked about many times if Luke is open he's going to keep shooting
no matter what. He gets the big steal, hits the big shot last night. Is there
something about the big moment or the big game that his personality, he
embraces it or he's well suited for?  
RICK PITINO: Well, I actually had to jump Luke in the last time‑out, hard. I
said, Luke, if you have an open shot, stop ball faking and shoot the damn
ball. I don't want to see you open one time without you shooting because he
passed up about five shots. We're struggling with guys shooting it that
shouldn't shoot it, and our best guy is not taking the open shot. The steal
was a big‑time play, the shot was a big‑time play. But when we pass the
basketball, pass it, we are a terrific team.  
The last two games we've been just a good team because we only had 10 assists.
Prior to that, we were getting 19, 20, 21 assists and we looked like a great
basketball team. And when you get all those assists you shoot a higher
percentage, you get your press on more and your style of play takes place.  
  
Q. I'm sure you saw last night that Saint Louis was face ‑guarding T.J.
Warren pretty much the whole game with a bunch of different guys. Do you
anticipate that at all with Russ, and what other things have teams tried to do
to Russ to try to slow him down, and has any of it ever worked?   
RICK PITINO: You know, I would imagine they'll try everything to stop Russ,
but like I just said earlier, Russ makes us a better team when he passes more.
You know, we've got a lot of playmakers‑‑ who would you say the MVP of the
game was last night by your naked eye? If you had to pick one guy for us?  
  
Q. Harrell or Hancock.  
RICK PITINO: Well, Hancock would be I think the obvious answer. I thought it
was Chris Jones by far. Now, he may have been 2 for 11 but he was 6 for 6 from
the line, five rebounds, three assists, no turnovers playing 33 minute of the
game where I thought Van Treese the other night was the MVP. It's what the
whole ‑‑ when you breakdown the tape what the value of a player is to the
team. I thought Russ and Montrezl had very poor games last night but played
like All‑Americans when the game was on the line, but that's what you would
expect, but Chris Jones played a terrific game. So we have a lot of guys who
make plays and taking away Russ, I don't think hurts us too much, because
you've got Chris, you've got Luke, you've got Montrezl, you've got guys that
can make plays.  
  
Q. Two things: First of all, you talk about Luke, getting him to shoot the
ball and not the ball fake. I remember at UCF this year you were yelling at
him the same thing. He's a shooter, but does that surprise you?  
RICK PITINO: Believe it or not, he drives very well, he passes very well, he
likes to ball fake. But against Manhattan, they leave the middle open, they
close out hard on the middle, and then if you don't take the quick shot they
close out well. So you've got to take what's given to you by certain teams.
And last night it was necessary for him to do it whether he‑‑ what happens
with Luke, he misses a few and says, let me go to something else, and he
couldn't do that in last night's game.  
  
Q. Obviously Mercer pulled it out today. Talk about being on the other end
of that upset.  
RICK PITINO: Well, nobody handles it as well as Coach K does. There's nobody
who has more dignity and class in the game than him. He handles it the best of
any of us.  
That being said, it's torture. It gnaws at you. I remember last year, two
years ago, and I always tell this story. It made me write that book One Day
Contract. We have great media in Louisville and I don't read them or watch
them but they're great people and I love being with them all the time. I don't
read them or watch them for a different reason.  
But three years ago we lost to Morehead State, and Moorehead State played
great and we had a terrific season. Our best player broke his ankle. We were
up four with eight to go. Bad break, we lose the game. So my son, who listens
to‑‑ my oldest son listens to the fellowship of the miserable, and he said to
me one day at lunch, boy, dad, they're all over you. They say you've lost your
touch and you're too old. I said, too old? We had a terrific season. He said,
yeah, but you lost in the first round. I said, the kid broke his ankle. He
goes, dad, they don't understand that. This is call‑in shows. So I said, why
are you listening to that? Why would a son of mine ever do that, and why would
you tell me? That's why I started writing the book One Day Contract. It's the
way I'm going to coach from this point on because of our media today and our
social media today.  
With that in mind you have to understand that that's the way it is today.  
You know, you can lose today‑‑ you've got a veteran team like Mercer or Saint
Louis or Manhattan, that's why I knew the game was going to be so tough.
They're a senior team, they've been together, it was their moment finally. I
think if they would have been faced against another team who didn't know them
as well as we knew them vice versa, they would have gone to a Sweet 16, and so
that's why I was a little disappointed for one of my players.  
But today you get these Mercers and the Manhattan Colleges and the Ionas who
have all those seniors, they can beat you on a given night. Duke is a very
young basketball team, so it wasn't a surprised. But that's the way it is.
That's what makes March Madness the greatest month in sports. It's even much
better‑‑ people want to believe back in the old days at UCLA and when North
Carolina all had their seniors, yes, it was great to see those guys like
Patrick Ewing get better each year, but it's even better today because
nobody‑‑ they can have as many guys in ESPN jackets that they want, they can't
pick it. And they can be as bright as Vitale and Bilas and all‑‑ they can't
pick it, because it's just impossible. The teams are so good, so balanced, and
it's so much fun to see. It really is so much fun to see. I could easily see
Mercer going to a Final Four this year the way they executed today, and
that's‑‑ my assistant coach Marvin Menzies took it into overtime. My other
assistant, Herb Sendek played in overtime last night. It's just so much fun,
not for my assistants to lose, but to watch those guys and what they're doing
with their programs. March Madness is just absolutely incredible.  
  
Q. Last year during the NCAA Tournament you also had a horse on the derby
trail. Do you have one on the derby trail this year, and if not, how much will
you miss it?  
RICK PITINO: Oh, I won't miss it because I'll be there.  
  
Q. Having a horse on the trail.  
RICK PITINO: I've been very lucky in that business. I've had three derby
horses and three Breeders Cup horses and I'm only down a million dollars
(laughter). It's a fun sport to be involved in.  
You know, I root for it. I have friends that will have horses and I root for
it. No, I don't have one right now. I've scaled way back in the horse industry
right now. I'm just watching my friends that own horses. But I do have
Megatrez, a two‑year‑old with Nick Zito, going to be a very good horse. I have
Lieutenant Dale coming up, too, a great two‑year‑old horse with Nick Zito.  
  
Q. Kind of talking on the March Madness, Russ just told us that his bracket
is a total mess and I'm curious if you helped him make his picks this year?  
RICK PITINO: I try to spend as little time with that maniac as possible. I
would lose my mind if I spent‑‑ I spend enough time with him, with his texts
late at night, his videos late at night, what he watches. On my 60th birthday,
I get a thing at 1:00 in the morning, he knows that I drink Grey Goose‑‑ I
used to. Actually I don't drink anymore, and he texts me a huge bottle,
thinking of you on your birthday. I'm not going to ever even try something
like this, but I'm thinking of you. Then I get videos of Samurais being
stabbed 100 times, and it's 1:30 in the morning. I don't know why I leave my
phone on. Because you have children and you leave it on. This is what I get
from this. I spend as little time with him as I possibly can so I can keep my
sanity.

_ORLANDO, FLORIDA_  
  
Q. Michael, yesterday did you think it was Albany that took you out of the
game, or did you think you kind of took you out of the game, and what makes
you think tomorrow will be different for you?  
MICHAEL FRAZIER II: Well, I know their strategy was to try and take me and
Scottie out of the game, so we saw a little bit of triangle‑and‑two, and they
were kind of determined not to let us beat them, so it opened up things for
other guys.  
  
Q. (No microphone)?  
MICHAEL FRAZIER II: Yeah, I mean, their defense is different, so they're
probably going to throw something a little different at us defensively, so
we'll have some open looks in other areas.  
  
Q. Patric, a little while ago Talib Zanna said, in praising you, said you
were a dirty player, then he kind of qualified that later on and said he meant
that in a good way, like himself. I wonder what you think about that. And
overall what kind of physicality or what kind of game do you think it's going
to be tomorrow down low?  
PATRIC YOUNG: I think he meant probably that we're both similar type of
players, willing to do whatever it takes, the hustle plays, going in there for
offensive rebounds, fighting. I don't think he meant anything out of context
as far as unsportsmanlike, taking cheap shots. No one has ever said anything
like that about me. I've never purposely or intentionally done anything like
that on the court. I just know tomorrow because we're both very similar
players, it's going to be a battle. We're going to go out there and just try
and wear their frontcourt out because they have a lot of depth, a lot of good
talented guys, especially him. I saw that he had a 19 and 21 game against
Carolina or 21, 19, so I know it's going to be a battle up front. I'm just
excited for the opportunity to go against someone like that.  
  
Q. Just a follow ‑up for any of the players, what makes them‑‑ I don't know
how much you've studied them on film, but they've been a pretty good
grind‑it‑out defensive team. What makes them tough or challenging defensively,
and how much do you expect this to be that kind of a game?   
SCOTTIE WILBEKIN: I think they do a great job of rotating and helping each
other out on defense. They do a couple of different schemes of trapping the
low post and different guys rotating up and having everybody else scramble, so
it's a little bit different look than most teams. I think like us, they do a
good job of priding themselves on defense and they really work hard on that
end. There will be a lot of defense played tomorrow.  
  
Q. Scottie, yesterday seemed to be an aberration for you guys, the way you
played, and the way you didn't come out with a lot of energy. What do you have
to do to make sure that doesn't happen again?  
SCOTTIE WILBEKIN: Just make sure we're ready to go, put this last game behind
us, and start worrying about Pitt and just how we need to play against them. I
don't think there's any‑‑ we just have to be ready to play. That's the only
way we can avoid something like that. I think we'll be ready, though. I think
we've got this game out of our system, and we're ready to move forward and
ready to play like we know we can.  
  
Q. They just mentioned that there was a TV back in the holding area.
Obviously it looks like you guys were watching the Duke ‑Mercer game. How much
of a reminder is it about how easy it is to get overthrown in tournaments like
this by teams with much lower rankings, and how do you move forward with that?
  
PATRIC YOUNG: Well, I think in this tournament you have to be aware that every
team is fighting for their life, and the goal is just to survive. Seeding
doesn't matter when it comes down to between the lines. As you see, a 14 can
beat a 3. Fortunately a 16 has never beat a 1 and we were able to keep that
going. But moving forward we have to realize our next opponent is Pitt. We
have to make sure we do whatever it takes just to survive and every team is
going to be trying to keep that same mindset of just moving on to the next
round. Hopefully we can keep it going, as well.  
MICHAEL FRAZIER II: Yeah, what Patric said. At this point it's not about any
other team, it's just about us and how we play to our standard, and you know
just going into every game focused and prepared to stay in the moment and
focused on the task at hand.  
  
Q. Scottie, how has Patric developed in his years at Florida, and what kind
of guy is he?  
SCOTTIE WILBEKIN: He's a great guy, fun to be around. As far as his
development, I think he's done a better job each year at getting better at his
low‑post scoring, and he's always been a good defender, but he just‑‑ this
year I think he's really done a good job of maybe improving his stamina so he
can stay in the game for longer and play that top level of defense for longer
periods of time and just his hustle plays this year have been more than any
other year, so that's about it.  
  
Q. Scottie, Michael, I was wondering, how much of your offense is generated
by the pressure you have on defense, and how much faith do you guys have in
your pressure that eventually it's going to wear the other team down and
you're going to start getting turnovers and all that stuff?  
SCOTTIE WILBEKIN: I think we try to let our defense create some offense for
us, but if the other team does a good job of taking care of the ball, then
there's not too much of that. But we try to‑‑ our motto is to try to wear
teams down with the press and try to eventually grind them down with our depth
and just the pressure that we put on them.  
PATRIC YOUNG: Yeah, I ditto what Scottie said. We want to try to wear teams
out, and if they're doing a good job of holding the ball, taking care of the
ball, we're just going to try and set our own tempo, just run the ball
up‑and‑down the floor, making them have to handle the full court without
fouling, and I think we do a pretty good job of that, just trying to stay
focused on that when we're locked in and focused.  
  
Q. Patric, when Michael is in rhythm and when he hits three or four in a
row, can you talk about the energy that gives your team and what it's like
when he's hitting from all over the court?  
PATRIC YOUNG: When he's open, it opens up a lot of us, as well, because now
those guys have to really account for him. But when we can find him knocking
them down with confidence, balls going down, we feel as though it gives us
energy for all facets of the court, offensive side, defensive side, because we
know that they are going to have to make extra rotations trying to look out
for this guy, so it opens up so many other opportunities, driving lanes,
close‑out situations, offensive rebounding for us because they get two guys
running at Michael Frazier on the three, he misses and we have numbers on the
offensive rebounding standpoint. It just really helps us a lot when he is able
to get fired up.  
  
Q. For all three of you guys, Pitt only had three turnovers yesterday
against Colorado. What can you guys see in them that you can maybe force some
more and try and make them make mistakes?  
MICHAEL FRAZIER II: Well, they're a really good offensive team as far as
passing the ball, getting in the lane, playing off of two feet, so we're just
going to have to stay solid on the defensive end and not try and gamble for
any steals and things like that, just try and wear them down and just stay in
the moment each and every possession and try not to get out of ourselves
defensively and just stay to the grind the whole game.  
SCOTTIE WILBEKIN: Yeah, like Mike said, they're a great passing team, and
there's nothing specific that we've talked about that we can do to
specifically force turnovers, but we'll play our style and try to run and gun
in the press and just see what happens.  
PATRIC YOUNG: Yeah, they have one of the best assist‑to‑turnover ratios in the
country. We're just going to have to do a good job of deflecting balls and
disrupting their flow, style of play, same type of deal we've always been
trying to do, just to be disruptive and junkyard dogs out there on the
defensive side.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about your defensive game. Do you think you've grown
into it, and has it evolved since you arrived in Gainesville?  
MICHAEL FRAZIER II: Definitely. But I think it's just a result of me staying
in the moment every day in practice and just understanding what I had to get
better when I came in and watching a lot of film, listening to the coaches and
my teammates, older guys, just helping me and continuing to learn and grow
every day. And I think I've come a long way, but I still have a long way to
go.  
  
Q. How would you describe how Coach was in practice today coming off the
effort yesterday? It seemed like he was obviously a little upset in the
postgame interview. Did that carry over into today or was there a sense of
urgency?  
SCOTTIE WILBEKIN: We haven't practiced yet. I'm sure he's going to be on us.  
  
Q. How quickly were you able to compartmentalize last night and then clear
your minds and focus on Pitt?  
PATRIC YOUNG: Well, you have to. You can't linger on in this tournament, let
the last game affect you, especially if you get another opportunity to play 40
minutes again. We just learned from the past, regrouped as a team, and going
to go out and practice, make sure we know scouting pretty well and move
forward and make sure that we're ready to go, make sure we have a lot of
energy and passion into the next game and not let the last one affect us.  
  
Q. Billy, so much of this season has been about your seniors and their
contributions. Could you talk about Mike Frazier as kind of the X factor for
your team, how far he's come in a year for you?  
BILLY DONOVAN: You know, coming into the year I was a little bit concerned
about him, nothing more from the fact that we had two really, really big‑time
scorers in Rosario and Boynton and Eric Murphy, and Michael kind of came off
the bench as a guy probably on a lot of people's scouting report not highly
thought of, and he had a lot of wide‑open looks, shot a very, very high
percentage for us from three. Now you lose both those backcourt players and
he's got to move into a starting role. He's had a great year, and I think he
has benefitted from our seniors. I think Patric and Scottie, Prather, Yeguete,
they've all helped him, so he's kind of the one underclassman in our starting
lineup and the other four guys are seniors, and I think that's helped Michael
in his growth and development taking the next step from where he was a year
ago.  
  
Q. Kasey Hill had a really good game, his first NCAA Tournament game ever,
he's got the toe injury. How has his foot responded from playing yesterday?  
BILLY DONOVAN: He seems to be fine. Yesterday at shoot‑around we were going to
probably try to gauge where he was at health‑wise. He was moving pretty well
and said he could play, and there was no restrictions on me from the bench in
terms of limiting his minutes. So we just put him out there. I thought he gave
us some really, really good minutes and really helped us a great deal.  
  
Q. How about his foot today?  
BILLY DONOVAN: He seems fine. We have practice after this, and he's cleared to
practice and will practice today.  
  
Q. Obviously anybody who's watched this team all year knows that yesterday
was a bit of an aberration energy ‑wise. What do you do to energize this team,
either today in practice or before tomorrow?   
BILLY DONOVAN: You know, I think one of the things, these guys have gotten a
lot, a lot of attention, and I think rightfully so what they've done. They've
accomplished a lot of different things, and I think sometimes as a coach I
feel like it's my responsibility in a lot of ways to keep them somewhat
grounded and to be truthful and honest in areas of improvement and growth and
development that we need to make as a team.  
I think coming into the game, they did not‑‑ they wanted to play very, very
well in the game, there's no question about that. They've been that all year
long. But I think what was open in the game for us was a little bit maybe
unconventional of what's been open for us in other games. We prepared for
triangle‑and‑two and box‑and‑one and obviously they tried to take some risks,
some chances in terms of leaving some guys open, and it really helped Hill and
Dorian Finney‑Smith have really good games. We shot 51 percent from the field.
That's about six percentage points up from where we were at. But it was a
little bit of uncharacteristic, uncommon game for our team in terms of the way
the game went, but I still felt like our guys battled and fought.  
I think the greatest sign of respect for me as a coach is when somebody says
to a player, we're going to take that player out of the game, and it was a
game where because of the way they guarded Frazier, because of the way they
guarded Wilbekin, there were a lot of other things open, especially inside and
around the basket that I thought we took advantage of.  
Again, I think there was a quick turnaround for Albany. Certainly they had the
much more difficult challenge with their travel to come back and play, but we
really only had a day, too, to prepare for them, so we're trying to condense a
lot in a short period of time against a team that we're trying to get them
familiar with.  
So hopefully, again, we've got an opportunity, and I think our guys are
excited for it, and I think they're looking forward to playing tomorrow.  
  
Q. Since stepping foot in this building, has it crept into your mind that
you potentially would have been the head coach of the Magic in this building,
and if not has it ever crept in your mind what if since 2007 if you were still
in the NBA?  
BILLY DONOVAN: I guess being in this building they love to keep bringing that
up here. I got that the other day, too. Was it your colleague that asked it?
No? For me it seems like a long time ago. Great organization, it's a great
place. You know, but for me, like I said, it was just something internally I
felt like this was where I needed to be. Who knows where I'd be right now. I
don't know. Maybe TV, maybe sitting on a beach somewhere. I don't know. I'm
excited that I'm still at Florida and still having a chance to coach, and I'm
happy that making that decision there's been a lot of things that I've had a
chance to experience in my personal life, my professional life that I really
wouldn't trade anything for.  
  
Q. Pitt is a low ‑turnover team. Is their philosophy impressing that if
they're not getting turnovers it's not impressive or are there other things
you're trying to do with your press?  
BILLY DONOVAN: No, I think Pittsburgh is an outstanding passing team. They
really do a great job. We've played other teams this year that have been very,
very good passing teams. I thought Albany did a very, very good job against
our press in terms of clearing half court and getting into offense. But
there's a lot of things. It's disruptive, it's something you have to deal with
every single possession. I think there's other things you can get out of the
press. It's our style of play. It's kind of what we do.  
There are times we change and we don't trap as much, we play full‑court
man‑to‑man, and sometimes we pick up, we'll play one‑three‑one zone, we'll
play 2‑3 zone, we'll do a lot of things defensively. Pressing for us is a part
of it.  
But ideally, yeah, you'd want to turn teams over a lot. But if you don't, I
still think for us we're getting nine players in the game. We're able to deal
and manage with some foul difficulties, and then a lot of times teams are
playing with a shorter shot clock. By the time they get it across and regroup.  
I think Pittsburgh, they do a terrific job attacking the press. They're going
to try to attack the score. They're very good at that. So our rotations and
what we do in our press will be important because they really do a terrific
job in the middle of the floor passing and making decisions and attacking the
basket.  
  
Q. Can you talk about their frontcourt and do you expect a physical game up
front?  
BILLY DONOVAN: I definitely think it's going to be a physical game. Zanna,
I've got a lot of respect for him. He's a high‑motor, high‑energy guy, great,
great rebounder, great runner, a great defender in pick‑and‑roll. He's a great
help defender. They've gotten a lot of productivity out of their front court.  
I would imagine it will be a physical game. You know, it's interesting because
both teams trap the low post. They do a really good job trapping the low post.
We try to do the same thing. So how effective each team's frontcourt is
scoring is going to be interesting because of the way both teams play post
defense in the frontcourt.  
  
Q. You've been at Florida almost 20 years now, but you're only 48. Do you
consider yourself a lifer at Florida or do you think the allure of the NBA
might come again?  
BILLY DONOVAN: I've always said this: To me the NBA part of it for me is‑‑
it's all basketball. I got into coaching because of the basketball piece of
it, and there is an intrigue as it relates to that. One of the things that I
think I've learned, when you try to project where your future is, where you're
going to be, and you don't know because I don't have a crystal ball, all I can
say is I am happy here at Florida. I love being here.  
The NBA part of it, the intrigue part of it for me is just the fact that it's
basketball 24 hours a day. That's all you're dealing with is basketball.
That's all you do is basketball.  
For me the college part of it is whenever the season comes to an end for us, I
really don't see these guys again in terms of basketball stuff until August,
September, and that's hard sometimes. Now, the NCAA has changed some rules and
we can do some different things with our guys, but there's a lot more that
goes into a college coaching job other than the coaching part of it. There's a
lot of other things that you have to do.  
My offseasons actually are probably a lot more busier than my in‑seasons, and
I think most college coaches would say that. But when you say a lifer, that
means to me I'm never, every going to go anywhere and be there. Who knows?
They may get sick of me at Florida and want me to move on. But I don't like
coming out making bold predictions or statements. I would say right now I'm
extremely happy with my life right now at the University of Florida.  
  
Q. Are you still a Knicks fan?  
BILLY DONOVAN: Yes, I love the Knicks. I grew up buying $5 tickets in Madison
Square Garden and sneaking my way down as close as I could to the court.  
  
Q. A lot has been made about Pitt's frontcourt. They've got some solid
backcourt players, James Robinson. Could you talk about him from a defensive
standpoint and what he brings?  
BILLY DONOVAN: I had a chance to coach James the last two years with the USA
team. He is a winner. He is a guy that makes big plays, big shots. He comes up
with loose basketballs, steals. He's got a great IQ for the game, a really,
really solid point guard and a great kid. I really enjoyed being around him
for the two summers I was with him.  
They're a very, very good team. I think one of the things I always look at,
when you look at their OER, DER, they're one of the top teams in the country
on both ends of the floor, and certainly their front court is outstanding, but
I think with Wright, Patterson, Robinson on the perimeter, they've got a full
and complete team.  
  
Q. I don't believe you've ever coached against Jamie Dixon, but you talk
about your relationship with him, how well you know him ‑‑  
BILLY DONOVAN: We've never coached against each other, our teams have never
played against each other. I've known Jamie for a long time. We have a clinic
every summer on our campus. Jamie has been there several times to speak. It's
been great having him there and being a part of it.  
Also got obviously a chance to know him through the USA Basketball. He was out
there a couple summers helping pick the team. James Robinson, coaching him,
there was some connection there.  
Got a lot of respect for Jamie as a coach and more respect for him as a man
just based on the relationship that we've been able to develop over the years.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of talk forever that Florida ‑‑ people just look at
Florida like it's a football school. Is that frustrating to you as a coach and
how does your team feel when people keep saying that?   
BILLY DONOVAN: I'll kind of go on a dissertation on this. In the South, okay,
football is the passion. It's never changing. It's just the way it is. Okay,
and I've done nothing since I've been at Florida but try to embrace that
because I really believe in the fall there's not a greater place to be than on
our campus when there's a football game going on.  
That being said, I do think that there is an incredible affinity in the state
and nationally for the University of Florida, and I always look at, right now,
one, the support administratively, the support by fans, what our building is
like, what the commitment has been, and I think our commitment and our support
has been as good as anywhere in the country, and I think there's a lot of
people that are involved with that.  
The whole football piece of it for me, that's just the way it is, and I
remember coming in here to Florida where maybe a lot of coaches in the state
of Florida got wrapped up in that, talked about it, complained about it. I've
never really gotten into that. I have no control over that. All's I know is
that when we line up and play in our arena, we've had incredible environments,
incredible crowds, and it's been an incredible place to play.  
  
Q. You had a chance to coach James Robinson a little bit. Your impressions
of him and what kind of player he is?  
BILLY DONOVAN: Yeah, I love James. Great kid, great player, winner, total team
guy, unselfish, comes up with a lot of big plays for their team. Really had a
lot to do with our team the last two summers winning gold medals. He was a big
part of that, and he's obviously doing great for Jamie here at Pitt.  
  
Q. You've had a lot of teams very reliant on the three ‑point shot. Do you
feel like this team finds a lot of other ways to win? And how much momentum
when you guys are hitting threes does that kind of give you?   
BILLY DONOVAN: Yeah, you know, we were, I think, a team there for a while
where we weren't really taking a lot of threes and then we had some games
coming down the stretch where I think we shot 47 percent from the three‑point
line in the SEC Tournament. I think one of the things that helped our
three‑point shooting was when Dorian kind of went through that stretch there
for a long period of time where he wasn't really making anything, he was 0 for
18. He's gotten into a rhythm making shots for us, which has been good.
Frazier shot it well. We've gotten good shooting from DeVon Walker, Wilbekin.
That's kind of helped us. But I really believe what you've got to do
offensively is you've got to take what the defense gives you, and sometimes
it's been games where we've had a lot of threes to take and other times it's
been putting the ball on the floor, posting up or attacking the rim, getting
out in transition.  
I think you've got to be a team that can look to score in a variety of
different ways, and that's what we've tried to be offensively over the course
of the season.  
  
Q. Reflecting on previous seasons, do you feel like you did have some teams,
though, that maybe really relied on the three almost overly?  
BILLY DONOVAN: Probably had to. You know, probably had to on some teams. When
we had Beal and Eric Murphy and those guys, we weren't really a physical front
court team. I mean, Patric was, but outside of Patric, most of our team was
more perimeter‑oriented team where we'd put four three‑point shooters on the
floor. Sometimes we have one, sometimes two, sometimes three three‑point
shooters. Some of the other teams have been built more around the line. Eric
Murphy, as great as he was, I think he had a hard time sometimes scoring it
around the basket. He struggled with that at times, whereas Patric was the
main post presence over the last several years.  
The team in 2000 could really shoot, but I thought we were physical, too, when
we had Haslem and Harvey across the front line, and then we had Dupay and we
had Kenyan Weaks, we had Mike Miller, we had some really good shooting teams,
and I think the two national championships were good shooting teams, but a lot
of it had to do with Lee Humphrey and Taurean Green. Those were the main guys
for us.  
  
Q. Dorian has gotten some huge rebounds at the end of games. Can you talk
about his ability to get to the ball and how important he'll be against
Pittsburgh?  
BILLY DONOVAN: He's always been a good rebounder. I think the one thing he
gets into the game is his rebounding. He does a good job with that. I think
he's been pretty reliable. He makes an effort. I think part of being a good
rebounder, certainly is the flight of the ball, having a knack for it, and
then you've got to be able to pursue the ball, you have got to be able to
chase the ball, and I think that's something you've got to be able to get up
the floor quickly. Certain guys just have a great knack for it, and I think
Dorian is one of those guys that the gift, the talent he has is to rebound.

_ORLANDO, FLORIDA_  
  
Q. Last night Albany's coach, kind of previewing this game on Saturday, says
it could be the most physical game of the entire tournament. Talk about the
match ‑up with Patric Young.   
TALIB ZANNA: I mean, I'm just going to go out there and just play my game. I'm
not looking up to playing against. I know he's a physical guy, he plays dirty,
so that's how we play, so it's going to be a good battle down there. And it's
going to be fun.  
  
Q. Talib, you were a little vocal yesterday after the game in your opinions
on Colorado's effort yesterday. In watching Florida either just as a fan on TV
or watching film, do you believe this is the type of team that you'll get 40
minutes of effort from them?  
TALIB ZANNA: Yeah, I mean, Florida is a good team. They're No.1 in the
country. The chemistry is really strong. I think we're playing good defense
right now, and the energy and focus is right there, so it's going to be a good
game tomorrow. It's going to be fun.  
  
Q. This question is for all you guys. How do you plan to take on Florida's
pressure defense and handle it, and have you guys seen a team that had that
kind of defense this season?  
LAMAR PATTERSON: We plan on just sticking to our basics, taking care of the
ball, playing solid, and then at the same time attacking them. We're a hard
team to press because we've got so many guys who can handle the ball and make
great decisions. We're just going to use that to our advantage and try to
attack and get easy lay‑ups and stuff.  
CAMERON WRIGHT: Yeah, exactly, just playing the way we normally play, not
rushing anything, taking what the defense gives us. There's a lot of open gaps
when teams press, so it's just a matter of taking the right pass and finishing
the play.  
TALIB ZANNA: Yeah, we're just going to stick to our principles, defensive
principles.  
  
Q. Lamar, could you talk about this season and how you guys started strong,
had a little bit of a slide there and have kind of finished strong? Do you
think you're playing your best basketball right now?  
LAMAR PATTERSON: We're playing good basketball right now. We'll know if we're
playing our best basketball on Saturday. The season we started out strong,
like you said, and every team has ups and downs. That's just how college
basketball is. That's how basketball is in general. But right now is the
perfect time to be making strides toward the best you can possibly be, and I
feel like that's what we're doing as a team right now.  
  
Q. How do you guys maybe embrace a little bit of the underdog role in the
sense that you're the 9 seed coming in here, and it's kind of on Florida's
home turf?  
CAMERON WRIGHT: Well, yeah, that's obvious. We've been the underdog pretty
much the entire year. We don't look too much into that. We don't feed into
being an underdog, but we're definitely excited to play against the No.1 team
in the country.  
  
Q. Talib, you mentioned Patric Young played dirty. Could you expand on
that?  
TALIB ZANNA: I don't mean like a dirty player, I just mean he's physical, get
after it, and he's a hustle player.  
  
Q. Lamar and Talib, could you guys both describe what Pittsburgh basketball
stands for, what style you play when you're most successful and just describe
what it's like when you guys are clicking?  
LAMAR PATTERSON: Our most‑successful basketball is when we're just getting
down and dirty and just playing tough, playing tough basketball, playing smart
basketball, and just our defense and rebounding. Coach emphasized that
throughout the whole entire year. When we're at our best, those two categories
we're dominating. We're holding teams under 40 percent shooting and we're
out‑rebounding teams. That's when we're at our best is when those two are good
numbers.  
TALIB ZANNA: Just out‑rebound teams and out‑play teams and just try to play
our game and just represent our name and represent just the way we play and
the way we was coached.  
  
Q. Cam, when you guys have looked at video, you've had a chance to look at
video of Florida, is there any kind of gosh, wow thing, where you go these
guys just look incredible, there's no way we can compete with them?  
CAMERON WRIGHT: Next question, please?  
  
Q. You guys only had three turnovers against Colorado. What can you do to
kind of repeat that performance and take care of the ball?  
LAMAR PATTERSON: Just be patient, don't rush anything. The game against
Colorado we really didn't rush anything. We took what they gave us. Just have
to repeat the same thing. Obviously Florida is going to apply more pressure
because they pick up most of the game, but that gives us a better opportunity
to get out and go. Once we make that good outlet pass, they're playing
catch‑up sort of. We have to just be strong with the ball and play smart with
it, also.  
CAMERON WRIGHT: Well, yeah, just going off what LP said, just sticking to our
principles and playing Pittsburgh basketball and defending and rebounding,
doing what we do best.  
TALIB ZANNA: It's just going to come down to transition and taking care of the
ball and just less turnovers and rebounds.  
  
Q. Cameron, could you talk about the outside shooting of Michael Frazier
from Florida, just what kind of dimension he gives them when he's shooting and
how you defend a guy like that?  
CAMERON WRIGHT: Well, yeah, he's a really good player. They have shooters on
the perimeter with him, Scottie Wilbekin and a couple other guys off the
bench. But those guys you just want to try to stay attached and definitely
throw screens, try not to get screened. But we're pretty familiar with our
defensive principles, so I'm sure we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Cameron, how have you handled the pressure throughout the course of the
season?  
CAMERON WRIGHT: I mean, we've played against press defense before, so every
team doesn't press, but Florida happens to be a team that does press. I'm sure
breaking down film tonight and later on today we'll be prepared for Saturday.  
  
Q. Jamie, Albany went into the game trying to take Michael Frazier out of
it. What kind of attention will you guys give him and what kind of player do
you think he is?  
JAMIE DIXON: Well, he's a big part of their offense, obviously, because of his
shooting ability. He's their best shooter, best perimeter threat and shoots a
high percentage from three. We know that, and we're well aware of that. You
can't stop everything, but you don't want to allow him to get going, and he
can make a lot of‑‑ if he makes shots, makes a couple of them it can break a
game open. We'll be aware of him. We know every team has a shooter, at least
one, and he's their guy and he's very good at it. We've got to be aware. We'll
have different guys guarding him at different times. I think transition often
times is a place where guys get going and get shots, and that's where we can't
allow him to get. I think we can guard him well in the half court but
penetration, kick outs, we've got to keep those things under control and I
think that will help in limiting his looks.  
  
Q. Three years ago you were a No.1 seed in the region and you lost in the
Round of 32. Is there any inherent pressure that comes with being a 1 seed,
and how do you relish maybe the role of being an underdog this time?  
JAMIE DIXON: Well, I mean, as far as us now, we're in an interesting position.
I think we feel like we're playing really good basketball. We think we're
playing our best. We played well in the ACC Tournament. We didn't win it, but
we thought we were playing better and we played good the other day. I think
all that matters is not so much the seed but how you feel like you're playing
and how you are playing. With that we feel good about ourselves at this point.  
As far as them, they've been high seeds all‑‑ the four seniors have been high
seeds all their careers. They're used to being in these situations, and I
think they're about as well prepared as anybody for that situation.  
  
Q. Could you just speak about your perception of seeds, the competition in
this tournament and the public perception of seeds in this tournament, like a
1 ‑9 game, what it really means and what it means to you guys when you get to
this point in the tournament? Is there a fallacy in thinking, oh, the No.1
seed is heavily favored and maybe that's not so in this tournament?  
JAMIE DIXON: I think it's different with every situation. I think teams get
labeled a seed. As we know you can move up and down and teams are playing
better, other teams are playing not as well. You're seeded based on what you
did often times in November and December, and teams can change as we all know.
Obviously we changed a little bit. We lost a player, but I think we've gotten
better. It's taken us some time to improve and figure out our rotation and
improve our freshmen. The seed has got to be done, but at the same time I
don't think anybody thinks it's a perfect system, a perfect number, and
obviously we've seen upsets, if you can call them that, every day, and we'll
see some today. We know there's some seeds that are pretty obvious, Florida
being one because of the way they've played and how their whole season went.  
You know, at the end of the day we've still got to play the games, and that's
fortunate for us since we're the seed that's the lower seed. Obviously we're
the 9, not the 1.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about this season in terms of ‑‑ you got off to a good
start and you kind of had that lull in the middle. People were even saying we
don't know if they're in the tournament, and then to go and play well here
down the stretch?  
JAMIE DIXON: Yeah, I mean, we lost to good teams. If you look at the teams we
lost to, they were very good teams in close games. We won, we were 7‑2 on the
road in conference play, best record in conference. We lost some home games
that we usually don't lose to good teams in close games, lost obviously a
couple buzzer beaters. We didn't panic, and I think people that really knew us
and watched us play, obviously people talk, and as we get closer to it, I
think that as people want to promote games and talk about games, the bubble
gets bigger and bigger. You're either a 1 seed or you're on the bubble pretty
much is how it works. But that's all about promotion and talking, and that's
what you've got to do.  
But we feel very good about our team and where we're at. Yes, we wish we won a
couple of those close games, but we did some good things, going 7‑2 on the
road in the ACC in our first year in that conference, so I think that spoke
volumes about what we were and what we could do once we got into neutral court
games in the ACC Tournament and the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Jamie, you guys have obviously faced some presses before the season. Is
there anyone that looks familiar that you've faced this year that you can
equate to Florida?  
JAMIE DIXON: Well, I mean, we haven't faced a lot of‑‑ this year we've been
pretty good against it. We're a low‑turnover team, good‑passing team. I think
teams will recognize that. We have the North Carolina game where we were up
big and they pressed at the end. I don't know if it was so much missing free
throws, but I feel like this is somewhat similar to some we may have seen
earlier. Obviously in the past we played against Louisville, their press in
the Big East over the years, and a number of other teams that press. Syracuse
presses at times, Seton Hall presses. I don't know if we saw a lot of it in
the ACC except when we had leads, but this is something that we prepared for
today, and we've prepared for all year long, and maybe haven't seen it as much
in game situations. But I feel like we're well prepared for it.  
  
Q. You mentioned yesterday there were a couple of things that you put in
defensively specifically for your opponent in Colorado. Do you see yourself,
whether it's tomorrow or at any point in the tournament, adjusting
dramatically, or is your defense basically your foundation, the way you play
it consistently?  
JAMIE DIXON: Well, I mean, there's adjustments, and you go with your
strengths. We'd like to be a man‑to‑man team, and foul trouble has caused us
to play some two‑three in some games and I don't think it was effective for
us. But we adjust according to personnel and what we're going to do, bigs and
smalls, and playing to their strengths. Yeah, there's always adjustments.
Hopefully what you do put out there to start with works the entire 40 minutes,
but that's not often the case, so we've got to recognize that, and they're
going to do different things, as well.  
You know, we feel like we're getting better at what we want to be, and it's
been a long time coming, but it's with some young guys, six new guys, four
returning guys. You had to understand that it was going to take some time and
get there. We're getting there. I don't think we're there right yet, but
hopefully it's tomorrow.  
  
Q. Could you speak about ‑‑ if somebody asked you what is Pittsburgh
basketball about, what are your core principles, what's the most important
thing you want your program to be known for, how would you describe that?   
JAMIE DIXON: I would guess unselfish is a word that sticks to us. I think
toughness is something that we kind of embrace. I think initially I thought it
was kind of something that‑‑ I thought teams used it as a‑‑ they would talk
about it before the game to let the officials know that we were tough and
physical, but now 15 years later, I think we embrace it and it's part of our
culture, part of our city, so I think it's a good thing, and now I think we're
proud of it. But unselfish I think is the other word if you really look at it.
Offensively we've been good year after year. People talk about our defense,
but offensive efficiency, we've been amongst the best in the country year
after year, again this year we are. Our defense is actually lower than our
offense.  
So I think assists, we're always high in assists, especially high in
assist‑to‑turnover ratio. I think those two words, if I had to sum it up. I
haven't given it too much thought, but maybe we'll put it on some tee shirts
here.  
  
Q. Albany's coach said the key to this game is going to be how well you guys
handle their pressure. Do you agree with him? Do you think that's an important
part of this game, or are there other keys to this game?  
JAMIE DIXON: Well, you know he's a friend of mine, so I guess I have to agree
with him. But yeah, I think so. There's going to be a lot of big parts. We've
got to out‑rebound them. We've got to take care of the ball against the press.
We've got to guard their perimeter shooting, Frazier, as we mentioned. There's
a lot of parts to it. I would point to the rebounding, but we certainly don't
want to turn it over. We feel like after coming off a three‑turnover game, you
feel like you're pretty good at taking care of the ball. But you can't expect
to have three turnovers every game, one in a half to start. We've got to take
care of the ball. We've also got to hurt them on the back end. If they are
going to press, we want to get baskets at the back end of it and Albany did
that a little bit early.  
  
Q. You talked about being a physical team. How do you feel like you match up
with Florida's physicality, in particular guys like Young, Yeguete, Finney
‑Smith coming off the bench?  
JAMIE DIXON: Well, they're old, they're experienced, they're physical, they've
got big bodies. It's pretty obvious once you look out there and see them,
though Young, I think, was that big when he was a freshman in high school when
I was watching him.  
But they're just a very physical team. They're old. But we're used to playing
against those kind of teams. We'll be ready for it. We've got to be smart.
We've got to play with our feet and move, and our bodies, and again, not get
into foul trouble, but we've been good at that. We're well aware of how good
they are and their size and their seeding and their ranking and all those
things, but we've played‑‑ we just played a No.1 seed the other day in
Virginia, and we feel that we should have won that game. So we're going to go
in confident and ready to play.  
  
Q. What have been some of the keys to your team defensively? You seemed to
have managed to hold teams down throughout the course of the season.  
JAMIE DIXON: I think we've had a good‑‑ we started out with good perimeter
guards. I think our freshmen had to get better defensively as every coach goes
through, so Josh Newkirk getting better allowed us to play him more minutes,
and in recent games we've been allowed to play Lamar, Cameron and James less
minutes, and I think that's helped our defense. I think Jamel and Mike Young
have gotten better, and I think Mike Young's post defense has helped us,
allowed us to move Talib to other spots, as well, guard different people.
Really our improvement has come from those freshmen. Derrick has gotten better
defensively. Again, we have four returning players on a team, and at no point
did we speak about being young and inexperienced. But it took them some time
to get better defensively, and they're getting there, but we've still got‑‑
hopefully we can have our best performance tomorrow defensively.  
  
Q. James talked about the benefit that he got out of playing for two summers
with Billy Donovan in USA Basketball or whatever. Do you think that those
experiences are good to supplement these guys' development? Did you see
tangible evidence that it helped him? And will he be your sort of inside spy
guy or whatever you want to call it in terms of getting scouting stuff on
Donovan and the Gators?  
JAMIE DIXON: Well, I know those games that they played there‑‑ I don't know
how much you can gain out of their 72‑point wins and 90 percent of those games
that they had overseas, especially in the Americas, and then not so much in
the world championship one.  
You know, I think they're a great experience. First and foremost, I don't know
how much you get‑‑ everybody talks about how much improvement you make. I've
been on the trips. I coached the under‑19s, and so I mean, it's a lot of
hotels. It's a lot of sitting around. First and foremost you get to play for
your country. It's a great honor. It's a great privilege. We're always
appreciative when one of our guys get to play in it, so I think it's terrific
in that regard.  
There's a lot of ways you can improve and get better, and being in the gym and
playing every day and getting a lot of shots up. I always concern myself with
guys, when they go on those trips, is how much time they are actually playing
rather than traveling, flying around and sitting in hotels. But it is a great
experience, and that's, first and foremost, you get to play for your country
against other countries, and playing against the best people in the world.  
That's a great thing.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS:
ORLANDO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+ORLANDO)

### [Jim Crews](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25045)

### [Dwayne Evans](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23453)

### [Mike McCall, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25046)

  
_ORLANDO, FLORIDA_  
  
Q. Dwayne, how tough is it to calm back down after yesterday's emotional win
and then get ready for Louisville tomorrow?  
DWAYNE EVANS: Not hard at all. We know we have a huge test in front of us
tomorrow afternoon, and they're a really talented team, so guys did a really
good job of getting focused this morning, and we'll meet again tonight and
we'll be ready.  
  
Q. And the last two years you guys have won the first game in the
tournament, lost the second. What would it mean to get that second win, to get
to the Sweet 16?  
DWAYNE EVANS: It would be big. Last couple years, as you said, this has kind
of been our stopping point, but to advance to the second weekend and keep
playing would be huge.  
  
Q. This is for both of you guys. Take us through the last couple minutes of
that game, the emotions you guys were going through, getting it to overtime,
and then afterwards.  
DWAYNE EVANS: I mean, the locker room was wild after the game, after a
comeback like that. You can't help but just go crazy.  
But like I said, that was for last night, and as of this morning when we all
woke up, it was on to business for Louisville.  
MIKE McCALL JR.: Like Dwayne said, it was a lot of craziness going on in the
locker room. We were very excited about the comeback we had against NC State.
But like Dwayne said, it's a new day, and we've got to prepare for Louisville.  
  
Q. Dwayne, you don't get to answer this because you didn't shoot any free
throws yesterday, but Mike, what was going on? We've seen this a few times
this year where all of a sudden no one can make a free throw. As that went on
what was the feeling yesterday?  
MIKE McCALL JR.: Just keep shooting them. We've been struggling with free
throws all season long. That's been something that's hurt us down the stretch.
But we've been working on it in practice, and hopefully we get better.  
  
Q. Is it just one of those cyclical things do you hope?  
MIKE McCALL JR.: I don't know. I mean, it felt good when I was shooting them,
and the team said the same thing, as well. Like I said, we've been working on
them, and hopefully we get better.  
  
Q. What would it mean for you to get to the Sweet 16, a step further than
you've gotten in the past?  
MIKE McCALL JR.: Like Dwayne said, it would be huge for the program. That's
something we've been aiming for all season long. It's been a goal for us, and
if we get there, it would be big.  
  
Q. What are your early impressions of Louisville? What impresses you about
their program and what they've done this year?  
DWAYNE EVANS: They're an athletic team. They have play makers. They're big at
the rim guys, try to block shots a lot. That's pretty much what I've seen.  
MIKE McCALL JR.: Very athletic team, a team that likes to get into you
defensively, make you turn the ball over. They have very good guard play and
big play, as well.  
  
Q. Louisville is the defending national champion, ranked third in the polls,
won a lot of tournament games. It's almost like you guys can put the underdog
hats on for the first time in a while because in the A ‑10 and late in the
season everybody expects you to win. There's probably not a lot of people that
would expect SLU to prevail in this match‑up. How do you feel about being such
an underdog?   
DWAYNE EVANS: We've been the underdog pretty much my entire time at Saint
Louis, so it's nothing new. But to be the best, you've got to beat the best,
and obviously Louisville won it last year, and I think we have the team to do
it.  
MIKE McCALL JR.: Like Dwayne said, we're kind of used to being the underdog.
Louisville won it last year, and everybody is going to pick them to beat us.
We just have to just come out and play our game, and we'll be fine.  
  
Q. You guys are ranked one of the better defensive teams in the country, as
are they. I wonder what your ‑‑ how you would describe your style of defense
and what about Coach Crews' system makes you good defensively?   
MIKE McCALL JR.: Just getting into the offensive players, trying to make it as
tough as possible for them, taking them out of their offense, and really just
making it hard for them.  
DWAYNE EVANS: Yeah, we try to pressure teams, take them out of their offense
so they end up going into ball screen or isolation action. Really we just like
to take teams out of their comfort zone and get them into making plays they
don't usually make.  
  
Q. Only because Louisville is so good and deep, is the energy level going to
be a problem at all because you had such a draining game last night?  
DWAYNE EVANS: Absolutely not. I think this is the NCAA Tournament, and this is
what we've been thinking about all year. Every game has been leading up to
this one. I think guys are going to come out excited, ready to play, and
fatigue won't play a factor.  
MIKE McCALL JR.: Yeah, the team knows this is a very big game for us, and
we've just got to come out and play our game and be ready.  
  
Q. What problems does Louisville pose? I'm sure it's a long list, but what
do they do really well?  
JIM CREWS: Well, two things tie together: Number one is you've got to be ball
strong. You've got to be able to handle the basketball. The put a lot of
pressure. They come from a lot of different places with you. If you're not
ball strong then the ball is going the other way for two points, so that kills
your defense. If you're not good offensively, it hurts your defense from that
standpoint, and then if you're able to do that, you've obviously got to do a
lot of things in the half‑court defense, but if you don't get the rebound,
you've wasted a lot of maybe good play and good effort. So you've got to get
the first rebound.  
  
Q. How quickly did the emotions of yesterday's win go away and then you
start to focus on playing Louisville?  
JIM CREWS: Well, we were preparing for both teams. We had a lot of respect for
Manhattan, and anyone that saw the game last night, that was‑‑ I told our team
right off the bat, we don't know who's going to win this game. So as a staff
we were preparing for both throughout the week. So the emotions, our guys are
not‑‑ I mean, they're excited, don't get me wrong. But they don't get way up
high and get crazy and when we lose they don't get way down and get depressed.
They kind of have a pretty even keel.  
  
Q. Speaking of even keel, you are that, and you've also in your career as
player and coach, you've been in a lot of big games, a lot of big wins, a
national championship. Did you take any time personally to just try to put
that in perspective, just in your experience of winning a big game in the
fashion you did last night? How special was that?  
JIM CREWS: I really didn't think about that. I know it is special, but I
haven't thought about it because you're just‑‑ these games have a quick
turnaround, really quick turnaround, so you're involved with that, and you've
just got to study it. It's like studying for a chemistry test or a math test
or something like that. There's a lot of information you're trying to digest
and condense it into a very small package for the players so you can get the
job done.  
So I didn't reflect on that, but that was certainly a very unusual game, the
way the kids came back. I mean, we pressed. We never press. So they did that
on the fly, and they did that great. We've done it three or four times, but
we've just never practiced it, which a couple of the guys who represent the
players' union think we shouldn't practice at all because they would do better
with their offense, defense, rebounding if we never practiced, so I think that
is going on right now. But we're excited about the next one.  
  
Q. It's not uncommon for teams to hit kind of a little funk at some point in
the season. Yours came late in the year. What was the nature of that?  
JIM CREWS: Well, we were playing good teams. Our league is off‑the‑chart good,
very, very good, and we weren't playing as well. But sometimes we didn't play
well and we won, and sometimes we played well and you don't win. That's kind
of how it is sometimes.  
And you're right, I think the season is so long, I mean, obviously Wichita
State really hasn't had a slump, but that's very abnormal. And really we have
not really had slumps over the last couple years, but we did at the end of the
season.  
But I think our ball handling wasn't as good as it needed to be, and that led
to points‑‑ how we've gotten beat is what Louisville is good at in terms of‑‑
but we've traditionally been pretty ball strong and get back on defense pretty
well. But those two tie in directly.  
  
Q. Teamwork, SLU has won a tournament game now three years in a row. Getting
that second one has been a mountain to climb. Could you talk about that and
what it would mean to actually get that second win?  
JIM CREWS: Boy, that sounds just like him. Always a black cloud. I don't worry
about it. I mean, all you can do is just‑‑ doesn't mean you play the best,
doesn't mean the coaches make all the right decisions, but all the coaches, we
try to make as good a decisions with all the information we have. The players
are trying to do the best they can. They've put themselves in a chance to win
a second game. They've put themselves in position to win the first game by
getting to the Tournament. It is extremely, extremely hard to get into the
NCAA Tournament.  
We've just got a game that's tomorrow. I think it starts at 2:45, sometime
tomorrow, and we're just going to try to do the best we can.  
That's how we look at it. I mean, college basketball should be fun. It
shouldn't be a burden of life in my opinion, and we take it serious but we're
not going to take ourselves too serious. There's only one team that's really
not disappointed when it all ends. So you want to add that up, this gentleman
here probably has how many national championships‑‑ well, since 1939, so I can
do the math on that pretty quick, so 75, 76 years probably, so there's 76 guys
that aren't disappointed, in the history of the game. So add up all the guys
that are disappointed at the end of the season, there you go. Fortunately I've
been on both sides, not many, but more times on the negative side than the
positive, so that's how I look at it.  
  
Q. I was wondering how many times you've had the chance to compete against
Rick Pitino and your impressions of him and what makes him and their style of
play so good.  
JIM CREWS: Good players. Any coach will tell you that. They've got really,
really good players. Really good players. I don't think we've ever played
against each other. In fact I know we've never played against each other. Not
even when I was an assistant or he was an assistant. I don't think we've ever
played against each other. I don't think we have. But he's got a really good
program, great teams, really good teams, year in, year out.
