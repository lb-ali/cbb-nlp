# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2009

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: Coach Self, welcome. Your opening comments, sir.  
COACH SELF: I know I can probably speak for everybody that we're all very
excited to be here this morning. This early.  
No, it's an exciting time. Of course, everybody's optimistic this time of
year, and rightfully so. I really like our team. I think we have a chance to
be a special group. We'll have to be very special because I think the league
is the best since I've been in it, and I think it's the best it's going to be
since the inception of the league.  
We've had success in the league the last few years, and certainly it will be
much more difficult to maintain that because of the quality of teams in the
league.  
PETER IRWIN: Okay. We'll take questions. When you ask a question, we'll get a
microphone to you.  
COACH SELF: I wonder if Mike Jones will ask the first question.  
PETER IRWIN: He always does, Coach.  
  
Q. Let's get this out of the way, Bill. How did the events of the recent
past affect the image of your program and the chemistry of your team, if at
all?  
COACH SELF: I'm sorry, Mike. Would you elaborate on that. I don't know what
you're talking about.  
You know, for a short term, I do think it probably hit us from an image
standpoint, you know, especially with the fight. But from a long-term
standpoint, I don't think it's going to hurt us from an image standpoint.  
I think it's one of those things that people deal with and move forward. As
long as you don't have major hits after it. You look around the country, and
all programs have had something at some point in time.  
Unfortunately, it was a distraction we had to deal with. Fortunately, it was a
distraction we dealt with before the season started. In my mind, I can say,
that was the off-season; now the season is a fresh start.  
I'm not real happy with our guys for those events that took place. But if we
were that undisciplined and irresponsible that selfish motives could get in
the way of something so insignificant as that at that point in time, then we
weren't obviously disciplined or responsible enough to win big.  
So, if anything, I think we'll be more disciplined. We'll be more responsible.
And if you have that combination along with good players, I think that can
make for some fun.  
I see it as being a positive over time, and certainly it was a negative in the
short term.  
  
Q. Coach, I know practice is just a week old. Can you talk about how your
guys are developing and maybe if anybody has stood out or any -- a couple
guys?  
COACH SELF: Probably the guy that's been the most -- it's not really a
surprise, but the most pleasant surprise, you know, from what I thought the
day we were recruiting was Thomas Robinson. Thomas is a good player, and he'll
impact his team immediately.  
His motor is different than what we've had, so he's definitely raised the
level of -- not the -- the level of effort may be the right word, from the
twins. Thomas has changed practice more than anybody else.  
Xavier is a guy that's going to be really good. He's kind of finding his way
right now. As he gets more comfortable, he's a thinker now instead of a
reactor. As he gets more comfortable, I really think the ceiling is so high
for him. Those two have been the two most pleasant surprises.  
Withey's been nicked up. He's hurt right now. He's going to be out a
significant amount of time with the bum knee. And Elijah Johnson's come along
nicely. It's just going to take some time.  
C.J. Henry has been in and out with injuries, but he's going to be a nice
player too.  
I'd say Thomas has been the most pleasant surprise we've had so far.  
  
Q. Bill, when you look at the First Team Preseason All-Big 12 picks, how
many of those guys do you put on an All-American list, maybe Player of the
Year, National Player of the Year candidate?  
COACH SELF: You know, if I recall correctly, I think there's six. Is that
right? They all deserve to be on the first team. And I think you have six pros
there, not just good college players. I think you have six pros.  
I also think there's a couple others that may emerge to be in the top six
players or seven players in our league that hadn't even been mentioned yet. So
that tells you the depth -- the quality of players.  
You know, I think Brackins is deserving of All-American mention without
question. I think Damion James. I think he's terrific. I think he's very
deserving. I think Willie Warren is as good as any guard in the country,
especially a combination of strength and scoring and all those things.  
And James Anderson, to me, is a guy that could get -- you know, could get 30
any night. Those four have gotten a lot of attention.  
Then there's several newcomers, and you throw in R2, who I think Sherron is
about as good a league guard, if not the best guard in the country. And I
think Cole's the best big man.  
So you could make a case that you could have guys fighting each other in the
league not only for Player of the Year honors but for big-time national honors
also, I agree.  
  
Q. Bill, you think there's any kind of common denominator. There's been an
influx of freshmen that make for the top ten in some lists. Just a bunch of
guys. Any reason in particular why so many teams are getting so many good
players?  
COACH SELF: I think the staffs, the respective staffs all know what they're
doing. The league's a good recruiting league too.  
I also think you talk about our league, and primarily the state of Texas being
the proximity of players, but schools are going outside their area also and
bringing in some really good talent.  
But when Durant plays at UT, and then when Beasley plays at K-State, and
Griffin plays at Oklahoma, how could young kids not be interested in going to
a league which has produced, you know, the premier player in America the last
three years. So that's kind of how I see it.  
All those guys were the best players in the country the last three years. They
may not have won all the awards, but they impacted the game more so than
anybody else. So I think recent success.  
You know, this may sound like we're patting ourselves on the back, but I think
one thing that the Big 12 hadn't had happen prior to '08 was, as great a
league as it was, they haven't been able to crown a champion. Maybe that and
the combination of Durant and Beasley and Griffin and coaches that know what
they're doing. Maybe that's all been a bonus because the league is going to
continue to get good players.  
  
Q. Bill, two years ago you lost some great players. Could you have imagined
rebuilding this quickly?  
COACH SELF: You know, recruiting is a weird deal in that sometimes you don't
get what you deserve, and a lot of times you get what you don't deserve. I
would have had no idea. I had no idea Cole would be what he's become.  
I knew Sherron was a good player, but we went into last season thinking we had
one good player, and Cole emerged to be outstanding, and then our young guys
really developed as the season went on.  
You know, the way we got Tyshawn Taylor was because of a coaching change. We
didn't deserve that. That kind of fell in our lap.  
So we've been fortunate in that regard.  
You know, one thing about our guys, you know, they expect to have success, and
they play at a place every day where there's pressure on them to perform. I
think in a lot of ways that forces the development more rapidly with our young
kids than maybe what it would some other places just because they feel that
every day that they wake up.  
  
Q. Bill, there's been a pretty good coaching turnover the last, I guess,
three or four seasons. Has the style of play in the Big 12 changed much in
your time there?  
COACH SELF: Yeah, it probably has. But I think the league, if anything, it may
be playing a little faster. I think having Mike at Missouri kind of helps
create that image because they do play fast and really pressure.  
And the thing about it is there's been a lot of turnover coaching-wise, and I
think some people probably questioned whether or not the turnover -- we were
losing such experienced guys, that the turnover would be able to measure up to
those guys.  
I think what people have shown already, in that these coaches in our league,
they're getting it done. I mean, the programs, if they haven't been elevated,
they're real close to being on the verge of being elevated in a short amount
of time.  
So I think there's been a lot of smart ADs, to be honest with you, that have
made some hires that were very good and represented their university very
well.  
  
Q. Bill, from what you can tell around college basketball, how unique is
Cole as a true post man?  
COACH SELF: I think you have -- we've had some true post men in college, going
back to Oden, although just one year, that was a true five.  
But the game's getting smaller in that he knows who he is. We have a couple of
true fives in our league that -- you know, Pittman obviously at Texas --
they're true fives. You don't have to pacify them in any way other than this
is what your job is, this is what you do. At this time, all fives want to be
fours, all fours want to be threes, all threes want to be twos, and these guys
want to be fives.  
I'd say it's unique. There's probably more out there than what's called
attention to.  
But as far as -- you know, Cole has a chance, in my opinion -- a lot depends
on what kind of year he has, obviously. He could be the best true big man
Kansas has had since Wilt. You start and think about the true big man. Danny
wasn't a center and Rafe wasn't a center. But you really look at it, that's a
pretty big statement for 50-plus years that he could be the best true big guy.  
I'd say not common, but certainly not totally unusual to have a guy like Cole
that knows who he is. Most -- there's just not very many guys out there that
do that. Most guys feel like they've got to be something else, and he doesn't
feel that way at all.  
  
Q. Back to Cole, you talked about he became something you didn't expect
right away. Was it just the fact that he had -- he was able to have that
playing time extensively last year.  
COACH SELF: I don't think so. I think that, obviously, when you get playing
time and experience, you've got a chance to get better.  
You know, in recruiting, most guys -- I shouldn't say most guys, but the
majority of guys that we deal with, and I'm sure the majority of guys that
guys in this league deal with, they look at your roster, and they say how can
I play immediately? It's a quick fix. I want to go somewhere that I can impact
it right off the bat or have a chance to start.  
The best thing for Cole was that didn't register with him. He went to a place
that he wanted to be at first and foremost, and then style and playing time
and all that was way secondary.  
And the fact -- what got him better prepared more than anything was getting
his butt beat every day by Sasha and Darnell and Shady. That prepared him.  
Cole played eight minutes a game as a freshman, and four of the minutes don't
count because they were mop-up minutes. So he probably averaged four minutes a
game as a freshman and got better every day in practice and used practice as
his vehicle for getting better.  
And then at the end of the year, obviously, he had the one good game, and you
can kind of see what it was -- what was getting ready to happen.  
To me, I don't think it was last year's experience, I think it was him having
the right attitude his freshman year when he went getting experience is what
allowed him to be pretty good last year.  
PETER IRWIN: Coach, thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2009

  

### [Doc Sadler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15826)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're back with Coach Doc Sadler from Nebraska.  
Coach, welcome. Your opening thoughts.  
COACH SADLER: Well, it just seems like the other day that we were all here a
couple of years ago. It's exciting to be back.  
I guess, like most of you all, everybody in the NCAA and the rest of the staff
felt sorry for us by giving us 14 scholarships. They know how bad we're going
to be this year.  
But I really like our guys. You know we've got basically two players that's
played significant minutes, but we've got two other players that's played a
little bit, and we've got a bunch of other guys that have no idea what they're
up against.  
But saying that, I think this is the first time I've really felt like we have
a basketball team that eventually sometime will be able to compete at some
level in this league.  
Unfortunately, the league, as all of you all know, is probably the best it's
ever been. And I know it's the best it's been since I've been here.  
You know, you've got obviously Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma State, Oklahoma, Texas
A&M. You've got everybody that is picked to be, you know, a team that can make
it to the NCAA tournament. And then you see where we're picked.  
But I can promise you that the guys that we've got understand one thing; that
they're going to compete and they're going to play hard, and they believe in
themselves.  
I think, when everything is said and done, I think you're going to see a team
that, when we come back here in March, that I hope maybe will surprise some
people.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. We'll take questions from the
floor.  
  
Q. Doc, are you actually going to have a couple of big guys on the floor
this year. Can those two guys play?  
COACH SADLER: Yeah, we do. Unfortunately, we lost the one guy, but we do have
some size. I don't know what I can do with it. It's been so long since I've
been able to have anybody over 6 foot tall to play for us.  
We do like our guys. Brian Diaz, who you're talking about, Brandon Ubel,
Quincy Hankins. All three of those guys, you know, are 6'8", 6'9", 6'11".  
And the thing about those guys is they're really skilled. The unfortunate
thing is two of them are freshmen. But Quincy Hankins has been out all week.
Don't know when he'll be back. But when he does get back, he's going to add
some size to it.  
You know, with what we like to do offensively, we need to have some guys down
low that can put pressure on defenses.  
  
Q. I hate to get you to elaborate on anything with your voice like this.  
COACH SADLER: I feel much better than it sounds.  
  
Q. Could you just talk a little bit more about Ubel, the local product.  
COACH SADLER: You know, when we signed Brandon, I really, really liked him but
didn't realize he was as mature as he probably is.  
He comes from a great high school program. The Lewandowski kid that's at Texas
Tech, I think you got a chance to see what he did as a freshman. Donnie
Campbell does a great, great job. So he's probably more prepared to help us
earlier than normal.  
And so, you know, if we were to toss it up tonight, he'd probably start for
us. But we don't toss it up tonight. But he's going to be a very, very, very
good player for us the next four years.  
  
Q. Is he a banger type?  
COACH SADLER: I think that's a perception because of the way he looks. He's
pretty thick and strong. But Brandon's a very skilled player, can really shoot
the basketball.  
You know, he's worked with Scott Wedman and played for Scott the last three or
four years. Brandon is a very, very fine shooter. I can't say enough good
things about him.  
  
Q. Doc, if you go big, can you still play your trademark pressing defense?  
COACH SADLER: I hope so. That's the one thing that we -- that's what we're
going to do. I've seen obviously right now that's probably the area that we're
not as good as I'd like to be after six or seven practices. But I do think the
way they're working, eventually they will become a very, very good defensive
team.  
  
Q. Could you just the idea of having somebody back --  
COACH SADLER: Sure, it helps.  
  
Q. How does that change what you do or affect what you do?  
COACH SADLER: Well, again, I think any time you've got somebody back there
that can at least -- they can see makes a difference. And so with some guys
back there, you know -- because we're going to get beat off the dribble some
because of the pressure we try to put out there.  
So as long as they can see them back there, I think maybe it will discourage
them a little bit. I don't know if it's going to discourage the teams in this
league. I hope it just discourages some teams that we're playing in
nonconference.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, Coach. Best of luck to you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2009

  

### [Greg McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15827)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We are now joined by Coach Greg McDermott from Iowa State.  
Coach, welcome. Your thoughts about the upcoming season.  
COACH MCDERMOTT: This is the first time in my tenure at Iowa State that we've
had the luxury of having some returning players with some experience.  
The difference that that has made on the practice floor in the early going has
been incredible. It's really eased the transition of the new players that
we're trying to get ready to play because there's going to be two or three of
them that are going to have to impact our program this year.  
But with a guy like Craig Brackins making the decision to return to school,
it's really just generated a lot of excitement around our program. Obviously,
Craig had a terrific year last year, and he's worked extremely hard to build
on that this year.  
And then the fact that we opened a new practice facility about a month ago has
really given our program a boost. We were all over campus in the past with
athletic training in one place and weightlifting in another place and
individual workouts in a different place. And now that's all under one roof.  
So just what that does to help develop your chemistry because the guys are
around the coaches more often, and they're around each other more often.
That's moved us in the right direction. But they're working extremely hard in
practice.  
Without question, we're more athletic than we've been in the past, and now
it's just putting those pieces together and moving in the right direction. But
so far, I really like what I see.  
  
Q. With the addition of Marquis Gilstrap, how does that do for you guys'
depth? Does it take the focus off Gilstrap?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: It's "Marquez." It's spelled like Marquis, but it's
"Marquez." I made the same mistake early in the recruiting process.  
If you're going to win in the Big 12, you have to have versatility on the wing
with some size. We were desperately missing that a year ago. We really haven't
had that since we had Rahshon Clark.  
So Marquis we felt like was one of the more talented wings in the country.
Even though at the time he only had one year of eligibility left -- and we're
operating under that assumption now -- we felt he was too good to pass up.
He's a very powerful rebounder. He shot over 40 percent from the three-point-
line last year. And he's just been a joy to coach.  
It's a unique situation in that he realizes he might only have one year of
college basketball, so he is really cherishing every minute of it, and his
eyes are wide open from a coachability standpoint. And as a result, he's
getting -- he's just making strides every single day on both ends of the
floor.  
So, you know, he can score inside and out. And probably even more importantly,
he gives us that versatility to defend some of the great wings across our
conference.  
  
Q. You got one of the league's premier players, the Newcomer of the Year,
and you're still picked eighth in the conference. Is that a conservative
estimate and testament to the strength of this league?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: They must not think much of the coach is what that must mean.
That would be my guess.  
But I think it is a testament to the league. I think you could argue -- and
it's an easy argument -- the seven teams that are picked ahead of us are
picked ahead of us for a reason. Generally, preseason polls are based on how
you did last year and what you return. There's just a lot returning in our
league.  
Some of the newcomers that are entering our league come from very successful
backgrounds in high school or junior college, and I think they're going to
have quite an impact right away.  
So we're picked probably about where we should be picked, but I'll be
disappointed if that's where it ends up at the end of the day.  
  
Q. What does the addition of Chris Colvin give you? First of all, when do
you think Chris is going to be able to contribute, and what's that do for
Diante?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: I think Chris will be able to contribute hopefully right
away. We needed another point guard that can break down the defense and create
some things for his teammates off the dribble. Diante's done that for us the
last couple of years, but he was really the only one in the program that was
able to do that.  
Now with the addition of Chris, I think he can help in that regard. And
probably most importantly, we just finally have some depth in the guard corps.  
We weren't in a position where we could afford someone to have an off game or
someone to sprain an ankle or come down with the flu on game day. We couldn't
recover from that.  
And now with Diante Garrett, Dominique Buckley, Chris Colvin at the point,
Lucca Staiger and Scott Christopherson, the transfer from Marquette at the off
guard, and Marquis Gilstrap and Charles Boozer at the power forward, we have a
group of guards where there's some depth which, number one, helps you through
the tough days, but, number two, there's great competition in practice every
single day.  
Dominique Buckley, Diante Garrett, Chris Colvin are going at each other every
single day, which is making them better.  
  
Q. Greg, was RPI in mind that you've made this nonconference schedule?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: Either that, or I was losing my mind. One of the two.  
You know, the instate games are built in, which it's a little bit unique in
Iowa. It's something I liked a lot more when I was coaching at Northern Iowa
than I like now. But those are great games because it's got a big-time
atmosphere because no matter where you play, the arena is full. So it tests
your guys in that regard.  
But we've got a return game from Bradley coming. We started a season with
Houston, who had a great year last year. They come back to our place. And I
just made the mistake of requesting to go back to California to take Craig
Brackins back there, and of course we drew Cal, who's one of the best teams in
the Pac-10 this coming year.  
And the Duke game was just something that happened late. It was an opportunity
for our program to be on the national stage on a night when there wasn't a lot
else going on. You know, our fans want us to play games like that, and the
reality of it is players want to play in games like that.  
It will be a great measuring stick for us as we're about to enter Big 12 play.
And I've always felt as a coach, if you've got what you think is a good team,
then you need to schedule along those lines and challenge your team. If you
have an inexperienced team, you don't want to overschedule. You want to have
an opportunity to give them some confidence and have some games that they can
win.  
I think we've got a good mix of challenging games both at home and on the
road.  
  
Q. How big a confidence boost was the big game that Brackins had last year
against Kansas?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: It was a huge confidence boost for him, and it just -- it
changed his perspective on everything because now all of a sudden the
opportunity to leave school early was a reality. And, you know, he had a huge
game against Northern Iowa in November, where he had 35 and a bunch of
rebounds. He did the same thing at Houston, and then he did it in the Big 12
against Kansas on that particular night.  
But he was able to back that up with consistent scoring and rebounding after
that game. Oftentimes when he was drawing a double-team.  
I think he gained a lot of confidence from it. And then when he made the
decision to come back, you know, I really think this summer his experience
with USA Basketball was a tremendous growing experience for Craig to get out
of his comfort zone and go away from home. He came back a much more mature
leader, and that's carried over to what he's done for our team.  
  
Q. What do you want Boozer's role to be this year? He obviously stepped in
in the middle of last season and gave you guys another option. How does this
depth affect him?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: Charles did some good things last year. You know, his
freshman year he really shot the ball well. But he wasn't able to pick up
everything defensively that we were asking him to do, and he struggled on that
end of the floor.  
Last year I felt like he made great strides on the defensive end of the floor
and with some of the energy he was able to bring us off the bench. He just
didn't shoot the basketball very well.  
I'm hopeful this year he can put this all together. Obviously, his
understanding of the system of play and what our expectations are, now being
in his third year, are at a level they haven't been in the past. He sees an
opportunity where he can help us.  
So far in practice, he's competed extremely hard.  
PETER IRWIN: Coach, thank you very much. Good luck.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2009

  

### [Frank Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17664)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now join by Coach Frank Martin from Kansas State.  
Coach, welcome. Your thoughts on the upcoming season.  
COACH MARTIN: Thank you. Just another exciting Big 12 year.  
I think it goes unsaid just how competitive this league is year in and year
out. Coaches, players, the venues that you play in.  
I don't think people understand just how good the league is sometimes. When
you look at some guys that could have been gone to go make some money and make
big money, and yet they choose to stay in the league, that's a credit to those
coaches and those relationships they've got with those kids and those
universities that they choose to stay and represent that school rather than
take advantage of going to make money.  
It's a credit to the league and just how much fun it is.  
It's not fun when it's late January and you get your brains beat in, but it's
tremendous basketball. If you've got any hope at being any good, you've got to
be excited about being in such a great conference as this.  
  
Q. Frank, when you had Michael Beasley, obviously you had a phenomenal
talent, but you had a lot of young players around him. This year it seems you
have a better balance of youth and experience. How do you feel this team is
prepared kind of comparatively to that team that got all that publicity that
year with Michael?  
COACH MARTIN: You know, two years ago basically everything came out of my
mouth, people thought here's this ignorant guy that doesn't know what he's
talking about. That's all right. I still express myself, and I'll continue to
be consistent with what I said two years ago.  
There's a reason why IBM doesn't go out and hire 18-year-olds to run their
company. And we had nine first-year guys. Seven of them were freshmen. And the
upperclassmen that we had were playing for the second or third head coach in
so many years.  
And then as coaches, it was the first time that I got to implement my views,
my thoughts with players. We don't get to see them in the summer. You don't
really know what they're going to do day in and day out until you actually
live with them.  
Well, here we are a couple years later, now we've got a core of guys that have
been together. Our staff's been together. They understand -- freshmen come in,
and they all think they're going to take the league by storm. They don't
comprehend how hard it is.  
I tell our guys all the time -- I've told them since they got on campus,
whether it was four years ago, three years ago, whenever -- if winning is
easy, who loses? I think a lot of times young kids lose perspective of that,
that everyone wants to win, and everyone's willing to sacrifice to win.  
We've got some things in place now. Because of that, when you watch us
practice now, you can identify who the freshmen are because they're just at a
different speed, different body type, different energy level than those
upperclassmen, and that's a credit to those upperclassmen that they've worked
so hard and they've invested themselves in attempting to succeed.  
Because of that, then we're excited our freshmen have a chance.  
  
Q. Frank, consider your finishes of the last couple of seasons, the class
you brought in with guys like Judge and McGruder in it. Can you allow yourself
to take a breath and say, okay, this is my program now?  
COACH MARTIN: That's for others to say. I'm going to -- no one's going to put
more pressure on me than I put on myself every year to better represent Kansas
State University.  
I approach my job the same way today that I did in 1985 when I was a junior
varsity high school basketball coach. That doesn't change. I have a
responsibility and a duty to the academic institution I work for, and I have a
responsibility and a duty to those parents that trust me with their children
to make them better men and better players.  
And that's the way I approach my job. I truly feel that that year three is
when your personality as a coach kind of starts to really permeate and become
representative through your team.  
Look at Missouri last year. All the coaches three years ago, everyone said
this league was down. It wasn't down. We had six first year coaches. We were
just in a little bit of transition. Well, you're starting to see those coaches
and their teams, their personalities and their kind of play and their
recruiting efforts that they've made evolve. And I think that's kind of the --
hopefully, the natural thing that will take place with us. That's for other
people to determine, I guess.  
  
Q. Rodney McGruder, highly touted along with the other freshmen, how long do
you think it will take them to make an impact for your team this season?  
COACH MARTIN: I don't mean to give you kind of a silly answer. I've got no
idea. It's going to be a lot harder for him and Wally Judge and Nick Russell
and Jordan Henriquez and Martavious Irving, our five freshmen, because we have
guys in place that are older now. We don't have little kids anymore.  
There's a difference there with the approach of the upperclassmen as to what
they used to be two years ago.  
Now, with that said, for his age, his being a freshman, never been through Big
12 or high major college basketball, has an unbelievable work ethic. Has a
sense of toughness about him that excites us. And then the other part of that
is you can have all that, and if you're not going to embrace leadership on a
winning team or coaching, you're going to kind of level off and not improve.  
But he embraces it. He loves to listen to those upperclassmen and loves to be
coached and challenged. Because of that, he's going to make an impact on our
team.  
Now, when? I don't have a feel for that right now.  
  
Q. What's the next step for Clemente and Pullen?  
COACH MARTIN: Last year they both -- they grew tremendously as players. The
part that I was the proudest of those two guys was the way that they made
their drive, their personalities just kind of grow on the basketball team. I
don't think there's a better indication of when we started Big 12 play and we
were 0-4, those two guys which were the spirit of our team, that spirit that
they have to succeed, that drive to embrace the responsibility that comes with
winning and losing, they were willing to take the chance.  
And because of that, it gave us a chance. When the season ended, we went out
to San Diego State and didn't play well the second half and got beat. Well,
they didn't go home and cry to mom, and they didn't come in and feel sorry for
themselves. They went right back in that gym, and they've both made themselves
stronger because of the commitment they've made in the weight room. They've
made themselves better athletes.  
And lastly, they lived in that gym. That's what you have to do to become a
better player.  
  
Q. Frank, what kind of progress has Curtis Kelly made since he transferred
into the program? What type of player will he bring to the roster?  
COACH MARTIN: Curt -- when I saw Curt play in high school, I thought he was a
pro. He's one of those kids that I just thought that he was going to be a pro.  
Now, he went to UConn, and the main reason why I chose to take him as a
transfer was because in his recruiting process never once did he lead me to
believe that Jim Calhoun or UConn had anything to do with his lack of success
there. He accepted that responsibility. So that kind of told me who he is as a
person. That he's not the one trying to pass the blame for his lack of success
there.  
And since he's been on our campus, he's been phenomenal. He's worked his tail
off. He's in line to get his degree in May, which I know makes his mom
extremely proud. He's lost 30 pounds.  
We were just in the back, Jacob Pullen and Merriewether and myself, we're
laughing because when we go into strength camp the coach takes pictures of
ourselves with boxers on. Every year he takes another picture.  
When I saw his picture about a week ago, I literally had a tough time eating
later on in the day. But now he's transformed his body. He looks like a high
major athlete again, and he's playing that way. He's been tremendous.  
He gives us a presence at the rim, both on offense and defense, and he's been
great.  
  
Q. How much potential exists within those guys in the front-court to
possibly take some of the scoring load off of Denny and off of Jacob?  
COACH MARTIN: That's what we're hoping. Last year we were not very athletic on
the front line. Darren Kent, bless his soul, worked his tail off and gave us a
chance to win. Luis Colon will be a fourth-year guy this year. Worked his tail
off and gave us a chance to win. And he's going to be a better player this
year.  
Jamar was a freshman. Jamar was 20 pounds lighter then than he was now. He'd
do certain good things against certain people, and he'd bounce off other
people. It wasn't that he wasn't trying. He just wasn't physically ready to do
it. Now we've got more guys.  
Wally is every bit of 6'9", 242 pounds. Curtis is 6'9" with a 7'2" wingspan
and every bit of 238, 240 pounds. They're both as athletic as you're going to
find.  
Jordan Henriquez has a 7'6" wingspan, and he's a lot better than I anticipated
him being this early in the year. Jamar is 20 pounds heavier. Because of that
depth on the front line, now we're being able to kind of move Jamar over to
the three a little bit.  
So it's fun when you throw all those guys in there together. You just have
more to choose from. You create a certain competitiveness within your team on
a day-in-and-day-out basis that you need to have so you can be good.  
PETER IRWIN: Okay, Coach. Best of luck to you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2009

  

### [Pat Knight](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18927)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Pat Knight from Texas Tech University.  
Coach, welcome. Your thoughts about the upcoming season.  
COACH KNIGHT: You know, we're just looking -- I don't get into all the coach's
speak. I just kind of like to open it up for questions so you guys get your
answers.  
Of course I'm excited about the season, and, you know, I think we'll be more
talented and more athletic. But we'll see what happens.  
So let's just open it up for questions to make sure I'm here for you guys so
you guys get everything that you need.  
  
Q. Pat, I know you're pumped about your newcomers. Talk about them. And from
top to bottom, is this the most talented team that you've had at Tech since
you've been on campus?  
COACH KNIGHT: Yes, obviously. I think it is just from an athletic standpoint.
The talent standpoint.  
I really believe that to compete at this level, one of the top conferences,
you've got to be nine or ten deep. We're there now, you know.  
I think we'll have a problem now just trying to figure out who our top nine or
ten are because we have probably 12 we can choose from, I think, and at least
compete at this level of the Big 12.  
We're just excited. It's just something -- we've had talented teams in the
past, but I just think from an athletic standpoint, this is probably the most
athletic we've been in a long time, or really since I've been there as an
assistant or a head coach since last year.  
You know, we're always going to be half junior college when I recruit. It's
just Texas Tech is just a really good situation to recruit junior college and
high school kids. The three junior college kids -- Reese, Tairu, and Jenkins
-- we brought them in immediately to upgrade our talent and athleticism, and I
think you'll see them in the starting lineup a lot this year or being one of
the first to come off the bench.  
So really those three kids are going to make a huge impact for us just from an
athletic and talent standpoint that we didn't have last year.  
You know, I think they'll be having those kids added to the mix with good
players like Roberson and Singletary, now you have five guys that are actually
a threat with the ball. But we can actually play defense now. We can get back
to playing man to man.  
I really don't like to play zone. People were on my ass last year about giving
up so many points like I didn't work on defense. We worked on defense two
hours a day. We just didn't have the personnel to guard anybody.  
We had guys, if you got by one, the next guy was probably just as easy or
easier to get by. It wasn't from a lack of my staff and I not trying to coach
it.  
To be honest, there's no secret to coaching. You've got to have the personnel.
I just didn't think we had it last year. Now we have it.  
Now we're able to be in the pass lane. We're able to be on help side. Web
guard the ball.  
For me, it's kind of nice. I can get back to playing man-to-man defense the
way I was taught, the way I played, and the way I taught -- was taught as an
assistant.  
So, overall, just from that standpoint, I just think everything's going to be
better for us.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Mike Singletary. The last half of the season
last year, he really started to come along. You can give us your comments on
him this season.  
COACH KNIGHT: I look for good things from him and John Roberson and D'walyn
Roberts. Those three kids came in together. It was kind of a highly touted
class.  
We just haven't had the support for them overall to help them out, help them
along. And now we have that.  
You know, Mike did a good thing for me last year. I brought him in before the
season. We were only four or five deep, and I didn't want to get in a
situation where I started my five best players, and I had no bench whatsoever.
So I actually brought him in and asked him if he'd mind coming off the bench
because he's really the one kid I knew from a personality standpoint wouldn't
pout, I wouldn't be hearing from his parents, why is my son not -- you know,
all the BS that goes with it.  
He was just concerned that he'd get his playing time, and he really took one
for the team. I think it showed. He ended up really well the last couple
months of the season, especially the A&M game.  
But now this year we are deep enough. I think, you know, he's going to be in
the starting lineup. But the best thing for him is just the upgrade of talent.
It's not just from us, hopefully from a one-loss situation, but now every day
the starters are going against Big 12 caliber players. Or the caliber of
Kansas or Texas? Maybe not. But at least Big 12 caliber players.  
Is this going to make Mike better? I think, if you ask Mike, his first week of
practice for him and John, it's probably a little tougher than it's been the
last two years. It's been really easy for them. We just didn't have the talent
to push them.  
I hope really good things for those three kids -- D'walyn, John, and Mike.
They came to Tech, and their first two years didn't go as well as we wanted,
but I think they can finish up well the last two years because of the talent
we've added and the way they've improved. I look for good things not just from
Mike, but from those three kids to finish up their careers.  
  
Q. Pat, what's Mike done? I understand he's lost about 20 pounds. What's he
done to improve his physicality?  
COACH KNIGHT: You'd have to ask my strength coach, Chris Braden. I've got a
great strength coach. Actually, Rick Barnes recommended him, and we hired him,
which is kind of strange.  
He was the number two guy in charge of men's basketball at Texas. Actually, it
started with my dad. My dad was tired of seeing other people's guards bigger
than our post guys. So I finally had to explain to him that a lot has to do
with weightlifting, and that's come into play a lot in basketball, not just
football anymore.  
So we actually called Rick because his guys -- Todd's known around the world
as the number one guy in basketball for strength and conditioning. And it was
funny, we thought, being rivals, even though we're good friends, he'd probably
tell us about some football guy down at Auburn or LSU. He actually told us we
needed to hire his second guy in charge.  
We actually played him as a Monday. We're going to play him on Wednesday
there. He actually set up the meeting at the shootaround. We met with Chris
Braden and hired him right there on the spot. It all has to do with Chris.  
Chris is really good at seeing guys. He thought Mike wasn't playing
athletically enough, because Mike's an undersized post player in a way. And we
thought he needed to become quicker, being able to jump better, play more
athletically.  
So Chris, it's all him. You know, I just give him ideas how I'd like to my
guys to play, and then he oversees it and then gets the job done. So he's
really taken -- he took 15 or 20 pounds off of Mike, and now Mike's able to
drive more, get by guys. He actually dunks in the half-court situation.  
I think it's helped his rebounding. But is this really -- I can't really take
any of the credit. I just thought he needed to lose some weight, but my
strength guy, Chris Braden, did all the work.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked a little bit about how important it is to have good
personnel already, but is it more important as a coach to adapt to that
personnel or adapt them to your coaching style?  
COACH KNIGHT: You can't win without personnel. You can have bad personnel, and
you can do all you want from a coaching standpoint, and you can't win.  
You need to get your personnel that fits your style of play. And when you
inherit a program, it's tough. Even in -- we tried to adapt. You know, that's
why you saw us play so many junk defenses, zones, trapping, and trying
different things.  
But, you know, from a standpoint as a coach, you've got to get your personnel.
That's what we did from a recruiting standpoint. That's why you'll see this
year it's more of the personnel that I want.  
But, you know, maybe there's a few guys out there that they can win with not
very good players, but I really don't see it. Look at all the -- look at
what's going on in baseball right now in the Major Leagues. Everyone talks
about how loose the Yankees are this year. Look at their talent level. Look at
the talent level of the Dodgers, the Phillies.  
You can talk about, yeah, this guy's a great coach, but all the great coaches
have got great players. I know one guy that maybe could win with some bad
talent, maybe my dad, but I'm smart enough to know I can't. I've got to get
better players. That's what I think we've done this last year from a
recruiting standpoint.  
I'm not going to sit here -- I honestly don't believe that anymore. You have
to have the talent. Look at the teams that went to the Final Four. None of
those teams were underdogs or guys that did not have talent.  
So nowadays, you have to have talent. I mean, I know you've got guys out there
that like to write books and sell videotapes like they're these great coaches
and everything and did a lot with a lot less. That's all BS. You've got to
have talent.  
Tony La Russa's book is out. It's a great book. You need to read it if you
want to know about coaching. He summed it up. You have to have players to win.
I don't care what sport it is.  
  
Q. You talked about your strength coach and getting guys physically ready to
play, kind of physical basketball. That seems to be the way the game is now.
How much has that changed since maybe going back to when you were a player,
that emphasis on weights and playing physical?  
COACH KNIGHT: Well, one of the big differences really is how you guard the
post or block out. You know, when I played, you'd work on different pivots to
block out, front pivot, reverse pivot. You'd even work on pivoting how you
guard the post.  
But I think guys are so strong and so quick now, really you just tell them,
from a rebound sense, you make contact. Just make contact and go get the ball.  
I mean, guys are so big and athletic now, you can't sit there worrying about,
well, I'm going to pivot this way or that way to block a guy out because he's
right by you, or he's got you shoved underneath the basket.  
So I think it's taken some of the technique out of a lot of areas where I was
growing up -- I mean, we worked one on nobody, on how to pivot to block out.
We'd work on how to pivot to guard the post. And so a lot of that's gone out
of the way.  
You know, I remember at camp, learning all these different pivots. Now that's
kind of going out of the way. You've got guys that can outrun you. So you just
get down the floor.  
They used to teach you how to turn and pivot to get down the floor. I think a
lot of that stuff's going out of the way.  
The so-called fundamentals, when it comes to footwork, is going out the door
just because guys are so powerful and strong. Now you've just got to -- it's
more brute force on a defensive situation.  
  
Q. Roberson was a 200, 100 assist guy last year, which on that team is
pretty remarkable. Could those numbers rise even because he's got better
places to throw the ball?  
COACH KNIGHT: I think so, but I also think his assists may be down because I
like to get the ball out of his hands. Because he's such a good shooter off
the screen.  
I felt bad. It wasn't his fault. I just didn't have anybody else to handle the
ball. But I think honestly I'm in a situation now where I'll even let my
center bring the ball up.  
I think I'm going to have five guys, or at least four guys, whoever gets the
rebound goes. It would be better to have him coming off the flare screens or
coming off down screens.  
His assists may be down a little bit this year, but it has nothing to do
because of him; it's just because we have better players, and I can get him
more involved in our entries and motion and coming off the screens instead of
having to handle the ball all the time.  
Then I think his defense improves. It wears you out bringing the ball up all
game long, especially in the Big 12. You know, when teams are starting to pick
you up full court. And so I think this year maybe his assist numbers could be
down, but that's just because I think his overall game is going to get better.  
I'm trying to get the ball out of his hands. I want him to be more well
rounded the next two years. Because he really is. People haven't seen what a
good player he is cutting and moving off of screens.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, best of luck to you. Have a great season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2009

  

### [Travis Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18471)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Travis Ford from Oklahoma State.  
Coach, welcome. And your thoughts on the upcoming season.  
COACH FORD: Thank you. Great to be here today. Excited about this season.  
You know, when you look at our basketball team, and I think we are, from what
I understand, probably the youngest team in the league. Our average age is
like 19 years old. We have seven new players.  
And when you say that, you would think that we're probably in our rebuilding
stage when you bring in seven new players, but we're not really approaching it
that way because of the returning players we have and the backbone of our
team.  
When you look at guys like James Anderson, Obi Muonelo, Keiton Page, Marshall
Moses, these guys who are returning who are going to be the backbone of our
team, we think we have a chance to have a very fun and exciting year.  
Yes, we are going to have to rely on some of these new players, we're placing
them to get minutes, but from what I've seen the last four or five days of
practice, I think we have a chance. Matt Pilgrim, one of our new players, has
been in college. This will be his fourth year in college. He's a very
experienced player who will step in and play right away for us at 6'8", 245,
the most athletic player on our team and the strongest player on our team. So
he's going to step in and play significant minutes.  
We really like the balance of new guys with returning players. We really like
the balance. You know, I don't think it's every coach's plan to bring in seven
new players, but that kind of happens when you take over a program. The first
couple of years, different things happen.  
But we're looking forward to it. We're excited. All the players. We think
we've improved ourselves in every area, except maybe the point guard spot.
James Anderson has gotten better. Keiton Page has gotten better. Marshall
Moses has gotten better. We've gotten better at each spot. Obviously, when you
lose a four-year starter in Byron Eaton, you're just not going to replace him
overnight.  
  
Q. You anticipated my question about your point guard. You signed two pretty
highly regarded kids. How have they looked so far?  
COACH FORD: They've been very competitive in practice. It's typical of any
freshmen. I think the physical tools are there, just the mental aspect of
having to play at this level. So much being thrown at you one time is a lot to
handle.  
But, you know, I think we brought in Ray Penn, Fred Gulley, even Reger Dowell
from Arkansas. All of these guys can play the point guard spot. Reger is
probably more of a combo guard. Can play more the two. And Ray Penn has more
of a complete game than any of them right now.  
Ray has been very impressive in practice, being able to score the basketball.
Really distributing and finding the open man and playing at a high level of
speed. And being able to play at that high level of speed and making good
decisions.  
He's probably physically -- even though he's 5'9", he's physically very, very
strong. He's probably got the most complete package right now. Even though
Fred Gulley is really push him at that spot.  
And then even Keiton Page can play that spot. Keiton Page backed up Byron
Eaton last year at the point guard spot and really did a very good job of it.
Even though Keiton is a natural two guard, and that's the position we would
like for him to play mostly. But if we needed somebody with experience who we
-- you know, I have no question mark can Keiton do it; it's just we'd like to
get him at that two guard spot.  
I think as we put Keiton Page and Ray Penn out there, you're extremely
dangerous from the perimeter. And I'm going to say James Anderson, those three
guys. I don't think there's a better three-guard shooting lineup in the
country. These three guys in practice, you know, we haven't worked on offense
very much in the first five or six practices I have. I've approached it
differently than I ever had in coaching.  
But it's tough for us to work on defense because these guys just shoot the
ball unbelievable. It makes us very dangerous from the perimeter when you have
these three guys on the perimeter. And Obi Muonelo is a great shooter as well
who plays the four spot. He's going to play more of a wing -- not more, but
some wing position this year. It makes us very dangerous the way we play.  
  
Q. Travis, because of the -- considering the strength of the league, did you
know that you were getting into when you came here? And what are your
observations about the Big 12?  
COACH FORD: I knew what I was getting into. Big 12 is always very good.
Obviously, I think this is an elite year, no question about it. From top to
bottom and then you look at all the individual talent in our league and how so
many players made the commitment -- sacrificed to come back to their schools.
The James Andersons, the Sherron Collins, Brackins, Willie Warren. You can go
down the line.  
This is a very special year, there's no question. I've been doing all the
Kiwanis and rotaries and all that stuff we do, and I've been telling our fans,
you'd better get your jackets because, when January gets here, you're not
going to want to miss this because night in, night out, you're going to see
very competitive, great basketball from top to bottom, every single team.  
And every night in and night out, you're going to be witness three to four to
five NBA players on the court, and there's going to be great talent out there.  
So, absolutely, it's exciting to be a part of it. On the other hand, it
definitely keeps you up at night. There's no question.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Obi Muonelo, your lone senior, and the leadership
qualities he's brought to the team so far this year.  
COACH FORD: Well, Obi is, I think, a natural leader when it comes to work
ethic. I don't know if I've ever coached a player that puts in the time Obi
Muonelo puts in.  
He's the one player that, when I came to work this summer in June and get
there -- I get there maybe at 8:00. He's already been there at 5:30 in the
morning getting so many jump shots up on his own. Not something we have to
tell him to do.  
You know, he's just a natural worker. No question about it. And he leads by
example that way. Our players, our new players have seen how he goes about his
daily habits of preparing his body, whether it be stretching or getting in
extra shots before practice, after practice, getting extra time on a
treadmill, whatever it may be. His body is just -- he really approaches the
game the way we would like every player to approach it.  
So he leads by example in that way. You know, Obi, last year I put him in a
position he'd never been before. We asked him to be a 6'4" four man, and he
had great success at it. And he's going to do the same thing this year. He's
going to play, yes, a lot of four, but we're also going to be able to move him
to some three a little bit because of the addition of Matt Pilgrim and some
other guys, and let him play that position.  
He's a phenomenal shooter. His work ethic is contagious to our other players.
And we're looking forward to Obi having a great senior season because of his
leadership and because he puts his time in.  
  
Q. Point guard, is that the toughest position for a freshman to come in and
have to work at right away?  
COACH FORD: It probably is. You know, it probably is in every system, but
especially in our system where we ask them to do so much. And probably tougher
on my point guards than I am anybody.  
It is tough because the ball is in your hands, and you've got to make
decisions. It's tough this year because you're replacing a great player in
Byron Eaton. And, yes, I do bring up Byron's name almost every day.  
Some people say, well, you know, don't. Our players know about Byron, and they
know what he led our team in last year and how he led our team at the end of
the year and the things he did for us.  
We want -- you know, a lot of the attributes Byron had, we want our point
guards to pick up some of those. We want him to be our own type player, but
it's especially tough this year because they are taking over a four-year
starter. It's a system where the ball is in your hands a lot, and we ask you
to make plays.  
We've got guys -- people have asked me, it's always been the number one
question. Who's going to play the point guard spot? That's the biggest
question mark of your team.  
Well, for me, yes, it is a question mark because I'm not even sure yet. It's
not an overly big concern that those two go together. I'm not for sure who's
going to do it yet, but I'm not overly concerned about it. Why am I not
concerned about it? Because James Anderson, Keiton Page, Obi Muonelo, Marshall
Moses. These guys are going to allow someone to learn the position a little
bit.  
Yes, they're going to have to get out there and perform, but they're not going
to have to be Byron Eaton from day one or even this year at all. We don't
expect that. But we want them to get out there and get James the ball, get Obi
the ball, get Keiton the ball. Pick up full court defensively. And if you're
open, knock down a shot. You don't have to create every play like Byron did.  
We're going to be patient with that position, but I've been very happy with
Ray Penn and Fred Gulley and Keiton and Reger and those guys. It's just going
to be a work in progress a little bit, and I'm going to have to be the number
one guy being patient.  
You know, the biggest -- the thing about this point guard spot, Ray Penn has
got all the physical tools. Fred's got the physical tools. They just don't
have the mental tool of it yet. And that's the greatest challenge of it,
understanding how difficult it is to play at this level.  
Not just the games yet, that's hard enough, but in practice. We've gone two-a-
days and stuff like that. I can tell after the first practice when I say, all
right, let's be dressed and ready to go again at 3:00. You can see their eyes
kind of pop up, what? We've got to go again? They don't understand the
commitment yet and how difficult it is to play at this level. And how
committed you have to be at it.  
That's the biggest challenge of teaching these younger point guards and
getting them to be leaders because it's not natural for them to come in and be
a leader surrounded by all these older players that they're going to be
playing with. We're telling ray and these guys, don't be afraid to speak up
and talk to James. Don't be afraid to speak up.  
I don't know if you can tell them what to do yet, but you can encourage them
and talk to them and be outspoken. I like my point guards to be outspoken.
Byron Eaton was very outspoken. I like my point guards to have a personality.
I want them to have a personality.  
And that's the part we're trying to develop with these guys right now. Develop
a personality. They got the physical tools. They're working extremely hard.
They've got that down really. How hard you've got to work. They've just got to
develop that mental aspect that I want out of it.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Best of luck.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2009

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We are now joined by Coach Scott Drew from Baylor.  
Coach, welcome. Your opening comments, sir.  
COACH DREW: It's great to be here again. Wife's not in labor this time, so I
can relax and have a great time here.  
As far as the Baylor bears go, we lost the winningest class in Baylor history
with our senior class. Very excited for all the new players we have. We
recruited well. We're excited for the season. Really excited for the Big 12
conference. This is my seventh season, and by far this is the best top to
bottom teams have been as far as parity and outstanding players.  
I think the facts and stats speak for themselves when seven of the top ten
players returned. We've done very well in the postseason the last few years.
And I'm very excited.  
PETER IRWIN: Coach, thank you. We'll take questions from the floor.  
  
Q. I hope I'm pronouncing it right. Udoh.  
COACH DREW: Ekpe Udoh.  
  
Q. Can you talk about him and what he's going to do for you guys.  
COACH DREW: Especially key, the last several years, defensively is where we've
struggled. You bring in a player like Ekpe, and you bring make a better
defensive team, better defensive post. He's going to make us better when
opponents have to get in the paint and score over the top of him.  
Any time you break Chris Webber's blocked shot record, you know you're an
impact defensive player. What's pleased us with Ekpe is he's very good
offensively as well, and we knew he'd be very good defensively, but we did not
know he'd be as good offensively as he is.  
  
Q. Like Kevin Rogers?  
COACH DREW: Similar to Kevin Rogers. At the same time, 6'10", 245 pounds. A
little bit bigger. And Ekpe likes to bang in the paint a little bit more.
Kevin liked to face up a little bit more.  
  
Q. Scott, the last couple of seasons, you know, you've been good early, good
late. Have you figured out how to put some meat in the middle yet?  
COACH DREW: Well, this year hopefully we'll be good early because the last two
years when you have an upperclassmen team, it's so easy to be good early.  
This year with so many new players putting on the jersey for the first time, I
think we're going to get better as the season progresses. I think our best
ball should be at the end of the season.  
But as far as I think the biggest reason we've struggled in the middle is
because of the Big 12. I think that's a compliment to the Big 12.  
Last year we started out. We were ranked for eight weeks, played and beat a
number of top teams. One at Washington State, beat Arizona State, beat
Providence. But then when we got in the Big 12, we hit some tough teams and
lost some close games.  
Again, I don't think people realized how good the Big 12 was until after the
NCAA tournament last year, and then with most schools better this year than
they were a year ago, everyone realizes it could be -- and I think is -- the
best conference in America.  
  
Q. Coach, I was just wondering, with your experience through the years with
your dad coaching, how have you seen just the general style of coaching change
through the years?  
COACH DREW: I think the thing that's really been consistent is the better the
players, the better the coach. I've learned that from my dad. The more talent
you bring in, the easier things are.  
But I think the game is a lot faster than it used to be. I think coaches
really emphasize transition offense, getting the ball in quick, especially in
the Big 12. If you can't stop transition, you're going to really struggle
defensively.  
And then on the offensive end, we spend so much more time working on getting
the ball up and down the court.  
So I think that's the biggest difference from probably 15 years ago to today.  
  
Q. Scott, is Udoh good enough to make you guys better than coaches have
predicted for you in the league this year? What can he do to facilitate
that?  
COACH DREW: I think, first of all, with the turnover we've had, you would
expect to be picked low. At the same time, I think the group that left have
left the foundation. I think we've recruited well.  
The returning players like Tweety and Lace and Ekpe and Josh, Quincy and Fred
-- people that have been in the program and won the last two years coming off
two back-to-back 20-minute seasons for the first time in school history,
coming off two postseasons.  
I think you have momentum and gives you a chance. Obviously, as a team and a
coaching staff, I think we hope to be better picked in the preseason.  
But it's a nice compliment to the seniors because when you lose 50 percent of
your rebounding and scoring and assists, you expect to be picked low.  
  
Q. Scott, you said the game's gotten faster over the last 15 years. Why is
that? Is that players like to play that way and coaches kind of went along?
Why has that happened?  
COACH DREW: I think twofold. It starts out with players like to play that
style. So I think coaches have adapted their style to players' strengths.  
And then at the same time, if you want to get good recruits, you probably need
to play a style that they want to play in.  
Strength coaches have really helped. Players lift a lot earlier. Physically,
they're stronger than they used to be. Athletically, they're better. So just
makes for more an up-and-down game.  
Again, I think coaches adjust to the players. If you have teams and players
that can go up and down, you're going to play to their strengths. Fans like to
watch that type of style as well.  
  
Q. Scott, how do you see Tweety -- or have you seen Tweety's demeanor change
now that, quote, this is his team?  
COACH DREW: Well, I think Tweety's one of those players that welcomes a
challenge like this. For three years playing along so many good guards, like
Aaron Bruce, Henry Dugat, Curtis Jerrells. Now he has a chance to control the
ball more, control the team more.  
I think he's very excited about that opportunity because, when he came out of
high school, that's something that he did. So very excited.  
Any time a coach has a senior point guard, he feels good going into -- better
going into a season. So I think Tweety will take a step forward this year
compared to maybe more backseat role in the past.  
He's been our best defensive guard the last couple of years. We've put him on
the best offensive player. And now I think he'll get a chance to show more of
his offensive ability.  
  
Q. Another newcomer question. Nolan Dennis seems to be that tweener size.
What do you project for him?  
COACH DREW: The great thing about Nolan is he can play -- his versatility. He
can play multiple positions. He can play the one, two, and three.  
Nolan is one of those players physically, because of his length, in the next
couple of years he's going to be a lot better than he is now as he puts on 20
pounds of muscle.  
But as far as at the end of the day, his versatility and length and skill set
is going to make him an outstanding player for Baylor over the years.  
PETER IRWIN: Thanks, Coach. We appreciate it.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2009

  

### [Jeff Capel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15825)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We are now joined by Coach Jeff Capel from Oklahoma.  
Coach, welcome. Your thoughts about the season.  
COACH CAPEL: First of all, good morning to everyone. I'm excited to be here.
Last time I was here was a very good weekend for us. In the NCAA tournament.
And it's great to have the Big 12 tournament back here in Kansas City.  
I'm excited about our season. We're a very different looking team, but we're a
talented basketball team. These guys have worked extremely hard in the summer
and our preseason workout. And now as we've started practice.  
We've had six practices, and they've really gotten after it. I like what I
think this team can become, but it's going to take a lot of work. But, again,
we have the pieces. It's just a matter of those pieces working together and
putting them in situations to be successful.  
So we're excited about it and are anxious to get started playing.  
  
Q. Jeff, talk about Tiny and especially Tommy Mason-Griffin. Most people
focus on Tiny as your top newcomer, but Tommy's going to be quite a
contributor, is he not?  
COACH CAPEL: Well, I think that -- I think Willie Warren is one of the best
guards in the country. Tommy Mason-Griffin has been as good as anyone in
practice for us first six days. He's been that good.  
I knew he was good coming out of high school. One of the things I thought
about Tommy was I thought he had a large room to grow to get better. Same
thing with Tiny.  
Once those guys got into a situation where they were forced to work
consistently, and that's where they are right now. And because of that,
Tommy's made a little bit bigger jump right now than Tiny. Tiny's coming, and
tiny's very talented. He's worked to get his weight in check. He's at 290. He
was 360 going into his senior year. He's at 290.  
We weighed him on Sunday. He's 290 pounds. He's awfully proud of that. He's
very talented. Has an incredible skill set.  
One of the things with Tiny -- as with all freshmen -- they have to get used
to the speed of the college game and the sense of urgency that you have to
have in the understanding of how important every possession is. But those two
give us a lot to work with immediately.  
  
Q. Jeff, given the versatility of Tiny, will you have to battle with him a
little bit to make him play in the blocks as opposed to outside sometimes?  
COACH CAPEL: You must have seen Tiny play somewhere.  
You know, that is something -- he is a versatile guy. He can do a lot of
different things. One of the things he can do is shoot the basketball. But it
is something that we have to remind him of, or we've had to remind him of so
far is don't fall in love with just being on the perimeter because you are
6'9". You do have a 7'4" wingspan, and you are 290 pounds. And to use that.  
I haven't seen any 6'9", 290 pound shooting guards out there. LeBron is close,
but, you know, by any means, he's not LeBron. There's only one of those guys
walking the face of the earth.  
It is something that we've had to remind him, and I keep using the word "had,"
past tense. Hopefully it's not something, as we get into November and December
and January and February, that we don't have to continually remind him of
that.  
  
Q. When you look at your First Team All-Big 12, do you look at that as an
All-American team as well?  
COACH CAPEL: Yes.  
  
Q. Coach Self was saying this is probably the most talented he recalls in
the Big 12.  
COACH CAPEL: Absolutely. If you look at -- you know, I think -- I really
haven't looked at it or how it was vote. I know how I voted. And so if you
look at Sherron Collins, you're talking about, in my opinion, the best point
guard in college basketball.  
When you look at Willie, I think he's the best off-guard or combo guard,
whatever you want to call him, in college basketball.  
James Anderson is certainly one of the best wing guys in college basketball.  
And then, again, I voted Craig Brackins. I think Craig Brackins is one of the
most underrated guys.  
Then in Aldrich, you have possibly the best center, I think, best center in
college basketball. And then you have guys right there that have a chance.  
And we have an awfully, awfully good freshman class and newcomer class in this
league.  
So it is incredibly talented. Again, like I've said since I've been here,
there's some great coach ins this league. Because of the talent level that our
league has been able to attract, it makes the basketball a very, very high
level.  
  
Q. Tony Crocker's here, a senior. He's kind of the last man standing of a
recruiting class that -- when you got to Norman. Talk about him and his
maturation up to this season.  
COACH CAPEL: You know, Crocker will always have a special place for me because
he's the only one that stayed.  
You know, that was a difficult time when all that stuff happened when I first
got here. We've talked about that. But Crocker's had a good career so far, and
I hope he has a great senior year.  
You know, he's stronger now. He finished our preseason conditioning at about
215 pounds. He lowered his body fat, improved his vertical, was more explosive
and quicker.  
Now yesterday was the first time he practiced. We've had a little flu thing
going on with our team. He's been out. Yesterday was the first time. So I
don't know how much weight he lost or things like that. But we need him to be
more consistent.  
And one of the things I challenged him with at the end of last season was, in
my opinion, in order to become more consistent, you need to work more
consistently. You need to do the things that you can control on a more
consistent basis, getting in and working on your game. So we'll see if he's
done that.  
  
Q. Jeff, how did Willie, in the times that he did, develop as a player and a
person when he had to defer to Blake?  
COACH CAPEL: We never wanted him to defer to Blake. That was the first thing.
That's something we talked about with him during the recruiting process and
while he was here.  
There would be times in practice where I would literally be screaming at
Willie in practice, you know: I didn't bring you here to defer. I brought you
here to be a difference maker. And I thought he was that last year.  
Now, there were times when, you know, he maybe tried to defer, and we tried
everything we can to get him to not do that.  
But he's grown up a lot. I think seeing how Blake handled everything last year
is going to be very important for him. When you look at him -- I don't know if
you'll be able to tell it today, you know, without a jersey on, but he looks
different. You know, he's gotten stronger. You know, he's in really, really
good shape right now. He looks more mature.  
And because he's worked like that, he carries himself in a different way now.  
And I know there were a lot of things said about Willie when he first came to
college and came to OU, he had a reputation. One of the things I've shared
with him is that sometimes you can never shake that, but you can control what
you can control. And he's done that.  
Since he's been at OU, we've had absolutely no problems at all with him.
Really, there were no problems with him in high school, nothing off the floor,
nothing academically. It was just a perception that people had of him.  
You know, when you're good, sometimes you get that. And when you're good and
you know you're good, which he knows he's a good player. I like that about
him, and I like the way he's matured.  
Today is his 20th birthday. So we're excited about that. I think he's going to
have a great year for us.  
  
Q. Jeff, can you just talk about shaping a team's personality and identity
after losing a guy who -- you know, the best player in the country last
year.  
COACH CAPEL: Well, it's work, and it starts really as soon as the season is
over with. As soon as last season was over with, we started.  
You know, it was -- I don't mean this to try to sound funny, but it wasn't a
surprise to us that Blake was leaving. We knew it when he decided to come back
that it was going to be his last year.  
You know, it's something we started trying to do when the season was over
with. I think one of the things is Willie has really stepped up in the
leadership department. Again, I think it was so great for him to be able to
watch everything that happened last year, watch how Blake prepared for
everything, watch how he handled everything.  
You know, some of the cheap shots we took -- he took last year. Some of the
things that people did to him or tried to do to him.  
The thing that Willie took from that is, again, how Blake kept his cool, but
most importantly, how he prepared.  
I've said this to people, and when NBA people call me, Blake Griffin is
obsessed with being great. When you talk about obsession, there's a fine line
there with a little bit insane. And he has that in a great way.  
I think some of that has rubbed off on Willie. You know, Blake -- we would
practice at 3:30 on the weekdays. At 2:30 I didn't have to look out my window
to see. When I heard that bounce every day at 2:30, I knew who it was.  
Now all of a sudden, that's happened in our first six days -- now, I hope it
doesn't change -- but that guy is Willie Warren now. Staying after practice
getting extra work.  
So I think him seeing that -- and all of our guys, our returning guys seeing
that, has helped.  
And then seeing Taylor do that and to see Taylor make the Phoenix Suns roster.
So it started when our season was over with. All of our guys were there this
summer, including our freshmen. And so the team-building process starts right
there.  
Now, I can't do anything with it, but our players do it. And once we start up
in August, we start doing some things. We do a lot of things together as a
team to try to build that.  
  
Q. Jeff, along the same lines, when you have a team that last year had the
comfort level of knowing if things were kind of falling apart on the court,
Blake could kind of rescue them. That's not there anymore.  
Do you sense that these guys will step into their roles that they need to to
take over a game when necessary?  
COACH CAPEL: It's interesting you say that because we talked about that the
other day as a team. We don't have a huge margin for error.  
Last year we could maybe get away with some things because, I call it, we had
big brother there to bail them out. He's gone now. But we do have other really
good players now.  
I think the thing our guys have to understand right now is how much we need
each other. Even though we had Blake last year, I thought Blake did a great
job of -- he did a great job of reminding the guys of that, of how much we all
needed each other.  
Our guys understand that now. So screening is going to be more important.
Communication is going to be more important. Guys really embracing their roles
is going to be more important. And so far we've done that.  
Now, we haven't faced any adversity yet. So far our guys have had a great
attitude and a great spirit about practice. Hopefully, that's something that
continues when we get knocked in the face, when we face some kind of
adversity.  
  
Q. I hate to look ahead, but November 21st is kind of a special game for you
guys. You face Virginia Commonwealth. What are your thoughts on that game?  
COACH CAPEL: You kind of threw me off when you said the date. I didn't know
what that was about. Coaches don't look that far ahead.  
You know, I'm excited about it. Obviously, VCU is and always will be a special
place to me. You know, my plight to becoming a head coach is way different
than anyone that I've ever even heard of and incredibly unique, and it's all
because of that place, because they believed in me. They saw something in me
when I didn't -- wasn't even looking for it at the time.  
Now it's different now because some of those people aren't there. The athletic
director that hired me is not there anymore. The president that hired me is
not there anymore. The players that I coached when I was there, there's only
one left, and he redshirted my last year there.  
So it is different, but the fans are the same. I know it's going to be a rowdy
environment. And it's a very tough place to play. And they'll have a really
good team.  
But, you know, it's a game we have to play. Hopefully, it's a game we win. I'm
going there to win. I'm not going there for a homecoming. I'm going there to
try to get a win. We can do homecoming stuff afterwards. If we win.  
  
Q. Jeff, that period when Blake was out with a concussion, how do you think
that what Willie learned in that stretch will carry over to this year?  
COACH CAPEL: Well, that was a different period because it wasn't something you
can prepare for. You know, what happened -- I can't remember what mark it was
in the first half against Texas. I knew right then that he wasn't coming back.
You know, I think maybe there was still some hope in our locker room that he
could come back the second half.  
But I knew when I looked at him. We saw him in the huddle. I don't know if a
lot of people saw him in the huddle, but we knew right there. I'm walking off
at halftime, and I think I was talking to Erin Andrews, and I happened to look
out the side, and he looked like a wobbly boxer.  
Willie was tremendous in the second half of that game. He almost single-
handedly won that game for us. I think he had 24 in the second half. If Abrams
misses just one of those shots, perhaps we win that game.  
But then you come back and less than 48 hours later, we're playing Kansas.
There was really not a lot of time to prepare because it was such a hard-
fought battle, such a physical game down there in Austin that when we came
back on Sunday, we literally just walked through everything.  
A couple of years ago, Blake's freshman year, when we played at Oklahoma
State, we had a chance to prepare without Blake. We had a whole week to
prepare after he had surgery on Sunday. And our guys were very prepared, and
you saw, you know, we were able to go down to Stillwater and win that game.  
Hopefully, with having a season right now to prepare, or preseason to prepare,
that makes Willie even more better. He understands how to pick his spots
better and different ways to attack. But certainly -- you know, look, I think
he's going to have a great year. I really and truly do. He's worked at it. I
think he's earned the right to have a great year. And he's a special talent.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2009

  

### [Jeff Bzdelik](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13815)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Coach Jeff Bzdelik from Colorado.  
Coach, welcome. And your comments, please.  
COACH BZDELIK: Thank you. Anyone who saw us play last year, it was obvious we
weren't deep enough, strong enough, mature enough with only one senior, one
junior.  
Our players played extremely hard. We lost 11 games last year by an average of
4 1/2 points per game. We just, like I said, weren't deep enough, strong
enough, mature enough.  
We've gotten deeper with the addition of five new players. We've gotten
stronger through just the maturity of working hard in the weight room. And we
gained valuable experience from last year with the fact that we had three
freshmen and a sophomore playing 30-plus minutes a game.  
We will be better. We're in an unforgiving league called the Big 12. So we'll
just take it one game at a time. We will be prepared. We will play hard. We
will be fearless, and we'll see where that takes us.  
Any questions?  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Speaking of depth, I just wanted to get your thought on Alec Burks and
his potential and his development.  
COACH BZDELIK: Alec Burks is a player, I think, is going to surprise a lot of
people. He's so young.  
He grew almost three inches since high school. He's about 6'6 1/2" right now.
I was kidding him in the locker room the other day because he was next to a
player that hadn't shaved in a couple of days, and I said, Do you need a
razor? And Alec looked at me and said, you know, Coach, I hope someday I need
one.  
But he's extremely talented. Most people who have seen us practice look at
him, and their first comment is, Wow, he's actually much more talented Richard
Roby when Richard was a freshman. You know, lanky and skilled.  
But Alec is talented. It's going to be an interesting year for him.  
  
Q. Does the growth change the way that you were planning on using him? 6'3 "
to 6'6"?   
COACH BZDELIK: Well, yeah. Alec is very versatile. He's a very willing passer.
He might be as talented of a passer as there is coming out of high school.
He's very unselfish. He's very skilled. You know, he can score the basketball
and do something that our team lacks, and that is he can create some offense
by himself.  
  
Q. Jeff, historically big men, freshmen big men in this league have
struggled. Harris-Tunks, what do you expect from him this year?  
COACH BZDELIK: To be quite frank, he's not ready yet. If you look at our
basketball team, our weakness is going to be our rebounding. It was last year.
If that doesn't change, you know, to be quite frank, we're not going to change
much from a win and loss standpoint. And players know that.  
We're going to have to really block off strong and collectively rebound the
basketball, all of us. We are much more athletic. We're much deeper. That, I
can tell you for sure. If we can rebound the ball, like I said, we'll be very
competitive.  
  
Q. Jeff, where are those rebounds going to come from?  
COACH BZDELIK: We'll find out together, Tom.  
No, we're just going to have to -- our perimeters are going to have to
rebound. Cory Higgins last year had almost, I think, five, six rebounds a
game. Everybody's going to have to do that.  
We're going to have to block off strong. That's something that we work on
every single day in practice in the beginning of practice. Right from the get-
go, right out of -- as soon as we warm up, we work on defensive rebounding.  
It's technique, and it's a will and a want to when the ball's up on the glass,
we need to just go get it. Somehow, some way.  
That's been our focus because we know if we can do that we've got a chance to
be competitive.  
  
Q. Can you just speak to Cory's development last season and how much he
improved, and then also how much it will help to have his brother around?  
COACH BZDELIK: First of all, Cory Higgins is a player who started every game
as a freshman and a sophomore. So gaining wisdom and experience, for all of
our players, has come at a high cost, and that is getting your tail beat.  
Through it all, the experience, he understands where shots are coming from
through the offense. He understands defensive positioning. He led the Big 12
in steals last year. He was one of the most frequent free-throw attempt guys.  
Cory is really driven internally. And, also, what's really important about
Cory is his father, being a general manager of the Charlotte Bobcats, Cory
hangs around all summer with the NBA players in Charlotte. He works with them.
He's on the court. He's in the weight room. He's watching, observing, you
know, just hanging around people like Larry Brown and Michael Jordan. Those
kinds of players. He absorbs a lot, and he takes it in the right way.  
He's an intelligent player. Again, you know, he's a player now that, just
heading into his junior year, he's improved his schedule. He's improved his
strength. He's improved his overall game in a great way. So we're looking
forward to a great year from him.  
Having his brother there, there's a great bond between the two of them, and
his brother being older -- his brother's not eligible, but his presence on the
court every day -- you know, you should see them compete. His brother's a very
good player in his own right, and he brings out the best in Cory every single
day in even a greater way just because of the way they've grown up and the
respect that they have for one another.  
So it's all good.  
  
Q. Jeff, I'm doing a style of play story and how it's changed. You were in
college for many years and then went to the NBA. When you came back into the
college game at Air Force, what kind of things had changed as far as the way
people played the game?  
COACH BZDELIK: This is just my observation. I think the game is -- you're
looking more to a game where it's more of a drive and kick game. There aren't
that many great big men out there that are skilled. So I think teams are
actually playing for the most part smaller.  
You know, it's such a drive and kick game. People just put their head down and
drive, and I think people look to have the court spaced. That's just my
observation.  
I think that -- has it changed much? I don't know. I think everybody has their
own unique style. I'm not really answering your question. I just know that, I
think, as a coach, I feel more comfortable when I have as many skilled guys
out there as possible that can make shots and not clog up the lane.  
You know, you talk about the so-called Princeton offense, I think that's a bad
name for it. I think it's just good basketball, just team play and passing the
ball to one another and cutting hard and cutting for each other. I think
that's just the way that, I think personally, the game should be played, and
it's the way the game should be watched, to be honest with you.  
  
Q. Jeff, I'm not going to try and pronounce his name, but how does Marcus
look? The kid from Indian Hills. Do you think he's going to be a
contributor?  
COACH BZDELIK: Yes, well, he needs to be a contributor. And what helps us with
Marcus is that Marcus is about 6'7". He's very versatile. He can play all four
positions on the court, one through four. He adds great experience to our
team.  
You know, when he left high school, he went to a prep school, and then he went
to play for Coach Majerus at St. Louis, and then he went to play for Indian
Hills, and they were rated number two in the nation, and he played an awful
lot for them.  
So he brings added experience to a team that still only has one senior on it.
He fits into our offense because he's a tough person to match up with because
he can make threes. He can drive it. He can post. He's a willing passer. He's
very strong.  
We'll play him a lot as really like a point forward to handle the basketball.  
He's mature in the fact that he's all about winning. So he was a player that
was recruited by a lot of other BCS schools that we were able to get. One of
the rare junior college players that we could get because he is such a good
student.  
And so going back to my original statement about us not being deep enough,
mature enough, and experienced enough, he adds depth, he adds maturity, and he
adds experience to a team that needs it.  
So we expect him to have a great year. You know, he's the type of player that
can immediately take the pressure off of Cory Higgins having to do so much for
us.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2009

  

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by coach Rick Barnes from Texas.  
Coach, welcome. Your thoughts about the upcoming season.  
COACH BARNES: I'm ready to take their questions.  
THE MODERATOR: Fair enough. Questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Justin may on. I know you have Dexter Pittman
and Damion James as your core seniors, but can you talk about what Justin
Mason brings to this program.  
COACH BARNES: It is the first time in I don't know how long we've really had a
senior class. We've had seniors, but you mentioned those three guys along with
Matt Hill, who's actually a redshirt, but would be in that class.  
Justin Mason works as hard as any player we've ever had. Last year he really
struggled. He really had a tough time shooting the basketball, and I thought
that really hurt him in a lot of ways.  
I can't even begin to tell you how hard he's continued to work. But the things
that he's done this year, really, mentoring a guy like Avery Bradley, Jordan
Hamilton, that potentially could take minutes away from him, he is the
ultimate team player. He really is all about winning.  
He's a guy that he's going to find his minutes. Someway, somehow, he will be
on the floor. Maybe not as much as he has in the past because we've got more
depth than we've ever had, and he won't need to play that many minutes. But he
continues to improve.  
The one thing you know about him every single day, practice, games, whatever,
he's going to give you everything he's got.  
  
Q. Rick, has anyone done anything pro or con to help you whittle down that
4-player rotation?  
COACH BARNES: Really, up to this point, every day it seems like somebody else
does something -- and I've said this before. If they do what they're supposed
to do, if we have to play 14 guys, we'll play 14 guys.  
But every day somebody gives you something that you say he can really help us.
There's no doubt we're going to be shuffling people in and out of games
because we really do want to maintain an attitude of where we're going to
attack both offensively and defensively. We're going to extend our defense and
do some of that.  
We want to play quick on the offensive end, and we do want to make
conditioning a factor. So we're going to use our bench. But every day there's
somebody.  
You might think this person might not play that much, but over the last week,
everyone's shown that they can help us.  
  
Q. I've heard Avery Bradley is kind of quick. Who does he remind you of in
that regard, and what do you anticipate from him this year?  
COACH BARNES: Well, he is quick. He's extremely quick. He can close -- you
know, if you looked at our guard core really with Avery and Varez Ward and
Justin Mason and Dogus Balbay, really, if you put them in our football locker
room, you would think they'd be defensive backs. They're extremely strong.
They're built. They're quick.  
They really can -- if they make a mistake, they all have the ability to close
up and get back in the play.  
Avery, what he loves to do as much as any player that I've been around in a
long time, he loves to get into the offensive player and belly up to him, try
to get him to play with his back to the basket.  
He'll have to go through some periods where he'll probably have to deal with
getting fouled. You know, he just plays. He just goes at it.  
But he is extremely quick, very explosive. He just gets there.  
And he's continuing to learn every day. He's a player that, I think, he has
tried to fit in way too hard. Where he has such great respect for our seniors
and Justin and those guys that he has really let those guys teach him. But
there's going to come a point to where he's going to have to let it go and be
who he is.  
He'll find it. There's no doubt about it. He's one of those players that in
the last week out of nowhere he'll kind of do something, and you'll kind of go
like wow. He never gets tired. He just keeps going and going and going.  
But he will -- there's no doubt, he'll continue to improve every day.  
  
Q. Rick, talking about Avery as well, we've heard a lot about the fact that
he's a pretty good defensive player, which is unusual for someone as young.
How good is he for this stage of his development?  
COACH BARNES: Well, he's really good on the ball. I was talking to him, and we
had a film session yesterday, and where he's going to have to -- and his idea
sometime is just to attack and just like go at it.  
And he's going to probably get a little defensive discipline, where he doesn't
just take off and go try to do something on his own and maybe give up a three-
point shot, something like that.  
But he has to continue to work on his closeouts. Once he gets there, he can
really guard you. But he has to make sure he gets it under control and
contains it. Then he can climb into people.  
He's such a -- I mean, he really wants to be coached, almost to a fault. I
mean, every play. He'll look around and say, Coach, did I do that right? Am I
doing it right? He's always wanting it done right.  
But, obviously, you'd rather have that than the other way.  
  
Q. Rick, seems like every year we talk about Dexter Pittman and his weight,
his potential. Just what is it -- how important is his consistency to your
program?  
COACH BARNES: You know, Dexter, in all three years so far, he's had a great
third of the year, and it's always been the last third of the year. And I've
wondered and asked myself that question over and over. Why is it at the end he
seems to come on really, really, really strong.  
I don't know if it's because early in the year, you know, we obviously work
extremely hard in our preseason, and Dexter never misses practice. He's never
been a player that takes himself out of drills. He's going to really work at
it. Obviously, he over the years has continued to try to lose weight and get
his weight down. By doing that, sometimes you don't realize from a nutritional
standpoint, trying to lose weight, going through a 2 1/2, 3-hour practice, how
grueling it is on him.  
Once we start getting into the season, practice is cut back, I think he gets
better and his stamina is better. He is right now in the best shape -- I don't
know if you've seen him, but when he walks in, he's a different looking guy.
He's got his weight down even more so than a year ago. He's running the floor
really well.  
He got sick a couple weeks ago and lost -- got down to really under 290 for
the first time. I said, maybe you should stay sick all the time. But actually
the other day after practice he got on the scales while he was wet, and he
weighed 281. That's really over 100 some pounds since he's been at Texas that
he's lost.  
And we talk about the weight, but that's not really a factor anymore because
he's -- people, I think, will find out this year really the skill level that
he has. I mean, he's a guy that can do some things, catches everything. And
he'll be -- and a guy that we really need to be the team that we want to be is
a guy that probably needs to be on the floor 26 minutes a night for us.  
  
Q. Following up on that, Rick, is it something of a luxury in college
basketball these days to have a true post like Dexter and especially one as
experienced as he is?  
COACH BARNES: I do think you've got to have that. We've got Dexter, and I
think a year ago, losing Alexis Wangmene hurt us.  
Alexis gives us another presence. He's got a 7'5" wingspan, and he and Dexter
go at it every day. We had a good day the other day where those guys were
blocking shots. Dexter has started to improve, where he's really started to
make an impact on the defensive end. He blocked two or three shots the other
day, Alexis did. When you have two or three guys that can do that, it does
give you something that you can deal with.  
Dexter is a guy where, if we can give him the ball where he needs it, we don't
think anyone can keep him from scoring. He's such a strong force down there.  
Like we said to him, a big man, you've got to do more than just score. You've
got to rebound it and defend your position. Got to be able to guard on the
perimeter because people are going to definitely look and say, let's get him
away from the basket and get him into pick-and-roll situations. He's done all
that. He's improved in every area.  
I do think in today's game, if you've got something like that -- and not a lot
of people have it. But what helps us with our team this year, people want to
play differently, five guys out, we can play that way too, with Damion and
Gary Johnson, who often play together there. We were even playing Jordan
Hamilton and Shawn Williams in those positions. We need to just spread out and
play, we can do that.  
  
Q. I was wondering, since you got into the league, how have you seen general
coaching styles change comparing now to then?  
COACH BARNES: Well, it's definitely changed. I think each person that comes
into the league brings their own style and what they want to do and how they
want to play.  
You know, I've seen some good coaches in this league that have come and gone
and were, I think, excellent coaches. For whatever reason, things didn't work
out exactly the way they could have or should have.  
Overall, this league, I think we've proven as a league that we've been able to
attract some of the best players in the country.  
The league has improved in a lot of ways. When I look at -- I mean, I could
sit here and talk about the officiating from where it started 12 years ago to
where it is today, it's night and day. It's going to really continue to get
better.  
You know, I think the way, really, the league has -- what they've done to
continue to support basketball has really been impressive with, you know, once
John Underwood came on board, a lot of things changed.  
I think Dan Beebe is doing a great job and understands it. You can feel that
he understands what we're going through as coaches and what we're trying to do
to continue to build that part of it.  
Our league is always going to be able to attract high-level coaches because of
being a league that has the exposure that we have. Coaches come in. Really,
there's some great coaches in this league right now, great coaches.  
And you know that your team's got to be ready to play, or you'll get beat.  
  
Q. Talking about your point guards, what do you expect from J'Covan Brown as
far as where he fits in? How has he looked after sitting out a few years?  
COACH BARNES: Well, extremely talented. Great court vision. Great feel for the
game. Plays the point guard position the way I think most coaches would like a
guy to play the point guard position. He's thinking pass first, set his team
up.  
What makes a great point guard is a guy that makes it easy for everybody else,
or makes it easier for everybody else. He has a way of doing that. How quickly
he's able to show that will be strictly dependent on how quickly he can get
himself in the kind of condition that he needs to be in.  
He wasn't really with us all summer. And so when he got on campus -- and he is
behind from that standpoint. But every day he gets better and better. He's one
of those guys that you can tell that he loves to compete. And what's helped
him now is right now every day he's being guarded by Dogus Balbay, Varez Ward,
and he can really guard you. He's never had anybody belly up to him, get into
him, so that's really going to help him. That in itself is going to bring him
along quicker than anything else.  
But once he figures it out, he's going to be a real weapon for us.  
  
Q. Rick, I know Kevin Durant has helped you guys attract more talent since
he left, but do you have any way of knowing if it's helping the league in
general? Some people have asserted that.  
COACH BARNES: I think it helps not only Kevin, but I think you look at all the
players that come through here. Obviously, the more that those guys continue
to go into the next level and perform at a high level, you know, kids are
current. They keep up with what's going on right now.  
You know, hopefully, from our standpoint, with the players that we have --
Kevin, LaMarcus Aldridge, Daniel Gibson, T.J. Ford, those guys, the more
visibility they have, people know who we are, there's no doubt about that.
There's no doubt what we've done coming through this program and this league.
I think the same can be said with a Michael Beasley, a Blake Griffin, you
know, those guys, yeah.  
I mean, our league -- you know, years ago people used to say -- or ask the
question, is our league ever going to be considered one of the best leagues in
the country, or it can't be until you win the national championship.
Obviously, Kansas doing that, I don't know what other questions people can ask
about our league. If we're not the best league in the country, we've got to be
in that discussion every year.  
You go back and look at the success year in and year out, I think also in the
tournament, obviously in the recruiting, where there's a lot of games won
during those months.  
But there's no doubt that from a Texas standpoint, that those guys that you
mentioned, Kevin, and I mentioned are guys that really continue to help our
program.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2009

  

### [Mike Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15828)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Mike Anderson from Missouri.  
Coach, welcome. Your thoughts about the upcoming season.  
COACH ANDERSON: I'm excited about Tiger basketball. I think what took place
last year, the thing I really emphasized with our guys was to take that
feeling of what took place.  
Not only that, all the hard work, the sweat, the tears, getting up at 6:00 in
the morning and bring that into this year.  
Obviously, we're going to be -- it's a different team. There's no question
about it. There's a question mark. We lost some quality players when you talk
about DeMarre Carroll, Leo Lyons, Matt Lawrence, and my son Mike Anderson, Jr.  
But at the same time, I think this will be a new team that's got to find its
own identity. With that being said, I think the brand won't change. It still
is going to be the fastest 40 minutes in basketball, up-tempo, pressure.
Hopefully, one of the top assist teams in the country. Assist-to-turnover
ratio team. One of the more exciting teams.  
If there's a word I heard more this year, this summer about our basketball
team is that they were fun, they were exciting to watch. Not only that, we had
some winning basketball that took place.  
So I'm excited as we started practice. We've already had nine workouts since
Friday. So you can imagine our guys are working and trying to get better. I
think that's the key. Try to get better each and every day.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. We'll take our first question.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Mike Dixon and what he brings to your team's
practice this year as a freshman.  
COACH ANDERSON: I'll tell you what, Mike is one of those explosive little
quick guards. He's got an old-school game, and he's got a new-school game.
That means he's got that in between game.  
He has a toughness that I like about him. I thought he was one of the better
guards in the country, especially to play the way we want to play.  
There's that learning curve, but I think each and every day he's getting
better. Why? Because he's getting an opportunity to go against guys like J.T.
Tiller, who's one of the better defenders in the country. Zaire Taylor, Kimmy
English, Marcus Denmon. And not only that, he gets a chance to play with those
guys.  
So he's being exposed to the ways of the fastest 40 minutes in basketball. And
especially playing defensively how we want to play. But I'm excited about
Mike. He's got a great first step. I mean, just quick. And he's not an
unselfish player. So I think he's kind of finding his way.  
  
Q. Mike, what does it say about J.T. Tiller that he's on the Wooden list?
But you look at his scoring average, and you immediately go, what's he doing
here?  
COACH ANDERSON: I'll tell you what, J.T.'s a special player. I think if you
watched our basketball team play last year, I thought he was the heart and
soul of our basketball team at the guard position.  
A lot of time, as J.T. went, our team went.  
I thought DeMarre was the heart and soul of our team at the forward position.
So we had two of those kind of players on our basketball team.  
There's a reason why we won 31 games. So now coming into this year, I think
he's going to be the heart and soul of our team.  
But I'll tell you what, it just tells you the guy's a winner. He's just a
winner. What does he bring to our team? He brings a toughness, an
unselfishness, winning attitude.  
Last year I made the statement in a press conference, you know, talk about the
five stars, the four stars, the two stars and all that -- you can't put a star
on a guy's heart like that. You saw what he did this past year. I think he's
going to be even better this year. I really do.  
I think he's had an opportunity to have surgery on his wrist. He's worked
extremely hard. He's one of those power guards that played to win. I'm glad
he's on our team.  
  
Q. Mike, about Zaire Taylor. I think he's fond of saying if his job status
ever hits a low point that he can come back to Missouri and get a job because
he beat Kansas. Has he become something of a -- maybe the number two heart
right behind J.T.?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think he's one of those captains that we have on our
basketball team. I think he's settled down, and I think he's going to take on
a bigger role, as well as J.T.  
When you look at those guys, I call them the T&T boys, the T&T guys, Taylor
and Tiller. I'll tell you what, I think it's one of the more underrated guard
tandem in the country.  
There's a reason why we won 31 games. I mean, you don't -- I think you have to
take a look back. We led the nation in assists. We led the nation in assist-
to-turnover ratio. This is a team that was number five in the country in
scoring, playing up-tempo. I think you got good guard play when that takes
place.  
I think people fail to recognize that. Sometimes people look at the scoring,
and no question about it, I think they've got to be able to score more this
year. Hopefully, they'll continue to do the things they did for our basketball
team last year.  
I think the brand will continue. But I think this Zaire will be one of those
guys that you talk about. He's more subtle in his role as he was last year.  
I thought leadership was important with our basketball team and ownership. So
this is their team. J.T., Zaire, and Keith and Justin Safford.  
  
Q. Coach, your team last year, one of the challenges might have been finding
the go-to guy on offense. You can just put the ball on the floor and score.
DeMarre might have been closest to that. This year I know you expected more
from Zaire and J.T. offensively. But do you think Kimmy can develop into a guy
that can put the ball on the floor more and be part of that go-to scoring
option?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think, as this team continues to develop its identity,
that's going to be apparent, a guy such as Kimmy. He has a knack for scoring
or getting to the line. Or even a guy like J.T. Tiller.  
You've seen those guys in crucial situations make plays. I think, for some
team, they may have just one go-to guy. We may have about three or four. Which
is better?  
Because as an opposing coach, who are you going to key in on? But I think
you've got to have somebody that's going to bring it and can get it for you
each and every night.  
But I think even with our team last year, you saw Zaire make big shots for us,
J.T. make big shots for us. I think you see other guys do it this year. I
think we're a team that's going to be unpredictable.  
I think, as you sit here and say, will Kimmy be that guy? It can be Marcus
Denmon. Laurence Bowers. I think each game will dictate that.  
I think we've got some guys that can. It's going to be by committee early on.
I think it kind of works its way out.  
  
Q. Coach, do you think your former boss, Nolan Richardson, will be energized
by his new job with the WNBA team in Tulsa?  
COACH ANDERSON: Where did that come from? You know, I think he is. I talk to
him probably every day, every other day. He's kind of intrigued. You've got to
look at coach's past, his history. The guy's done everything else. I mean, you
think about it. He won a junior college championship. I had an opportunity to
play against his team in the junior college championship game.  
He won the NIT championship at Tulsa. He won the NCAA tournament at Arkansas.
And now he has a WNBA job.  
You know what's going to happen next? He going to win a WNBA championship.
Trust me, he will.  
But I think he's intrigued by it. He's excited to have an opportunity because,
again, there are always going to be the naysayers that he can't do this here.
He's been told that all his life.  
So I think he's out to prove something again. I'm happy for him and excited
for him.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, best of luck and have a great season. We appreciate it.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2009

  

### [Connie Yori](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13896)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by Coach Yori from Nebraska.  
Coach, welcome. Your opening comments, if you would, please.  
COACH YORI: I was sitting back there waiting for about 15 minutes. Blair must
have been in front of me, huh?  
I've heard this a little bit today, that some folks are saying we're a
sleeper. In the race. We were definitely a sleeper last year, at least we put
our fans to sleep with how bad we were on offense. So hopefully we'll be able
to turn the corner a little bit in that area.  
I'm really, really excited about our team. I think everybody comes up here and
makes that statement. I think -- I went home last night, and my husband of 14
years -- and we've been together for 16 years -- asked me, Hey, how did
practice go? I said, It went great. We've had now six practices, and every
night I've gone home, and every night my husband's asked me that, and every
night I've said, It's gone great.  
He said, what is wrong with you? You are never this positive. And I said,
well, you know, honey, I'm a realist. I'm not an optimist. I'm not a
pessimist, but I'm a realist. I'm real excited about our team.  
I think we have some things in place that we haven't always had. Like
everybody, you've got to get healthy and stay healthy. But we have a lot of
the components there that we could have a great season. We've got great
leadership, got 16 years in our program, and in each case they've all been
four-year players for us.  
Kelsey Griffin, actually, this is her fifth year in our program. So that in
itself is positive.  
We have enough talent. Are we the most talented team in the league? No. But we
have enough talent. We have a lot of really hard workers in our program.  
I think our players have really held themselves accountable for -- since the
end of last season to push forward and get a lot of things done in the off
season, so that's great. We've got great character in our program.  
And on top of it, we've got great experience and depth. A lot of positives.
You know, I could find a couple negatives, but I'm trying to stay as a realist
right now.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach. We'll take questions from the floor.  
  
Q. How's Griffin look now that she's back in the swing of things?  
COACH YORI: How you doing, Dan?  
  
Q. Life's a 10.  
COACH YORI: I knew you'd say that.  
First of all, Kelsey, of course, has been a two-time All-Big 12 player for us.
Sat out last year with an injury. Had two ankle surgeries in about a ten-month
span. Went 13 months without playing basketball.  
About a month ago, she was cleared to go full go. It's amazing where she is
right now. It's a great credit to her how hard she's worked in rehab, in how
hard she's worked in the conditioning phase of where she needed to be.  
Whether it be on the bike or whether it be on the treadmill or in the water,
she really worked to stay in great shape, and she is -- I think this is the
best shape she's ever been in. You know, the fact that she hasn't played for
so long says a lot about who she is.  
But she -- it's great to have her back, obviously. She's playing at a level
right now that I haven't seen, and yet she was one of the best players in our
league two years ago.  
  
Q. It always struck me she had real sneaky athleticism, if that's one of
those terms. Is she still as athletic, or is it part of it just that she's
such a smart, experienced player?  
COACH YORI: No. Kelsey's a good athlete. I mean, she can get up, and she loves
to scare me to death after practice and start hanging on the rim. It's like
quit doing that, you know. We don't need another injury.  
But she's a better athlete than you might think. She moves -- obviously, she
can run the floor as well as, you know, really any post player in our league.
But on top of it, she's improved her lateral quickness. She jumps really well,
but she's also very strong. All the things that you're looking in a good
athlete, Kelsey is.  
PETER IRWIN: Another question on the front left.  
  
Q. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your guard play. It seems
like you've got a lot of options. How do you see that playing out?  
COACH YORI: Well, we're really deep, and that's exciting. We have some -- we
haven't been as good a shooting team the past couple years as we would like.
That's something we hope that we corrected in the off-season.  
I feel like we had a lot of players that spent a lot of time in the gym. We
have a little 10,000 make club in the off-season, and we had more players
involved in making those shots than we ever had. So credit to them. We're
making more shots at practice than I've seen.  
With our post-game, and we haven't even talked about core yet. But we've got a
really good post-game. Teams are going to try to take away our post-game.
Well, we've got to have players who make shots, and we've got a lot of options
there.  
You notice I haven't even mentioned one name because our depth is really
strong at that position, at those positions.  
  
Q. You mentioned -- you've got a lot of people back from last year. Do you
see the caliber of play, has that taken a step up from the things you said at
the start that you didn't like?  
COACH YORI: Well, I've been coaching -- I've been a head coach for 20 years.
The teams that I have coached over the years that have played really good
basketball are the teams that early in the season I've seen them be a little
bit ahead of where you would hope they would be.  
So right now we're playing a little bit ahead of the game, which is obviously
encouraging. I think that comes with just having a lot of seniors and a lot of
juniors that have played.  
So we go to practice, and we're doing a drill. We've got 20 minutes up on the
clock to do the drill. At the 20-minute mark, we feel like we've accomplished
something. That doesn't always happen.  
Every year you might have a team that you put up 20, and it takes you 40 to
get something done. So that's a highly encouraging as to where we are right
now.  
  
Q. You mentioned that over there you heard a lot of people saying that you
might be a sleeper this year, kind of look at you that way. Do you see
yourself, this team as maybe something -- a team that can sleep on some people
and sneak up on them and surprise them in the end?  
COACH YORI: Well, like I said, we have a lot of the pieces in place that you
need to make a push for a conference championship. And I've never even used
those words in this setting. And yet at the same time, I think we do have the
pieces in place that we can push for, whether it be at least a top four seed
and hopefully better.  
As we get to -- when we come back to Kansas City, we hope that we can return
as a top four seed. I think that's realistic.  
  
Q. Connie, you said you hadn't gotten a chance to talk about Cory, but I've
seen some of the things you said about her improvement, even over last year's
season. Can you tell us what you -- excuse me -- what we can expect from Cory
this year.  
COACH YORI: Well, Cory is the most underrated player in our league. You look
at the numbers that she put up last year. We weren't a very good offensive
team. Everybody tried to take Cory away, and yet she averaged about 20 points,
and I believe close to 9 rebounds in the second half of the Big 12 season.  
Once she got healthy. She too played with injuries. She dealt with a back
injury and shin injuries last year, and when she got healthy, she played great
basketball for us.  
And even before then, she was playing good basketball for us.  
She was, I think -- I think she finished the season as the eighth leading
scorer in our league and the eighth leading rebounder in our league. And she
was named Honorable Mention All-Conference. We felt like she had a better year
than that. Again, a player that just doesn't get a lot of attention but puts
up big numbers.  
PETER IRWIN: Coach, thank you very much for your answers. Best of luck to you
and the team.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2009

  

### [Cindy Stein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14283)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: Okay. As we go back to the stage area, Coach Cindy Stein from
Missouri has joined us. Coach, your thoughts about the upcoming season and any
other comments you might have.  
COACH STEIN: Well, I could take it out of Coach Mulkey's book and say "none,"
but it gets a little tough when she's voted number one and doesn't say
anything. I'm not sure I should say anything at all.  
But I'm extremely excited. I think that you see all the coaches in our league
extremely excited about the year. I think we have great reason to be. And us
for sure, we feel like we have something to prove.  
We have great players that are working hard. We believe in what they're doing.
And people want to know why we think we're going to have a successful year. I
think the biggest ingredients are we have the will to win. We have the work
ethic to win. And our hearts are bigger than they've ever been. And especially
very united.  
So we are going to prove everybody wrong.  
PETER IRWIN: That sounds good. We'll start with that. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. You talked about proving everybody wrong. How do you change the mentality
from being a team that's picked 12th in the preseason to a team that really
believes that it can win.  
COACH STEIN: Honestly, we were very surprised where we were picked because we
expected more. So, obviously, we did take that as an extreme insult.  
But at the same time, we also understand that we've got to do something about
it. And how do you change that? Well, your players change that. And our
players have already done that. That started as soon as our season was over
last year.  
Our team came together at that point and made an emphasis on making their own
changes. Each of them individually and then obviously all of us collectively.  
And that's how you do it. And like I said, we always had an understanding of
what it took. I can't say our will was always there or our work ethic was
always there, and our hearts were sometimes there.  
I thought last year we learned a lot and we were constantly learning. I think
that we've gone to a group like that to where now we're just playing. They
know what to do.  
The only people we've got to teach anything is to the two freshmen. And beyond
that, we're just enhancing the things they already know.  
  
Q. Jessra talked a little about the hard time she got for Jessra's Jungle
and everything, but how much is she going to really mean to this team?
Obviously, she's gotten the crowd into it a little bit.  
COACH STEIN: Sure. Jessra brings a lot to our team, just on and off the court.
She's hilarious. I think you probably picked that up. But she's also very
talented.  
Last couple of years she's been our second leading scorer. She's been our
leading rebounder. She's led our team in blocked shots. She's a huge impact.
She's very tough to defend. She's very versatile. She's improved her game.  
I think that those things lead her to, you know, have a lot of confidence in
what she's capable of doing.  
But I would also tell you, I don't think that you can take away from Shakara
Jones because that's someone that's started since her freshman year and just
gets better and better. And RaeShara Brown, who led the Big 12 in steals this
year as a sophomore. I think that's a pretty tough thing to do.  
I thought we were pretty good defensively last year, and we're much better
now. I think that all of those things complement each other in making this a
really good year.  
  
Q. Wonder if you could sort of expand on that. I thought a lot of your
players by the end of last year, including Christine, you could really see the
improvement coming. Is that carried over with some of your younger players,
too, this season?  
COACH STEIN: Absolutely. This group -- and I've talked about this a little bit
on -- usually you pick captains to help lead your team in the right direction.
We're in a position where we can't pick captains because they're all doing
what they're supposed to be doing.  
It doesn't mean you have too many chefs in the kitchen; it just means that
you've got kids that every single one of them are especially stepping up in
their own way. They know how to talk to each other. They know how to motivate
one another. Basically, we've got to pick captains for obviously the games,
but they actually don't want captains because they want all of them involved
in the entire process. And I think that's one of the greatest things about
this group is they're so committed to each other.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about defying expectations. How difficult is it to
break into that upper echelon of the Big 12?  
COACH STEIN: Well, you know, obviously, our conference is extremely strong,
and when you talk about that top echelon, you're talking about the top 1
percent in the country.  
I think that's always tough. But I don't think it's undoable. I think the key
in our league is who's going to play the best the most consistent throughout
the year, preseason -- or preconference to conference. And let the chips fall
where they may.  
And I think that, especially this year, I see a lot of movement throughout the
league on everybody. And Kansas being one of them. Nebraska being another one.
I think that you just have some tough teams that, you know, I'm not sure that
you can just say we have a top echelon.  
PETER IRWIN: Somebody always asks about your freshmen. Tell us about your
freshmen.  
COACH STEIN: We have two freshmen. One of them is from Kansas City. Trenee
Thornton, point guard. Very talented player. Very good shooter, defender. Just
still learning some things, but going to be a very good player for us down the
road.  
And then we had Sydney Crafton, a player out of Jeff City, high school out of
Missouri. And, another, she doesn't even know what she's doing right now, and
she's scoring. You know, she's getting deflections and doing a lot of little
things, and she has no idea where she even is on the floor. She's going to be
an incredible talent for us.  
  
Q. What about Bekah? I know she was somebody you, you know, were really high
on and then got injured, was able to come back. How much do you think she's
going to be improved this year?  
COACH STEIN: Well, Bekah's been out of practice a little bit. She has
reinjured her knee. We're still waiting word on what that means. But, you
know, Bekah's always so steady for us.  
With that being said, I would say Toy Richbow, I think, is going to surprise
everybody because she's always been a great defender. We can't stop her right
now offensively. She's pushing the ball off the floor and just taking it to
the basket. She's improved on her three-point shooting, where she's shooting
close to 65 percent in practice.  
And those are some of the things that, you know -- we've always liked the
scoring point guard. I think with Bekah's presence, she's made Toy a lot
better, and I think obviously that combination of the two are incredible.  
  
Q. I probably should have asked this before, but what's Bekah's situation
right now?  
COACH STEIN: Right now she's seeing a doctor tonight. So I won't know until
she sees the doctor tonight.  
  
Q. Did she suffer a serious injury in practice?  
COACH STEIN: She did reinjure her knee, so we're just waiting to see what
happens.  
PETER IRWIN: Coach, they let you off easy. Best of luck to you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2009

  

### [Deb Patterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14194)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by Deb Patterson from Kansas State.  
Coach, welcome, and your thoughts about the upcoming season.  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, we're looking forward to what will be kind of an
adventurous season for us. Going to be very young.  
With the exception of Ashley Sweat, who is a returning First Team All-Big 12
player, who we're extremely excited about the versatility and the talents that
she brings to the floor. And Kari Kincaid as our other experienced senior on
the floor.  
So it should be a fun year for us in terms of integrated in some youth. A new
look for Kansas State women's basketball. And, obviously, great challenges
ahead in what I think is the best league in America.  
PETER IRWIN: We'll go with questions from the floor for Coach.  
  
Q. I know you don't fill a hole like the one that Shalee Lehning left
behind, but how do you plan on, I guess, attacking that hole and trying to
cover it up?  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, we're looking to do it by committee, obviously. I think
you have an exceptional player like Lehning, and as you said, you don't
necessarily replace that. But we have Kelsey Hill returning as a sophomore,
who played very limited minutes, and then we have three freshmen players who
have come into the gym in Mariah White, Brittany Chambers, and Taelor Karr.  
And so I look at that position right now as one in transition. We'll evaluate
day to day what kind of impact we think that those four might be able to bring
to the challenge there at the point position.  
And I'm not above thinking that it won't be something that continues to evolve
even through the course of the season with all the youth and the inexperience
that we'll bring there.  
You know, there's a great advantage in having a 40-minute-per player, All-
America caliber point guard, and then there's also the challenge of replacing
her.  
So the young people we have in the gym right now are hungry. They're playing
hard. They're working hard. And we'll try to simplify the game a little bit
for them and see, as the season develops, who assumes the greater portion of
that responsibility.  
  
Q. Also, with the weapons that you lost, this is probably the lowest you've
been picked preseason-wise because of all the youth and the inexperience. Is
this a team, though, that could really surprise some people?  
COACH PATTERSON: I think it's a team that day by day we'll figure out honestly
what we're going to be.  
I look at the picks in this league, and relative to what we're bringing back,
I think, again, we're a very fair pick, if not an aggressive pick at eighth in
this league, to tell you the truth.  
At the same time, I know that we have players that are very aggressive and
hungry and will compete hard and well. It's just the league is extraordinary.
And for us, honestly, it's going to be a game by game in the nonconference and
then a game by game through the season to figure out what it is we're capable
of bringing.  
I don't necessarily bring an expectation at all of what when the season's
done, we will have been able to bring to the table. I think that's going to be
part of the challenge on the table for us is to establish an identity, to
figure out how our young players and our players without any significant game
experience are going to transition into Big 12 play and how they'll answer the
challenges on the road and at home.  
  
Q. Coach, with all of the rebounding you lost last year with Shalee and also
with Marlies Gipson, how are you going to try to replace that this year? Is
that something you'll have to work on throughout the year?  
COACH PATTERSON: It's something we've made a huge priority in these early days
of practice obviously. With both Marlies and Shalee, you're losing about 16
rebounds a game, and we've never been known as the great rebounding power in
our league as it is.  
So we understand that that's an area of the game, in terms of production, that
has to be answered. And in large respect, that's going to be a major factor in
our opportunity to win and be competitive in games.  
So it's going to be something that everyone needs to work to improve upon or
to bring great attention to.  
You know, the thing about rebounding, especially offensive rebounding, is my
thought is so much of that is instinctive and want-to, and it's a natural --
sort of an aggression and a mentality that you bring to going and getting the
ball.  
So we know we have that with those two. It's definitely a hard thing to
develop. I'm hoping we'll see as Branshea Brown and as Jalana Childs see their
minutes expand, I hope that we're able to get more interior rebounding than
we've had in the past. We've pretty much relied on Marlies to handle the load
there.  
So certainly that's where we would begin and try to start. But we also
understand we've got to have our perimeter players going to get the ball as
well, and that's something Shalee had a great knack for just instinctively.  
  
Q. You had probably as good a senior performances the last two years,
meaning Kim Dietz and then Shalee and Marlies. Do you expect the seniors you
have this year are going to be able to elevate their games the way those
players did as seniors?  
COACH PATTERSON: I think what's interesting about Dietz and Shalee is they
were surrounded by almost a core of fellow juniors or seniors that put them in
position to be very strong and to be productive.  
I think the challenge for Ashley and for Kari is that they'll be on the floor
with very young and inexperienced players. And so the game will be very unique
and distinct relative to what Dietz and Shalee and Marlies had the opportunity
to experience.  
So it's my hope that we'll be able to find production for them that is
consistent with what they've brought, you know, last year. And in Kari's case,
I hope can surpass her production.  
Ashley, I don't know that you can expect anybody in this league to score
better than 16 points per game. That's an awesome production.  
But it's going to, in many ways, dictate the level of success we have. How
strong are those two? What kind of numbers can they put up playing around
young players and having everybody's best defenders bring maximum attention to
them each night? That will be part of the challenge that they each face and I
think part of the transition that they go through through the course of this
season.  
  
Q. Just in talking about Shalee, did you get a chance to see her play this
summer, and were you surprised by the level of success she had in her rookie
season in the WNBA?  
COACH PATTERSON: I had the opportunity to see her play in person and obviously
a lot on the Internet. And, no, I wasn't surprised at all. I knew in my heart
and my mind and experience that she'd be a phenomenal next-level player.  
But my belief is that, as players transition to the WNBA, particularly players
like Shalee, what's critical is that you find the right fit and the right
opportunity, or you sometimes get lost. I think she had the advantage of
getting to a team that needed a player at the position she plays to assert
themselves. And the opportunities fell into place for her to do that.  
There was no surprise whatsoever for me, and I don't believe for the other
coaches in this league, that she transitioned well and had great deal of
success once she got there and had that window of opportunity.  
But, you know, there are a lot of great players that might not get that
opportunity at just the right moment, and she transitioned into a team that
had a need at the point position, and once that opportunity arose, she pretty
much assumed it full force and obviously did a great job.  
PETER IRWIN: Coach, best of luck to you in the season. Thank you very much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2009

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by Coach Mulkey from Baylor University.  
Coach, welcome. And your comments, and then we'll take questions.  
COACH MULKEY: I really don't have any. I'm ready for questions.  
PETER IRWIN: We'll take questions, then. That's easy enough.  
  
Q. Talk about the opportunity that you'll have this season to play Louisiana
Tech with Teresa Weatherspoon as the coach, and you have three former Tech
coaches in the building.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I'm excited that Teresa and her athletic director agreed
to play us. I tried very hard this year to play teams that were coached by
former Lady Techsters. We'll have one against Jennifer White at St. Edward's
team. Jennifer played with me at Louisiana Tech. Coach Barmore coached her.
And then Angela Lawson, Incarnate Word, we'll play them also. Teresa
Weatherspoon. At the time we scheduled the game, Tennessee Tech was coached by
Amy Brown.  
So I made a conscious effort to try to play as many schools to allow Coach
Barmore the opportunity to see his former players in action.  
  
Q. You lost four starters. Your top three scorers, your top two rebounders.
You're picked to win the conference. Were you surprised?  
COACH MULKEY: Yes.  
  
Q. Elaborate.  
COACH MULKEY: Elaborate? I don't know. You'd have to ask those coaches that
picked us. I wasn't allowed to vote for my own team, and I would imagine a lot
of that has to do with Brittney Griner, the number one recruiting class in the
country. We haven't accomplished anything.  
You lose 60 percent of your scoring, 50 percent-something of your rebounding.
There are teams returning in this league that have many starters, if not an
entire starting five back. I was very surprised.  
  
Q. I guess then tell us about these freshmen. You said you don't want to
have them rushed along before they've done anything, but what do you think
they can do this season?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I'm going to treat them as I do all freshmen. They're
going to have to take time to learn. They're very talented, but talent doesn't
win anything.  
I think it's going to take a long period of time for them to adjust to the
college game. Many years they have not ever had to do. They've never had to be
intense for long periods of time. Most of them have never had to play defense
in their life.  
So those are the types of things we're spending a lot of time doing right now.
And one day, when it all comes together and all of them are on the same page,
I think it can be a very special team.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Brittney
Griner. Not everyone's gotten a chance to see her. You start reading the
numbers, and 52 dunks or whatever it is, and you kind of just starting to
piece together how special of a player she is. How special of a player is
she?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I've been playing basketball a long time. I have coached
the last, gosh, I don't know, 20-something years, but I've played at the
highest level. I've played against 7'2" Russian. I've played against a 7-foot
Chinese girl. I've played with Americans that, you know, are 6'8", 6'9". I've
seen the dunks in collegiate basketball. I've seen them in international
basketball.  
I've never seen a girl that can effortlessly dunk it any way she wants, left-
handed, right-handed, two-hand jam. I think the only dunk I've not ever seen
her do is the windmill. But there's more to Brittney Griner than just dunking
the basketball. She understands there's so much more to basketball than
dunking.  
What she is learning is the intensity that she has to play with and practice
with every day. She's learning she's got to move her feet and guard people.
She is just someone that, you know, not many of us in our lifetime will ever
have the opportunity to watch or, I know, coach ever again.  
She's going to be a very good basketball player. Right now she's probably more
known for her dunks than anything. But when she's in the weight room for a
longer period of time and she's played at this level for a longer period of
time and had time to adjust, I think she's really going to be special.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your -- the returners who are going to be leading.
Kelli Griffin and Melissa Jones, and just how good a postseason they had last
year.  
COACH MULKEY: I think, when you talk about our returning players, there are
three that have -- that just stand out more so than anybody else on our team.
I think you start with Melissa Jones. She's our team captain this year.
Melissa had an outstanding sophomore year. She was Sixth Player in this
league. She's just a young lady that's very versatile. She plays the
perimeter.  
But when we were hit with injuries in the playoffs, I used her some in the
post. Tremendous rebounder for her size, just a competitor. Can hit the open
three. Probably could play any position on the floor if you needed her to.  
She practices so hard and just her leadership ability from the way she
practices is contagious.  
Kelli Griffin, I thought, when the season ended last year, was playing as good
a basketball as she's played since she's been at Baylor. She's also a junior,
and she is a young lady that can deliver the basketball to people when they're
open. She won several games for us at the end with shooting or making a layup
or just making the play that needed to be made.  
Morghan Medlock is our only senior, and she unfortunately has only been in our
program one year, came in and did a tremendous job off the bench. Could have
easily started for us, and she's playing extremely well in practices. She's a
post player that will give guidance to Griner and Mariah Chandler, the two
freshmen post players.  
  
Q. I guess, if you're saying you're surprised somewhat that you guys were
picked the favorite, would you like to say who you thought might be the
favorite for this season?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I think there are three teams that have returning players:
Kansas, Texas, and A&M. I think those three teams stand out to me with who
they have returning. So I would say those three.  
PETER IRWIN: Okay, Coach. Thank you very much. We appreciate it.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2009

  

### [Kathy McConnell-
Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14195)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: Coach, your comments, and then we'll take questions.  
COACH MCCONNELL-MILLER: Well, first of all, I am sitting here today feeling
very good about the past six months. It's probably been the most productive
six months or six months of an off-season that I've experienced in my head
coaching career.  
Last year clearly was a difficult finish for us in a conference that we all
know is the strongest conference in the country. However, these young ladies
have responded both on the floor and off the floor.  
The commitment to becoming physically better, mentally tougher, more skilled,
and more focused over the past six months has proven to be a result of, first
and foremost, a tough season. And the leadership of some women in our program
that have decided that this is the year that they were going to make a
difference.  
They spent the last six months in Boulder, summer school. We had two players
play internationally. They became more aware of what it takes to compete in
the Big 12. Their experience has shown these past three days in practice, four
days in practice, and right now, again, I just sit here feeling very good
about the young ladies that have come to Boulder to compete and make this
program a national program.  
I brought Brittany Spears with me today. Brittany is a player that two years
ago, I couldn't even hear her on the floor. The only way I knew she was on the
floor is if she scored or made a great stop. Right now she is one of the most
vocal players in our program. It goes to show what two years and what
experience and what the development of a player can do.  
Overall, we're a very different team as a result of our strength and
conditioning program. We have a new strength and conditioning coach. His name
is James Hardy. I think his overall focus was, of course, getting stronger, of
course being able to run faster, become more explosive. But to gain a mental
toughness about these players that, when the game's on the line or situations
arise, that they are able to fight through and become better in situations
that we've struggled in the past.  
Off the floor, academically, we have just shone in the classroom. We have
extremely bright young ladies that continue to grow on and off the floor.  
My experience this past two months, the month of September and October, has
been a very positive one in that recruiting was fairly -- or for the most part
finished, and I didn't have to spend too much time on the road. So I had the
opportunity to spend time with the players in all of the four-on-ones or the
team workout, we had every coaching staff present. It shows the commitment
level of our staff and the commitment level of these players that we are -- we
were not where we wanted to be, and we know where we want to be at this point.  
When you have the unity and the chemistry that this team has shown, that's the
reason I'm as excited as I am about this upcoming season. We've got a great
nonconference schedule. We've got Virginia coming in. We've got Seton Hall. Of
course we have our own holiday tournament. But we've got a very, very strong
nonconference schedule that we feel like will prepare us for the Big 12.  
Feel like the Big 12 is different this year than it's ever been. Just the
makeup of teams, the graduation of players and the addition of some great
players is very exciting. We need to be deep in this conference.  
Over the past four years at Colorado, we have been very front-court oriented,
and we've been dominated by bigs, and our point production has mostly come
from the interior.  
This team is very different. Whitney Houston has returned after her injury and
has come back with a sense of purpose and with the ability to lead this team
where it needs to be at the point guard position.  
We've got some incoming freshmen that we feel like can make an immediate
impact. Chucky Jeffery is just a phenomenal player out of the Springs that we
felt very fortunate to get, very highly recruited that we feel like will
definitely give us the ability to play a little bit more up-tempo and of
course give us some depth.  
Some things we've struggled with in the past has been depth. With the strength
in our backcourt right now, that's where the depth is coming from.  
A couple of returners, Julie Seabrook, and of course I mentioned Brittany
Spears, Bianca Smith, have come back more physically fit, ready to play, great
conditioned.  
And the chemistry between the newcomers, the newbies, as we call them, and our
returners, which we feel like is a very experienced group as far as point
production, minutes played, and being battle tested in the Big 12, feel like
it's great chemistry amongst the players, and of course with our staff.  
So it's an exciting time right now for Colorado basketball. We're ready to get
started.  
Last Friday could not have come soon enough. But after five days of practice,
it feels pretty good. It feels pretty good to be in my fifth season at a
university and an institution that I love and hope to continue to build with
players like Brittany Spears and Chucky Jeffery and Whitney Houston.  
So for our perception and the way we feel right now, our best basketball is
yet to come.  
PETER IRWIN: Okay, Coach. We'll take questions from the floor.  
  
Q. Can you talk about just, especially with your freshman class, the size
that you're bringing in, what that will contribute.  
COACH MCCONNELL-MILLER: Well, I think, if you look at our freshman class --
I'll start with the tallest, and that would be Melissa MacFarlane at 6'7". She
is very long. She's very good north to south. She's good around the rim. She
just gives us the interior presence that, if we need to be big, she takes up a
lot of space.  
She has improved considerably. She came to Boulder a week after her high
school graduation, spent the entire summer on campus trying to elevate her
game, and hopefully be able to contribute this year as a freshman.  
The twins out of Boulder, Brenna and Megan Malcolm-Peck are two that stand
about 6'2" and about 6'4", 6'5" in length. Extremely long and extremely
versatile. Megan is one that has just come in right away and shown that she is
ready to play at this level. She is a player that you will see play anywhere
from the two to the five spot, depending on our opponents and depending on the
tempo or what the situation calls for. But I would say describing Megan and
Brenna as extremely versatile.  
Kailah Bailey is one that we signed late. After last season, the rebounding
was something our staff identified as an immediate need for somebody to go to
the rebounds, go to the boards, get putbacks, defend on the interior, and her
athleticism and her energy and just her bounce and what she brings, we feel
like she can contribute this year as well.  
The most highly touted was probably Chucky Jeffery, and she, I would say,
rivals Brittany Spears when she was coming out of high school, as far as the
talent level. She's a player that probably has played against boys or guys in
her life more than she's competed against girls.  
She grew up in a neighborhood where she was consistently playing at the rec or
playing at the park. She can play anywhere from the point to the three, and at
this point proves to be probably one of our best defenders.  
But they do bring great size, and they bring a great deal to the table as far
as -- I was talking a little bit earlier. They're the types of players that
sometimes when you have returners and they make mistakes, they sort of dwell
on them or they feel -- they start to internalize things. Freshmen don't do
that. This class does not do that at all.  
They make mistakes. They don't even know they're making mistakes. They're
having fun out there. They just keep playing. And they bring such a youth and
energy about them that I think it's contagious because there are so many of
them. It's just added for great practices.  
  
Q. Kathy, talk about the mood in practices this year compared to last year
with everybody back.  
COACH MCCONNELL-MILLER: Well, I think -- I know we've talked about this a
great deal, but when we had finished in the Final Four, the WNIT in our third
year, and we were planning for our future, we were planning for the very next
year. We knew we were going to be without Jackie McFarland, but we did not
know that Aija Putnina would turn pro, we did not know that Whitney Houston
would tear her ACL.  
So we're coming into that season losing three starters. One of course we knew
about and had the opportunity to recruit and replace. Two we did not. So there
was a great concern about who was going to fill certain positions and voids
and where the rebounding was going to come from, who was going to be our point
guard.  
There were so many uncertainties that we were working through as a staff and
the players were working through additionally. This year we don't have a lot
of uncertainties.  
I think if you were to ask Brittany or some of the players who your point
guard is or who is your go-to player or what style of player are you going to
play, are people going to be able to press you, defensively what is your
philosophy, when you have a group that you've been working with and the
confidence is there, the ability is there, then you can continue to build on
that.  
So the moods is exceptional. They're the most competitive practices that we've
had. Even though we have players that have sort of set themselves into their
roles and their positions, it's fun. It's competitive.  
When I walk into practice and Brittany Spears is smiling and she's getting
steal after steal and she's scoring and she's talking to freshmen and putting
her arm around Chucky Jeffery trying to talk her through some things, and
Whitney Houston is high-fiving Melissa MacFarlane, there's such a positive
energy that makes you want to come to practice and do more.  
Additionally, there's players coming in watching film. There's players wanting
to get extra shooting. Those are things that we haven't had so much in the
past because there's been uncertainty.  
Right now there's just a great vibe in practice. And I have to thank my
players for the last six months and their commitment to our program and what
they continue to bring.  
PETER IRWIN: Coach, thank you very much for your answers and your comments.
Best of luck to you through the season.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Everybody, thank you for joining us for the afternoon
session of the student roundtable. My name is Debbie Antonelli. I'm one of the
analysts for Fox Sports Net on the Big 12 television package.  
What we're going to do is an attempt here to try to draw out some stories and
some off-the-court things about these young ladies to bring out their
personality. Anything that I will ask them will be a lot easier than anything
they're asked to do daily on the defensive end.  
Let's start with Melissa. And just say your name, where you're from, what year
you are, and what your degree is in.  
MELISSA JONES: My name is Melissa Jones. I'm from Thornton, Colorado. And I'm
majoring in speech communications.  
ERNESIA WILLIAMS: Earnesia Williams from Oklahoma. Texas. I graduated last
year with an education degree, and I'm trying to get kinesiology for grad
school.  
ANDREA RILEY: I'm Andrea Riley, and I'm from Dallas, Texas. I'm a senior, and
my major is physical education.  
KARI KINCAID: I'm Kari Kincaid, and I'm from Andover, Kansas, from K-State.
I'm a senior majoring in elementary education.  
JESSRA JOHNSON: I'm Jessra Johnson from Fayette, Missouri, and my degree is in
history.  
BRITTANY SPEARS: I'm Brittany Spears from Pasadena, California, and my degree
is in sociology.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Kari, we're going to start with you. You guys lost a lot
last year in Shalee and Marlies. How will you expect to replace some of that
this year?  
KARI KINCAID: Definitely not going to replace them. You can't replace Marlies
Gipson, Shalee Lehning and Danielle Zanotti. You definitely have to find new
ways to fill the shoes and the numbers they put up for four years straight.  
It's going to be something we're going to have to work on all season long.
It's not going to be one person. It's going to be a collection of the whole
team.  
It's just going to take a lot of accountability from each person to understand
what they brought to the game and what we lost last year. But it's something
that we worked on from day one, and we're still working on it.  
It's going to be a year long thing.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Ernie, you went through senior ceremony last year. Welcome
back. We're happy to have you back another year. We're not all surprised, but
we're happy you're back.  
Why were you able to come back? What was the decision that came through your
mind to play another year because you're a redshirt senior?  
ERNESIA WILLIAMS: All last year I knew I had another year. I played last year
like it was going to be my last one.  
I didn't make the decision until after the NCAA, the game, and, you know, I
didn't want to leave Texas on that kind of a note, you know, getting out in
the first NCAA round.  
I knew we were going to have a good team with our freshmen coming in this
year, and our sophomores have improved greatly. I just wanted to give it one
more go.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Brittany, Coach McConnell-Miller and I were talking about a
story about you about the Coors Event Center, where you guys play your home
basketball games, and your card allows to you get into the building at any
time. You've become sort of an electrical engineer and can turn the lights on.
You've had a hard time turning the lights off at night, so you're in there all
hours of the night.  
Do you think the electrical bill in the Coors Event Center has gone up because
you spent so much time in there shooting? And what are you working on when
you're in there?  
BRITTANY SPEARS: It probably has gone up, but that's not my problem. I was
working on shooting and ball handling and just trying to get better every day.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Do you think Coach McConnell-Miller will pick up the
electric bill?  
BRITTANY SPEARS: She got the money. She can pick it up.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: The other thing that coach McConnell-Miller told me is that
you own a little scooter. I don't know how you make it up and down the hills
there in Boulder, but she didn't find out about the scooter until how? How did
she find out you had a scooter? What event happened?  
BRITTANY SPEARS: I had it in the locker room, and we were at basketball camp
last summer. Her son Bryce came in and said, can I ride it? He started riding
around the gym, and she figured out I had it.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: It's one of those mini scooters. I don't know how you get
on.  
BRITTANY SPEARS: It's real little. If it's fully charged, it goes up the hill.
If not, you've got to scoot your foot to go up the hill.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Melissa, you've been known to take a dare. Keep this G-rated
if you can on any dares you've taken in the past. What is the most disgusting
or challenging dare you've ever taken and why?  
MELISSA JONES: Well, T and I, we went skydiving. That was kind of fun.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Whitney Hand went skydiving this spring.  
MELISSA JONES: I've eaten a live cricket once. That was kind of gross.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Why?  
MELISSA JONES: I don't know. My teammates call me a daredevil, I guess. It's
more fun, just kind of, we have challenges. It's weird.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Being a daredevil and being such a great rebounder that you
are, undersized on your side, what are the personality traits that carry over
there between eating a cricket, being a great rebounder, and being undersized?
There must be something inside you.  
MELISSA JONES: I just think -- I don't know. It's kind of like I haven't
really found something I'm too afraid of yet. I think it's kind of -- I think
that might relate a little bit.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: You're not scared of Coach Mulkey?  
MELISSA JONES: I do take that back. I am a little petrified of her.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: There's several of us that are. Sometimes we can be scared
too.  
Andrea, we know about your dad who's a body guard for Jerry Jones, the owner
of the Dallas Cowboys. You have developed some relationships and friendships
with some of the guys on the team. One in particular is Marion Barber. How
does he inspire you, and what kind of conversations do you guys have that help
you become a better basketball player?  
ANDREA RILEY: Well, Marion, he always wishes me good luck during the season.
And, you know, he always talks to me about like just staying determined and
keeping my head up and everything. I really look up to him because he never
backs down from anybody. I mean, they call him Marion the Barbarian or
something. Every third down they always give it to him.  
I think that relates to basketball like every time you go down, three seconds
left, you know, I want the ball to try to make something happen to like dish
it or even shoot from half-court or whatever.  
But I think that his determination really just has an impact on me.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Jessra, there's a thing in your arena called Jessra's
Jungle. What is that, and how did that come about?  
JESSRA JOHNSON: Just basically my mom and some of her friends got together and
decided it would be a great idea to make T-shirts and call themselves a
jungle. At first I didn't even know about it. I guess my teammates and the
coaches saw it before I did, and Coach Stein came in, and I got an earful
about it and made fun of for it.  
But, basically, just the fans from my hometown.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Do they paint their face and all that or put the T-shirts
on?  
JESSRA JOHNSON: My mom paints her chest sometimes.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Your mom must be -- she's pretty interesting. She's a
preacher, so she usually has a message to deliver. We know some of the
deliveries that Cindy serves out are preacher-like at times. Is there anything
that's similar between a message your mom may send and something that Coach
Stein may give you in practice?  
JESSRA JOHNSON: Well, similarities. Let's see, they yell a lot. To get their
message across. They both use the Lord's name in different ways. And they want
the best for me. So I guess that's similar.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: That's pretty good.  
Kari, Jordan Murphree from Texas Tech was here. She's involved in this program
as well, Locks of Love. You do the same thing. Why? And how does that make you
feel when you're able to help somebody that is in need?  
KARI KINCAID: I've actually done it twice since I've been at college. And I
really have always had long hair, and my mom never let me cut it, and I don't
know why.  
But once I got to college, I was like, yeah, I'm going to cut my hair. I just
saw -- I think it was on TLC or something. They were talking about Locks of
Love. I was like, that will be a way I can tell my mom a good reason to cut my
hair. So I did it.  
It was just a really cool thing. Ashley Sweat cut her hair for Locks of Love
after I did. And recently Shalee Lehning just cut her hair for Locks of Love.  
Then it's kind of trickled down on the team. My hair is short right now
because I just got it cut a couple months ago. It's just something that it's
just hair and it grows. I'm lucky to have it. I feel like might as well just
cut it and give it to someone who might not be able to have hair.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: You've got a lot of plans coming up. You're planning for a
wedding. You're planning for your career as an elementary school teacher. Tell
us about what you want to do as an elementary school teacher, and will there
be any coaching in that?  
KARI KINCAID: I won't graduate until next December. I'm very, very excited to
be in the classroom. Right now I'm in what's called my block. I'm in there
every week working with kids. I'm very, very excited about it. It's definitely
a passion of mine. I love being around little kids.  
I have nieces and nephews that are my pride and joy. So I'm very excited about
that.  
And the wedding, really haven't planned much. I'm not very good at it. But I'm
very excited about it. It's going to help transition from not playing
basketball because it's been like a slow four-year depression coming on
because like I just have so much fun playing basketball and being with my
teammates that I really can't think about not playing and not being here.  
It's definitely going to make the transition easier.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Isn't that what it's supposed to be, fun? Aren't you guys
having fun in practice so far?  
Andrea, nobody in the history of this league has ever led the league three
years in scoring, and you have a chance to do that. What did you do in the
off-season to prepare for that opportunity?  
We just heard Coach Budke say you're going to play off the ball a little bit.
How is that going to impact your ability to score?  
ANDREA RILEY: Like Jeff Parr is our manager, and he's one of the best managers
that you would ever, ever dream of having. And he really stretched the fact
that I had to get up and come shoot.  
He'll call on me. He'll wake me up when I want to sleep in because we're off.
He really stressed the fact and really motivated me to want to be determined
to get my shot better and show everybody that, you know, leaders have to be in
the gym in order to be better the next few seasons or anything.  
I think my teammates really looked up to me and told me, you know, wow, you're
in the gym. I want to do that. Because, you know, we have a lot of young
players.  
They really look up to me and just follow what I do.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Ernie, sometimes when you face adversity, you have a certain
awareness about it. You had a bad car accident right before the Big 12
tournament last year. Then when you came back and played in the tournament and
into the NCAA tournament, your numbers were better than they had ever been.
Why was that?  
ERNESIA WILLIAMS: I don't know. I had that accident actually the day before --
or the -- either the day before or that day that we were traveling to the Big
12 tournament.  
And I came out, blessed and lucky, with just a scratch on my hand. My car
hydroplaned down a hill, and it was wet --  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Were you wearing a seat belt?  
ERNESIA WILLIAMS: I was, yes.  
I ran into like a brick wall, and my car spun twice, and I landed upside down.
And these guys, I guess they must have saw everything from behind me because
right when I landed, I felt like they came to the door and got me out of there
like that, right there.  
But I don't know, I just felt like God gave me another chance. So I wasn't
hurt very bad at all. So I don't know, I just had the will to play and help my
team win that game.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: A renewed sense of focus maybe?  
ERNESIA WILLIAMS: Yes.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: How has that carry over to this year? There's expectations
for Texas. You've been picked very high in the polls. You've been picked
second in the league. How has that carried over for you being a leader on this
team?  
ERNESIA WILLIAMS: Just to help my team and be a role model to our
underclassmen and freshmen, and put everything out on the floor every time and
just try to be a good leader.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: One of the biggest stories nationally is Brittney Griner,
Melissa. It would be remiss for me not to ask you about playing with her, what
it's been like, what you would anticipate it being like. We all know she can
dunk, but what else can she do? Why is she going to make your team really good
this year?  
MELISSA JONES: Brittney Griner is very unique, not in the sense she can do 260
dunks or do some crazy things out there. She's also like a big teddy bear.
She's someone who always has a smile on her face and wants to talk with you
and have a nice little conversation with you. We love her. Love hanging out
with her.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: You took a trip to Kenya this year. It was not a basketball
related trip. What was the trip about, and what did you gain from that
experience?  
MELISSA JONES: There were 16 of us who went on a sports ministry team to
Kenya. Just gave us the opportunity to set up some sports clinics there and
just to play with kids that are there and just play some fun games and some
sports. Most importantly, we were able to spread God's word. So that was kind
of fun.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Brittany, I mean, Brittany Spears and Whitney Houston are
reconnected again. It's just kind of ironic that Whitney Houston is making a
comeback off her injury like the other Whitney Houston is making a comeback.  
You can't talk about sweet music or being in rhythm or anything. All those
cliches are going to apply this year when we're doing your games. But the one
thing I want to ask you about is the change in tempo this year. There's been a
lot of talk about the buffs speeding it up a bit. We heard Coach McConnell-
Miller talk about the conditioning program. What will be different about the
style of play for you guys this year, and is it different?  
BRITTANY SPEARS: Yeah, it's different. We've got a lot more guards this year
than we've ever had in previous years. The speed is going to be different
because it's guards. We're going to run up and down the floor more than we
ever have before.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Are you going to enjoy playing in that style of play? You
started your freshman year, you were quite a three-point shooter, but you've
added other things to your game as you've matured.  
BRITTANY SPEARS: I'm going to like playing it because it's guards and I'm a
guard. I would like it better than my freshman year probably because we had to
slow it down a little bit. But now we can run up and down and press and play
basketball.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: One last thing I want to ask you is about the Emergency
Family Assistance Association and the basketball clinics that you do for them.
What is that association about? What do you guys as a team benefit from giving
back to your community in Boulder?  
BRITTANY SPEARS: It's about like people who are less fortunate than others. So
I guess our team just helps out with like little -- give them canned goods and
stuff like that and just give them stuff to help them out. We have like little
benefit shows and stuff like that. We help out.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Okay. That's good. Everybody is involved in community
service on your own campuses, I know. Ladies, thank you for joining us up
here. The next is going to be sessions in the back. Thank you very much for
your time this afternoon. Wish you all the best of luck this season, and we'll
see you down the road.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2009

  

### [Bonnie Henrickson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13895)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We'd like to welcome Bonnie Henrickson from Kansas University.  
Bonnie, if you'd make a couple of opening comments, and we'll take questions.  
COACH HENRICKSON: Great to be here. We're excited to get started. Having a few
days under our belt, we're excited about our group and the growth -- potential
for our growth this year. But we're also excited about what should be a great
year in the Big 12. The quality of talent, the quality of coaches that year in
and year out is consistent. And we're thrilled to be a part of it.  
We've got a lot of work to do to be successful, but I like where we are right
now, and I really like my team.  
PETER IRWIN: Okay. We'll take questions from the floor.  
  
Q. It seems like after your postseason run last season in the WNIT, a lot's
expected of your team now this season. How do you feel your team will respond
to all that, now being one of the teams to beat maybe?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Our players are prepared. They've worked hard to get to this
point. Certainly, using last year's run at the end of the year to gain
confidence and gain experience.  
And the bar is high. It's higher. It should be high. Our players are excited
about that challenge. Year in and year out, it's a great league.  
That presents a steep challenge every year and will be no different this year.
But no one has higher expectations than I do.  
Our goal right now is pretty simple. Just try to get better every day. And
we'll have that opportunity this afternoon.  
If we can keep it that simple and grow as a group, we've got a chance, like
many teams in this league do, to have a great year.  
  
Q. Hi, Coach. Danielle McCray was obviously a huge part of your team last
year. I don't know if anybody has bigger expectations placed on them than her
this year as the player of the year preseason-wise. Just what is she going to
mean to your team again? You've got her one more year. Just how much is this
offense really going to kind of thrive and revolve around her?  
COACH HENRICKSON: I think certainly it will be important for Danielle to get
touches and get good looks and high percentage shots. Certainly, her
responsibility to take high percentage shots. But she's a very, very unselfish
player and trusts her teammates.  
I think our point guard play will be different. I think that will be good for
Danielle, as well as everyone else in our group as far as how I really believe
they'll be able to play in transition.  
I think we'll be able to get her more uncontested shots in transition and not
run so many sets, which is what we did quite a bit last year.  
And Sade Morris on the other wing makes Danielle a better player. Those two
being able to play off each other and being Batman and Robin, so to speak, and
two talented kids on the wing.  
Danielle's teammates' play and our improved play, the point guard position
will help her have a great year, and obviously the confidence she's gained
from the end of last year and this summer. And recognizing that her game has
grown, her attack mentality is as good as it's been. But she understands that
the quality of her teammates really will enhance her play throughout the
course of the year.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how different practice is with all this experience you
have.  
COACH HENRICKSON: The experience and then sheer numbers. We have 15 right now.
So it's very, very competitive. For the first time really in Sade and
Danielle's career, they guard each other a lot in practice. We haven't had
that much.  
We have some young, talented wings that can play with them and need to learn
how to play with them and get on the floor with them. Their competitiveness,
the number of opportunities they have has increased in practice.  
There's great energy. There's great accountability. Really, when you go back
to look at last year when we made the run, there was a lot of self-policing.
When you have a team that holds each other accountable, first and foremost,
themselves, and our seniors do and our leaders do, and they start to hold each
other accountable and they start to demand more, even before I can say, hey,
double back. That was terrible. Or take some ownership.  
We did that at the end of the year and really believe with a few other things
that was part of -- created the opportunity for us to be successful. We didn't
get to that probably until February.  
And we are at that right now to start. That has been, if you listen, if you
just sit and listen to practice, that's going on right now.  
Great teams hold each other accountable. The head coach -- it is my
responsibility, but when your leaders look left and right and demand more from
themselves and more from their teammates, it gives you a chance.  
  
Q. Bonnie, building your program didn't happen overnight. What was your
blueprint? What was your formula for getting to this point?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Get great players. I'm a better coach with talent, I promise
you.  
Develop the players in the program. We've done that. I think with Sade and
Danielle, the two kids that are here today, the growth from their freshman
year. And then recruiting. Recruiting a better athlete, a better basketball
player. And then putting all of that together.  
And believe that those two -- doing those two things, we've positioned ourself
to have a much, much better year in the league. And, again, which is the best
women's basketball conference in the country by far.  
  
Q. Good morning, Coach. About a year ago at this time, Angel blows her knee
out. Could you just talk about what she's gone through in the past year to get
to here now.  
COACH HENRICKSON: It is. It's been a lot for her, emotionally and physically.
I believe the emotional part has been more difficult and was more difficult
for her than the physical part.  
She was a rock star in her rehab. She's out of the brace. She was running,
sprinting, everything a little bit ahead of time. Not grossly ahead of time.
You know, we didn't want to rush her, realizing we had the rest of the year.  
But emotionally just, Will I still be good? Am I going to get hurt again? All
of those things that every player that's injured goes through.  
The physical part, she was fantastic. Our trainer, training staff did a great
job. She did a great job committing to that. She's really relied on her
teammates to be there for her.  
She would tell you, if you had a chance to talk to her and when you do, that
has made a difference for her. The support from her family, her coaches, and
her teammates to reassure her, you do what you're supposed to do and do what
the doctors and trainers tell you to do, you're going to be fine.  
Yesterday she was as aggressive as we've seen her, since we didn't get to
watch her very much last year because it happened so quick. As aggressive and
as confident as she has played -- because late night on Friday night, a little
passive, not very aggressive, didn't attack very much.  
But every practice since then, she's been the Angel that all of us saw over in
Tahlequah.  
  
Q. Hi, Coach. I looked at media day, and Krysten Boogaard is a lot bigger. A
lot of times last year, maybe she was being pushed around a little bit. She
started pushing around other people in practice?  
COACH HENRICKSON: She has. Actually, she tried to push me yesterday when I
tried to play dummy defense. Why I thought I would play dummy defense. I was
really good at it in college, but probably not something I should be doing
with her.  
I said to her, I wouldn't have felt like that; she kind of backed into me as I
was trying to show weak-side help. She's put on 16 pounds.  
It's good. She's running well. She's physical. She's attacking. She's playing
with more confidence. Her personality -- she's much more confident as a
person. She's done a great job.  
She's bought in to that will be a difference -- it really will make a
difference for her. Because she did. She is maybe a step slower, maybe, but,
boy, when she gets there, it looks good. I told her, Maybe you're there a
second later, but now you can finish and do something.  
Last year you got there faster, and everybody just shoved you around. That's a
credit to her. She made a commitment, as did all of our players, they were in
summer school both sessions and trained all summer together, every single one.  
And the new players, the two junior college kids and the freshman. We had them
on campus all summer. She made the most of her time in Lawrence over the
summer because she's gotten bigger and stronger.  
  
Q. Speak to the different style that you might play this year because of
more experience and whether or not things might change because of the players
you're going to be able to put on the floor this year.  
COACH HENRICKSON: I think what changes our -- what will look different in
reference to style will be our point guard play.  
Two kids, Angel Goodrich and Rhea Codio. She's a junior college transfer from
Manhattan College, by way of Manhattan, New York. Both are play making point
guards. For us to create more opportunities in transition, to score more in
transition, and not rely and put so much pressure on our half-court execution.  
And in transition, getting uncontested shots. And Krysten should get more
uncontested shots. All of the post players should as our point guards drive
and drop, drive and kick, or go to the rim and finish. And both kids are small
of stature but can find a way to score in the point and get underneath the big
kids and score. Both did that successfully yesterday.  
As far as style, we will still -- you know, as far as our player development,
how we run offense, we really set up things to get our kids in a position to
score and find out where they're most successful.  
But I think where it will look different in style will be our effectiveness in
transition, just being more opportunistic and being more aggressive.  
PETER IRWIN: Coach, thank you very much. And best of luck to you and your team
this season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2009

  

### [Gail Goestenkors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14259)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by Coach Gail Goestenkors from the University of
Texas.  
Coach, welcome.  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Thank you. Glad to be here.  
PETER IRWIN: Would you like to make some opening comments for us before we
take questions.  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Just real excited about -- it's hard to believe. The summer
goes so fast. I cannot believe we're starting another season, but I'm real
excited about this season, probably more so than any season since I've been at
Texas.  
I feel like -- I feel really good about my team. We have great chemistry.
We've only got ten players, but they get along so well, and they've worked so
hard. I feel like we have a great understanding now of what is expected, what
is needed, and they've really bought in. And I feel really good.  
So we're just excited about the season. It's coming around quick, you know. I
can't believe how quickly we play our first game. But we've got an
unbelievable schedule, very difficult. Even before we hit the Big 12, and the
Big 12 is going to be, I think, amazing, it's going to be wide open, I think.
So many of us have an opportunity to win the conference this year. So I think
it's exciting for all of us.  
I think the league has always had great parity, but I think this year, more
than any year since I've been here, the parity in the league is amazing. So
just really excited about the season.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you. We'll take questions from the floor for Coach.  
  
Q. Gail, about the schedule. We were talking about that a little bit earlier
and just how quickly the team has to acclimate. Do you like having that tough
November schedule just to figure out where everybody stands that quickly?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I really do. You know, I'm excited about playing some tough
games early, especially that Connecticut game, obviously. We'll find out
exactly where we are, who we are, who we want to become, and what we need to
work on.  
So I'd certainly rather have that early, give us some more time to really
prepare for some of those other games as well. And see our improvements.  
  
Q. Given your opening comments about being excited about the season, do you
feel like after these couple of years that you finally have your system in
place and got your players acclimated to that?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I do. You know, we as a staff talked this summer. We feel
like we've really turned the corner. We feel like the players, they really
understand the system now.  
We only have two freshmen this year. So we're reviewing a lot of things that
took us two years to put in, and now it's just a review. And the upperclassmen
are really helping those freshmen along. So the learning curve is really small
compared to what it has been the first two seasons.  
  
Q. Earnesia coming back, can you talk about what that's going to do in
making you guys stronger.  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Yeah. Ernie, as I've said before, Ernie is what I consider
my warriors. Those are the players that in the big games, in the tough games
-- and the Big 12 is a war, make no mistake. You want your warriors out there
on the floor.  
So having her back, she will help us set a tone for all the tough games that
we're going to encounter this year. She's been through all the wars. She knows
what's needed and what's expected.  
  
Q. Gail, with the limited roster that you have, how do you work -- do you
look at everybody as pretty much being in your rotation? And, also, is depth a
concern at all over the course of the long season?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Right. I feel like everybody's going to play. I've talked
to the team. I feel like anybody could start of the ten players. I think we
have great parity with those ten players.  
So I have so much confidence in all of them. So I know -- and they know. They
feel very important. They know they're all going to play, which I think is a
great thing.  
As far as the depth, I'm not really concerned. I went to the Final Four
several years ago with eight players. So I've experienced that before and been
pretty successful.  
I guess my only worry would be injury. You know, I figured out a way, I think,
to handle the fatigue. But, you know, the injury, that's another aspect. We're
just going to hope for the best with the injuries.  
  
Q. Gail, you mentioned players are already looking for Cokie Reed to be
inside. How uncommon is that for a freshman to earn that respect so quickly?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Usually post players in particular don't get many touches
on the low block either because they don't want the ball, they don't demand
the ball, they don't understand to how to post up. If they do get it,
sometimes they don't know what to do with the ball.  
Cokie is going to be really special. She posts up hard. She has a tremendous
understanding of the game, and when she gets the ball, she knows what to do
with it. She is demanding the ball. For a freshman. And our perimeter players
are really looking for her. I feel like we're going to have a really good
inside/outside attack.  
We've been more finesse on the inside the last couple of years. Now I feel
like we're going to have a power game as well.  
  
Q. Do you see Cokie and Ashley, Gail, ever playing on the court at the same
time and just the advantages that might give you with two such big and mobile
players?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Right. They will play together at times. I don't know how
much, but I know there will be times when they'll be together, I think
offensively.  
Cokie's got a really nice shot from 15 to 17 feet as well, so she can play in
that high post area, and they can dominate the low block.  
They're both really good shot blockers, so that could cause some problems. But
on the defensive end, we're going to have to figure out how we would play them
both together as well because I'm not quite sure who would be able to defend a
four that would step out and face up. They both need work in that area.  
PETER IRWIN: Coach, best of luck to you. Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2009

  

### [Bill Fennelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13850)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by Coach Fennelly from Iowa State.  
Coach, welcome. Your comments.  
COACH FENNELLY: Good morning, everyone. Nice to see everyone again and
certainly appreciate your time and effort. As always, the things you do for
our league and our student-athletes.  
Like everyone else, just really, really excited to get started and looking
forward to the opportunity to play in the best league in the country.
Certainly excited about the new team that we have and looking forward to
seeing what happens.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Hi, Coach. How much is the nature of the league changed this year? You
graduated a lot, the Parises are gone, Marlise Gibson.  
COACH FENNELLY: Thank God the Parises are gone.  
It's changed, but the one thing that's always constant is we have always some
of the best players in the country in our league. We have some outstanding
coaches. So you always know there's going to be good teams.  
Certainly, we lost a lot of very good players through graduation, but I think
what it does, though, is it allows other players like -- I mean, Danielle
McCray in my mind is the best player in the country that a lot of people don't
know about. Now she's going to get her chance to shine.  
There's going to be a lot of new faces, new players. That's the way this
league is. Great players leave, and great players come in.  
When you look at the coaches in our league and the commitment that the
universities have made, it's going to continue.  
You know, different names, different faces, same thing. Great league, great
players, and a lot of competition. I hope the fans enjoy watching it, and I
hope all of you enjoy covering it.  
  
Q. How much of a shadow would the Parises -- you know, the last four years,
did -- did they have starting every year, it seemed like?  
COACH FENNELLY: You know, Ashley and Courtney both did a lot for our league.
Not just for the University of Oklahoma. They did a lot for women's
basketball. They did a lot for the Big 12. And they were great ambassadors for
our sport and for the league.  
But at the same time, there's probably a lot of good players that maybe didn't
get the attention they deserved. Again, I go back to Danielle McCray, and
there will be others like her that will now get their attention.  
Kelsey Griffin at Nebraska, and you can go right down the list. Ashley Sweat,
K-State. People like that that are really, really great players but maybe
didn't get as much attention because Courtney especially, and Ashley her
senior year, dominated our league so much and were in a program that brought
so much attention to our league.  
But there's a lot of good players in our league, and I think you'll see them
this year.  
  
Q. Hey, Bill, talk about what having a 6'6 " player now adds to your team
that maybe you didn't have last season.   
COACH FENNELLY: I'd tell you if she was practicing more. She's got a stress
fracture. So I don't really know. Anna Prins is almost 6'7", a very, very
skilled kid. I think she's a kid that will be a great asset to our team, great
asset to our league.  
She's someone that I think is a very -- has a chance to be a really, really
special player. She can shoot the ball. She's not just someone you're going to
stand on the block. She can shoot the 3. She can do a lot of things.  
Unfortunately, she had a stress fracture. They diagnosed it end of September.
So she's just starting to run and work out a bit. But she'll change our team.  
She's certainly not someone that we've been fortunate to have -- obviously the
tallest player we've ever had at Iowa State. But I think someone that will
make other people prepare for in a unique way. Like, you know, Courtney Paris
and certainly Brittney Griners of the world.  
They're unique players not just because of their size, but in Anna's case,
because of her skill set. Hopefully, everyone will get a chance to see her at
her best. I think, if you do, she's someone that will really, really impact,
not just our team, but I think the way the league is looked at too.  
  
Q. How has being an assistant coach with the USA Under-19 Team enhanced your
coaching at Iowa State and winning the gold this year?  
COACH FENNELLY: It was a great experience. I worked with Carol Owens at
Northern Illinois, Amanda Butler of Florida, two great people. And you're
always learning.  
We had a lot of very, very talented kids. I think what it does, it makes you
appreciate even more the chance to coach, to represent your country.  
I told people back home, I've heard the National Anthem a lot of times in my
life at our games, going to recruit at high school games, whatever. But when
you hear the National Anthem with a gold medal around your neck and you're
watching the flag be raised in a foreign country, I can't -- I'm not going to
lie to you, my heart was coming out of my chest.  
It was a great honor, and certainly something I'll remember for a long, long
time.  
  
Q. Bill, Alison and Kelsey are going to have a lot on their shoulders this
year, and I guess they're prepared for that. Can you talk about what each one
of them is going to need to bring for you.  
COACH FENNELLY: Everyone is always asked, how are the freshman going to do?
Five of our top seven players are brand new. Ten of our players have played
almost no Division I basketball. So the challenge becomes -- the pressure is
on in my mind Alison and Kelsey. They've played before.  
I think if Alison is completely healthy for a year, she's as good as any
player in our league. I really believe that.  
She's our best player. She's our point guard. She's the leader of this team.
And I say that at our media day. It's her team. She wants it to be her team.  
And I think Kelsey is someone that can score the ball. That's the number one
challenge for us right now is finding scorers. Kelsey started for two years
and I think understands her role from role player, someone who was one of the
options to being one of the options.  
They both understand that. They're both bright kids. They've worked very hard
at it. They've had great summers. I talked to them collectively and
individually about what's ahead for them and the frustrations they're going to
feel at times playing with new players, players who don't understand what it
takes to win at the Big 12 level. They do have a lot on their shoulders. There
are going to be days when it doesn't seem real fair to them. But I have a lot
of confidence in them.  
They'll both have really good years. I really believe that. If they do, I
think we have a much better chance to be successful than maybe a lot of people
think.  
  
Q. Bill, this is not Big 12-related specifically, but you played Stanford
last year. They're going to be one of the --  
COACH FENNELLY: You had to bring that up. Twice.  
  
Q. You did. They're bringing so many people back. Do you think they're a
legitimate hope for a national champion this year?  
COACH FENNELLY: If they play us all the time, they are. They're really good.
Obviously, very well coached. Do not have any weak link.  
I think the challenge for them to beat UConn is how can they find point guard
play at the level that they need to have it.  
I mean, they have amazing size, depth. You know, Nekka (phonetic) was on our
team this summer and has gotten a lot better. Jane is obviously a tremendous
player. But they're certainly a team, I think, can contend. I think the
challenge for them will be the point guard play at the highest level.  
I don't think there's any question that most people would say Connecticut,
Stanford, and you just don't want to get in their region kind of thing. So
very, very good team and certainly a team, I think, will be rated very, very
high all year and deservedly so.  
PETER IRWIN: Okay, Coach. We wish you the best of luck.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2009

  

### [Kristy Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14069)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: Coach Curry has now joined us from Texas Tech University.  
Coach, welcome. Your comments.  
COACH CURRY: Thank you. We're real excited to get started. We feel like we've
had our best incoming freshman class since we've been at Tech and have six new
faces. I think they bring a lot of athleticism and size.  
We're really excited about the fact that Kaylan Talley and Lindie Kimbro may
finally be able to play at Texas Tech because of injuries. Those two
redshirted a year ago. They're in practice, and it's good to see their faces
out there.  
We feel our returnees bring a lot to the table. I feel Kierra Mallard had a
tremendous freshman season. She's done a great job of getting herself in the
best shape of her life and really matured a lot.  
Jordan Murphree, Timilia Martin, Ashlee Roberson are really leading the way as
seniors. I think Jordan Barncastle is stronger and more aggressive.  
As young as we are -- and maybe we'll have a lot of kids who haven't played in
this league -- I think we have a chance to really do some special things.  
I know we're not expected to do that, but I think no one expected more than we
do of ourselves. It's like I tell them, age doesn't define beauty. Hopefully
our experience level in this league won't define our beauty this year.  
We're loving the challenge. And, again, I'm just happy to have a great
incoming class, and hopefully some healthy bodies this year.  
PETER IRWIN: We'll take questions from the floor.  
  
Q. With all the changeover now, what's the biggest difference that you think
you'll see in your team?  
COACH CURRY: I think the athleticism. I think we're a lot bigger on the
perimeter. Again, I think we're more athletic. That's what you have to have in
this league to be more successful, especially in the South.  
We're bigger, so we're real excited about what our incoming class brings. You
know, we have four commitments in this class that went 4-for-4.  
So we feel like we're recruiting the type of athlete and the level of talent
that we need to be successful in this league.  
  
Q. I guess two questions. Not knowing exactly what these lineups are going
to be like, but it looks like you have a potential for a really big team at
times you can put out on the court. Is that going to be the case? And, also,
did you feel like last year you made enough progress just in terms of, you
know, the program?  
COACH CURRY: I think we are making progress. You know, I think you see that in
the fact that we're able to do some things the past couple of years and some
key wins, some big wins. Just not that second or third or fourth win that we
needed to get in the tournament.  
It's really helped us in recruiting because we have been able to beat the
Texases and the A&Ms, and we have done some good things.  
Just not enough, so it's a matter of what that's done for us in recruiting. I
think that's given folks they're going to be able to do that. A great
opportunity to come in and play immediately.  
We can be big. You know, I did lose 6'4" Shauntal Nobles to an achilles tear
for the year, our freshman we felt like would have contributed a lot.  
But, again, having Kaylan Talley. We have a waiver filed with the NCAA on
Teena Wickett, who's 6'4" and brings a tremendous amount of talent.  
If some things can fall into place and stay healthy, I think we may can
surprise a lot of folks.  
  
Q. Kristy, can you just talk about what you expect out of Jordan this
year.  
COACH CURRY: Well, I tell you, Jordan has done a tremendous job of leading the
way all summer, this fall. She's very motivated. I see a different look in her
eye. She's got a swagger about her. She's playing her best basketball.  
She brings a great work ethic, very unselfish. Right now she's really taking
these young kids under her wing, and she's trying to show them the way.  
There's nobody I would rather have leading the way. I will say that I think
Ashlee Roberson has done a tremendous job. She's really taken her game to a
new level, worked hard in the off-season, very versatile.  
So I think those two really understand what it's about. You know, Jordan's
been the only kid that's been there with me for four years, so I have a lot of
respect for her. I have a lot of respect for what she's been through
personally with her mom and having breast cancer and how she's fought through
a lot of adversity. She's ready for a big senior year and has a chance to be
as good as anybody in this league. Hopefully, she can consistently do that for
us night in and night out.  
  
Q. You mentioned a couple times surprising people. Did you feel a little bit
snubbed being picked tenth?  
COACH CURRY: Not at all. You know what, I've learned that what's on paper
really doesn't matter. We don't talk about that. You know, we don't talk about
playing Tennessee in November. We don't talk about going to Baylor in January.
Or, you know, playing up here in March.  
We're just talking every day about getting better. And if we can get better
with each day, each month is going to take care of itself. Right now we're
working for January and getting ready for the Big 12 season.  
So what's on paper really doesn't matter. Obviously, you know, the past three
years we haven't been respected very much, and I understand and respect that.
But at the same time, nobody expects more than we do of ourselves. Within our
family, we know what our expectations are and our goals. We're working toward
that every day just getting better.  
  
Q. I wonder if you could talk about how Mallard, what you look for her. She
had such a good season last year.  
COACH CURRY: She had a great freshman year in a league that was very dominant
in the South as far as the post play. Knowing that some of those dominant
posts are gone, I think she has the opportunity to really, you know, once
Jordan's gone, be the face of this program.  
The thing that I've noticed so much about Kierra is she's really matured on
and off the floor. She's doing a great job of really stepping out early in her
career and saying the hard things.  
You know, you always -- I've talked a lot with her about your best players
have to be your hardest workers, and she's really done a nice job of trying to
turn the corner with that.  
I think she has a chance to have a great year as a sophomore, which is
exciting for us.  
  
Q. Kristy, you've talked about needing athleticism to compete in the Big 12.
If you don't have that, if you lag behind in that area, where does that show
up on the court?  
COACH CURRY: Well, I don't think there's any question in the South it shows up
on the boards, it shows up defensively, it shows up in transition. It shows up
in a lot of areas.  
Again, whether it's size and athleticism, you know, we also too want to be
fundamentally sound. So I think it's a great combination, and that's something
we were able to do at Purdue that put us in a position to be successful in
that league.  
In this league, it's the best league in the country from top to bottom. Night
in and night out, you've got to have the athleticism, the size, and the depth.  
I think depth is really important too. That's another area I'm really excited
about. As young as we are, we have a lot more depth this year if we can keep
everybody healthy. You don't have to always count on your time-outs or timing
with that.  
Putting people in and fresh bodies and the physicality of things really make a
difference.  
  
Q. How much do you think the whole -- I guess the dynamic with the Paris
twins gone because they dominated so much of the conference the last four
years. How much does that change the way people are going to look at the
conference this year?  
COACH CURRY: You know, I just -- I think the thing I enjoyed the most was
sitting back and observing those two. How they handled themselves as people
and as players and the recognition that they gave this league was just
unbelievable.  
You know, I think it gives a Mallard, I think it gives a Griner what they can
continue the tradition that the Paris twins have put in place.  
From Starks to Gant, I mean, Player, Morrow, there's a lot of faces in this
league that did so much. That was a tremendous senior class.  
I think a lot of young players can look to fill their void and carry on the
tradition they've put in place.  
PETER IRWIN: Coach, thank you very much.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Good morning. My name is Debbie Antonelli. I'm one of the
analysts for Fox Sports Net on the Big 12 women's package. I'm here to
moderate the session today. Ladies, let's please -- starting with Sydney,
please state your name, school, year, and what your major is.  
SYDNEY COLSON: Hi. I'm Sydney Colson. I'm from Texas A&M. I am a junior, and
I'm a sociology major.  
ALISON LACEY: I'm Alison Lacey. I'm a senior at Iowa State University. And my
major is communications.  
DANIELLE MCCRAY: I'm Danielle McCray. I'm a senior at Kansas. And my major is
communications.  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: Hi, I'm Kelsey Griffin. I'm a senior at Nebraska. And my major
is biology.  
JORDAN MURPHREE: Hi, I'm Jordan Murphree. I'm a senior at Texas Tech. And my
major is exercise sports studies.  
WHITNEY HAND: Hi, I'm Whitney Hand. I'm a sophomore at Oklahoma, and my major
is physical therapy.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Ladies, our effort here today is to try to introduce you to
these young women, their personalities, and why they've become such great
ambassadors for the Big 12. That's what we're going to attempt to do.
Hopefully, this will be of interest to you. I know I'm very interested. I've
had a good time researching them and finding out something for them as I'm
preparing for my Big 12 season just like you guys are.  
I want to start with Jordan. Jordan, one of the things that you do to
volunteer your time is in the Challenger League. Explain the Challenger
League, what it is, and what you benefit from.  
JORDAN MURPHREE: The Challenger League is on Monday nights in Lubbock, and
it's for the special needs children, and it's just kids who don't have the
ability to play in the little league.  
What our job is is you pick a buddy and stay with that buddy throughout the
season. You just help them hit. If they're not allowed to hit, you run the
bases with them, and everyone scores a home run.  
If you have a bad day conditioning, practice-wise, you just think about that
and how excited those little kids are to be out there day in and day out.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Sydney, you are in a sister-to-sister group. Explain what
that is and why you're involved in that.  
SYDNEY COLSON: Mostly, it's a group -- we have meetings like every -- like two
times a month at our study hall facility at night. It's just for African-
American female athletes to come together and talk about, you know, things
that are going on in the community and things that are going on with our teams
and what problems we're having or things that are going well.  
And, you know, it's a way for us to get involved with the community and find
out what's going on with one another.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Whitney, your skydiving experience this past spring, why?
What possessed you to jump out of a plane? What did you gain from that
experience? How did that make you a better basketball player or person?  
WHITNEY HAND: Well, it was kind of a spur of the moment kind of thing. A bunch
of us when we first got here, our whole freshman class, the football guys and
me and some of the basketball girls, we were like, we should go skydiving. We
researched it for one of my friend's birthdays. Ended up being April, and our
seasons were over. Let's do it. It was the coolest thing ever. I can't really
explain it.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: You have to explain it. I want to know what would make you
want to jump out of a plane and what was Coach's reaction to it?  
WHITNEY HAND: I don't know if she knows. We were in this little cargo plane
with four people, and you're sitting there with your knees up to your face.
And the guy that's going with you is just telling you these awful stories.
They were sitting there, and they have these altitude bracelets. You go up to
10,000 feet, I think it was.  
We reached like the clouds, and I was like oh, my gosh. I looked at my friend.
This is crazy. It was 4,000, and we kept going and going and going. Couldn't
see the ground anymore. And I was like this is insane.  
The thing is once you're in the plane, you can't back out of it. It's not
like, oh, I don't think so. They open the door. Three, two -- oh, my gosh.  
They literally just jump, the guy's on your back, and they just throw you out.  
I was looking, and I see the plane, and I see clouds. And I was like, oh, my
gosh. You free-fall for 45 seconds, and just freezing cold wind. I don't know.
I'm shaking thinking about it.  
You're just praying the parachute opens. After the parachute opens, it's
great.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Could anything be tougher or more surprising in conditioning
now that you've experienced free-falling 45 seconds? Does that give you a --
what kind of sense of courage did that give you about entering into this
season?  
WHITNEY HAND: I mean, skydiving, it's just the thrill of doing something that
is crazy and just insane. It's also cool to be able to do that for yourself, I
think. Just that kind of thing really boosts your confidence about just your
fears and your ambitions and stuff like that.  
Yeah, I think, I mean, it's kind of like I conquered that, why not run this
suicide? Just kidding.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Why not run them?  
Danielle, you are on many different leadership committees and boards and
executive committees and things at Kansas, student-athlete advisory committee.
Even on one of the chancellor's programs. There's a lot of expectations for
Kansas this year. How have you used your experience in those leadership type
of experiences to help you become a better leader for your team?  
DANIELLE MCRAY: Like you said, just being a better leader on the team. Those
committees has just -- the student-athlete advisory committee, you just go out
and voice your opinions on things that you want -- or things that you want to
see changed in the university. So it just helps going back and hearing what we
talk about at meetings and telling my teammates.  
It's this big thing we're doing now. Every year you get points for every event
you go to. Say you go to a volleyball game. You get points. Your team gets
points.  
So like we compete with other teams in our school. So like whoever wins gets a
big trophy. It's just something that we do to just support other teams and
voice your opinions about what you want changed and things you want to see
changed in the athletic department.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: It's always about competing, isn't it? Doesn't matter what
you're working at, no matter what.  
Alison, you made a decision this summer to stay in Ames, coming off your
league experience. Instead of going and training with the Australian National
Team, you stayed. Why did you stay?  
ALISON LACEY: I thought it was my duty as a senior. The only one with playing
experience really, besides Denae, to help the freshman, help Chassidy Cole,
sophomore transfer, to try to help them get ready for the season, to get them
up with plays, and just how we do things around Iowa State.  
We lost a lot of good players, and we needed the freshmen to be able to play.
I thought it was my job to make sure they're ready.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Kelsey, we are so glad that you're back healthy and ready to
go. We missed you last year. At least I did. I don't know how the coaches in
the Big 12 feel about that.  
You and your dad have a great relationship. He is a cancer survivor. How does
he motivate you to be the best that you can be and work hard every day in
practice?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: Actually, he was a great motivator my junior year when he was
battling cancer, had a rib injury, and it really put things in perspective.
That's really, I would say, the most motivation, how he's most motivated me is
in that. In the whole scheme of life, is that one turnover, is that one missed
layup, is it really that important? I think it's motivated me to look at the
larger picture in things.  
I think that's helped me in my leadership ability and not focus just on me,
but on the team and on the whole process. And really the process of what we're
trying to do at Nebraska.  
I really appreciate that, you know. He does have words of wisdom, but I think
it was the whole experience and really putting things into perspective and how
not to take things for granted really helped me get through that year and
helped me to really grow, I would say.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Unfortunately, cancer has touched all of us in some way,
and, Jordan, your mother is a breast cancer survivor. How has your
relationship with your mother and how she has battled so hard helped you?  
JORDAN MURPHREE: I definitely have to agree with what she said. Putting things
in perspective. You get someone close to you that comes down with something as
a disease, and you just have to go through things and be positive. You have to
be positive to the battle that disease. Day in and day out, we have to be
positive on the court and just think, you know, people have it worse off than
we do.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: You do the Locks of Love. How does that make you feel when
you have a chance to help some young person battling cancer?  
JORDAN MURPHREE: Definitely. I wasn't able to be home with my mom and I wasn't
able to help her or anything. I thought that giving my hair to somebody that
also was doing that. I cut off 14 inches and gave it to Locks of Love.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: In my conversation with Coach Curry last week, one of the
things she said on the first day of practice she was going to do is pass out
this book. It's called "The Energy Bus." I highly recommend it. Coaches, it's
very good. I'm not a reader, and it took me a very short time to read it.  
What's your assignment with the bus book? What is -- what did you gather from
that? What is the most important message that you received from reading that
book?  
JORDAN MURPHREE: My assignment's not due until Friday, so I kind of
procrastinated. I'm a little bit in. It's about a guy that goes through a lot
of adversity, and his relationships are all failing at his job and at his
home. It's about having a positive attitude day in and day out and working
with your team and working in his job.  
I think it's going to help us a lot because we have six new people coming in
that are going to face a lot of adversity and just having a positive attitude.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: It's an excellent book about leadership. It's very good.  
Danielle, we've got a skydiver over here, a deep-sea fishermen over here. You
go deep-sea fishing with your dad. To me, that's just as scary an experience
as skydiving. Why? Where? What possessed you to do that?  
DANIELLE MCCRAY: I did it -- I'm from Florida, so I always do it all the time.
Growing up in a family where my mom was a commercial fisherman with her dad,
and she stayed on boats for months and weeks and a long time.  
My dad, he just has his boat, and we go out. I love fishing. So that's
something I do on my off time. And when I go to Florida on vacation.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: You got any good fish stories? Tale of catching some
gigantic --  
DANIELLE MCCRAY: No, I don't have one.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: And you're going to be honest about, you're going to tell us
the truth?  
DANIELLE MCCRAY: One time, we have these belt things attached to your seat.
And I got a big catch, and I almost flipped over in the boat. That's like the
scariest thing that happened. I love fishing. When you love something, you do
it all the time.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Kelsey, what did you learn from sitting out last year and
not being able to play? You're on the end of the bench in street clothes the
whole season. I know you listened to Coach Yori and benefited from hearing her
from the bench and not hearing her from the court. What are some of the things
you learned that you'll carry into this year?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: It was really another perspective year for me. I really saw
the game more as a whole and not just as a position. Being a forward my whole
life, basically. I really got to see more of how things work as a whole.  
But also really the biggest lesson I learned was how much energy coaches put
in to game planning. Knowing as a player, you have a lot going on. You have
practice, and you get tired and those kinds of things. Having that all pushed
aside. Really seeing the energy that coaches put in to practices, to game
plans, to encouraging, to cheering on in practice.  
Like how much energy you exert clapping or encouraging, constantly motivating
people. And really having that perspective now going into it, I think, has
helped in my leadership ability and to be a mediator between coach and players
to help in the process.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Sydney, you guys lost three valuable components to your team
from last year, really good players that were history changing players in the
Big 12. You're also on a student-athlete advisory committee. What will Coach
Blair expect from you out of a leadership position because you're also the
point guard?  
SYDNEY COLSON: I think that he just expects for me, along with the other
returners, you know, to help our freshmen out. It's been a tough transition
for them thus far, you know, just, when we started with our 6:00 a.m.
conditioning, they had never been through anything like that. Having to juggle
both school and basketball, the time demands of our practices and everything
else that we do, it's really tough for them.  
Everybody on our team has been through that. We're trying to help them out as
best as we can. Me, along with two other girls, on our team were on the
student-athlete advisory committee. That helps with leadership skills. We just
try our best to lead them in a positive direction.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Alison, you guys lost something also. Coming off your Elite
Eight experience, what else did you gain in the NCAA tournament that you can
carry forward this year?  
ALISON LACEY: It makes you -- I'm hungry to get back there. That experience
was great for our fans, for our university, and it was good for our seniors to
end on that note. I want the freshmen this year to experience that because not
a lot of people get to go through that.  
If I can work hard and make them do the right thing, maybe we can get back
there, and they can experience what we went through last year.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Whitney, the Final Four experience. I saw the myth about the
Super Glue on your fingers. Can you clear that up for all of us? Start with
the Final Four, and you can finish with the fingers.  
WHITNEY HAND: I think -- I mean, every person dreams of going to a Final Four
and getting to play on the court and going through that experience. As a
freshman, it was overwhelming and just amazing. More than I could ever ask
for.  
I think our team bringing back -- you know, there's eight of us that have been
there, and I think it's so key to our season this year. I'm so excited about
it because all of us -- we lost. We shouldn't have. We lost, and it was just
horrible. Even though we were there, it was a tough loss.  
I think that makes us all the more hungry to get back there.  
The Super Glue, I think I have dry hands. I don't know. I would shoot, and it
would just crack open, and it was so frustrating. The only way they could stay
together was Super Glue. So I Super Glued them.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Super Glue your fingers. That's a new one. To use Coach
Coale in the years Erin Higgins was on the team, I carried a tape measure
everywhere I went. When I had the Oklahoma game, I knew Erin Higgins was going
to shoot a three that was going to require a tape measure it was going to be
so long, I needed tape. I'm going to carry Super Glue in case you need it.  
Danielle, one of the nicest compliments any player can receive is to be picked
Big 12 Preseason Player of the Year. That means your peers think you're going
to have a great year. You had a wonderful USA Basketball experience.  
Assess what you feel like your responsibility will be this year with your
Kansas teammates and how Coach Henrickson has helped you along the way.  
DANIELLE MCCRAY: I would say just being a leader. As far as -- I think it's a
great honor to be named that and recognized. I'm fortunate to be on a team
that has great players that are pushing me every day and great coaches.  
I think as far as for me, I have to do the same thing I've been doing, being a
great leader and being more confident in my teammates and myself as well.  
The most important thing is last year I think I led by example, and this year
I think I have to be a leader vocally, more vocal, and just bring everyone
under my arms.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Ladies, thank you so much for your time, and wish you all
the best of luck this season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2009

  

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by Coach Sherri Coale.  
Sherri, welcome. Your comments, please, for the season.  
COACH COALE: Thank you very much. I like the fact that we're in the arena.
This is awesome.  
Just want to say, I think -- they just reminded me in the old Big 12 showcase
that I'm like the oldest person in the league. I think it's Deb Patterson,
Bill Fennelly and I are charter members of the Big 12 conference. But it just
made me think what an honor it is really to compete in this league.  
I can remember in '96, when I got this gig at the University of Oklahoma and
we were merging the Southwest conference and the Big Eight and becoming the
Big 12, all the rumblings and murmurings about what would women's basketball
be, what would our identity be as a league, it's pretty neat to sit here 14
years later and look at what we have become.  
Ten consecutive years leading the country in attendance. Year in and year out,
probably 75 percent to 80 percent of our teams participating in post-season.
Just last year, six teams in the NCAA tournament, Kansas in the finals of the
WNIT. We've done some pretty remarkable things as a league.  
When people ask what is our identity, I have to say it must be excellence, and
I'm sure proud to be a part of it.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you for your comments. We'll take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Sherri, can you kind of talk about some of the players who are going to
step forward this year. For instance, Nyeshia Stevenson and Amanda Thompson.
How big a role they're going to play for your team.  
COACH COALE: We have ten guys in a Sooner uniform this year. Every single one
of them is going to play a role, I can promise you that.  
I think our depth is going to be a weapon for us because we have a hard time,
as we look out on the floor only five days in, trying to decide who the best
five players are. And that's a great problem to have.  
Nyeshia was selected by this league as the Sixth Man of the Year last year and
rightly so. A player who really came into her own right, and I think still has
her best days ahead of her.  
I think Amanda Thompson is poised for the best season of her career, playing
more in a position that is true to her strengths and her gifts. I think she's
at a good place where she feels most comfortable with the players who are
around her and in the role that she's been given.  
I think you'll see Jasmine Hartman continue to develop, and that's going to be
a key role. We don't need to wear Danielle out 40 minutes a game, and Jasmine
is capable of playing in place of Danielle and alongside of her as well.  
I think Carlee Roethlisberger has got to have a big year. I think it's time
for her. I think her confidence is catching up with some of her skill, and
that's an important combination.  
And then, obviously, our cadre of bigs, those three: Abi, Lyndsey, and Jo,
they're all going to be depended upon. There's not a single kid that is not
going to be responsible for some things when the lights are on and everybody's
looking this year.  
  
Q. What does your team need to do to make the Paris sisters questions
disappear?  
COACH COALE: Tell you guys to go home.  
I wish I had a dollar for every time I've been asked that today. First and
foremost, I just want to say that every year, you know, when a team loses
their seniors, there is a void. It doesn't matter if they combined to score 40
points a game or 6, there is a void. Their presence is felt.  
And the most important thing that we have returning this year are guys in the
backcourt who have the experience of going to the Final Four. So those guys
translating the confidence that comes from that experience, confidence that
can't come in any other way, shape, or form the way it can from playing on the
brightest stage in women's college basketball.  
Those guys set the tone early. And I don't think it's about post players
producing 40 points a game. I don't think that's the answer. I think the
answer is Oklahoma playing a solid, beautiful version of basketball.  
  
Q. Were you aware you had players jumping out of airplanes?  
COACH COALE: You know, not before it happened. Whitney was shocked to discover
that I didn't discover that today. Norman is not that big, you know.  
Actually, I'll tell you guys a funny story. Landry decided that he was going
to treat her on her birthday, which occurs in the middle of the season, to a
hot air balloon ride. Fortunately for us, we live in Oklahoma, where the wind
comes sweeping down the plains, and conditions were not favorable for that in
Norman during season.  
And that was lucky for Landry because that's how I got to know him. Come here,
son, let's talk about what you want to give Whitney for her birthday. No
death-defying agents in the middle of season, please, thank you very much.  
Apparently, she has that risk gene and got it out of her system hopefully this
spring. I'm impressed. No way I have the guts to do that.  
  
Q. You mentioned Abi earlier. Talk more about her progression. This is her
year to shine. She's been behind a couple great players, and this is really
her time, isn't it?  
COACH COALE: It is. Abi looks fantastic. You know, the most important thing
about opportunity is to be ready when it comes. Abi has had the foresight to
be able to do that.  
It's one thing to wake up in August and September and go, okay, this is my
year, and another thing to realize it in the previous January, which she did.  
That's really when she began to drop some weight. All season last year -- and
I said this at the close of the year. I have no problems with Abi in practice.
I had -- I loved coaching her every day. I thought you could tell at that
point that she had really decided everything she could soak up was going to be
very important to her.  
And that change in attitude and that increased attentiveness was the beginning
of it. But then she began to follow it up by getting herself in incredible
physical condition. She had an opportunity to leave Norman in July, had
several internships that she could have taken and decided not to do it because
she wanted to get ten more pounds off and really be committed to being in the
best shape she could be in when school start.  
And she has. When you see her, you'll just be blown away. She is has just put
herself in a position to experience the success that she deserves to
experience. And so we couldn't be more excited about what that will be.  
Now, at the beginning, she's probably going to foul out the first five or six
games. She's going to be so daggum happy to be on the floor, she'll just run
up and whack people. But if we can get her through that and get her calmed
down a bit, she's going to be a force to be reckoned with in her own right.
She has skills and gifts that are uniquely hers, and I look forward to
watching her use them.  
  
Q. Sherri, your thoughts on the WNBA team coming to Tulsa.  
COACH COALE: I think it's fantastic for the city of Tulsa. I'm happy for Bill
and David. I know the time and the work ethic that they've dispensed over the
last really two to three years probably to see this come to fruition.  
So I'm excited for them. I'm excited for the BOK Center and the city of Tulsa.  
I think any time you can have people in your state thinking about and talking
about women's basketball for 365 days, that's a great thing.  
  
Q. Nothing unusual about you guys playing a tough nonconference schedule,
but this is really tough, especially if you look at that tournament in the
Virgin Islands in November. Can you just talk about putting that together, and
obviously, once again, it will include UConn and Tennessee.  
COACH COALE: We have typically year in and year out had one of the toughest
schedules in America. That's something that's important to us, something that
we feel has given us an opportunity to succeed in this conference and to be a
part of six conference championships.  
But this one got a little bit ridiculous. You know, you send in that you want
to go to the Virgin Islands. Oh, I want to go. Sounds like a fun place to be
over Thanksgiving. So we did that, and then we found out half a year later who
else had decided to go there too. And our schedule went from really, really
tough to ridiculous.  
We're playing there. San Diego State, South Carolina, Notre Dame, in addition
to Georgia, Arkansas, and Connecticut and Tennessee.  
So one thing, when March rolls around, we will have been tested by just about
everyone in America who's in the top 25. So we will know who we are. We will
know hopefully what we're good at, and I'm sure we'll know what we're not so
good at. But we will have a very cleared idea of who we are and how we have to
play to win.  
I think it makes for an exciting road. There will not be a week that goes by
in which our players are not fired up about who they get to take the floor
against.  
PETER IRWIN: Coach, thank you very much. Best of luck to you guys.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2009

  

### [Kurt Budke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14197)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We'd like to welcome Coach Kurt Budke.  
Coach, welcome, from Oklahoma State. Your opening comments, and we'll take
questions.  
COACH BUDKE: I'm taking Baylor's place?  
PETER IRWIN: Yes, sir, you're Baylor.  
COACH BUDKE: You have to get rid of the 6'8" questions. I have nobody that's
6'8" and can dunk all the time. Get rid of those. I'll talk to Leon about that
when I get home.  
I'm sure everybody's come up here and said how excited they are about getting
to start practice and getting things underway. I feel the same way.  
We've got nine new players. We've got six freshmen in. We've got a lot of
inexperience in.  
But we felt like last year one of the things that hurt us was chemistry, and
chemistry is huge in our sport. And I think it was the total difference
between the year before where we were Sweet 16 to last year.  
And so we brought some different people in, some young and enthusiastic,
excited young ladies that are ready to play at Oklahoma State. So far, early
practices have been a lot of fun.  
I think this has a chance to be my longest, quickest, deepest team that I've
had at Oklahoma State. So we truly are excited about the beginning of
basketball.  
PETER IRWIN: Coach, thank you. We'll take questions from the floor now.  
COACH BUDKE: They're having to shift the 6'8" questions, I told you.  
I do have a 6'1" that can dunk. She dunked in Homecoming in Hoops the other
night. Pretty impressive dunk also.  
  
Q. Kurt, I'm not going to ask you any 6'8 " questions. What about this
senior year for Andrea and just what you expect from her?   
COACH BUDKE: I think Andrea -- Andrea has already proven she can lead the
conference in scoring. We know she can do that.  
I think what you're looking for out of Andrea this year is more leadership. I
think, instead of averaging 23 points a game, a better year might be 18 points
a game and 8 or 9 assists a game.  
Now, she's got more options to throw to this year. I think Andrea's had her
best summer by far. She's had her best preseason practice by far. She'll tell
you herself that, you know, leadership is something she's really focusing on
and trying to do a better job of.  
So I know this: She's in tremendous shape, and she is playing the best
basketball of her life right now. So there's going to be some big moments for
her this year.  
  
Q. Kurt, talk a little bit about Garrison and what she brings to the
program.  
COACH BUDKE: Lakyn is a transfer from Carl Albert. What Lakyn can bring to us
is, one, Lakyn legitimately has range that is five, six feet behind the line.
I know you all say, oh, you coaches, you think a foot behind the line is five
feet. This kid can shoot it five feet behind the line.  
Yet she can play the point guard, and she is tough. And what she can do for us
is we can throw out a little different look this year, and you'll see Andrea
playing a little bit of a two instead of just one all the time. Gives us a
different attack point to use Andrea Riley.  
Everybody is used to Andrea having the ball in her hands and preparing
defenses to stop her from the point. We'll be able to switch that up a bit. I
expect big minutes from Lakyn.  
Lakyn averaged 25 points a game in junior college last year. It's not like she
can't score. She can score.  
  
Q. When you talk about chemistry, what's going to be different about this
group? You said you were looking at bringing in some different types of
people.  
COACH BUDKE: You know, you just have to be dedicated to the whole package when
you're in Division I and when you're in the Big 12. You have to be -- you want
to be a great person off the floor. You want to be dedicated to the academics.
You want to be dedicated to your team. And what you have to do in practice
every day to be successful in the Big 12.  
We had some kids that thought they wanted that, but they weren't willing to
sacrifice on a daily basis to achieve that. And so a couple of those kids have
now transferred out, and we have some in that we think just have been a joy to
be around with tremendous work ethic. That can do nothing but help chemistry.  
  
Q. Kurt, you mentioned Toni Young earlier. What do you see her role being as
a freshman?  
COACH BUDKE: I think we have a rotation of about ten kids that as long as
Andrea is on the floor with them, it doesn't much matter who's going to be
around her. Toni can do things that many can't do. She can throw from the
free-throw line. She can lay it on the rim. She can dunk. She can legitimately
dunk. It's not those shots that other people try. She can get out and hammer
it down.  
It's just a matter of her getting used to the physicality of the Big 12,
getting bumped around every single night. But she is long and athletic and has
got a nice touch.  
If she's willing, if her heart's big enough and she's willing to put the work
in, she can be a star in this league someday.  
  
Q. Kurt, when you have this much turnover, do you have enough time to sort
through all these players and get them ready to go by the start of the
schedule?  
COACH BUDKE: I hope so. I would think, as a former junior college coach, one
of my areas of expertise is having nine or ten freshmen come in and kind of
start over as the year comes.  
What you do is you don't just try to have everything in by game one. You try
to have a basic package in that they can remember, that they feel comfortable
with.  
The problem is this year we really upgraded our schedule in nonconference, and
we open with Arkansas Little Rock, who won 27 games last year, has the whole
team back. And then possibly Georgia Tech, possibly Ohio State, Marist,
Michigan State. They're going to be thrown into the fire right away.  
We have some games after that that hopefully we'll have a chance to let these
kids settle in a little bit.  
You know what, the advantage we have this year that we've never had before is
a bench. And one of the best motivators in the world to play hard every minute
you're on the floor is the threat of going to the bench because somebody's
there ready to take your spot.  
So I really do think these kids will play hard every second they're on the
floor, or if they don't, they'll come sit by me.  
  
Q. Just wondering if you could talk about your thoughts on WNBA moving to
Oklahoma and how that is maybe going to affect, you know, your program. Does
it have an affect on your program?  
COACH BUDKE: I don't think it will affect us at all. I really don't. I think
it's great for women's basketball in the state of Oklahoma. We already have a
great state for women's basketball.  
And with what Sherri's doing at Oklahoma and what we're doing at Oklahoma
State, to add a veteran WNBA team like Detroit coming to Tulsa I think will
just keep the excitement of women's basketball at an all-time high. I'm
anxious to go watch it myself.  
PETER IRWIN: Coach, best of luck to you.  
COACH BUDKE: Thank you all. It's good to be back.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2009

  

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We are now joined by Texas A&M Coach Gary Blair. Coach, welcome.  
COACH BLAIR: I'm glad to be presented this national championship trophy right
in front of Peter and I, and hopefully we can live up to the expectations this
year. Glad to be in Kansas City. Going to be eating at Gates Barbecue in about
an hour and a half, and looking forward to it.  
Congratulations to all you newspaper people that still have a job.  
PETER IRWIN: Is that a paid commercial there about Gates Barbecue?  
COACH BLAIR: That's why I didn't use my journalism minor to stay in that
profession. I had to find something else. I was looking ahead a long time ago.  
  
Q. Coach, you lost a couple players that seemed like they were there for ten
years. How's the nature of your team changing? Do you think in general is
there much of a big change in the conference as a whole from last season to
this season compared to what this usually is?  
COACH BLAIR: The core that we had together, those six kids, we graduated three
of them a year ago, three of them this past year. They were very special. But
at the same time, they had to come in as freshmen and play because we had
nothing behind them as freshmen.  
Now we're even having better recruiting classes, and our freshmen are having
to wait to be able to play just because our nucleus is a lot better than what
it was four to five years ago when we were here for the first time.  
I like the makeup of our team because we're reloading. I don't think we're
rebuilding. The talent is there. What we've got to do is just learn how to
turn talent into basketball players and to be able to contribute.  
Those kids have played together for so long. They were so good defensively.
Offense came second because they enjoyed the defensive end of the court. And
we played very well as a team.  
Our team is all about pressure. Offensively, defensively, sideline plays,
inbounds plays, pressure on us old coaches in recruiting and in trying to
figure out game plans. It's what we do.  
And who's going to be the next core for us? I remember at Arkansas they had a
group of triplets and then three more triplets and three more triplets back
when Nolan was coaching. It's kids change, they graduate. But I think you'll
start seeing the Tanisha Smiths and the Sydney Colsons, and the Carters, and
these kids start contributing, and all of a sudden they'll be household names
just like the Gant, the Starks, and the Morenike have been for us in years
past.  
I'm sorry. I missed your second question. I couldn't remember that far.  
  
Q. Coach, we talked a little bit about Danielle Adams just a little while
ago. Can you talk a little bit more about what you expect from her this
season, the Big 12 Newcomer of the Year?  
COACH BLAIR: Well, if some of you do not know Danielle, she was the nation's
number one ju-co Player of the Year. Played up there at Jefferson. Very good
player.  
Offensive machine, can score, and I've never coached anyone like her before.
Not so much of talent because of her size, it's sort of like a Charles Barkley
that can play the three, the four, or the five position. That's just the way
Barkley was, and this kid is just different. I'm going to have to work her
into our system. She's been out for a month with a hamstring, just back the
last week and a half.  
We've got a lot of work to go just in the conditioning part. I'm not worried
about her offense. Coach Schaefer's really worried about her defense, but that
all comes with all freshmen or ju-co kids or whatever. We teach them how to
play defense. We recruit them for their offense.  
  
Q. You said last year there were times when you had players you wanted to
give playing time and you couldn't find playing time for them. How do you feel
like the rotations are going to work this year?  
COACH BLAIR: I think, if we had to play Duke tomorrow, which we have to play
them first game of the year November 15th, I've got about eight players that
are ready to play, and that doesn't include any of my freshmen or my ju-co
right now because they're not ready for our system.  
I think we've got eight kids that are ready to go. I think we're going to move
Carter to the two-guard position and compete against Tyra White at that
position this year.  
Tanisha Smith is solid at the three. We've got Colson at the point where we
can slide Carter over. I've got a freshman coming in.  
So we've got a four-guard rotation that I'm very comfortable with right now.
I'm just trying to develop who's going to be that fifth player to come in or
that sixth player. Will it be a freshman? Cierra Windham. Will it be Adrienne
Pratcher, the point guard? That has to be determined.  
At the five position, we graduated Micheaux who was a four-year starter for
us. She averaged 3 1/2 points a game last year. And you say how could she
still be starting for you? That's one of the reasons how we were able to be so
successful against Oklahoma the past few years is because of Micheaux and our
team defense.  
So sometimes you've got to sacrifice. We've got Damitria Buchanan, who is
looking very good for us. She's been Micheaux's backup for three years. Her
and Kelsey and Assarian will battle for that five spot.  
The most improved player on our team is Adaora Elonu. You remember her brother
played in the league and got drafted by the Lakers in the second round. He's
over in Spain playing. That family just believes in work. In the classroom and
on the court, she's the most improved player that we have. She'll be at the
four spot.  
Right now I don't see any of the young kids challenging her.  
Now, as we in three weeks from now, hopefully I'll have some of those freshmen
and the junior college player ready to compete. But right now we look like a
very athletic AAU team going up and down the court. And what we've got to do
is learn how to play a little bit better basketball right now.  
But that's why we've got the month of October and November in front of us.  
  
Q. Want to know what you think about Nolan Richardson moving into women's
basketball. He's going to be coaching this team in Tulsa, WNBA team.  
COACH BLAIR: I think it will be great. I worked with Nolan for nine years. He
has a passion for the game. He also has a passion for young ladies, as most of
you know. His daughter died of leukemia. His wife was one of our biggest fans.
They used to come to our ball games in Arkansas, and the kids would love to go
up and talk to her. I think it's a perfect fit. I think we'll do very well,
particularly if he's getting Detroit's team.  
That's not an expansion team. That's a readymade team, ready to compete. And
hopefully he'll look into some of these Big 12 players like Danielle Gant,
who's over in Turkey right now playing, to say come back home and play in
Oklahoma.  
And maybe the other Paris. So hopefully he'll look at some of the Big 12
players and say, let's fill my roster with some of those kids in the Big 12
that can maybe put some butts in the seats.  
He hasn't forgotten how to coach the game. He is a very, very good teacher and
a very good coach. And I really believe, for him to get his legacy that he
deserved, he needs to get back into the game and hopefully get into the Hall
of Fame someday.  
PETER IRWIN: Coach Blair, we appreciate your comments and your answers. Best
of luck to you for the season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2009

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

### [Curtis Jerrells](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16448)

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Missouri  73  
Baylor - 60

  
CHARLIE FISS: We are joined now by Coach Scott Drew and his two student-
athletes from Baylor, Curtis Jerrells and Kevin Rogers.  
Coach, we will call on you first for an opening comment on today's
championship game.  
COACH DREW: I liked the other press conferences better than this one.
Missouri, give them all the credit. They played a deep rotation. They pressure
you. We tried to slow it down. Their pressure really made it tough to do.  
We tried to get the ball inside. Their pressure made it hard to do. We got
some open looks, and we got guys that are normally going to take and make open
shots. Even though it is day four and we emphasized getting inside, I think
Missouri deserves a lot of credit from keeping us from doing that.  
They have had a great season, and we wish them the best of luck in the NCAA
tournament. Very proud of our team how we performed and played and excited
about where we go in post-season.  
  
Q. About the ten-minute mark of the second half, you guys had quite a few
open threes that just seemed to be this much short. What do you think happened
on those shots?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: I'm not sure. Like Coach said, those are the shots we
normally make. We were making them all tournament. It may have something to do
with fatigue. I'm not really sure. Those guys make you play a little faster
than what you want, what you like to. Sometimes you may think you got good,
open looks and may not be the right shot.  
Like I said, we have been taking and making those shots all tournament. We
continued to take them and unfortunately we didn't make them.  
  
Q. You guys, defensively -- I guess their defense pressure, how tough was it
for you guys? It seemed to be kind of constant.  
KEVIN ROGERS: Any time you play a team like Missouri that basically presses
the entire game, it kind of wears guys down, especially our guards and trying
to break their press and get into our offense and run things like that. It is
always tough.  
But that's the style that they play. It is very successful for them.  
  
Q. C.J., you have said all along at the press conferences this week you came
here to win four games and win the Big 12 tournament. You came up one short.
One might say you guys got here but you don't look satisfied.  
CURTIS JERRELLS: Not at all. The goal was to come and win it. Like Coach said,
we are in it to win it. We fell one short, but I couldn't be more proud of my
teammates and the coaching staff and myself.  
I think that we came into this thing, we finished ninth in the conference.
That's where we want to be, that's where we expected to be. We think we did
ourselves a disservice all season, I'm just proud of the way we came out and
played. God giving us the opportunity to come out and play. I'm happy the way
we played. We beat, Nebraska, Kansas and Texas and then we fell short. Like I
said, I'm very proud of their effort.  
  
Q. Touching on what Curtis just said, Kevin, it stings now but as you go on
into the post-season, what can you take away from this experience having
beaten three pretty good teams?  
KEVIN ROGERS: We know everybody on this team has big hearts. For us to do what
we did, it was really special, you know. For this being my senior year, I
could pick no better way to go out. Playing the teams we played and nobody
expecting us to be here.  
But at the same time coming in, we were picked preseason third place. So we
expected this all along. But, you know, this is really special. I mean, you
know, obviously the end result is not what we wanted. We can take into the
post-season that we won't back down from anybody.  
  
Q. Scott, in essence the first five minutes of the second half went a long
way toward determining what happened, did it not? Y'all just came in a little
cold?  
COACH DREW: I think Missouri deserves some credit on that. They made shots
today. Against Oklahoma State they didn't make a lot of threes and we thought
that zone would be a little more effective.  
They hit some shots. Could have contested them better but, again, give them
the credit for it.  
The other thing is I know offensively we really, again, wanted to get the ball
into the paint and get the ball down low and their pressure really prevented
us from doing that as much as we'd like. It is a good learning experience for
what's further down the road for us hopefully.  
  
Q. Given Missouri's style, given their depth and everything, were they maybe
the worst matchup you could have faced playing that fourth game in four
games?  
COACH DREW: Yes. You want me to elaborate or are you good with that?  
When you play a team that plays as many as they rotate, they are always going
to be fresh. And then the second thing is them playing one day less. And then
the other thing with that is their style, not allowing us -- we really tried
to slow it down more, but, again, when you are getting hounded, you have -- it
is like someone swinging at you. You have two options, duck and hit and both
of them are actions.  
The last couple games we could dictate the tempo a little better. We don't
mind playing fast and like that, but I don't know if we had -- our advantage
was inside, and I don't know if we had enough in the tank to do that nonstop.  
We wanted to attack. Any time we had numbers, we wanted to attack and they did
a good job spreading back and not allowing us to get as many easy ones and we
would have liked to have had.  
  
Q. You guys came here to win it. You came up one short. Are you guys feeling
good you got here or is it more disappointment that we had a chance to get the
conference championship?  
COACH DREW: Very disappointed because our goal was to win the tournament, the
goal was to be in the NCAA tournament. But at the same time, I know we're
fortunate enough to have post-season hopefully, so we can't be so down that we
can't get up for that opportunity.  
So it is one of those situations as a coach, I mean, we could have had that
talk in there and everyone cry their eyes out. But at the same time, we still
have basketball hopefully to play and we want to be ready for that opportunity
like we were for this one.  
  
Q. Along those lines, you have always talked about how some of your best
basketball memories have come in Oklahoma City. When you look back on this,
will it fall in the really good basketball memory or the "we came so close"
category.   
COACH DREW: That's the tough thing in coaching, we seem to remember the losses
more than the wins. It will be bittersweet.  
  
Q. Scott, at the end of the first half when Kevin got his second foul, it
looked like -- were you trying to get him out? Was there something as far as
the substitution?  
COACH DREW: With Kevin being the veteran player that he is and basically us
needing him and using him out there, we tried to go as long as we could. And
just at the end, he actually asked for his self to come out because he was
tired and fatigued. We tried to sub and we couldn't get him out in time.  
Again, everything would have been perfect if we didn't get a back call.
Hindsight, obviously we could have gotten him out two seconds sooner. Second
half, it doesn't bother us. He wasn't in foul trouble. Again, with some
players, that really hurts you because -- Kevin has played with fouls most of
his career. If we are going to lose, we are going to lose with our best.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the impact DeMarre Carroll had for them and just how
tough he is to guard.  
COACH DREW: There is a reason he is first team all-conference, 20-9. He is the
Energizer Bunny out there. I think he could have played eight games in eight
days. Him and Lyons are as tough a matchup you will find in the country
because they can guard anybody and do it inside and outside. We are glad they
are both graduating.  
  
Q. You talked about trying to get it inside. Kevin only gets six shots. Is
some of that on the guards not getting it there? Or is it denying it inside?  
COACH DREW: Definitely we had opportunities but, again, I think that's where
the first couple games we were able to get it down there today because of
pressure. I think physical fatigue is always one thing, but I think what we
all forget is mental fatigue.  
When you mentally get tired, you don't operate as well either. And I think
both of those situations led to us being -- not being able to get the ball
inside as much as we wanted to. And so, again, we'll credit Missouri but
obviously we'll learn from it, too. Wherever we play again, we will try to get
back to what we did for those three games.  
  
Q. What did you guys learn about yourselves in these four days?  
COACH DREW: I think the toughest thing for me as a coach is we finished second
in two tournaments now. There is nothing better than celebrating after getting
a win in a tournament.  
So we all made a deal we are going to celebrate after the next one. Hopefully
that comes true.  
The second thing is I couldn't be more proud of the guys as far as how they
came back. Again, people don't understand, it was frustrating on the fans this
year during conference and it is frustrating on all of us. But how they
bounced back and played good basketball, played together -- again, we are a
program that's still building. It is the first time in the school's history
with 20-win seasons back-to-back, hopefully -- only second time ever post-
seasons back-to-back. Sometimes we all forget that stuff.  
  
Q. Beating Kansas and Texas back-to-back --  
COACH DREW: That's huge for our program. Snap some streaks and some of you
guys won't be able to ask the same questions anymore (smiling).  
But I mean -- again, as a coach, there is nothing you want more when you have
seniors that are going out, you want them to enjoy their experience and you
want them to go out on a high note. Now I know -- again, the ending wasn't
what we wanted, but they are going to be able to look back on this conference
tournament and talk about some highlights and talk about some great moments.
As a coach, just like a parent, you are proud of that.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Missouri  73  
Baylor - 60

  
CHARLIE FISS: Ready to begin with the Missouri Tigers, champions of the Big 12
conference. Coach Mike Anderson and his four student-athletes, DeMarre Carroll
who happens to be the most valuable player, Leo Lyons, Zaire Taylor, another
all-tournament team member, and Matt Lawrence.  
Coach, before we get to questions for your student-athletes, congratulations.
Your thoughts on today's victory?  
COACH ANDERSON: First I want to say my hat is off to Baylor. I have been at a
program where you have to go four games in four days, and that's tough,
especially to play against a team such as the Missouri Tigers in terms of how
we play.  
I thought the tournament format plays into our hand, especially with the
depth. But the thing I'm more proud about these guys is the focus, the focus
that they came out with each and every game. They just took care of business.
Hats off to them. We got off to a, I thought, pretty decent start, but our
bench came in and played real well, our young guys, the freshman, Miguel Paul,
Kimmy English, Marcus Denmon, Keith Ramsey, all those newcomers, those guys
came in and really helped.  
These guys were able to come out in the second half and put the pedal to the
metal so to speak with our defense. Our defense was the most consistent thing
here in this particular tournament. Eventually, we are going to shoot the ball
well and I thought we shot the ball a little bit better today.  
  
Q. Matt and Leo, you two more than anybody else have been here so long. I
know you try to look forward and not back. Can you just talk about any sense
of appreciation you have for the moment and all that's gone on in the last
period since you guys have been here? Did you reflect on that on the court
after winning?  
LEO LYONS: It is a very emotional time for us right now. Four years we have
been through all the ups and downs. We have seen this program when it was at
its worst and best and that's right now. We want to continue to keep it going
and take it as far as we can to end our senior year.  
MATT LAWRENCE: I agree with my boy Leo. It has definitely been a roller-
coaster ride. Credit goes out to the guys on our team that all came in here
and we are about one thing and that was winning. That reflects our coach.  
Coach Anderson has been nothing but honest with us saying he is going to bring
a championship to this school. Not many people believed him except those 14
guys in the locker room and our coaching staff, too.  
  
Q. Seniors, what was it like for you that last 60 seconds or so where the
outcome had been decided and the clock was just ticking down?  
COACH ANDERSON: It was a great moment, you know. Coach -- we couldn't really
look at the last 60 seconds. We had to wait until it got to zero because Coach
said -- he kept saying it is not over yet. Once it got to zero, we got happy.
We hugged each other.  
Hats goes off to our bench. They all get a lot of credit. But I think we are
the ultimate team. That's what makes our team so great because many of y'all
know that Leo went out and Lawrence Bowers would come out and he would get a
great steal. Many teams, when one guy come out he gets kind of mad. We are the
ultimate team. I think our bench stepped up, Kim and Miguel. Hopefully we
carry this on to the NCAA tournament.  
MATT LAWRENCE: I was just concentrating on winning the game. I wanted to see
the 0:00 on the clock. I wasn't worried about what was going through my mind
except for that game being over with finally. I was excited to be out there on
the floor with some of these guys I have been through a lot with.  
There is time for reflection later. I think we got a big thing coming up in a
week. We showed we are a team that can play in a tournament-style atmosphere
and do well. We will try to do it well again next week.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible).  
LEO LYONS: Mostly you are used to seeing us laughing. I know I made a mistake
at the end of the game. He told me he loved me. It was pretty emotional. I
said I loved him back. The game ended. That just shows the maturity that I
have been through and just shows how we stuck together throughout these whole
things.  
  
Q. DeMarre, everybody is talking about their emotions. Can you talk about
your emotions, transferring here, all you have been through and to be the MVP
and end up here.  
DEMARRE CARROLL: You know, my whole thing of transferring here, once I
transferred here, everything started going wrong and I was just looking around
like "man, what did I get myself into." My uncle told me to keep having faith
and the light is going to come up -- the sun will come up at the end.  
I got shot. We lost a lot of games and so on. Look at me now. I'm standing
here smiling with a Big 12 championship.  
  
Q. Kim went through a pretty tough period there the last two or three weeks,
struggled on the court. Tonight he came into the zone and really stepped up
for you guys when you needed him the most. How did he stay so positive and
what advice did you give him? And how important is it for him to keep going
with what's coming up?  
LEO LYONS: He has got a high confidence level. There is nothing that can
bother him. That's good for him because him being a freshman, he goes into the
games knowing he can score and knowing he can play for us.  
I don't think no shots mess up his confidence. We keep on telling him to keep
shooting and sooner or later it keeps going, like today.  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: The coach is like that's the shot we want after every shot he
missed. We all shot terrible yesterday for the most part. Just being a little
slump -- I mean, every freshman goes through it. I mean, I'm sure we have all
been there at one point or another.  
MATT LAWRENCE: I didn't have a freshman slump because I didn't play
(laughter).  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: Matt didn't get the opportunity.  
When it comes down to it, it is just hard to, like, go through a 30-game
season at this level, 30-plus games.  
I mean, the wear and tear takes a toll. He knew what he was capable of. I came
in and tried to talk to him and he was telling me what he was going to do. He
wasn't worried about it. So if he wasn't worried, we weren't worried.  
  
Q. All season long after wins you guys have said that you have until
midnight to celebrate. Has Coach said anything on whether or not you get an
extension tonight?  
LEO LYONS: We got to fly back home. I'm pretty sure he will tell us on the bus
what time we got to be back in. I'm pretty sure a lot of us won't hear him.
I'm just joking. (Laughter).  
Nah. We are not too much worried about anything else but this win and we will
try to focus on the selection and see where we will get seeded and focus on
the next team.  
COACH ANDERSON: Y'all see what I deal with. Every day I deal with that. That's
a good thing, though.  
  
Q. Mike, given the Saturday finish and how successful y'all were here, do
you think that you have given the selection committee ample time to consider
you in the conversation for a higher seed than you might have been on
Tuesday?  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, I would hope that would be the case.  
We have been a team that's been focused on the things we can control, and
that's the games. We had an opportunity to win this tournament, and I hope
that stands for something. We have been pretty consistent all year long. Even
in the feats we have had, I think we have responded in a positive way. Our
last game of the season, we got a shelacking at Texas A&M. Look how we
responded. We responded with three pretty solid games and not giving people
many -- the scoring average was probably in the 60s. And so it just shows me
this team is a team that can adjust and adapt and they learn, I think.  
We are playing some pretty good basketball. And the better our bench plays, it
really makes us a pretty dangerous basketball team. Hopefully it does.  
  
Q. The fact that Oklahoma State played a zone yesterday, did that help you
guys get started in the game? I know it was a different team, maybe a
different zone. But the fact it was a similar kind of defense you were going
up against, did that help with the shooting a little?  
COACH ANDERSON: I thought it did because you got to remember in the second
half I thought we did a better job of attacking Oklahoma State. We scored
almost 50 points. So that means we got the ball moving, we got the ball
inside, we started knocking shots down. We started attacking the glass. We got
to the free-throw line.  
I thought coming in today, I knew we were going to see some zone. Baylor had
played zone practically the whole tournament. That fourth game, you try to
save those guys' legs and they got some guys in foul trouble as well. I
thought early on we didn't make some shots.  
But I thought the freshman group, when they came in, had great ball movement
and they started knocking some shots. It is kind of like the lid was open up
and you could just see our defense intensity really pick up and the starters
came back in. I think the game went back and forth like I thought it would.  
  
Q. Mike, it has been a long time since Missouri has been at the top of Big
12 or Big 8 basketball. How well prepared is the program to make sure you stay
there for years to come?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think if you look at our basketball team, we got a good
nucleus. Obviously these seniors are very, very important to our basketball
team. I think they have shown the young guys the way. I think those guys you
saw here along with Michael Anderson, J.T. Tiller who has been in our program
for three years, I thought they showed the leadership and they showed the
ownership of this basketball team. I thought the young guys followed their
lead. That was very, very important.  
So hopefully these guys have the kind of success they're having. It could
leave that trickle effect. That's how you start a program, you start it by
winning, bringing in great kids and they understand what leadership,
commitment, ownership is all about.  
But hopefully that is something that will be carried on. These guys look up to
these older guys. And I think they have been imparting some pretty good
knowledge on them. Even a guy like Zaire, Zaire is an old man.  
  
Q. DeMarre referred to some of the things he has been through since he has
been here. I wonder if you would talk about what it means to be able to get to
this point for your program and for some kids like him that have made it.  
COACH ANDERSON: I think coming in and obviously when you transfer, you come in
and you think hopefully things are going to be a little bit better. Of course,
we had some -- I mean, we had some storms, man. We had a lot of storms. He was
involved in some of those where -- as he said, what took place with him. I
always tell guys, tough times don't last, tough people do.  
That's how I look at myself, my life. You have got to persevere, you have got
to have faith. You made a decision -- he made that decision to come here. I
didn't make it for him. He made that decision. You have to go through some
things to get where you want to go. I have got to say he really dedicated
himself, he committed himself since he has been here, and he has had a
tremendous, tremendous impact on our program.  
I mean, just think about the things that have taken place. He is the first
team all-conference, first team all-academic, first one in the league for that
to take place. He's graduated and continued to lead this team as we get ready
for the NCAA. He is a true, true leader. He is the ultimate, ultimate warrior.
I think when you talk about the complete package, he has that package.  
  
Q. Mike, I wonder if you can talk about what this means -- a win means to
you, give a little perspective to that.  
COACH ANDERSON: I think it is some unchartered water where we hadn't been
since I have been there. To see it all come together with such a young
basketball team, it tells you the commitment of our guys. I think I got an
excellent coaching staff, when you talk about Melvin Watkins, associate head
coach. This guy has been in the Big 12. He knows all the -- the trainer, Matt
Zimmerman, those guys have been with me at Arkansas. T.J. Cleveland played for
us at Arkansas and happens to be my nephew. Jeff Daniels played junior college
ball with me at Jefferson State. I have known these guys for almost 30-some-
odd years.  
So to have those guys, Ben Lindsey and so on, to have those guys to work with
me, I think it has been a blessing and makes my job a whole lot easier. There
is no question about it. When you start out the season, you set goals and this
was one of our goals. To have an opportunity to actually do it here in these
circumstances, I think it says a lot about our basketball team.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the challenge of having that focus but
consistently having it every day through a tournament like this. I was across
the street this morning, saw Oklahoma, one of the two or three best teams in
the country just not ready to play, not focused. Talk about how it is that
your team had that this week and it seemed like that would be an advantage
going into this NCAA tournament.  
COACH ANDERSON: Once we got to the tournament, I always tell our guys, we
don't change anything we do.  
As a matter of fact, we kind of hopefully amp it up or turn up the volume on
our defense and really get after people, especially in a tournament format.
But it just goes back to -- from day one when we started out, the biggest game
is the game you are playing right now.  
And so that's been my talk to these guys, when you talk about it. Enjoy until
midnight. It sounds cliche-ish, but it is pretty simple. They don't have to
worry about all those things. As we start winning games and everybody, the
prognosticators say you are going to be this, you are going to be that, those
are things they can't control. They just stayed in the moment.  
I think the approach to our guys -- you have to go back to the leadership, the
leadership and the ownership. I think those guys, they want to do well, and I
think they -- they formulate a bond that's really, really special. As I told
them, they got a chance to have a special season and it continues.  
  
Q. How hard was it to suspend those guys last season as a coach, just on the
surface? It cost you at least one game. And if you don't, are you here today
in this situation?  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, I tell you what, that wasn't an easy decision. But it is
about who I am and what I want my program to be about. I want the brand. The
brand is going to be exciting, fun, up-tempo basketball where kids are going
to graduate and they are going to do the right thing on and off the floor.  
I'm a product of what I preach. So with that being said, it was a decision I
made and I'm not necessarily worried about the outcome of games. Games are not
that important, not when you are dealing with kids' lives.  
That's important to me. So hopefully that was a life lesson learned for those
guys as well as my guys that continue to be here. I thought it made a
statement about what our program is going to be. I think as we got to this
point, I think even -- I made a statement to our student-athletes, I made a
statement to our administration, not only that but to the family of the kids
that are here, to the family of the kids that were coming. So a guy like Kimmy
English, I knew his dad. He knew what kind of person I was, what kind of
program I was going to have.  
Hopefully it is going to continue to help us as we continue to recruit in the
future. I think when you get -- I'm big on character, and I think character
can take you a long way. Sometimes it can outweigh the talent because the kids
are going to come and do the right things on and off the floor.  
Not only that, one of the biggest secrets to our basketball program is we
develop kids. They develop. They develop on and off the floor, so when they
leave, they can go and be a productive citizen in society. I'm recruiting, I
hope you all know that. (Smiling).  
That's who I am and that's what our program is going to be about. Thank you.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, congratulations. Good luck next week.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Baylor  76  
Texas - 70

  
CHARLIE FISS: We're joined now by the Baylor Bears, Coach Scott Drew and his
three student-athletes, Curtis Jerrells, Henry Dugat and LaceDarius Dunn.  
Coach, congratulations.  
COACH DREW: Thank you. Players really competed, really battled, were down most
of the game till the second half. And for them to persevere and obviously
Texas is a very big, strong, physical team. We never backed down and we kept
playing and couldn't be more proud and happy for them.  
  
Q. Curtis, which is sweeter, getting to the championship game or beating
Texas?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: I say getting to the championship game.  
I think that we came in here with a mind-set of -- with a task. Today was step
three, and I think that any -- either team that won, that would have been in
this place, they would have got that type of game from us in the tournament.  
  
Q. Curtis, how did you manage to get that rebound, the last free throw with
Dunn with Dexter Pittman was boxing you out like that? How big was that?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: Usually when LaceDarius is at the line, I don't even move
because I know he is going to make it. But I watch the ball and I seen it, it
was falling short. I just used my judgment, and it darted right back and I
just got in there.  
  
Q. Curtis, you have struggled this season shooting against Texas. What kind
of emotions were you going through when you made several big plays in a row
down the stretch today?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: I don't think it had nothing to do with Texas. I shot it
okay. I shot 13 shots, had 13 points. I still wouldn't say I shot it well. I
made free throws and rebounds. I made other plays rather than just scoring the
ball. We got a ton of scorers on this team.  
I can kind of not do well in that area and we can still get a win.  
  
Q. This is for Curtis, Henry and Lace, you guys came into this tournament
the underdog and now you are in the title game. How has your philosophy of
wiping the slate clean in this tournament affected your performance these last
several games?  
HENRY DUGAT: I think it helped us. We came into it, you know, the underdog,
like you said, and we took that as a chip on our shoulder. We came in and knew
what we had to do. Like C.J. said, it is not over yet. We have one more step
to do, and we are willing to do it.  
  
Q. Lace, can you talk about that three you hit. Did you feel like you were
pretty open there with 1:11 left? What was happening on that play?  
LACEDARIUS DUNN: I just felt the first one I had before Damion smacked it out
of bounds. (Laughter) I felt great. I heard Curtis saying we got to get him a
ball, we got to get him a shot. They got it to me and I was willing to shoot
it and it went in. I think it was the biggest shot for my team.  
  
Q. Curtis, can you talk about when you finally got the shot clock turned
off, you guys went to the foul line but you ended up having to make about five
or six free throws there before the game was secured. You guys were smiling in
the huddle. Looked like the confidence was there and you knew what you had to
do.  
CURTIS JERRELLS: First thing I want to say, it is never too late to thank God
so I want to thank God.  
Secondly, we shoot free throws before the game, after the game we had all our
best free-throw shooters on the floor. That's what it is about. Basketball is
about having confidence. Anything you do is about having confidence, and I
think if you look up at your teammate and he is smiling, he got -- you got to
believe that he thinks I am going to make these.  
If you got a frown on your face or you are like, come on man, we need this,
you are putting pressure on your teammates.  
We try to have fun. We try to go out and have fun while we're doing it.  
  
Q. Henry, you have been kind of in a drought from the three-point stripe.
When you made that, what kind of lift did that give you? And, I guess, for
your teammates, what kind of lift did it give you to see Henry knock that
down?  
HENRY DUGAT: It was a big weight lifted off my shoulders. The first one I shot
it went halfway in and came out. I got to give glory to my teammates for
continuing to believe in me and find me. He found me and I was able to knock
it down.  
  
Q. LaceDarius, are you guys looking forward to this next step here? Oklahoma
State and Missouri both get up and down the court a little bit. Looking
forward to that challenge and running a little bit in this championship
game?  
LACEDARIUS DUNN: Exactly. I think we got here for a reason. We got here for
just leaving it out on the court at the end of the game playing 40 minutes.
That's something Coach has been preaching all year.  
I think the last three games we played, everybody just left it out there on
the court and gave it their all. Whoever we face tomorrow, I think we have to
come with the same game plan for the last two games. We will be all right.  
  
Q. Do you have a preference who you play, Oklahoma or Mizzou?  
HENRY DUGAT: I don't think we do. Whoever it is, we are going to be ready for
them. We didn't make it this far for nothing.  
  
Q. Dexter Pittman has been one of the hottest players in the tournament. He
had 21 rebounds yesterday. Talk about the job you guys did neutralizing him
out there?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: Our bigs did the tremendous job inside with him, fighting
him. We did our best to come down and help.  
He is a large man. He needs a lot of attention. I told my guys, I said, man,
that dude has been averaging 20, 23, 24 points a game in the tournament. Y'all
held him to seven. Y'all did y'all's job. We tried our best to contain A.J. We
have been watching that dude for years. The one thing he can do is shoot the
ball.  
If both of them have good games, I think we lose. But we was able to contain
one and get the victory.  
  
Q. Curtis, how did it feel to have all those Oklahoma State fans cheering
you on like that?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: I thought that was our fans cheering for us. I really didn't
care.  
Obviously, if they was cheering for us, that would maybe be a little bit of
disrespect. We split one in the conference. They protected their court. We
protected ours. Like Henry said, it doesn't matter who we face tomorrow. I'm
pretty sure the coach will do a good job of getting us prepared. The players
will be prepared and we will go out and play another game.  
  
Q. Were there one or two things that turned this team from a 5-11 team to
one that's on the verge of going to the NCAA tournament?  
COACH DREW: I think God gets a lot of that credit, just like Curtis said.  
The big thing is during the conference season, people don't realize how tough
the Big 12 is. I mean, every team -- it doesn't matter who it is, you got to
bring your A game to win. We played a lot of non-conference teams and we were
very successful against them.  
I don't know why our RPI we finished third best conference because it is
tough. That and number two, we started losing -- I think we lost confidence.
When you lose close games, that is really tough on you.  
And then the big thing is we had such high expectations and goals set for
ourselves. Ones you realize you don't meet those, it is tough. Once we got to
the conference tournament, we knew it was a new season. That weight vest was
lifted off, and, again, guys are really playing well, like we did in the non-
conference.  
  
Q. The streak had reached 24. How had you come to view that streak?  
COACH DREW: I really didn't like that streak (laughter). It is a situation
where you had so many close games with Texas and chances and you just knew it
was a matter of time you would break through.  
I was really hoping it would be with this group of guys, though, because they
had persevered and been through so much from their freshman year until now.
I'm so happy they are the ones that broke through the streak.  
  
Q. Talk about that closing -- at the end of the first half, you're down 12.
You run off, I think, eight straight points to get back in it.  
COACH DREW: We didn't take the lead going into halftime, but we were able to
get enough momentum where we went into the locker room and we were feeling
good about our situation and felt that second half we could be successful.  
  
Q. You have been able to play these last three games like there is nothing
to lose. Now you are playing for something. What is the mind-set going into
tomorrow with that title -- with that tournament spot just sitting there for
you?  
COACH DREW: I don't think you should bring that up to the guys (laughter).
We're just going to keep doing what we have been doing.  
  
Q. C.J. was talking you had to stop at least one of those guys, Pittman or
A.J. Can you talk about the job the defense did.  
COACH DREW: I think C.J. -- in the locker room, they just really told our bigs
they did a great job because I know they are all going to need ice because
Texas is very, very physical and they do a great job playing hard. Our guys
really battled, especially second half when first half Texas kind of had their
way with things and we really did a good job -- and then the big thing was I
thought our help-side defense and our rotations was much better, too, tonight.  
  
Q. Scott, do you believe in destiny for this team?  
COACH DREW: I believe in God, and I know he can do miracles. I definitely
believe in it.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you spent more time doing mental preparation to get
this team ready to try to win four games in four days.  
COACH DREW: A lot of people say coaches become psychologists. When you are
losing, it is tough. It is tough on the coaches, it is tough on the guys.  
Again, just like any of us in life, when you see your kid struggling, there is
nothing that brings you more joy than to see them have success, especially
when they are doing the right things. I mean -- and our guys did. Even when we
were losing, they were in the gym, they were working hard.  
The seniors made sure it never got to a situation where people were pointing
fingers and really dividing the team.  
  
Q. It looked like A.J. kind of shot you guys out of the zone early in the
game. I just wondered if you can talk about how you guys didn't lose
confidence in what you are able to do defensively and come back in the second
half to play like you did.  
COACH DREW: Well, I think the man helped give us confidence. When we came back
to the zone, we were a little more aware of A.J. A.J. for four years he seems
to play well against Baylor. If you want him to have a great game in the NCAA,
make sure that team is wearing a B and if he thinks it is Baylor, they're
good.  
I mean, he is as good a catch-and-shoot player you will find in the nation. He
gets it off so quick, it makes it very, very tough to stop.  
  
Q. Can you chat briefly about Missouri and Oklahoma State and what
challenges might pose tomorrow?  
COACH DREW: Both teams are obviously on a roll. Both teams are successful.
Both teams play fast. So we'll wait and see who wins and then we'll prepare
and knock out a game plan from there.  
Again, Missouri and Oklahoma State have had great runs and they will hopefully
do well in the NCAA tournament.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you and again congratulations. Good luck tomorrow.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Missouri  67  
Oklahoma State - 59

  
CHARLIE FISS: Okay. We are joined now by the Cowboys of Oklahoma State, Coach
Travis Ford, his student-athletes James Anderson and Marshall Moses.  
Coach, we'll call on you first for your thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH FORD: Congratulate Missouri. Wish them the best of luck as they
continue.  
We just didn't play one of our better games today. Not taking anything away
from Missouri, when you are not making shots, neither one of us were. When you
are not making shots, it is imperative you take care of the basketball.
Obviously the more opportunities you get the better off you will be hopefully.
17 turnovers in a game where you are not shooting the ball well is going to
hurt you a little bit because we did some other things well, rebounded and
played defense the way we wanted to really. Accomplished what we set out to
do.  
But we just couldn't get shots to fall. Didn't take care of the ball
particularly well.  
Even though we outrebounded them by eight, they rebounded the ball when it
counted, the last three to four minutes of the game. They got some big
rebounds on us and rebounded the ball when it counted. So you got to give them
credit.  
Our kids played hard. They fought hard, no question. It is just one of those
games. We just didn't play well today. Haven't played like that in a little
while. Hopefully we can put this behind us.  
Just congratulate Missouri. They won a good game.  
Marshall, can you talk about when Byron came out in the second half and
obviously was going to get to play. It looked like that gave everybody a big
emotional boost. Why do you think it didn't really transpire into success for
you guys?  
MARSHALL MOSES: I don't think we can really put it on Byron. I was glad to see
he came back into the game in the second half. With or without Byron, we still
-- like Coach said, we didn't rebound when we needed to and do some of the
right things we needed to do to win the game.  
Like Coach said, taking away nothing from Missouri, they played a great game
and they played hard. I don't think Byron was the reason we took a loss
tonight. He played hard and he played hurt which took a lot for him to do
that. I think just like Coach said, we just didn't do some things right. We
didn't play the way we had normally been playing over our winning streak. We
need to get back to the way we played before that in post-season play.  
James, was it a disruption when Byron went out or was it something you were
able to overcome in the first half?  
JAMES ANDERSON: We were sad to see he got hurt. We told Keiton had to step up
and make plays and run the team since Byron was out.  
At times, I think -- he did a pretty good job the whole time, but he kind of
-- I don't know. He wasn't prepared mentally for the challenge. I think he did
an overall good job just stepping up.  
To see Byron come back, I think it kind of released a little pressure from
Keiton. It was just a tough game for both of the guards and a tough game for
us overall. We made some bad turnovers and we turned the other team over, too.
We just couldn't convert, and Missouri played a good game and got the best of
the 50/50 balls at the end. (Take out that last period).  
  
Q. James, would you just kind of put the latter part of the season in
perspective, talk about what you guys have accomplished as you look forward to
playing on.  
JAMES ANDERSON: I think we accomplished a lot this year. Just the way we
started the season out, I think we had got into 3-6 and started a new season
with our last seven games, kind of went on a little winning streak. Just took
each game one by one.  
That's how we got here today. Now we just got to put all this aside and just
get ready for the rest of the post-play.  
  
Q. James, all of you guys up there said you didn't do exactly what you
wanted to do tonight. It wasn't the way you played in those seven games. Was
this a wake-up call? Was it a learning experience? What did you learn tonight
that you can take with you?  
JAMES ANDERSON: Yes, it was a learning experience. Tonight we learned that we
got to rebound when we are not hitting the shots. That's what Missouri did.  
We outrebounded them, but they rebounded when it counted. That's what we got
to learn from. When we are not knocking shots, everybody's got to crash the
boards and come up with the big rebounds.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about just you missed 16 straight threes to start the
game. Just kind of -- that's -- for a team to shoot so many threes and make so
many threes, what the mode is and how does that affect you when it seems like
none of them are going in.  
MARSHALL MOSES: It definitely affects us when we are not making threes. We
have big-time three-point shooters on our team, and that's a big part of what
we do. If I'm not mistaken, I think we are somewhere in the upper ladder, if
not number one, in three-point shots made in the Big 12. Of course, it will
hurt when we are not making threes.  
The key to what we got to do is when we are not making threes, like Coach said
again, we got to rebound the ball. When teams aren't shooting well, the team
that rebounds the most, especially offensive rebounds is usually the team that
comes out with a victory or fights to the end to get the win.  
When we are not making threes, we have to dig in deeper on defense and follow
the game plan to a tee even more to make up for the shots we don't make.  
  
Q. James, you went out 13 minutes and something with your fourth foul, you
sat out almost seven minutes. That's when the game sort of turned. Can you
talk about how frustrating it was sitting there watching the minutes tick by
and the lead evaporating, eventually get bigger for Missouri.  
JAMES ANDERSON: Yes, I did get a little frustrated, and I wanted to be in the
game, do whatever I can to contribute to the team.  
Whatever I could do to help.  
Me just sitting over there on the bench when I could help my team, I got some
cheap fouls at times. That's something I got to learn from, quit reaching and
fouling so I can stay in and help my team.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you for coming. Good luck next week.  
We will take questions for Coach Ford.  
  
Q. What did you learn about this basketball team during this run, 8-9 coming
into this semifinal championship game?  
COACH FORD: I think they have learned a lot, grown up a lot, improved a lot.
It has taken us as a coaching staff as well the team to really learn each
other, a long time, to understand our best rotations, understand what's best
for our team. It takes them a little while to understand our system, coaching
philosophy, and style of coaching, things like that.  
I think that has a lot to do with it. We had a few heart-to-heart discussions
after our Texas game at Texas when we weren't very proud of ourselves. We had
a little wake-up call there.  
But there is a lot of things. Defense improved. Rebounds improved. They have
come a long way. This was a team, I thought, early in the season -- even
though we won some games, they let little things bother them too much. They
live in the past. They would make a mistake and it would affect three or four
plays later.  
We told them it is about having a winning attitude, a winning attitude. You
can be intense and be passionate about the game, but you need to channel it in
the right way. This has taken these guys a little while to understand that
philosophy of that winning attitude.  
Once they started experiencing some success, I think they wanted a little bit
more of it and they started seeing a light at the end of the tunnel.  
So I think Byron and Terrell were tired of hearing they hadn't been to the
NCAA tournament. I even reminded them of that. Things like that are motivating
factors early in the year, that that needs to be a goal. That's something this
program hasn't done in a very long time.  
It was just a progression of a lot of different things. But learning how to
win at the highest level and learning how to win when there is something on
the line, that takes time. It takes time.  
These guys started to understand how important defense is to success, how
important rebounding is to success. And then we got to the point, and I put
myself at the head of the list, where I said we are not going to make any more
excuses. This was after the Texas game. I am not going to talk that we don't
have size, depth. I told them nobody is -- we are going to concentrate on what
we can do rather than on things we can't do.  
We started holding people accountable which I wasn't doing earlier in the year
as far as some guys I thought had to play 38 minutes a game or we didn't have
a chance. I was letting them get away with some things that I normally
wouldn't and we started holding guys a little more accountable to making the
right plays, being in position defensively, not just scoring and things like
that but doing other things to help our basketball team win.  
I think all those things combined helped us get to this point.  
  
Q. Last night looked like you were really in control on offense, and tonight
you looked like you rushed a lot. Was that due to what Missouri was doing
defensively?  
COACH FORD: Definitely. Definitely. No question. Things were going our way
until we got in some extreme foul trouble first half, and then obviously Byron
goes down and we just didn't get out of that first half the way we needed to.  
And then you get back in the second half and Byron is playing on one leg. He
is fine. He's fine. He just couldn't get into the flow of things.  
When you are not shooting the ball well, it affects so many other things. Both
teams weren't shooting the ball well, it was not just us.  
Missouri started rebounding the ball better, started doing some things better
when things weren't -- they had other things to go to, where we had Marshall
to go to. We probably didn't get him the ball as much as we needed to at
times.  
Byron, no question, we wouldn't even have been in this game without Byron.
Byron struggled tonight and he was injured. I love the effort and heart that
he came back and played with.  
Just wasn't our basketball team tonight. That's nothing -- Missouri did a
great job, and they did a great job on defense and everything. I thought our
guys, they had their head down and were very, very emotional and disappointed.  
I told them, yeah, we wish we could be in the final game tomorrow but, hey,
keep your head up. This just wasn't our night for whatever reason.  
  
Q. Travis, how do you feel about your team going to the tournament? And then
also with Byron, is his injury anything that could bother you next week?  
COACH FORD: No, he's fine. Byron is okay. I feel very good about our team. I
think we are playing as well as anybody.  
Somebody asked me, were we tired because of three games in three days and we
don't play a lot of guys. I told them tonight, yeah. If we were making shots,
you don't think about being tired. When you start missing as many shots as we
did, we started thinking about being tired, I think.  
So I'm very high on our team right now, and that doesn't have anything to do
with this game really, the reasons I am high on the team.  
One of those games. Missouri won. We lost. And they probably -- and they
didn't play that well. They probably stood up here and didn't play their best
either. One of those games where two teams were struggling to put the ball in
the hole and they came up with big plays when they needed to. I think our team
knows we can play better than this, and I think they believe in that. That's
why I'm high on our basketball team right now.  
  
Q. We were told -- you tell us, what exactly is wrong with Byron. Also, you
said two different things. You said he's fine, but you also said he was
playing on one leg.  
COACH FORD: Well, yeah, he was limping around a little bit but he's fine. He
was normally limping when made his turnovers. (Laughter).  
He is okay. I am not sure exactly what it is yet, so I don't want to comment
exactly what it is. But, yeah, he is going to be okay. He's fine.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Missouri  67  
Oklahoma State - 59

  
CHARLIE FISS: We are ready to begin with the University of Missouri and Coach
Mike Anderson, his student-athletes are J.T. Tiller, Leo Lyons and Zaire
Taylor.  
Coach, congratulations.  
COACH ANDERSON: Thank you. We talked about coming to this tournament. I guess
the motto is always survive and advance, and that's what we did. We survived
tonight.  
It wasn't a thing of beauty, but sometimes ugly is better for us. I thought
our defense was pretty good. Hats off to Oklahoma State. I thought they had
momentum. They played well last night. They played well tonight.
Unfortunately, Eaton went down. I thought some of their guys stepped up.  
What can you say about Eaton? He has the heart of a lion. The guy came right
back and still continued to have an impact on the game. Can't take away
anything from our guys. I thought Leo, J.T., Zaire, Matt Lawrence, DeMarre
Carroll, I thought all those guys, really, really stayed the course.  
I thought our bench came in and played well. So it was certainly -- we are
going to be the ultimate team. I thought the second half was much, much better
than the first half and much to our liking. It seemed like the second half was
big for our basketball team.  
Ford has done a tremendous time with his kids. I thought they were worn out. I
thought conditioning was a big part of this game and Eaton being hurt but the
shooting was what it was. I always say shooting comes and goes, and it went
tonight. I thought our defense was also constant.  
  
Q. Obviously you would like to be leading at halftime. At this point, if you
are still close, do you kind of think, we got them where we want them, the way
you play in the second half?  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: I feel like you always got a chance to win the game. You don't
play the game to be down at halftime, of course. Whether you are down 20 or
you're up 20, it is always a ball game. You got to play every play to win.  
You can't play the game to win, you have to play every play at this point
because everybody is hungry, as you can see. Eaton, that was incredible that
he even came back out and played after that. The whole team, they gave it
everything to the last -- to the wire. I mean, we were up and they still were
knocking shots down to the very last shot. We couldn't give up.  
  
Q. Zaire, at this point last year you're sitting on the bench watching. Talk
about how that felt for you and how you're feeling now having the weekend that
you are.  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: It is just a blessing. I thank God every day that I even had
this opportunity to come here and play on a level like this. Just playing --
for a team to play this good makes it that much more better.  
It is just a good feeling. It is just a blessing. You just have to thank God
every day for all our blessings.  
  
Q. Leo, can you talk a bit about where you guys were as a team last year and
a lot of the adversity you were facing to be in a situation now where you will
be playing for a Big 12 title game tomorrow?  
LEO LYONS: The difference between our team last year and this year is probably
our leadership. Coach puts a lot of stress on us to lead. Seeing last year and
going through that and going through the ups and downs taught me how to be a
better leader and when it's time to speak and time to show with your actions.  
This year we got four good leaders out there plus our guards. It helps our
team stay in the right direction.  
  
Q. Zaire and J.T., can you describe what happened the second half and how
you saw it turning around? Zaire, can you share what you were talking to, I
think -- who was it? Paige at the end of the game on Oklahoma State, you guys
were talking with about 15 seconds left on the court.  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: I don't remember. (Smiling).  
COACH ANDERSON: J.T. is tired. I'm telling y'all, J.T. is tired.  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: I don't remember what we were talking about.  
J.T. TILLER: I think in the second half, we just -- when we went in at
halftime, we saw that the guards were really making the difference on their
team against our defense. They were the ones making the plays and getting it
inside. We weren't pressuring like we should have.  
When we came out in the second half, we knew we had to pressure them to
actually get to their team.  
  
Q. This question is for Leo. Your next opponent, the Baylor Bears, it seems
with these last couple games their trademark seems to be sort of the upset
special. Does that put any more pressure on you as a player?  
LEO LYONS: Not at all. I don't consider it an upset because we are not that
type of team you have to come out and dominate somebody. We are going to stop
what they are doing because their guards have been hot. We witnessed it
before. This is a chance for us to show where our team is at now comparing to
the past years.  
  
Q. Zaire, can you explain why the number of threes and the strategy of
spreading the floor so much.  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: For us or for them?  
  
Q. You.  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: The first play -- after the first play, I realized -- I think
Leo set a screen for me and they went under the screen. Typically when you go
under the screen, it gives them a shot. I felt like they didn't respect me as
a shooter.  
I missed that first one, but after the first one, things started to go in my
favor as far as hitting the shot. I just had to keep shooting. We work on
shooting every day. Coach just kept -- Coach believed in me after the first
miss. And he said go ahead if you got the shot. Because I didn't shoot for
about six plays after that. Coach had to tell me to shoot. Once he told me, I
felt -- it made me feel that much more confident in my own shot, just knowing
that he believed in me and that my teammates believed in me because they set
the screens.  
  
Q. My question was: Why so many threes?  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: Today? They were sagging. It gave us opportunities to hit open
shots. We got good shooters. Kim was going through a slump. Matt Lawrence, he
is clearly a good shooter, one of the best in the country. J.T., everybody,
even Leo and DeMarre can knock threes down if you give them the opportunity.  
LEO LYONS: I can get a three (smiling)..  
  
Q. Zaire, all year it seems like you have been coming up with clutch
performances, winners. Today you had a big game. What is it about the pressure
situations that makes you -- that brings the best out in you?  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: I don't know. It is a good feeling. That's what we all live for,
even when we are little, if I remember correctly. When you are five years old,
you always count down before you take your last shot, you count down five,
four, three, two, one and then you shoot it and hope it goes in. If you miss,
you get a chance to do it again. (Smiling).  
LEO LYONS: You are telling a story.  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: Honestly, it is just -- everybody has that feeling of wanting to
be in that atmosphere. As student-athletes on this stage, we all get a chance
to do it. That's what we live for. It is a blessing and a good feeling.  
  
Q. Following up on Mike's question, was it -- were there too many threes?
Obviously it worked out. Were you worried that you were taking too many
threes?  
COACH ANDERSON: I thought early on -- obviously they were packing the paint
and we didn't make any shots. And I thought we got tentative about it.  
At times we did attack. I thought in the first half we did attacke it. As
Zaire said, they packed it. I mean, so they are going to give you something. I
think we got some guys that can knock some shots down. Same thing with them,
they didn't knock shots down either.  
It was a game that had to come down to defense tonight. It just seemed like it
was a lid. We couldn't find anybody until the second half. Zaire made a couple
of them in the second half, in the first half. Once Matt started making them,
I thought you saw us in attack mode. I thought in the first half we settled.  
We played a lot of guys. I have young guys that they think every shot is a
good shot. They will let it fly.  
You got to be careful with that. There is freedom but at the same time you
want our guys to understand what is a good shot and what the defense presents.
I thought we did a good job of getting into the heart of the defense in the
second half and got to the free-throw lines and we had some -- knocked down
some shots.  
  
Q. First time you guys played them, they scored 95 points against you. Did
you use that as motivation for your team to try and stop a little bit? And
talk about the job you did against them tonight defensively.  
COACH ANDERSON: I thought this game had nothing to do with the last game.
Obviously, I thought in that particular game I mean, you use the things that
happen to your advantage. We were up almost 19, 20 points, and I look up and,
boy, I tell you what, it was a nine-point game with maybe like a minute or
something to go.  
I look up, it is a three-point game. We had the intentional foul. We learned
from that. So we knew that they are never out of a game. And I thought we are
the same type of team. We are never out of the game. We keep talking about the
thing that we are going to hang our hats on is our defense.  
Offense can come and go. And it went tonight. I will tell you, it went south
tonight. The thing you got to continue to do is play defense. I thought at
halftime, I thought we were in pretty good shape. We made a stop right there
at the end and I thought coming out in the second half, it was important to
get the momentum.  
I thought we did -- and we were more in attack mode, I thought, and we
attacked them. As I said, Eaton, he is like Superman tonight. He showed up.
When he showed up for those guys, I think it just energized those other guys.  
They hadn't made any threes either. They started making them and, boy, you
could just see the crowd got into it. But to our guys' credit, we answered
every call. Leo makes a big shot. Justin Safford makes a big shot, gets a big
rebound. Zaire makes some big free throws, and J.T. makes big plays down the
stretch.  
You got to have guys make plays. It was a gutsy performance by our team as
well as theirs.  
  
Q. Last night you called the semifinals unchartered waters for a lot of
members of your team, or for all of them in that manner. When you look back to
last year, just how special, just how fortunate is it for your team to be
playing for a title tomorrow?  
COACH ANDERSON: It tells you the makeup of the guys that are here. I got to
give credit to the nucleus of the guys that have been through the storms, been
through the downs.  
Now they have listened. I think they have worked extremely hard. They have
shown the leadership, as Leo said. They have shown the ownership. When that
takes place, I think they have engaged the young guys to where the young guys
feel like they are really, really a part of what we are doing.  
That's important. So I go back to the nucleus of those guys have been here,
Leo, DeMarre, J.T., Michael, Jr., my son, Justin Safford. Those guys have been
through here. Zaire, he was sitting out. But those guys, they are
spearheading, infusing the young guys, I think that helps our basketball. It
kind of completes it a little bit.  
It is special but it can really, really get special. I think these guys have
paid a price and you are seeing the rewards.  
I said, I always think the tournament format, it favors a team like ours
because of the depth that we have and how we play. I thought it was true
tonight. Neither team shot the ball well. I thought our defense and just the
energy coming off the bench was huge.  
  
Q. Do you think Zaire has a little bit of a knack for rising to occasions
like this? I mean, he did demonstrate it at the end of a couple games and
coming through tonight with a season high in points.  
COACH ANDERSON: I think he is a gamer. He is a gamer. The guy makes plays
going down the stretch.  
I like those guys that can have an impact on the game. Sometimes it is not
even about their offense. But the great thing about him, he is going to do the
things defensively. He has big deflections going down the stretch. It gets
contagious. I think J.T. is one of those guys.  
When you got a guard tandem like that, I tell you what, J.T. alluded to it, he
talked about the guards got the best of him in the first half.  
I thought in the second half our guys really, really stepped up to the plate
and I think that's -- if you are going to have a good team, your guard plays,
it has got to be good. I think we got some good guard play, and I think we
have young guys coming off the bench to give us quality, quality minutes.  
It is a fun team. I said it earlier in the year. It is refreshing with some
guys that, number one, they are coachable, they listen. They are having fun.
If you watch our basketball team, they are just out there having fun.  
  
Q. Coach Anderson, you mentioned conditioning was a major part of this
victory here tonight. And your next opponent, the Baylor Bears, they have had
to fight through tough battles with the Kansas Jayhawks and now the Texas
Longhorns. You yourself have just overcome persevering Oklahoma State team.
How do you keep your own team refreshed while at the same time maybe playing
off the fatigue of your opponent?  
COACH ANDERSON: It is going to be interesting. I think they're playing -- they
are playing -- there is a lot at stake for both teams. And so I think
sometimes the conditioning and all that stuff kind of goes out the window. You
get an opportunity to play in the championship game, that's a big deal. I'm
sure it is for them.  
They are playing awful well. As a matter of fact, it brought back some
flashbacks from two years ago. You got Jerrells and Tweety playing well,
Rogers playing well. Of course, LaceDarius Dunn. He was unconscious. We have a
chance to play -- play them earlier in the year. That game had no bearing on
this game.  
There is a championship at stake, and I'm sure Scott will have those guys
ready to play. I'm sure we'll have a chance to go get a few hours of rest and
hopefully put on a better performance.  
I know everyone didn't come to this particular championship game in, but it
should be an exciting game to say the least. Thank you.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you. Good luck tomorrow.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2009

  

### [A.J. Abrams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15572)

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

### [Damion James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18425)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Baylor  76  
Texas - 70

  
CHARLIE FISS: We are ready to begin with the University of Texas and Coach
Rick Barnes, his student-athletes A.J. Abrams and Damion James.  
Coach, we will go to you first.  
COACH BARNES: We are ready for questions.  
  
Q. Rick, anything in particular at the end where you thought caused it to
get away when you had a lead?  
COACH BARNES: I didn't like the way we closed the first half. I didn't like
that. We did miss some free throws at an important part of the game.  
With that said, we missed a wide-open lay-up at the rim and we actually missed
an opportunity from the elbow that is a great lay for us. So, you know, that's
where it was.  
When we needed to make those plays, we didn't make them.  
  
Q. A.J., did you ever think you would lose to Baylor?  
A.J. ABRAMS: I mean, I don't think you want to say that. You want to go in and
try to win every game. Baylor is a good team. They had some unfortunate
incidents that happened this year where they have always been in the game and
just couldn't pull it out. I think they are putting it all together right now,
and they played a good game for the most part.  
  
Q. Even though you are not going to win the championship here, what do you
feel like you got out of these three games up here as a team?  
A.J. ABRAMS: We saw that we can play through Dex. He became more of a force
for us. We knew what he could do.  
I think it was kind of a -- somewhat of a breaking-out party for him knowing
he can play longer stretches of minutes and just be a dominant force inside.
That's one thing we can take from this.  
  
Q. Damion, did it feel like they got to you on the offensive boards a little
bit?  
DAMION JAMES: We gave up -- I gave up a couple offensive rebounds early that
led to a couple easy baskets.  
They really pounded us on the glass, I see. We just got to look at it and stay
focused.  
  
Q. Rick, the play where Dexter got his second foul on the pass from Mason,
do you feel like that hurt your momentum where you had to take him out of the
game when you were going pretty well at the time?  
COACH BARNES: Yeah. You can't give it to them in that situation. Justin did it
twice. But the one I thought was more hurtful was the third foul.  
  
Q. Obviously you got great play out of Dexter for this tournament and seemed
like Varez Ward played a lot better. Do you feel like you got a lot of
positive things out of this week?  
COACH BARNES: I think we can play any style we have to play against. I think
we -- obviously if we can get everything playing, we did come away with some
really good things.  
It is always disappointing when you lose, but Dexter, I think, the two days
back-to-back, playing the most minutes, I thought he would probably feel it
more than anybody, and I think he did early.  
But we thought we could manage it through working the clock. But then the foul
trouble sat him down a little bit. Overall, with Varez coming back with what
he did -- I thought Connor did some really good things today. He really did.
He did some good things in there. I feel good where we are right now. We got a
chance to do -- I told the team, this is what we always played for, Texas to
be in the NCAA tournament and this is the one that counts and this is the one
we got to try to do what we can do with it.  
  
Q. Do you feel Dexter -- it seemed like tonight Baylor focused on him and
opened up A.J. on the outside. Do you feel it has developed into a situation
where they have to pick who they are going to guard?  
COACH BARNES: Definitely, they are going to have to decide that certain teams
are not going to guard certain guys. That's why we have to shuffle lineups and
create some space at certain times.  
I mean, I don't think there is any question -- I have said this, we can play a
number of different ways.  
Defensively, for the most part, we were really pretty good here with the
exception today we just gave up too many offensive rebounds. You take that
away and, you know -- even with all that said and done, we are up four under
two minutes and missed a lay-up and missed a wide-open shot.  
I think Gary was surprised that he was that open, and that's his shot. Again,
this time of year is going to be a very fine line between winning and losing
and coming down the stretch, we didn't make the plays we needed to make.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you.

### [Marcus Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19453)

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [Tyshawn Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19452)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Baylor  71  
Kansas - 64

  
CHARLIE FISS: Joined now by the Kansas Jayhawks and Coach Bill Self and his
two student-athletes, Tyshawn Taylor and Marcus Morris.  
Coach, opening comment on today's game?  
COACH SELF: You know, the game obviously was not a well-played game by Kansas
at all. I thought Baylor controlled the game from the get-go. They were
certainly better than us from the start. We got exactly what we deserved.  
  
Q. Tyshawn and Marcus, for how well you played in the regular conference
season, what was it like for your first experience in the Big 12 tournament
with a loss like this?  
TYSHAWN TAYLOR: It is disappointing. We worked real hard to get here. We let
this one slip away from us. We started off bad, and they played well early,
and we had to fight back the whole game. We had the lead, but it slipped away
from us. So it is real disappointing.  
MARCUS MORRIS: Same. I fell as though we got off to a slow start and we were
fighting back the entire game. At the end, we made a couple mistakes at the
end that cost us the game.  
  
Q. How does this affect your confidence, and where do you go from here?  
TYSHAWN TAYLOR: We just got to look past it now. We can't get it back. We
still have NCAA to look forward to.  
We are going to go home and regroup and just try to be better in the next
couple weeks.  
MARCUS MORRIS: Basically go home and watch film and see what we did wrong and
just try to not do the same thing our first game in NCAA. Make sure we don't
lose in the first round.  
  
Q. Marcus, when y'all battled back and got up by five, did you think you got
them on the rim at that point? How did you expect them to react?  
MARCUS MORRIS: I think we did, but you can't count on a team. They had been
making threes and making almost every shot they put up. You can't count them
out. We went on a run and we couldn't uphold the run.  
They were just the better team today.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thanks for coming.  
We will now take questions for Coach Self.  
  
Q. Bill, looked like early on right off the bat you were really trying to
get the guys going early on. Is this something you saw coming a little bit ?  
COACH SELF: Not really. I thought we -- we practiced really well since
Saturday. And so I really didn't.  
But we -- I don't know how you guys viewed it. I thought we looked like a
really tired team today. There was no energy at all.  
Our two key guys got to provide that leadership. We just didn't do a good job
today. We were definitely a half step slow or a full step, and they beat us to
the majority of the loose balls. We let them get comfortable. You can't let
good shooters get comfortable.  
Obviously we missed some easy shots and the further we got behind, the basket
started shrinking a little bit and felt like we were shooting at the fair.  
And then we finally got the lid off of it. We played decent for a stretch and
then played pretty poorly down the stretch. They played good. They deserve to
win the game.  
  
Q. Last three games, somebody from the other team has come out on fire. If
it is not Voskuil, it is Gary Johnson or Lace Dunn today. Is that something
you can tell them to stop and get in their face and say it stops right here?  
COACH SELF: I thought Damion James kicked us Saturday and Voskuil obviously in
Lubbock.  
But today we know how to guard Dunn and we did not guard him the way he should
be defended.  
And so he is a good shooter, and good player. We let him get comfortable.
Very, very discouraging. It is something you tried to hang your hat on and
something we did a very poor job of.  
  
Q. Bill, you guys have rallied from some big deficits in recent games. Is
that something that catches up with the team after a while?  
COACH SELF: I would say probably yes. But today we didn't play very well. We
had a five-point lead and you had to get some stops at that point and Baylor
really, they made a couple of shots right after that. Dugat made a shot and
something else happened. Next thing you know, that lead evaporated pretty
quick.  
But, you know, the whole thing is, this time of year, in my opinion, you got
to play smart, you got to guard, you got to rebound. I didn't think we were
very good in any of those areas today.  
  
Q. With such a young team, how do you repair their psyche for next week with
the NCAA?  
COACH SELF: You know, that's a great question because we're not very tough if
we can't come back from this.  
I mean, you shouldn't base your entire psyche or confidence level on one game.
I think we probably got some confidence over time. But I mean, we did a bad
job today as a group so we had some individuals not play very well.  
Everybody has been telling us or them that, you know, how happy they are with
them and all this and that. I mean, today is a reality check. First thing we
are doing, we go back when we get to the hotel and go to school tomorrow and
make all the players walk around class tomorrow with all the other students
wondering why are you back here already? And then we will practice as hard as
we have ever practiced in the next two days and get them thinking about that
as opposed to worrying about what just happened.  
  
Q. Can you talk about trying to crack their zone and the problems it
created?  
COACH SELF: Well, we got the ball to the middle a lot earlier. We didn't
convert. We bailed them out by shooting jump shots as opposed to taking the
ball to the basket.  
What a zone does -- and that was a stretched-out zone where the middle was
open. What a zone does, it creates doubt. We weren't aggressive. We didn't get
to play up against it. I don't know how many shots we had the second half that
we took a step outside our shooting area. Just didn't play up against it and
didn't drive it near enough. They gapped it and made you drive it.  
At times we did a good job against it. But, certainly -- we usually play
pretty good against a 2-3 zone. But certainly for the most part, I thought it
was very effective against us. It also took us away from second-chance points
for whatever reason. We didn't do a good job on offensive glass like you would
think we would when we shoot that poorly against a zone where it is tougher to
block out.  
All in all, just pretty poor performance offensively.  
  
Q. What did you think of Baylor's post play, especially in Rogers and
Mamadou and how they were able to contain Aldrich a little bit?  
COACH SELF: I think sometimes in a zone it is easier to take a big guy out.
But I thought Kevin played very well. I thought Lomers was good, and I thought
Diene was fabulous. If you look at their post guys, they didn't turn it over,
they blocked shots, they altered shots. Diene -- the biggest block in the game
is when it was a one-point game and Sherron had the lay-up and Diene made a
great block.  
I thought their post play was very, very good. Very good.  
  
Q. Just following up on that Cole against five shots. Does that contribute
to the zone or did you just not work the ball enough?  
COACH SELF: I think it is a tribute to their zone. I think it is a tribute to
our perimeter not doing a great job. Cole has to take responsibility for it,
too. Guys have to find a way to get the ball. You saw what I saw. This was a
game in which he labored probably as much as he has at any point in time this
year.  
  
Q. Do you know how Sherron is feeling about his performance and the way the
game went?  
COACH SELF: I think the whole team feels poorly. Here's a couple of guys that
made first-team all-league and you want to come to our showcase of our league,
which this is, the tournament, and perform your best and kind of validate what
everybody else has been saying about you the whole year. We obviously didn't
do that.  
The thing about it is we did a lot of things poorly today. But the biggest
reason we played poorly was because Baylor played good. So when you talk about
us not playing well, we didn't do this, we didn't do that, you can always say
that after a loss. The bottom line is they were better than us today.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Texas  61  
Kansas State - 58

  
CHARLIE FISS: Ready to begin with the Wildcats from Kansas State, Coach Frank
Martin and his two student-athletes, Jacob Pullen and Jamar Samuels.  
Coach, opening comment on today's game?  
COACH MARTIN: Just a hard-fought game. We know Texas is a good defensive
basketball team. They just beat us. It is hard to win when you don't make
shots, and we obviously didn't make enough shots to beat a good basketball
team today.  
  
Q. Jacob, can you just talk about the difficulty on the offensive end and
how frustrating it was.  
JACOB PULLEN: No, their bigs did a good job of hedge and screens. They're real
physical, so they kind of knocked us off some screens. And some shots just
didn't fall. We got good looks the entire game. Our bigs got good looks in the
paint. Me and Denny and Fred got good shots from around the perimeter. A lot
of shots just didn't fall tonight.  
  
Q. Jamar, can you talk about the game that Dexter Pittman had and how
difficult he was to deal with?  
JAMAR SAMUELS: He is just a load inside. He is 6'11", 320. I had to guard him
for a possession. It was hard just trying to get over him. I think we did a
so-so job on him. I think we could have done better, but he is a good player.  
CHARLIE FISS: Now we will entertain questions for Coach Martin.  
  
Q. Did you feel that way, that you guys just got good looks, that the ball
just wasn't going down today?  
COACH MARTIN: We took open shots after open shots and just wasn't going in.
Shots we have been making here for the last two months.  
I am proud of these kids. They fought their rear-ends off. Give Texas credit.
They made our two little guards have to go finish in traffic in the paint. And
we got in there and we were able to make plays other times, other times we
didn't. Bottom line, you know, Joe, you sat there and watched the game just
like I did. You can count the number of lay-ups uncontested, free throws. Hard
to win when you don't put the ball in the basket.  
When you play a good basketball team, you are not going to get many easy
opportunities. When we had easy opportunities, wide-open step-in threes,
point-blank lay-ups, we keep missing, you are not going to win against Texas
if you don't take advantage of your easy opportunities because they come
through so few and far between.  
  
Q. What do you think today's outcome does for your team's chances to make
the NCAA tournament?  
COACH MARTIN: I'm not on that committee. I wish I could answer that.  
I like giving people intelligent answers. I like answering questions. I have
no control over what those people do. What do you want me to tell you? We
don't deserve to be there? Of course, we deserve to be there. These kids have
busted their rear-ends for us. We ended up as the No. 4 seed in the Big 12
tournament seeding-wise. We are tied for seventh.  
Everyone is trying to compare our resumes to the Big 12 teams. You tell me how
many of these bubble teams have as many top 50 wins as we do. Tell me how many
bubble teams around the country won five true road games. You tell me how many
of these other people that are on the bubble -- not the Big 12 teams. See,
everyone is trying to argue us against A&M. Go find other résumés around the
country. Look at our résumé, look at our résumé. Hide the RPI number. Look at
everything else. Only one team has won more games over us in the last 12 and
that's Memphis. Something to be said about that.  
Do we have a great non-conference schedule? No. You know what I find ironic,
everyone in the country that played Butler gets credit for playing a good
basketball team. Nobody played Butler at Butler other than their conference
teams. We go and play Cleveland State at Cleveland State. Everyone views that
as a bad win. Give me a break, you know?  
Everyone says you got to take the whole thing to create a résumé, which I
totally agree with. That's why you play 31 games. When you got a basketball
team that's as young -- as looking to define who we were early in the season,
and our three non-conference losses came in the second -- between the second
and third week of the season, and you want to not look at how much our team
has evolved over the whole process, I got a problem with the way people spin
things for their advantage because everyone assumed that we sucked this year.
And when we didn't, a lot of people have had a tough time saying, "You know
what, they are actually pretty good."  
That's what bothers me, that people go out there and try to put our kids --
not put them on the same playing field with other teams. I'm not talking about
Big 12 teams. I'm not into calling other people out, other programs out,
because they are all proud of what they've done. That's not my style. I don't
do that. But if you follow the RPI and you follow the so-called résumés, look
at our paperwork and compare it to the other so-called bubble teams. You tell
me if ours don't compare to theirs. Don't compare to the Big 12 teams. All the
Big 12 teams deserve to be in there.  
But I find it ironic that every other league in the country says, oh, they are
getting eight in. Big 12 is maybe lucky if they get six. Give me a break.
That's the most ignorant thing I have ever heard this whole year.  
  
Q. Talk about the challenges for your team trying to handle a guy like
Pittman, that size.  
COACH MARTIN: It is a problem for us. It is a problem. The only guy that we
have that has the girth, the size to kind of deal with Dexter is Colon. And
unfortunately for us, he is not playing well for us right now. So I think
we've had to rely on a couple other guys. I think he is a load.  
He has been playing better and better and better and better. His minutes are
up. And give him credit. Give Rick credit. They also have evolved as a
basketball team. Early in the year they depended on A.J. Abrams. Now they are
playing off the big fella and they are playing real well.  
  
Q. To hop on Pittman again, it seems like you guys were trying to front him
and that left him open for rebounds. It seemed like work off and on. Was that
your strategy?  
COACH MARTIN: Should we play behind him and they can score over our 6'7" guys?
You have to do one or the other. Our guards didn't do a very good job of
getting in passing lanes to extend their half-court offense. And then the
basketball gets to places where it can get passed to the post.  
You got to pick your poison. If you are going to play behind him, they are
going to throw it to him and he will shoot over our 6'7" guys. I like to fight
rather than sit there and let somebody punch me in the head. We got around. We
did a half-way decent job on it. There were times that we had breakdowns. It
happens. You play a team that's trying to come down and throw it to him every
single time and play off of him.  
Give them credit. They didn't fall apart from their game plan. They handled
it. We had good moments, and we had other moments that hurt us. But last time
I checked, we shot the ball to tie the game so we obviously didn't play all
that bad. We just didn't make shots.  
  
Q. What, if anything, did they do differently guarding Denny?  
COACH MARTIN: He made four shots. Last time he made 17 or whatever it was.
They took good shots. He took runners he makes. He took open threes. We're up
one and we scramble for a ball and it comes to him, step in, wide open right
in front of me and he missed. People have days where the ball does not go in
the basket. It happens.  
He just didn't make shots. Give them credit. They made it a little hard for
him. When we ran them off screens, they extended their defenders to make him
catch it higher up on the floor. At the end of the day, he still got good
shots. Maybe out of the 20 shots -- it is hard for me to put a number on it
because the game just ended. But there were maybe four or five that he maybe
tried to do too much.  
But all the other ones I thought were shots they had been getting the last two
months, they just didn't go in for him.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2009

  

### [Pat Knight](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18927)

### [Mike Singletary](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19435)

### [Alan Voskuil](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18131)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Missouri  81  
Texas Tech - 60

  
CHARLIE FISS: All right. Ready for Texas Tech and Coach Pat Knight and his
student-athletes, Alan Voskuil and Mike Singletary.  
Let's go to questions for our student-athletes, and then we will come back for
Coach Knight.  
  
Q. I'm wondering what the last day has been like for you, Mike, and was it
tough to follow up on your performance last night?  
MIKE SINGLETARY: I mean, it is always going to be tough to follow 43 points
and the zone I was in.  
But I'm just really proud of our team. We fought so hard all year. We battled
to the very end and can't say much more than that. I'm just so proud of our
team.  
  
Q. I wonder if you can talk about Missouri's defensive frenetic pressure
they had in the second half. It looked like they kind of wore you guys down as
the game continued.  
ALAN VOSKUIL: It took a lot of effort out of us. I mean, that Texas A&M game
took every ounce of energy we had and coming in to face that, I think in the
second half it started to get to us and we got a little tired and careless and
the game got away from there.  
  
Q. I saw you take a pretty big blow from Carroll -- or from Tiller, I'm
sorry. I just wanted to see how you are doing after that now that the game is
over.  
ALAN VOSKUIL: I'm doing good. I mean, it would be a lot better if we won. But,
I'm fine, I'm not worried about it.  
  
Q. Also in the second half, Missouri got a lot of shots right at the basket.
Was that also kind of being wore down as far as handling their pressure and
then they are coming back and doing a lot of back-door stuff and getting to
the rim?  
ALAN VOSKUIL: I would say a lot of it was fatigue. We were getting lost on
defense. Switches weren't being correct, doing the right thing. I think we
just got really mental and we got tired and didn't quite follow our game plan
we had in the first half.  
  
Q. They talked about fatigue, Pat, can you also address the first half, you
guys have the eight-point lead and then I think the last nine minutes scoring
only three field goals and the effect that had going into halftime.  
COACH KNIGHT: We had a chance to add to the lead, and we just kind of wore
out. You know, we were trying to play at a slower pace, be patient. They were
actually playing, I thought, at a slower tempo the first half than they
normally do. That actually helped us.  
We just -- you know, we just didn't have enough in the tank. We had enough for
a game and a half. But it started showing towards the end. We stopped cutting,
started settling for jump shots. Usually when kids get tired, the easiest
thing to take is the jump shot. So we kind of started settling, instead of
putting pressure on them. We got in the bonus, I think, with about seven
minutes to go.  
Instead of shot faking and driving or catching and driving, we settled for
easy shots instead of making them work. A lot of that has to do with being
tired.  
  
Q. Pat, obviously Mike wasn't going to follow up that 43-point night with
another one like that, but could you just talk about the way you did perform
because obviously he was kind of the target of some pretty good defenders out
there by Missouri and he seemed to respond well.  
COACH KNIGHT: I thought he responded well. I thought he pressed a little too
early, trying to make things happen.  
I think trying to have another night like he did last night, that's just not
going to happen. But he still gets 17 points and eight rebounds which is a
great effort. He just battles. Even if he gets off to a bad start, he is a guy
you can count on having numbers. That's why I actually -- I bring him off the
bench because we are just not deep enough from a standpoint of having a bench.  
If I started him during the game, then I don't have any production really
coming off the bench and he has been great because I actually asked him before
the season when I kind of figured how we were going to be, if he would mind
coming off the bench. And he actually preferred coming off the bench.  
He has just been a solid contributor to us. He is only a sophomore. That's the
thing -- that's the thing I really like. He has competed here against two of
the better teams in our league. This is something he can build on, not just
the performance he had last night but also, I think, tonight.  
To have 17-8 against Missouri is pretty darn good.  
  
Q. Does Missouri's defensive pressure give them an extra bonus in the
tournament setting when they can come out and get you with 14, 15 guys?  
COACH KNIGHT: Yeah. Mike has done an unbelievable job. I love their roster,
just the type of players they have. They are all versatile. They bring great
energy to the court from a defensive standpoint. Not only are they good from a
trapping situation, they can do a lot of switching.  
From an offensive situation, they can all shoot. They can all catch and drive.
They are very hard to play against. I have said this before when we played
them in Columbia, he has done a great job building this team into the style of
play that he wants to incorporate. He hasn't had the roster his first couple
years, and now he has his roster. Now you can see how lethal that style of
play can be.  
It is tough to play against because if you think about it in the league, it is
the only team that does anything remotely close to that. So now tournament
time, it is the same thing. Even next week when they start the NCAA
tournament, I think they will have an advantage because there is not a lot of
teams around the country that do that.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Oklahoma State  71  
Oklahoma - 70

  
CHARLIE FISS: We are ready to begin now with the Oklahoma State Cowboys, Coach
Travis Ford and his two student-athletes, Byron Eaton and Keiton Page.  
Coach, congratulations on tonight's victory your thoughts?  
COACH FORD: I'm just very proud of these young men. This is three great games
we've played against Oklahoma. I again have an incredible amount of respect
for their basketball team and the incredible amount of respect for Jeff Capel
and how he coaches and handles himself. Our kids are just -- have just
continued to get better. This is just a hard-fought game. We stepped up and
made some plays, we made some big shots, free throws, runners. We got some big
rebounds.  
I thought we did an excellent job on the big fella. I thought we did an
excellent job on the big fella, as good a job as we can possibly do. We just
didn't want to give him 25, and we did a pretty good job of that. It took an
incredible effort by Anthony Brown. I thought he did a great job of defending
inside.  
We changed up how we wanted to guard him this morning. It is a testament to
these guys to pick up the scouting report very, very, very quickly.  
It was a great overall effort to everybody. Everybody contributed. We
concentrated on this game that everybody that gets in this game needs to make
a play somewhere, somehow, a big play. That's what it is going to take to beat
one of the best teams in the country, special plays by everybody.  
I think you can look down the list, everybody did that. Everybody stepped up
and made a special play at some point.  
Just a very hard-fought game. A lot of different emotions and ups and downs.
We are just very fortunate to be a point ahead at the end, to be honest with
you. Very fortunate, very fortunate. That comes from having a great respect
for Oklahoma and Jeff Capel.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about how much fun it was to play in that game with the
atmosphere, the 50/50 split and somebody cheering the whole night?  
BYRON EATON: It was definitely fun for me, especially being my last time to be
able to play against Oklahoma. It was a special game for me. You know, that
was one of the main things I was talking to some of my teammates about, that
we figured we would have them after we beat Iowa State. The atmosphere was
great.  
Like you said, it was a split down the middle. I think we had more fans, but
that's always good. I mean, that's the way that you want to have them type of
games, when you are playing in Oklahoma City like half, in between, you know?
Just wanted to have a great fan support to come out and support us.  
It was going to be a great game. I'm just happy we were able to pull it out.  
KEITON PAGE: It was a great atmosphere. I think any Bedlam game is going to be
a great atmosphere. Playing here at the Ford Center with the crowd split,
that's the atmosphere everybody wants to play in.  
  
Q. Byron, talk about when OU went to that zone, when you got the lead. It
looked like they frustrated you and took away some of your penetration. What
did you try to do to combat that? Travis, when you --  
BYRON EATON: It did frustrate us a little bit. We came down. I think we got,
like, two or three bad shots. I had a turnover. We were just -- we were just
doing some things -- we didn't think they would play a zone as much as they
did.  
When they played it, it shocked us. I should have recognized and got into
something better than what I did. Once I got control of it and then I started
pointing my guys in the right direction, we started penetrating and getting
good shots.  
We didn't make a lot of our shots that we got wide open, but we were able to
penetrate the zone and doing a great job of finding other guys to get good
shots for them.  
  
Q. It has been tough against these guys over your career. Describe the
emotion. You finally got one and the last one, and now you are moving on this
weekend.  
BYRON EATON: Like you said, it has been a tough battle for me in Oklahoma. I
think that's only my second win against those guys. It has been -- like I told
Coach, it has been a long time. I haven't won the last five or six tries
against them.  
To win the last one is going to be something very good for me, you know? Like
I said, they beat me eight or nine times, but I got the last one. I'm happy
for that.  
We have a short memory. Got to put it behind us and get ahead for the next
game to go out and get a win here.  
  
Q. Keiton, you had big shots out there tonight. About a year ago this time
you were playing for the AA state championship that's going on right now.
Contrast the differences between then, now. Are there any differences now?  
KEITON PAGE: It is a huge difference, huge difference. The players out there
on the floor, the physicality and everything like that, tonight we did a great
job. Our guys coming out screening and Byron just getting in the paint and
other guards getting in the paint and finding the open man and knocking down
jumpers. That's a big difference between last year and this year.  
Pawnee is back in the state championship. So hopefully they get back to the
state championship.  
  
Q. Right before James shot his foul shots you went up and said something to
him. Can you tell us what you told James right before he shot those foul
shots?  
BYRON EATON: I just told him, you know, get my back for me. I went up there
and I missed one, but I put us in the lead.  
I just told him, this ain't nothing big for James Anderson, it is just another
walk in the park.  
CHARLIE FISS: First question for Coach?  
  
Q. What change did you make this morning defensively that you mentioned
before?  
COACH FORD: Well, the last two games we have been trying to double team him as
soon as he got the ball.  
And watching film until 2:00, 3:00 in the morning, we just -- we just kept
realizing how unsuccessful it was because when we would go double team him, he
would either split it or pick us apart as our defender was coming to him. He
was recognizing the double team and kicking it out and making plays for other
people.  
So we made the decision to go ahead and try to full front him as much as
possible and have a weak-side defender behind him and leave weak side open --
we would leave the weak side open.  
We knew the three-point percentage, and I said we're just going to -- we're
just going to have to hopefully hope they miss a few shots. Let's try to front
him as much as possible and deny him the basketball as much as possible, front
him. That's not something we normally do. That's the only game I can ever
remember us fronting.  
And then we wanted to play off the four-man to clog it up as much as possible
and pretend we were going to double team at times. But our guys, for a
different type defense that we normally play picked it up very, very, very
well, very well.  
Again, I think we did a great job of limiting his touches. I think our half-
court trapping was very, very good. It got them out of being able to come in
and throw it straight inside. That's what they did to us the first two games.  
We calculated almost 75 percent of the time they would come down and make one
pass and throw it inside. We said that's too easy when you are trying to go
against the best player in the country. We have got to make it a little more
difficult than that.  
And all that's great. We can come up with all these game plans, but the
players have to go out and execute it. I thought Anthony Brown for the most
part did a tremendous, tremendous job.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
COACH FORD: We shot around. We went over to a local high school and shot
around.  
  
Q. I wonder if you can just talk about the gutsiness that your two six-foot
and under guards showed out there tonight.  
COACH FORD: I had a little talk with Keiton today. I thought he might bring it
up, but I had a little talk with him. I set him down. I said, "You are playing
too much like a rouge player. I know you are playing with Byron, Terrell and
James and you kind of stand over on the side on offense and hope they drive
and kick it to you. We need you to make like you are in high school. Don't be
afraid, make things happen. You are a heck of a player. Don't just think that
you need to just be a rogue player standing on the side, get involved."  
I thought tonight he was a little more active. He got off the dribble a couple
of times. Had a little stuff to his game as I call it, rather than just
catching and shooting which I thought he had gotten into a bad rhythm of just
doing that.  
Byron, you know what you are going to get from him. You always got a chance.
Teams do a good job of trying to stop his penetration, and they did a good job
going zone but he still figures it out. He still figures out how to do
something positive.  
What I like, he did it last night, he did it tonight, he made some -- last
night he made a crucial turnover but he hustled back and stole the ball.
Tonight he did the same thing. He went in and made a crucial turnover and
stole the ball again. That's a progression from earlier in the year when the
guys make mistakes they let it affect them for the next five minutes. That's
an attitude we have been working on to get past a lot of these players is
don't live in the past. Let's move on. That's not the way we play.  
The tempo and the style of basketball, the up-tempo style, you can't -- we are
not worried about possessions. We are going to get it back. There is going to
be a lot of shots taken and a lot of possessions. Move on.  
I think our team has done a much better job the last month of doing that.  
  
Q. Can you comment on the question that I asked Byron Eaton about the zone
and you went through a couple time-outs and changed some things up and then
had more success. What happened in that period when you got the lead in the
zone?  
COACH FORD: We just made a few shots. We got inside the zone. I thought their
zone was very good. It stopped some of our penetration.  
But last night we played against 40 minutes of zone. I thought we would have
handled it a little bit better. We did the same thing we did last night. Early
in the game last night we took quick bad shots. We were relying on three-
pointers only.  
Well, even in time-out, once Marshall fouled out, I told our guys we have to
rely on threes, even more so don't be afraid to shoot because we don't have
that inside weapon that we had with Marshall. I told them to catch and shoot
it. If you are open, we need to get shots up.  
We started screening a little bit more in the zone. I thought we need to get a
little more action on the baseline to get them to start thinking who they are
going to guard rather than just ball screen for Byron, driving and kicking.
They got pretty comfortable with that. Oklahoma got very comfortable with
that.  
We had to start using different looks. Actually went to our man-to-man plays
against their zone, and it got us some pretty good looks.  
  
Q. Along those lines, Byron seemed to be able to get inside when they were
playing man or zone. When he got inside the zone, was it key that he kind of
went in under control? Sometimes he pulled up. Was that important against the
zone tonight, just take it all the way every time?  
COACH FORD: Obviously, Byron gets in the middle of about any defense. A lot of
times it comes down and once he gets there -- it is about decision-making for
him. Is he going to make the right decision or not? Shoot? Drive it? Pass it?  
I thought he did a great job of adjusting because I thought he went to the
hole early in the game, didn't get some fouls that he maybe normally can get
or didn't go his way. He said, all right, I'm not getting those so I need to
start pulling up for jump shots and he did a better job of doing that.  
He found guys when they were open. He shot when he needed to shoot and he
passed when he needed to pass. It is no secret the last three minutes of the
game we are going to put the ball in his hands and let him do his thing.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, again congratulations.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Baylor  71  
Kansas - 64

  
CHARLIE FISS: All right. Let's welcome the Baylor Bears. Coach,
congratulations on your victory today. This is Coach Scott Drew and his two
student-athletes, Henry Dugat and LaceDarius Dunn.  
Coach, your thoughts on today's victory?  
COACH DREW: The first question I got asked, how are you able to do it? Our
guys showed a lot of heart, and obviously they knew coming into this we are
going to have to leave it all on the line and really come together as a team.
I couldn't be more proud of the effort. We got down five. We could have easily
packed it in at that time. We didn't.  
I know, again, when you have seniors that care and you want to go out in
style, it makes a tough out. Again, we give God the credit.  
  
Q. LaceDarius, what got said in the huddle during that time-out after Kansas
didn't get up five on you guys? What was the mood like and what did you all
talk about?  
LACEDARIUS DUNN: We kept our poise. We knew the team. Kansas is a great team.
They made a run. We kept telling ourselves we can't get down and can't give
up. We just kept fighting.  
  
Q. Henry, can you just kind of describe the mood on this team coming into
this tournament after winning two games? It seems like y'all are really
believing in yourselves.  
HENRY DUGAT: Yeah, before the tournament, we didn't end the Big 12 season like
we wanted to. But we couldn't hang our heads. We knew coming into this it was
a new season. We had to leave it all on the line. We needed to accomplish what
we needed to do.  
  
Q. Lace, what was it about your zone defense that you think bothered them?  
LACEDARIUS DUNN: I think we just -- we just played great. I think that was the
best time we ever played that zone that greatly that we did today. We kept it
packed in and contested shots was the most important thing. We contested the
shots and tried to make it tough for Sherron. He is a great guard. I think we
kept it packed in and the better the zone was.  
  
Q. Did you feel like you guys are finally playing like you are supposed to
play, like you expected coming into the season?  
LACEDARIUS DUNN: Exactly. I think we came in with a chip on our shoulder. We
didn't win like we wanted to. We knew coming into the Big 12 tournament, we
had to come here and play because no team here is going to lay down. We had to
come back. I think we are playing great basketball right now.  
HENRY DUGAT: Like Lace said, a lot of people were counting us out coming into
the tournament. I don't think they expected us to make it this far. We had a
chip on our shoulder. We knew what we were capable of and we knew we had to
step it up. We knew it is not through right now. We still got work to do.  
  
Q. Henry, Lace hit a big three to put you guys up seven. It was kind of a
fast-break situation. Did you hear him yelling at you as you came down the
floor?  
HENRY DUGAT: I heard Lace from the time I got the ball. I knew he would knock
the shot down. I know he is a great shooter, one of the best in the Big 12. I
knew if he got a good look, he would knock it down.  
COACH DREW: Just so you know, everyone knows when Lace is open. He makes sure
everyone knows. (Laughter).  
  
Q. I wonder if you can talk about the lift you got from Mamadou.  
HENRY DUGAT: He stepped up real big for us today.  
We knew with a guy like Cole Aldrich, we knew we would have to step up. I
think he stepped up real big with rebounds and he got a lot of blocks that led
to a lot of stops for them and transitions for us.  
  
Q. Henry, you have a lot of confidence with the shot down the stretch. Talk
about the jumper you made when Kansas had taken a five-point lead or regained
it. And the free throws at the end, what was going through your mind there?  
HENRY DUGAT: My teammates and coaches, they have been telling me to stick with
it. Finally, the confidence started going. I knocked a few easy ones down
earlier. I was able to get into it.  
And just the atmosphere of the game, I wanted to take it and I made it.  
  
Q. How good are you? What kind of team does Baylor have?  
HENRY DUGAT: I think we just showed what we are capable of doing tonight. A
team like Kansas, defending national champs, we were able to come out and take
care of business.  
CHARLIE FISS: Congratulations on your victory today. We'll keep Coach here.
Questions now for Coach Drew.  
  
Q. Scott, can you talk about the time-out -- nine-minute time-out when they
got up five. Were you trying to keep them calm or what?  
COACH DREW: We said for T.V. sake we now made it more interesting, now we can
come out and play.  
But the biggest thing we did was try to keep the poise. They made a run. We
knew great teams make runs, and then great teams answer runs.  
So I thought the seniors in the huddle really did a good job of keeping
everybody focused and keeping everybody knowing that this -- we got a lot of
game left to be played.  
  
Q. Just talk about your defense and your zone and what made that so
effective today.  
COACH DREW: Well, I think Mamadou and Josh really stepped up and were huge
today. And we were active in it. The big thing is we didn't give up a lot of
second-chance points. Kansas did get 12. But, again, they are a pretty good
rebounding team, and we can live with that. We knew that was key coming in to
keep them off the glass and for the most part, we did a pretty good job.  
  
Q. Your hustle stats today look real impressive, and the categories that you
haven't necessarily taken care of business this year, touches and tips and
defensive stops and blocked shots. Was that the difference that was able to
weather the storm when they were coming back?  
COACH DREW: I think definitely we're playing as a team, and we don't have any
alternative right now but to win.  
So we're doing the things that you need to do to win games against good teams.  
  
Q. Would you break down the differences? Is it confidence? Is it game plan?
Is there something that you have done different in practice? Is it anything?  
COACH DREW: I think yesterday I had said something and really -- normally I
don't see that many intelligent things. Walking out I thought "that was pretty
good." The nonconference we were playing how -- I mean we were ranked seven
straight weeks. We were playing good basketball, beating Arizona State, Wake
Forest. We were playing good ball. And then got into conference and 3-1, we
start losing a couple. Couple tight ones. We go to some places that are tough
to play. We lose and then it was like putting a weight vest on. That was 10
pounds after losing four games in a row.  
Then when we lost five in a row, went to 20 pounds. I mean, it is tough when
you have expectations, you were not meeting them and you are frustrated. I
mean, that's how the conference season went for us.  
Now, once we got to the conference tournament, the vest came off because it is
a new season. We were great in the nonconference. We want to be great in the
conference tournament in the post-season.  
  
Q. Usually, if you play a zone the whole game they eventually find some
spots. Did you make any adjustments during the game where they would get the
ball in certain places?  
COACH DREW: You are always adjusting throughout the course of the game with
personnel and what they are doing. The big thing throughout the game, the
common thing, is our defense was tremendous when we didn't give them second-
chance opportunities.  
  
Q. Coach, Josh Lomers yesterday and Mamadu today. Do you have the strength
and stamina inside for these guys to keep playing back to back to back well?  
COACH DREW: I think we don't have any other choice. They know we're in it to
win it. The good thing about playing zone, it does save you, too.  
  
Q. Talk about the lift you got from Mamadu coming off the bench.  
COACH DREW: Mamadou was huge in the blocked shots but in the tip-dunks he had
4-4 from the field. Obviously we wouldn't have won the game without him. I
think that's a senior not wanting to play his last game.  
  
Q. You are getting contributions from a lot of guys and that's got to help
if you are trying to make a deep run in the tournament.  
COACH DREW: Most definitely. Players got to step up and players that maybe
haven't stepped up or even from game to game, someone, again -- Josh was
yesterday. Mamadou was today. You need that to win four games in four days.
Our guys are well aware of that.  
Right now we all have confidence in each person that plays.  
  
Q. Looked like you may -- something you did down the stretch, but you made
an effort to give guys rest throughout the game. Lace rested some in the first
half. C.J. quite a bit the second half. How much did that help you in that
last closing stretch?  
COACH DREW: I think that was huge when we went to the bench and we got
positive contributions. We were able to play them and rest other guys and you
got to have that. Again, we were able to get that. Even I mean, Anthony Jones
did a very good job for us as well.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you for coming. Good luck tomorrow.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Oklahoma State  71  
Oklahoma - 70

  
CHARLIE FISS: We are ready to begin with the Oklahoma Sooners and Coach Jeff
Capel, his student-athletes Blake Griffin and Austin Johnson.  
Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game?  
COACH CAPEL: First of all, I want to congratulate Oklahoma State. They were
terrific. They played hard. They played with a lot of passion. You have to
congratulate them.  
It has been an interesting day here today. A lot of upsets. Unfortunately, we
were part of it. It is tough to win when you are 3 for 19 from three and have
19 turnovers. To me that was the story of the game, those two stats right
there. And so we have to regroup. We'll figure out Sunday where we're going
and give this some time to try to work and get better get ready for the NCAA
tournament.  
  
Q. Blake, can you talk about the final sequence when you were on defense and
what was going on there, especially with Byron driving and that kind of thing
on the rebound.  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I went and grabbed the ball, and they said I fouled James
Anderson. There is not much you can do about that.  
Had pretty much the same thing coming back down. But I mean, you know, didn't
go our way.  
  
Q. This is a tough way to end the regular season. You still have the biggest
prize still out in front of you. How do you regroup and get back ready for
Sunday and next week?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: Learn from what we did wrong today. Like you said, we still
have games left to play. This isn't the end of the world. At the same time, we
need to figure some stuff out and we need to do a better job in certain areas.
We need to learn from this but at the same time grow from it and move on.  
AUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, it is a tough loss. Like Blake said, it is not the end
of the world. We are just going to regroup, get over it and try to move on. We
got the big dance coming up. We got opportunity.  
  
Q. Blake, what were they doing differently defensively in this game than
Saturday night to you to limit your touches?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: When you have three guys you can run into push and grab, you
really don't care. That's what they did tonight. They just didn't play behind
me. They just, you know -- when I did get in front of them, they would just
kind of, I guess, claw their way back around.  
So I mean, it was just kind of their mind-set coming in obviously from the
intentional or the flagrant foul. You saw that they weren't going to let me
have anything. If I was going to get a point, I was going to have to get it at
the free-throw line and they were going to knock me down and do whatever. That
was the difference.  
  
Q. Austin, talk about your shooting difficulties outside. Was it something
that they were doing? Or you guys just weren't on tonight?  
AUSTIN JOHNSON: I think we weren't on, and that happens sometimes. Sometimes
teams have a little shooting slump.  
I thought when we shot -- when we came over today to shoot around, I thought
we shot good. Me and Willie and Crock and Cade, I thought we were shooting
good. It just happens sometimes, and you just got to move on.  
  
Q. Blake, you got Marshall Moses out of there early. You got him in foul
trouble. You talked about what they did defensively. It seemed like you
weren't totally happy with getting the ball down deep. Do you feel like you
could have gotten the ball and done some damage down there?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I can always do a better job than what I do, I feel like, after
games. I didn't have to do much to get them in foul trouble. That was their
mind-set coming into the game.  
They got themselves in foul trouble. But you got to give it to them because
they played a better game and they wanted it more, and that seemed to work for
them.  
  
Q. Blake, did you think you were fouled on that last shot?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: Yes. Same play as before. We were both going for the ball. I
had the ball. He ran into me. Exact same play, different call.  
  
Q. Do you have any explanation for the ref on this?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: No, not at all.  
CHARLIE FISS: Question for Coach?  
  
Q. Can you talk -- is there any explanation in your mind for why you guys
are having so many turnovers here as of late? I mean, you were great for 30
games.  
COACH CAPEL: Yeah. I don't know. That's something I've -- I asked the same
question, Jim, these past -- past three games in a row really, we have had
18-plus turnovers in each game. It is why we struggled. Even when we beat
Oklahoma State at our place last Saturday, we would get up 10, 11 points and
then we would get a couple turnovers and they would make you pay for them.
Like you said, it was something we were doing a very, very good job of. But
here in the past, I would say, four or five games we have been very sloppy. We
have been really weak, in my opinion. That's a big part of it, we have been
really weak.  
We'll get a rebound and we're not strong and they come from behind and knock
it away. We are pushing the ball ahead. And against this team -- if you look
at our last three games that we have played against teams that do some sort of
pressing, our last three games, Oklahoma State twice and Missouri, and we will
work on it on practice and talk about when you get by these guys, they will
come from behind and try to knock it away. That probably happened at least
three times today.  
We have to make a conscious effort to work on it more. That's number one. But
then to be stronger with our decisions, to be stronger with the basketball and
to be stronger with what we are trying to do offensively.  
  
Q. Most people as soon as the game was over said it is one of the most fun
games they have ever watched. I know it is no consolation for the team that
loses. But were you able to sort of appreciate the atmosphere and the
remarkable swings of emotion with the building roaring at every second?  
COACH CAPEL: Well, the atmosphere was great. But I didn't enjoy how we played
today. I'm sure Travis enjoyed how his team played. I didn't enjoy how we
played really for the whole game.  
I thought we were sloppy. When you are not making shots from the perimeter,
that makes it a very long game. It felt like a very long game to me.  
But, certainly, the atmosphere was great. You could feel the energy. It was
like a NCAA tournament atmosphere.  
  
Q. When you talk about regrouping and to follow up on Jim's question, how do
you regroup? Is it a mental thing? Is it a Xs and Os thing? Is the turnover a
mental thing or is that a Xs and Os thing?  
COACH CAPEL: We just have to go back to work. We have to try to sharpen up
some things that we want to do on the offensive end.  
Those are the things that -- the things that we can control, we have to try to
do them at a very, very high level. Our movement on offense, being stronger
with the basketball. We have to work on it even more. We have tried to work on
it but obviously I haven't done a good enough job of working on that. We maybe
need to do some different things. That's how you regroup. Really, we don't
have a choice but to regroup because if you don't, then we are going to be
done pretty quickly. Fortunately, we do have part of our season left and it is
the most important part.  
Again, we'll figure out where we're going to play and we'll get prepared for
who we're going to play once we find out on Sunday, and then we'll go from
there.  
  
Q. Jeff, you talked after Blake came back the guys were kind of struggling
with their roles because they changed when he was out. Do you still feel like
you are going through that a little bit?  
COACH CAPEL: I don't think it is because of the roles, I just think guys are
struggling. Crocker is struggling shooting the basketball. We're all
struggling shooting the basketball, our whole back court.  
I know Blake was asked a couple times about some of his touches. Well, they
had three guys around him before he even caught the ball at times. They
weren't guarding some of our guys. And that's one of the things that happened
to us earlier in the year. And we started making shots.  
Through the conference season only, we were one or two in three-point field
goal percentage. I think that's why we were winning, especially when we were
winning 13 in a row. We were really shooting the basketball well and taking
advantage of those open looks.  
When you do that, then that make it more difficult to guard Blake. I felt like
Oklahoma State's game plan was to not let Blake beat them again and to make
some of these other guys -- to make some of our other guys make shots, and
unfortunately we didn't do that today.  
  
Q. The final play that you got -- you told your guards to get going to get
moving and you got the bucket. Could you talk about that. And then the
sequence defensively, did you get what you wanted out of your team
anticipating what they were going to do?  
COACH CAPEL: Well, we got to the -- we got what we wanted offensively. We were
able to -- I think we got fouled and went to the free-throw line and made two
free throws. So we got what we wanted.  
They didn't call time-out. Our zone had been very effective for us. We forced
a tough shot and a miss and we went to get a rebound and there was a whistle.  
Again, I'm not going to take away anything from what Oklahoma State did, but I
think it's physics. If you have a 255-pound guy and he happens to run into a
guy that is going for the ball, a guy that's 200 pounds, 205, he is probably
going to move him a little bit.  
But, again, that was the call. We threw ahead, ran an out of bounds play, got
it where we wanted it and there was some contact there and it wasn't called. I
knew then, even when we went to the monitor, the game was over. We shot it and
actually I think we got a rebound and I think we missed that. That's 2.3
seconds. I knew the game was over then.  
We got what we wanted both times as far as forcing a tough shot, a contested
shot and coming up with the rebound. And then for our last offensive
possession, we got the ball down in position where we wanted it, it just
didn't happen for us today -- tonight.  
But the game was not won or lost on those last two possessions. The game was
lost for us throughout with the 19 turnovers. That's where the game was lost.
The game was lost because of our inability to make shots, because we were weak
with the basketball.  
The game was lost because we didn't have movement on offense at times. We were
very, very stagnant. That's why the game was lost. It has nothing to do with
those last two possessions. Again, I'm not going to take anything away from
Oklahoma State's kids. After playing a hard-fought game yesterday, they came
back and showed a lot of character, a lot of heart and they won a tough game
today.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you.

### [Dexter Pittman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18388)

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Texas  61  
Kansas State - 58

  
CHARLIE FISS: We are joined now by the Texas Longhorns, Coach Rick Barnes and
his two student-athletes, Dexter Pittman and Varez Ward.  
Coach, congratulations on today's victory. Your thoughts?  
COACH BARNES: It was exactly the type of game we thought it would be. Kansas
State played as hard as any team we have played all year. We know that from
our first encounter with them. We knew it would be a very physical game.  
Early, again, they did a great job. In fact, they did a tremendous job on the
offensive boards and we knew they would force us into some turnovers, and we
got careless a few times. Nonetheless, when we had to make some plays, we made
some plays.  
  
Q. Dexter, you think you played even better today than yesterday considering
the physical nature of the competition?  
DEXTER PITTMAN: I think it was just a little bit more physical today than
yesterday because Kansas State has big bodies. I knew going into this game, I
would have to go in there and rebound and box out because they crash to the
board every time.  
I just went in the game with that mind-set, just block out and go to the glass
and get the rebound and jump over them and use my athleticism.  
  
Q. Dexter, are you starting to see yourself as a go-to guy on this team? Are
you to the point yet where you are going to say "get me the ball" to guys like
Damion and A.J. and say "run it through me"?   
DEXTER PITTMAN: I'm just playing my role on the team. I'm doing my job. That's
my whole mind-set.  
I wouldn't say that I'm like a go-to guy. Everybody on the team has got a job.
I basically think there is not a go-to guy on the team. We don't have a Kevin
or a D.J. this year. Everybody has to do their job.  
That's what me and, for example, Varez, he came in off the bench tonight and
did his job. He knew what he would have to come in and do. He had to play
defense and the defense stopper that he is.  
  
Q. Varez, one, you had seven points in a row. Were you trying to duplicate
Mike Singletary and go off there? Did you watch him last night?  
VAREZ WARD: I just wanted to come in and do the little things today and help
our team win the game.  
  
Q. How much rest did you have? I know you lost some of the minutes you had
gotten early in the year. How much rest are you feeling now?  
VAREZ WARD: I had a whole lot of rest during the past couple of days, and I
think that benefitted me a lot today during the game because I was able to
stay in the whole half and was able to kick in.  
  
Q. Dexter, you keep setting records for minutes played. Are you in better
shape than you were earlier?  
DEXTER PITTMAN: It is all just a mind thing. I'm taking over that now.
Sometimes I look over at the sideline and the coach will be like "No, you're
not tired." I will tell myself I'm not tired.  
It is more a mind thing and play smart when I'm tired and don't let the
fatigue come in.  
  
Q. Varez, when Coach put you in the game at that moment, did you have any
instructions? Did you have any idea what you wanted to do to try to help the
team where you were at that point in the game?  
VAREZ WARD: I really didn't have any instructions. When I go in, I'm always
thinking defense first and everything else plays itself out.  
  
Q. Varez, talk about going up against Clemente. Last time y'all faced him,
he went for 44. You were the only one, it seemed, that day that had any
success against him. Just talk about trying to keep him in track.  
VAREZ WARD: Clemente is hard to guard because he is always coming at you full
speed. I just wanted to come in and slow him down a little bit and really just
take him out of his game, or at least try to take him out of his game.  
  
Q. Dex, you mentioned Varez. Specifically, what did he do for your guys
during that span that he was in the game? Did he kind of add some energy to
what was going on?  
DEXTER PITTMAN: I mean, like I said, Varez, his whole mind-set is defense. He
came in there and he frustrated Clemente a little bit. I heard Coach tell him
-- lock him down. I know V, I told him do his job and he said he was.  
So I just knew that he took it as a challenge to try to cut Clemente out and
frustrate him because last game he thought he had a little free ball.  
I knew all of our guards took it as a challenge in this game to try to stop
him.  
CHARLIE FISS: Questions now for Coach Barnes?  
  
Q. Rick, when you put Varez in there, was it for defensive purposes? And was
his scoring just a bonus?  
COACH BARNES: We talked at halftime and we just felt the way the game was
playing it, and all I said to him is "This is your kind of game" because it
was a very physical, hard-fought game. We needed to drive the ball.  
I just said to him "Do what you do defensively and drive the ball." With some
of the things we were doing, we could change the guys on the floor. That's
what we said, just be aggressive, go at it. The biggest thing was defensively.
I thought he was terrific. I really thought he did some good things. What he
did defensively was really good.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate on what you guys were able to do against Clemente as
opposed to last month?  
COACH BARNES: Sometimes it is a make or miss situation. Some guys -- sometimes
they make them. Sometimes they miss them.  
Tonight there is no doubt that I think that we tried to guard him the same way
we did in Austin. We didn't give him as many open-court plays where he was
able to get away from us.  
Some nights it is just make or miss. We did go through a period where Varez,
we were really trying to deny him the ball. We were trying to take him out and
let somebody else handle the ball to put him into a clock situation where they
would have to hurry something. We had a couple big guys make blocks at the rim
and alter some shots. Again, I thought between the guards -- the guys that
guard him, they really were conscious of making him come through them and
trying to stay attached.  
  
Q. Now, you guys will advance to the semifinals against the Baylor Bears who
just took down the No. 1 Kansas Jayhawks this morning. Are you on any kind of
upset alert against that team?  
COACH BARNES: Well, first of all, I'm not sure you would call it an upset.
People forget now that Baylor was picked -- I think tied for third in the
preseason Big 12 poll and a team that they're playing great right now.  
They come in and really -- they played well last night. I didn't see them play
today. I don't think if you took a poll of the coaches, the coaches would say
that it is that big an upset if they beat anybody. When a team is picked third
in the preseason poll, you know they have proven in the past they can win.
That's no different here.  
I just know that our players understand when you play against Baylor, they've
got an inside-outside attack. You are going to have to play hard and sustain
them for 40 minutes.  
Every time we have been in games with them, they have been hard-fought games.
And they are playing with, I'm sure, with loads of confidence.  
So, again, I don't know upset alert, I don't know if I would look at it that
way.  
  
Q. A.J. takes four shots today. He had another efficient game just like
yesterday. Dexter, you know, the stats are starting to head into the paint. I
asked Dexter this. Is it to the point where he needs to say -- and obviously
the shots question is probably to your liking. But does he need to say to
Damion and A.J., run everything through me?  
COACH BARNES: I think you are looking for some quote or something. The guys
are doing what they need to do. They know Dexter is a factor, and we've always
wanted him to be a factor. And the fact he is staying out there, doing it.  
The difference in the game there, we told our team going in that our offense
really hurt us in Austin. We took bad shots. We were just, again -- they are a
hard team because they pressure. Our shot selection was bad.  
Again, for the last longest while here, every time Dexter has gone in the game
from start to finish, we have tried to go through Dexter every time he has
been in the game. Where he is today is because of his willingness to continue
to improve. I'm serious, from the very first game in the season when he went
in the game, there was no doubt that the whole team knew we wanted to get him
the ball. I don't think that's really changed any.  
  
Q. What did you see causing all the turnovers out there? Anything in
particular or careless plays?  
COACH BARNES: What upset me at the end, we came out of the time-out and we
didn't execute what we wanted to from a time-out. So a couple times there.
Early, I thought they were not being aggressive with it. You should have gone
by the double team as opposed to waiting on it.  
Other times, we just got in a hurry. But they play hard, they are aggressive.
We should have -- a couple times we got down the floor. We were just letting
doubles as opposed to attacking and doing what we wanted to do. But give them
credit. They played really, really hard.  
They pressured the ball early in the game. I told the players at halftime I
thought we needed to be tougher with the ball. We drove a few times. They
slapped the ball away. We had some rebounds in our hands that they came and
took away from us. We just kept talking about we got to be tougher with the
ball. We have to do a better job on the boards.  
Dexter, I told him the most impressive thing he has done since he has been at
Texas is those 20 rebounds tonight. That's what I told him this morning when
we walked away from the meeting. You have shown that you can score. I want you
to block shots and be a factor on the defensive end. Today he may have done
that better than at any time, no question.  
  
Q. Rick, has Dexter's minutes kind of ceased to be a major issue with you in
terms of how long you can keep him in the game, how long you can play him? He
had 34 today.  
COACH BARNES: Again, foul trouble today. Obviously -- in the past, that's one
of the reasons Dexter's minutes didn't go up. I said this all year long. I
thought earlier in the year officials had a hard time officiating the game
because of his size. I think it is hard because he is such a big man.  
He gets in there, and sometimes he just turns. Earlier in the year I think
people were flopping and doing things like that. I think Dexter has also
adjusted to know what he can do, where he needs to be. He has learned not to
lead so much with an elbow or shoulder into people.  
We try to use the time-outs, try to get him out before the time-out break, if
we can. You got to give him credit. He is really learning how to do it. It is
just experience. There is no doubt he is working at it. The more he can stay
out there, he is a factor. There is no question about that.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you and congratulations.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Missouri  81  
Texas Tech - 60

  
CHARLIE FISS: We are joined now by the Missouri Tigers and Coach Mike
Anderson, and he has three student-athletes, DeMarre Carroll, J.T. Tiller and
Matt Lawrence.  
Coach, congratulations on the win. Your thoughts on the game.  
COACH ANDERSON: I can tell you what -- I thought it was a tale of two halves
and that has probably been the story of our basketball team this year. The
first game in a tournament you never know how your guys are going to come out.
You never know if the nerves were going. We saw the nerves going early on.  
Texas Tech, give them credit. They had a game under their belt and they played
outstanding basketball. I thought they attacked us in the first half. In the
second half we really came out and we, I thought, established tempo, which is
more to our liking.  
Before you know it, our defense, which is the thing we thought about hanging
our hats on, really took over the game.  
  
Q. DeMarre and Matt, can you all discuss the ferocity of the hit on the
sideline pass by Tiller?  
MATT LAWRENCE: I was just happy to see Voskuil get up. Two guys going for the
ball. That's what J.T. does for us all year. He goes all out. Sometimes he is
going to knock some people down. He has done that to me a lot in practice,
too. I was just happy he was okay, though.  
DEMARRE CARROLL: It was just a great effort. J.T., he gives 100 percent, he
couldn't slow down. They call him the Tasmanian devil. You saw for yourself he
couldn't slow down. I'm glad he got up and he's not hurt.  
  
Q. I wonder if you can talk about those nerves in the first half and how
your defense kind of took things over after halftime.  
DEMARRE CARROLL: We came out with a little bit of nerves. We just had to get
our rhythm. Like Coach said, we needed to get our rhythm on the defensive end.
So the second half, we just put our focus to the defensive end and it gave us
ease of offense. We got ease of lay-ups, ease of breakouts. That's our main
goal in this whole tournament is just try to focus on defense.  
J.T. TILLER: Yeah, having almost a week off, we had to get the rust off. That
makes for butterflies. That turns into that half that we did have.  
Coming out in the second half, we knew what we had to do. Everything was
already out, we had the sweat going. That's how we finished that.  
  
Q. Can you guys comment on winning a Big 12 tournament game, I think, for
the first time in your careers, just to have that. And also how conscious were
you of the weirdness of the rest of the day with all those other top seeds
losing? Were you aware of it? Did Coach Anderson make a point of pointing it
out as inspiration at all?  
MATT LAWRENCE: I mean, yeah, it is the first time I have been to the second
round in the tournament since I have been here and I didn't have to play the
first game. So I was pretty excited about that. To win the first game since
we've been here, it is tremendous. If there is a half you want to win, it is
definitely in the second half. I think we have been doing that all year,
coming out in the second half if we didn't have energy in the first.
Definitely turning it around like we did.  
As far as the other games, we don't like to look into that kind of thing.
Watch their teams -- the only thing we can do is take care of the game at hand
and that was Texas Tech. Now our next game is Oklahoma State, who is playing
very good basketball right now. We got them at their house, so I know they
will be ready for us. I think we will be able to match the intensity.  
J.T. TILLER: Definitely a load off our back for the fact that we haven't even
been to the second round of the tournament. This has been our biggest game.
Not knowing what's going to come after that is -- after that, it is definitely
a big feat.  
DEMARRE CARROLL: Coach always said the first game is the most important game.
We just tried to pay attention to Texas Tech. Now we defeated Texas Tech. Our
next opponent is Oklahoma State, and that's our next biggest game. We can't
look over Oklahoma State.  
  
Q. All year long and even tonight you said that the defense has fielded your
offense. What was going on in the defense force and the 10-second violation
and DeMarre flying into press row. What did that mean to spark the offense in
the second half?  
J.T. TILLER: That was definitely the spark that got the crowd into it and
definitely got the team into it.  
When he went for that ball and dived over the table, I knew what was next to
come. I just felt sorry for what Texas Tech had to face after that.  
  
Q. You mentioned Oklahoma City a little bit. Can you go into further detail
what you think about that team as you get ready?  
MATT LAWRENCE: They are a very hot basketball team. Obviously they can shoot
the basketball. They can put four guards out there that can run transition and
spot up from three. They did a great job today winning that close game. I
didn't get to see much of the second half because we were getting ready.  
But they got great players, and they got a guy in size that has been playing
pretty well, too, Moses. They got some guys come off the bench and help them.
They are a deep basketball team that likes to get up and down the floor. So do
we, obviously. We got into a track meet with them at their place. Hopefully we
will get the up-tempo style again because I think that favors us.  
  
Q. Coach Anderson, it was brought up before, I just wanted to go back to you
are the only high-seed team placed in the quarterfinals to actually win your
game. Is that going to affect your confidence, boost your confidence into your
game with Oklahoma State?  
COACH ANDERSON: Our league has been so balanced this year, it is very typical
what took place today and yesterday. On any given night anyone can beat
anyone.  
When you get to tournament play, I don't know if people understand, it is a
little different feeling than, let's say, just the regular conference season
and so sometimes the nerves are going, and a lot of teams sometimes they have
nothing to lose and everything to gain and they leave it on the floor. I think
you have seen that case in point today.  
But I have always been a guy that's been tunnel vision, that's to worry about
what we do. We think we got a good basketball team. At the same time, we have
played some pretty good basketball and then hopefully we can continue to play
some good basketball.  
  
Q. Mike, talk about the rematch with the Cowboys, how you match up with the
Oklahoma State team.  
COACH ANDERSON: We had a game earlier in the year, and, boy, it was one of
those we were playing well. We shot the ball well. And, of course, they -- we
had a 20-point lead or a big lead, and they did a great job of hanging in
there. When you shoot the ball like they are capable of shooting the
basketball, they will always be in the game. Of course, we had some miscue
going down the stretch. But they are a tough team to match up. They like to
play up tempo. We do as well. I think they have created some depth. They are a
different team than we have played them earlier in the year. It will be a
challenge.  
We get a chance to play at the Ford Center. I'm sure there will be quite a bit
of orange in the house. But, again, both teams in the semifinals and everybody
is playing for something. It is a big game for them. It is a big game for us.
I expect a high-energy game. That's what we thrive on, energy.  
  
Q. Besides DeMarre you sat your other four starters for a significant time
in the first half. Was that to rest them for the second half, the rest of the
tournament or was that indicative of the play?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think that's the way we were playing. I think those guys got
tired.  
I go back to saying when you go into the tournament and I have seven guys that
have never been in this setting before, you use up a lot of energy, especially
with the way we play -- the way we tried to play in the first half.  
But at the same time, those guys got tired. They got winded. And I trust our
guys on the bench, even though they came out and they didn't play as well as
they thought they could. But one thing they were able to do to help rest those
guys that started out. You saw those guys with the opportunity to finish big
in the second half. That's been the secret to our basketball team all year
long. A guy like Miguel Paul, he comes in and plays some crucial minutes in
the game, early in the game. So it is important we get -- I thought Marcus
Denmon came in and give us some good minutes.  
Somebody over there come in and give us some productivity off the bench,
sometimes it is not even about scoring.  
  
Q. Mike, Matt has started the last three games. He has made his way into the
lineup. Can you talk about what you have done there and how that has worked
out. It looks like he has been keeping up the same pace.  
COACH ANDERSON: I think Matt is important to what we do. I think he is a guy
that keeps the defense honest. He has been shooting the ball extremely well.
He is the man of old, even better because I think he is doing a good thing on
the defensive side. He is deflecting passes, sticking his nose in. I think he
is coming off the bench and just gave us a big lift off the bench.  
So now he's back in the starting role. I think it is important at this time of
year, you got to have some guys that have kind of been there, done that
before.  
  
Q. You said you wanted your guys who have been here before to set an example
for the newcomers. How well did that follow that plan?  
COACH ANDERSON: I thought they did good. Especially in the second half. I
talked to our guys, J.T. and DeMarre and even Leo. I think those guys, they
are the core unit to our guys. Taylor as well.  
I think when those guys come out and they really, really play with a passion.
They play -- they talk, they communicate, they are having fun out there. I
think it makes it a lot easier for the guys -- the younger guys to follow
them. I thought in the second half especially, they alluded to the play where
DeMarre goes in -- knocking over the monitor over there. Those are energy
plays.  
And so what happens is now the guys on the sidelines, we talk about energy all
the time and defense. That's leaving it on the floor. And I thought you saw
just -- it kind of gets contagious.  
Not only are they doing it by example, I think they are doing it by talking as
well. Tonight we had a big-time spurt in the second half and it was all
triggered by our defense. I thought fatigue was a big factor. You will not see
Voskuil go to the free-throw line and miss two free throws. It was the wear
and tear. That's where our depth has been good to us. It was good to us
tonight, all year long and especially tonight and hopefully through this
tournament.  
  
Q. Obviously you got 15 guys playing time, nobody played more than 30
minutes. Talk about how important that might be if you guys have to play three
games in three nights.  
COACH ANDERSON: This is important. With the way we play in a tournament
setting, as you can see right now, it is almost 11:00, it is going to be a
quick turn-around. I think the game is at 8:30 tomorrow. I think we will have
some guys that are extending a lot of energy. Although they played less than
30 minutes, that's the equivalent of 40 minutes for most teams because those
guys, they play on both ends.  
So we'll get back to the hotel and get ready. But I just think our team is
made for this type of setting. We'll find out a little bit more about our
basketball team because this particular team is going on -- going through some
unchartered waters at the University of Missouri. So we will find out a little
bit more about our team, our ownership of the team.  
I like these guys, they leave it on the floor. They are a fun team to watch.
They are exciting.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Donald Sloan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17780)

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Texas Tech  88  
Texas A&M - 83

  
CHARLIE FISS: Joined now by the Texas A&M Aggies, Coach Mark Turgeon and his
two student-athletes, which will be Donald Sloan and Bryson Graham.  
Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game against Tech?  
COACH TURGEON: Obviously, Singletary was fantastic. We had no answer for him.
We tried all kinds of different guys. He just kept making plays and put a big
guy on him and he shot threes and they drove him. Little guy on him would post
him. Pat did a nice job tonight.  
We just quit. I was begging our guys in the Missouri game to play the second
half. We didn't guard in the second half. We had a great crowd and were able
to hold them off. I'm not sure we got a stop the last 10 minutes of the game
and totally just quit defensively and panicked a little bit on the offensive
end at the very end.  
Give them credit, they made plays. They never stopped.  
  
Q. When you got up 21 early in the second half, is there a tendency to let
up or let down a little?  
DONALD SLOAN: Well, not really sure. We just didn't get stops. Like Coach
said, it seemed like everything they shot went in. A couple shots they shot
were contested, a lot of them weren't. We just -- you know, like the intensity
in the second half from the way we started the game, the reason I guess you
could say because we were up by a good margin. So, yeah, I guess we did kind
of slack off.  
  
Q. Mark, when did you start getting nervous in the second half?  
COACH TURGEON: When did I start getting nervous? When the second half started,
I don't know. I don't know if I was ever nervous. I was more mad because we
couldn't get a stop. You know, they made some shots.  
I think we had an eight-point lead or a ten-point lead at the eight-minute
time-out or seven, whatever that was, was like, guys, if we can play the next
four minutes, the game will be over at the next media time-out. Just got to
get stops and do what we are supposed to do. We never got one. That's when
Singletary really heated up.  
We were in foul trouble all night. A lot of it because of our own reason, just
not playing very smart. We had to leave. We got a little lackadaisical and had
silly fouls. We had three or four fouls away from the basket, 94 feet from the
basket.  
And then we had the technical on Bryan which shouldn't happen. I don't know. I
kept thinking we were going to get stops and we didn't. Our last two second
halves defensively haven't been very good.  
  
Q. Mark, you guys have done so well lately to improve your résumé. Does this
hurt you at all going into Sunday?  
COACH TURGEON: It hurts our résumé. Whenever you lose, it hurts your résumé. I
haven't really looked at it to be quite honest with you. I think we were
solidly in because of what we have accomplished, finished fourth in the Big
12. Texas Tech is a pretty hot team. They did beat Kansas seven days ago,
eight days ago. It wasn't like this was a fluke or anything.  
So we'll see. It won't be -- it will be a lot more anxious than it would have
been than if we won a game or two here. I know that. So we'll see. We have a
pretty good résumé, though.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you for coming.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Texas Tech  88  
Texas A&M - 83

  
CHARLIE FISS: Joined now by the Red Raiders of Texas Tech, Coach Pat Knight
and his two student-athletes, Mike Singletary and Alan Voskuil.  
Coach, congratulations on your victory tonight. Your thoughts?  
COACH KNIGHT: Thank you. I don't believe in the coach's speak. I just open up
for questions. But I have to say these guys have two things, they got heart
and they got cohones and I think I can say that without getting in trouble.
That's what this team has. I don't care what the record is, this team has
those two things.  
I'm proud of them. I can't say any more than that. To come back like they did
against a good time like that just says everything about these guys.  
Go ahead and open it up for questions.  
  
Q. Mike, how do you explain something like tonight?  
MIKE SINGLETARY: Man, I was just in the zone, I think. My teams were giving me
the ball, and we didn't want to lose this game. We didn't want to go home. We
kept fighting hard, kept getting stops. Luckily my shots just kept going in.  
  
Q. Mike, you scored 29 straight points and 33 of 35. Did you feel like you
were dominating like that as far as --  
MIKE SINGLETARY: Yeah. Once I got going a little bit, you know, posting up
and, you know, hitting the threes felt like, you know, I was going to have a
good night. My teammates just kept getting me the ball and I just kept
rolling.  
They have had my back all year, so I decided to have their back for once.  
  
Q. Mike and Pat, I guess, is he going to start against Missouri?  
COACH KNIGHT: No, because I got 43 points off the bench and that's a great
stat to have. So I don't want to ruin that stat. Usually most of the teams
that win, they get bench production, I don't want to screw up the bench
production (smiling).  
  
Q. Alan, Mike was taking every shot during the stretch. What was it like to
be on the floor with him? Were you trying to feed him every time you could?  
ALAN VOSKUIL: It was obvious we kept giving him the ball. We were all on his
back. As he said, he scored 29 straight points. Our offense was giving him the
ball to go from there. Had no problem doing it and I don't think any of the
teammates had a problem either.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you think Voskuil against Kansas or Singletary tonight?  
COACH KNIGHT: I will take them both. We don't have a lot, you know, great
memories. But I will take those two. I think we deserve those two. These kids
have been in every game, like I said, all year long and haven't given up.  
Again, they are a great team. They respond when you call them out at halftime
or time-outs. I think this team's a lot better than what the record shows. I
love coaching them. I can't say anything more about them. They have just not
given up on me.  
There is a lot of first-year coaches I have talked to that can't believe how
these guys keep on competing and competing. Normally, teams would have given
up three, four weeks ago. These guys never give up, and I think this is a
great indication of that.  
  
Q. Alan and Mike, was there anything like early in the second half that gave
you guys any particular hope that you could come back? I knew you kept playing
hard the whole time. Was there any kind of feeling that this was going to
happen? Did it just happen when Mike got hot?  
MIKE SINGLETARY: You know, we have been fighting all year. That's been our
motto all year. No matter how many points we're down, we will fight to the
very end.  
We started getting a few stops and started chipping into the lead. Once we got
it down around 15 points, around 16 with about 14 minutes left, something like
that, we felt like we could come back.  
Our defensive pressure started increasing and we started getting stops and we
started getting buckets. That really gave us hope.  
COACH KNIGHT: He is being too politically correct. His last name is not
Knight. I think I pissed him off at halftime, to be honest. They were not
really thrilled with me when they came out on the court.  
He can give you all the politically correct stuff. But to be honest, yeah, I
think they wanted to prove me a little wrong. So ...  
CHARLIE FISS: Questions for Coach Knight?  
  
Q. Politically correct, what did you say at halftime? Have you ever seen a
performance like Mike's had?  
COACH KNIGHT: I can't talk about what I did at halftime. I think we got the
best commissioner there is in the country, I have caused him enough grief. So
I will just keep quiet.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
COACH KNIGHT: I called them out pretty good, and I thought they responded.
They had a good answer to me when we got back to the locker room after the
game. It is the first time I have been speechless, so I will let them have the
last word after this.  
Mike's performance reminded me of Calbert Cheaney, the same type of position.
Boy, Alan's game against Kansas kind of reminded me of Steve Alford; today
compared to Calbert Cheaney, some good players I got to watch growing up.
That's who I would compare them to today.  
  
Q. There have been times this year where the team has gotten down and you
said you knew it was too big a hole to get out of. Did you think there was
still a chance, and what was different about them being able to push through
this time?  
COACH KNIGHT: The last three weeks, I think after Oklahoma State got on us so
big at home and we almost came back. The last three weeks have been different.
Even though they have been competing all year, the last three weeks, they have
been able to come back against really good teams and been right there.  
And so I just thought we had to call a few guys out or the team out at half
and see how they would respond. We got what we wanted.  
I will give these kids credit. They made the plays, started playing defense.  
I got worried. We got off to a start like we did to Iowa State. I don't know
what the answer is, how we can change that. They just picked it up and just
keep on coming at you.  
So I'm just impressed. I thought at halftime we sat in there in the coach's
locker room and said, "Let's see what happens. They have done it before, let's
see." We didn't let them know that. We made them think it was over with and
they had no chance. But they proved us wrong.  
  
Q. Coach Knight, with your story and background, where does this victory
story rank?  
COACH KNIGHT: It ranks up there in probably my top four or five as being a
head coach. It is so much different coaching than it is playing. I was
fortunate enough, I played with some really good players and we won a lot of
games that had nothing to do with me when I was playing.  
Now as a coach, you are involved with everything. It is just great, not just
for the players but I have had a great administration. My chancellor, my AD
Coach Myers have been behind me all year long, our fans have. It is just good
for them these last couple wins we've had that they can feel good.  
They can feel good going into next year that we got things going in the right
direction. And I'm happy for the seniors. They have had two games toward the
end -- I have repeated myself about this -- 10, 15 years from now as a player,
no one will remember your record but they will remember certain games. Now
they got two games that people will always talk about with Texas Tech
basketball history that these guys were a part of.  
  
Q. Coach, coaches talk all the time about conference tournaments being a new
season. That said, did what Georgia did last year running through the SEC give
hope to teams like yours that maybe didn't do so well in the regular season
and maybe get to the tournament?  
COACH KNIGHT: That's very good. That's what we talk about was Georgia. We talk
to our team about Georgia. It does good things for you.  
If you can win the tournament, just have a good run in the tournament, it ends
the season on a better note than maybe it would have ended in conference play.
But then it gives you momentum, especially for a team like us with good, young
players coming back. Leave them with confidence and a good taste while they
work through the spring and summer getting ready for next year.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you. Congratulations.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Oklahoma State  81  
Iowa State - 67

  
CHARLIE FISS: We're ready to begin with the Cowboys from Oklahoma State with
Coach Travis Ford and his two student-athletes, Obi Muonelo and Marshall
Moses.  
Coach, congratulations to you on tonight's victory. We will call upon you
first for your thoughts.  
COACH FORD: Thank you. I'm very proud of our team, especially the way they
responded in the second half. I thought Iowa State came in and obviously, I
wouldn't say surprised us with zone, because we thought we would see some
zone. I didn't think we would see 40 minutes of it. They got us into taking
some early quick shots, shots that weren't falling and got us a little bit out
of element. We had to regroup at halftime. Brackins had a great first half.  
I didn't think we were playing with the energy level and the aggressiveness we
needed to. We changed up on Brackins a little bit when we were going to double
team him and when we weren't and changed it up at halftime and put in more
trapping zone to try to spread them out a little bit so they couldn't come out
and throw it inside.  
But these two guys right here were the difference in the came for us. When you
have got guys struggling from the three-point line and Obi comes in and knocks
down big shot after big shot and then we got to a point where we said, "Hey,
you got to throw to Marshall. We have to penetrate the zone at some point. We
have to get the ball behind the defense to get it inside to Marshall."  
He responded with obviously some great baskets and good percentages. I'm just
very proud of how they regrouped. This is one of those games that is a tough
basketball game. Iowa State, you have to give them a lot of credit. They have
one of the top players not just in the Big 12 but in the country. Brackins is
an extremely special player. The way they can shoot threes, it is one of those
catch 22s at some point.  
Very proud of these guys and very fortunate to get the win and glad to move
on.  
  
Q. Obi, talk about your run there in that span when it seemed like you kind
of took the game over and, if you would, comment on what you feel like if now
you guys have played your way into the big tournament.  
OBI MUONELO: I mean -- yes, I think we have.  
COACH FORD: Yes.  
OBI MUONELO: (Laughter) I think after this game, I think it definitely puts us
in the NCAA tournament. We have worked hard to get to this point and all year
coach has been talking about how we want to work hard to get to the tournament
and really just drive. That was our goal, started out the year.  
I think this game definitely solidifies that.  
  
Q. Talk about the Bedlam game, shooting against the Sooners.  
OBI MUONELO: It is a big game for us because they have already beat us twice
and it really bothers me. We were going to go in and play the best we can and
the outcome, play hard and do what we are supposed to do, we should be able to
get the win.  
MARSHALL MOSES: I have been here two years, and I haven't been a part of a
team that has beat OU yet. This is a big-time game. If we beat them, we can
advance even further in this tournament which I haven't done here either. It
is an important game to all our guys from Oklahoma here. We need to win. We
need this win.  
  
Q. Can you talk about doing battle with Brackins down the post all night.  
OBI MUONELO: That was your battle.  
MARSHALL MOSES: Passing the buck.  
At the beginning of the game, he caught the ball and I was right there. He
made a good move and I was right there on him, right in his face, and he hit
it. I knew from there he was the real deal. Just like Coach has been telling
us about him, he is a big-time player. I played against him before he got to
Iowa State and he has become a better player now. We had to not let him go
off, and I think we did a pretty decent job at that.  
  
Q. Marshall, you said you were guarding pretty well in the first half. How
happy were you to hear you were going to double team him in the second half?
And how did you decide when you had to do the double team?  
MARSHALL MOSES: Coaches made that decision. What they told me was don't rely
on the double team. Don't let him catch the ball. Front him as much as you
can. When he gets it, then we'll worry about when to double team and when not
to.  
My job was to not let him get it. I tried my best, and sometimes I was
successful and sometimes he got it. James and Obi came over and read it very
well, which is the double team we call it, and got the ball out of his hands.  
  
Q. Talk about your three-point shooting in the second half in particular and
then I don't know if you remember, you made a rebound off a Keiton Page miss
that ended up being a huge rebound. It looked like it was a rebound of a guy
that wanted to change things.  
OBI MUONELO: Second half, I just felt comfortable with Byron passing the ball.
I had won the first half and I think I was 1-3 in the first half but they all
felt good coming off my hands.  
I knew when I came back in the game, we needed energy off the bench. I wanted
to come in. I hit a big shot. Whenever I hit a shot, usually I'm going to
shoot it again. (Smiling).  
Next one I got I shot it again and it went in. And then the rebound, that's
just me getting back to my old ways earlier this year, the way I used to play.
Just being aggressive and wanting every board. I wasn't trying to make a
statement or nothing like that. I was just going to rebound like I was
supposed to every time.  
I went to go get the rebound and I got it. That was all.  
  
Q. Obi, tell me about the crowd. You were down in the first half. Rallied a
little bit in the second half. Was the crowd a factor? Were you aware of it?  
OBI MUONELO: Definitely, our crowd was huge for us today. Whenever --
sometimes we get the ball on offense, they start getting loud and clapping. I
think that gives us confidence to go get a basket. They were huge, big
defensive stops all day today. Our crowd helped us big time.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Obi, his playing time has dipped the last month. Can
you talk about how much you will need him though as the games get bigger and
the opponents better and more important?  
COACH FORD: Great question because in the past three or four days in our
coaching staff meetings his name has been brought up more than once because we
saw him getting down a little bit.  
There is no question he's probably been a little disappointed, but I tell you,
he has handled it well. We have made statements over and over again in our
staff meetings, we got to get Obi ready to go because he is going to be a
factor. We can't win without Obi. We need him playing 20, 25 minutes.  
And I think he let not starting affect him a little bit, which is very
natural. We understand that. We totally understand that. And I think tonight
he just put all things aside and said, "Hey, I will do whatever I can to help
my team win and not worry about things I can't control necessarily." And he
responded. As he said, I think he nailed it, he looked like his old self. He
looked like he did in the first 10, 15 games of the year when played with a
high level of energy.  
When he works that hard, he camouflages some of his weaknesses that he has.
And he made huge shots. That shot after shot was just big, very big. And then
his rebounding was obviously huge, huge key for us.  
  
Q. Coach Ford, was there something you did strategy-wise intentional to get
the results of limiting them to five offensive rebounds? Was that something
--  
COACH FORD: Nothing other than obviously concentrating on that. Our goal,
especially in this game, is to make sure -- make them take as tough a shot as
possible and hold them to one shot as you do any opponent.  
No great strategy, no great strategy. I think Iowa State puts a big emphasis
in putting back in transition and trying to take us out our fast break so they
may not send as many guys to the glass as some teams do.  
In our last game against Oklahoma, I didn't think we pursued the ball very
well. We didn't get 50/50 rebounds where it could have gone to anybody and the
other team came up with it. We concentrated on that the last couple days. If
there is a loose ball or a long rebound, we have to pursue the basketball, go
get it. I thought we did a better job of that tonight, as a group, as a group.  
When you look down, we had a guy with six, seven, six, nine, four. That's what
we need because obviously we are not very big. We don't have one guy that can
go out and get 14, 15 rebounds consistently. So we have to do it as a team.
Everybody has to do their job when it comes to rebounding.  
  
Q. As an old point guard, I'm sure the fact you only had five turnovers has
got to please you, too.  
COACH FORD: Huge. Especially in a game that was a little slower than most.
When you play against a team that played as much zone as they played,
possessions are extremely important. We weren't shooting the ball very well.
Shot 45 percent which is not a great percentage for us.  
When teams usually shoot a high percentage, a higher percentage than we shoot,
usually not very good for us.  
It was very important that we got as many shots as possible tonight. You look
at it, 64-47. That's a huge stat, a huge stat when you are not making shots.
The more opportunities you get, the better. And that was huge.  
  
Q. Bedlam has come to the Big 12. You will be facing off the Sooners right
here between Norman and Stillwater. I got to ask you a personal question. In
your opinion, is Oklahoma City a neutral site for this rivalry?  
COACH FORD: Oh, man, tough questions. Yeah, I think it is a pretty neutral
site. I think you will see a lot of orange in the stands tomorrow. You will
see a lot of red in the stands tomorrow. It will be pretty equal, I think.  
I don't know. I guess we'll see. I haven't been around long enough to probably
know yet. But I know we'll bring our people out. I know you will see a lot of
orange in here. You will see a lot of red as well. I guess it is pretty
neutral, I guess, yeah, to answer your question.  
  
Q. In Norman the other day you said you didn't play well and you only lost
by four. How much confidence does that give you?  
COACH FORD: I meant we didn't shoot the ball that well. We made some mistakes.
Again, we've got an incredible amount of respect for Oklahoma and I have got
an incredible amount of respect for what Jeff has done there. Again, I think
they are one of the best teams in the country with the best player in the
country, without a doubt.  
We understand the challenge at hand. We had a few opportunities in that first
game that we just didn't convert. But, again, when you are playing against
great teams, they seem to make a lot of plays. We will have to play a near-
perfect game. We will have to play a very special game and hope some things go
your way.  
Again, we understand the challenge at hand. We just need to go out and play
hard. This was a big game for us. I think getting by this game was huge for
us, just getting past this game was very important for us.  
  
Q. I asked Marshall this. What was the key to deciding -- or how did you
decide when you would double Brackins? How did you go about doing that? Is
that a secret?  
COACH FORD: A little bit. Don't want to give it all out. (Smiling).  
No, no huge secrets in this game. We wanted to try to make him put it on the
floor. We wanted to go stretches. We were doing it a lot of times time-out by
time-out. Maybe in time-out we will do what we call red, double post. The next
one maybe we take it off now. Let's not. Maybe stun at him, fake at him and
act like you are going to double the post.  
And once we got a 10-point lead, we took it off for the fact that I just
didn't want to give up any more threes. At that point, I thought we had enough
points. And twos weren't going to hurt us at some point where threes could
really hurt you. That's one of the reasons we took it off later in the game.  
  
Q. It was a pretty short period of time?  
COACH FORD: We had a specific game plan starting the second half. I was not
happy -- I take that back. I thought he made some tough shots. I thought he
made some tough shots. He makes some of the toughest shots I have ever seen
just watching him on tape. He made some tough shots.  
I thought we let him have the ball too easy in the first half. So we wanted to
do a better job. Marshall's job was -- we told him not to worry about the
double team. Your job is not to let him have it. If we don't double, fine.
That's not your job. Your job is to not let him get the ball deep in the post.
Make him work for everything he is going to get. Try not to let him have the
ball. I thought we did a better job of that in the second half.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, congratulations.  
COACH FORD: Thank you.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Baylor  65  
Nebraska - 49

  
CHARLIE FISS: Okay. We're joined now by the Bears from Baylor. Coach,
congratulations on the victory today and we'll call on you first for your
thoughts on today's victory.  
COACH DREW: I think we really came out focused. We did a tremendous job
defensively. Besides turnovers, executed well shooting 53% from the field, 54%
from the field. So I'm very pleased with the first game performance and I
think our guys are very focused and excited to play.  
  
Q. For Curtis, just talk about what was the difference between today and
five days ago.  
CURTIS JERRELLS: We was ready to play. I think we switched it up defensively a
little bit. Coach made the coaching adjustment, made the adjustment on
defense. We played a little bit of zone. Didn't make many shots. So we stuck
with it and we were more patient on offense. We had a lot of turnovers, but
that was more on us rather than what they were doing.  
  
Q. What was it about the zone do you think that made them so
uncomfortable?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: I'm not sure. I just know their two best guys are pretty much
on the inside and the rest of the guys on the outside, I guess they wasn't too
much confident. I heard one of them say "shoot the ball with confidence." I
guess they didn't make shots. Kevin did a good job of rebounding.  
  
Q. This is for Kevin. Can you talk about the emphasis you guys put on
rebounding I think 43-18 was the difference today.  
KEVIN ROGERS: Rebounding has always been the emphasis, especially for a team
like us. We are not the biggest team and that's been a focal point of ours the
entire year. I'm glad that we were able to finally kind of put it together in
the tournament, definitely when we need it.  
  
Q. Kevin and Curtis, if you want to jump in, can you talk about the lift
Josh gave you in the first half getting you off to a quick start.  
KEVIN ROGERS: Josh is like the moveable force. Once he is in that vein, it is
almost impossible to get him out of there.  
We knew they were a small team. We wanted to get the ball inside as much as
possible and, like I said, once Josh catches it, 4 feet in, you know, it is
almost a guaranteed bucket.  
  
Q. Kevin, can you ever recall a time when you single-handedly out rebounded
the other team?  
KEVIN ROGERS: (Smiling) not at all. Anything that I can do to help this team
win and keep us, you know, playing and trying to get into the NCAA tournament,
I'm willing to do.  
  
Q. How important was the start of the second half after they had made the
run late in the first half to make it close again and you all pulled it out
early in the second?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: It was very important. I think we went up ten in the first
half. We kind of relaxed. And then they make a run and we were up one. I look
at the scoreboard and it is kind of deflating.  
But we came in, and like I said, coach made some adjustments. We decided we
would be more patient on offense in order to get Josh the ball and start
inside. I think we made a run. After we were up ten again, I told the guys, we
have been here before and let's just have a different outcome.  
And everybody, they bought into it and we went out and got more stops.  
  
Q. What's y'all's attitude coming into the tournament? Are you looking at
this as a clean slate after a disappointing conference season?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: Most definitely. We had a team meeting and we discussed it.
From this point on, everybody is 0-0. You lose, you go home. We understand
that. We just want to come in and our goal is to win, win, win.  
  
Q. Kevin, this situation could well be applied as out of the frying pan,
into the fire. On the one hand, you had a great starting game against the
Nebraska Cornhuskers. Now you will take on the Kansas Jayhawks. What are your
thoughts on taking on the Jayhawks and moving on through the tournament?  
KEVIN ROGERS: You know, obviously Kansas is a great team. Everybody said that
they were young and inexperienced. But they have two veteran leaders in
Sherron and Cole. That's the heart and soul of the team. So we definitely have
to come in with a different level of focus.  
When we played them at our place, we played them very close. They came out and
got some stops and made some buckets. But like Curtis said, this is a new
thing. We are just going to come out and get a victory.  
CHARLIE FISS: Congratulations, Coach, on your win today. Coach, we'll take
questions for you.  
  
Q. Scott, why was that zone so effective today?  
COACH DREW: They missed some shots and I think we did a good job contesting
shots. When you miss your first couple, then it becomes harder to make them.
And because we contested those, they missed a couple.  
Then when they had some open ones, it was harder for them to go down. Again,
we were very active in it. We didn't give up a lot of second-chance
opportunities, which is again an easy way for an offense to get back on track.  
  
Q. Coach, you had one free-throw attempt in the first half, part of a three-
point play from Kevin Rogers. In the second half you got to the line 18 times.
That was a difference between a three-point lead and a large lead at the end
of the?  
COACH DREW: Normally the people getting to the free-throw line are the more
aggressive ones. We made a conscious effort to take the ball inside and I
think we did a better job of that second half.  
Again, credit to Josh real came up big because we didn't know if he.  
A. Play with his ankle. When he was able to -- we knew he could go, we kept
going inside, at least his presence made it easier for us to go inside.  
  
Q. When did you decide to go to the zone? Was it something specifically
about the way they played that might make you to decide to do it this time?  
COACH DREW: At our place watching on film, we only played zone for a few
possessions, but the possessions we played it, it was effective. Looking at
that, we were like, well, maybe we need to play that more. Obviously with
Josh's ankle situation, it made the situation where you definitely need to
play zone if you are going to use them a lot. We wanted to use him.  
So again I think it was effective early because we contested some shots. They
missed some shots. And we didn't allow them to get second-chance points
because -- when you are in a zone, that's one of the weaknesses of zone, is
giving up second-chance points. I thought we did a good job of limiting them
on that as well.  
  
Q. Did you make rebounding a special point of emphasis? You guys did have
two guys taller than anyone in their lineup?  
COACH DREW: Kevin wasn't joking when he said -- I mean, every game you go
into, rebounding for us is always one of the three keys. I think we were more
effective tonight because guys did a good job going hard. They missed shots,
so they gave us more opportunities.  
But again I think our guys were very focused today.  
  
Q. You touched on Josh Lomers a bit ago. Can you talk a little bit about the
lift he gave you?  
COACH DREW: A little irony in that lift, huh? (Laughter).  
If you are going to have a guy that gets a sprained ankle, have it be a guy
that doesn't jump very much or use it very much. That way again it didn't
effect him as much. Josh did a tremendous job in playing hurt, playing with a
lot of heart. Did a great job in the zone, contesting shots, making his
presence known in there.  
And then on the offensive end, he does a great job posting up. We had a lot of
turnovers trying to get him the ball. Otherwise, he would have been a lot more
effective. But when you have somebody that you know they have to double team
or focus on, it gave other people open shots as well.  
  
Q. Last time against Kansas, you guys did a pretty good job on Cole Aldrich.
Can you talk about the matchup tomorrow, what opportunity there is for your
time now?  
COACH DREW: It is a great opportunity for us. We viewed this conference
tournament as -- nonconference was very successful. Our conference we did not
finish like we wanted to. Our nonconference was an opportunity to get back to
what we were doing.  
So every team you play in the Big 12 we know will be tough. Kansas, obviously,
they can hurt you inside and outside. Whenever you have two players like
Sherron on the outside and Cole Aldrich on the inside, it makes it very
difficult.  
But the shooters they have on the outside also makes it tough when you try to
focus or concentrate on Cole Aldrich.  
  
Q. Coach, they kind of took the lead away from you or closed it there at the
end of the half. How important was the start of that second half where Lace
comes out, hits a three-pointer and then C.J. hits a couple of shots?  
COACH DREW: I thought it was huge, especially from the standpoint that you are
a team that struggled and have a lead and lose it. Sometimes you can get down
and credit our guys for not doing but fighting. And really that second-half
run got us going again and from there on out we were good.  
  
Q. How do you prepare to take on a Kansas team for the second time and do it
in one day? Can you just talk about that matchup tomorrow.  
COACH DREW: The good thing for us because we are a more experienced team, any
adjustments you make, normally we have done them -- we have played a certain
style, played certain plays in the past. It is a matter of telling them what
they are going to do. Because they have experience, it makes it easier to
adjust for it.  
Obviously, preparing against Nebraska was pretty easy, playing them so soon
right before. But Kansas is a team that again we won't change too much of what
we're doing.  
  
Q. Obviously, it is a good way to start the tournament with this kind of
victory. Do you sense any kind of different feeling with your guys now that
you got the conference thing, okay, it didn't work out that well. Second
chance for the season you kind of have -- is there a different feel around the
team?  
COACH DREW: I think when you are struggling in conference, it is kind of like
a weight vest and I think anyone that has ever used a weight vest, you put on
10 pounds, you lose a couple games, you put on 20 pounds, lose a couple games.
It gets up to 40 pounds, you just can't wait to get the vest off.  
I think the conference tournament, you're able to take the vest off and you
feel better.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, again, congratulations and good luck tomorrow.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2009

  

### [Jeff Bzdelik](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13815)

### [Levi Knutson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19423)

### [Dwight Thorne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19422)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Texas  67  
Colorado - 56

  
CHARLIE FISS: All right. We're ready to begin with the Colorado Buffalos and
Coach Bzdelik and his two student-athletes, Dwight Thorne, II, and Levi
Knutson.  
Coach, your thoughts on today's game?  
COACH BZDELIK: Pretty typical game for us from the standpoint that we can't
finish possessions.  
When you yield 18 offensive rebounds, give them 24 points off those 18
offensive rebounds, you know, for the most part we are getting stops but it
has been our problem all year.  
Can't finish a defensive possession. So I'm really proud of my basketball
team. We're undersized in so many ways with our youth and inexperience and
lack of size and they battled. They have been competitive for a great majority
of the year, and today was no different.  
  
Q. Dwight, you will be the only senior next year. What does the team have to
do this off-season to win those close games? You have lost 11 single digits.
What did you take away from this season as far as a learning experience?  
DWIGHT THORNE: First of all, we just got to learn from what we did this year.
We got to learn from the games we played. We had close games. We have to learn
from the blow-outs we had. We just got to get better. That's going to be the
thing for this off-season is just to get better and learn.  
I think if we do that, we got some new guys coming in, got a lot of returners,
so we should be okay for next year.  
  
Q. Was it not boxing out on Texas or are they just bigger and stronger where
it didn't really matter if you boxed out? Were they just getting the boards no
matter what? How did you all see that?  
LEVI KNUTSON: It definitely matters. We got to have all five guys in there on
the defensive boards, getting a body in. If they don't send their guards, our
big guys have to block, or we got to block our man and have the guards come in
there and fish out some of those rebounds. They are definitely bigger than us,
no question. But that doesn't mean we can't rebound the ball. We got to have
all five guys in there. Everybody got to block out and pursue the ball.  
Just because they're bigger, doesn't mean we can't rebound the ball with them.  
  
Q. Dwight and Levi, can you talk about Jermyl and his last game as a
buffalo?  
DWIGHT THORNE: He battled his heart out. He did a hell of a job battling
Dwight Thorne. Unfortunately, it is his last game. I wish him the best. I love
him. He competed all throughout the year this year.  
LEVI KNUTSON: Much of the same. We all love Jermyl in that locker room. He
battles his heart out on the floor, he's always battling bigger guys, like
Dwight said against Pittman tonight. Jermyl is a guy we look up to. He is
always on the floor, always taking charges, fishing out rebounds. So that's
something we can all take from him and I also wish him the best moving
forward.  
  
Q. Dwight, what was Texas doing defensively different than in the first
meeting when you guys shot so well against them?  
DWIGHT THORNE: They were in the zone most of the game this afternoon. We
played them in Boulder, they were more of a man team.  
The zone, they were playing in the passing lanes and not really pressuring the
ball and it kind of threw us off a little bit. We handled it decently. Our
main problem was rebounding the basketball, though. That was our main problem
for the night.  
  
Q. Did you have a feeling that they were going to pound it into Pittman, and
was there much you guys could do about it?  
COACH BZDELIK: We are very well aware of Pittman and our lack of size inside.
He caught the ball so deep that we were unable to double team him. Our
defensive positioning in the beginning of the game wasn't the way we planned
it to be.  
Staying disciplined to our game plan is imperative. We didn't want to front
him and allow him to get angles and dunks. We wanted to keep a body between
him and the basket and force him out as much as possible to catch it at least
away from the rim and then come off of either Mason or Balbay.  
But he caught it so deep and we allowed him angles. We weren't very forceful
on him. But, again, to make him shoot over the top of us and then to block him
off and not allow him six offensive rebounds, as Levi alluded to, the question
about rebounding, sinking and filling with a body on the weak side block, I
can remember vividly four times where we did not do that and they got eight
points off just improper sink and fills.  
See, we're not physical enough. When I talk about our lack of toughness
throughout the course of the year, I don't refer to fighting someone. I refer
to just the discipline to be physically strong enough to hold and contest
position and to sink and fill properly, to hold and contest low-post position
from a defensive point. That's what I'm referring to.  
How do you correct that? You correct that with strength. You correct that with
depth because we wear down and experience. And all those things, depth,
experience and strength are correctable. They're correctable through
recruiting. They're correctable through experience. They're correctable
through physical development.  
  
Q. What is the first thing you guys do to get ready for next fall?  
COACH BZDELIK: Our preparation for next fall begins now, it really does.
That's what we discussed in the locker room.  
We've been competitive for a great majority of the year with an extremely
young team. How do we take the next step? Just as I mentioned: Physical
development. It is 24/7.  
And we talked about Pittman. Here is a young man that was, what? Over 400
pounds, maybe 14 months, 15 months ago. How did he get to where he is? Through
24/7 -- 24 hours a day, 7 days a week of discipline, of eating right, sleeping
right, exercising.  
I remember when Texas came and played us at Coors just several weeks ago, they
were actually lifting weights on the court an hour and a half before the game.
It is just that kind of discipline. Winning doesn't come easy. If it did,
everybody would be doing it. How do you learn to win? Well, first of all, you
have to develop your body.  
Again, that's 24/7. Recruiting, I just had an assistant coach over the last
four days drive 1500 miles and met us here. I will be going out Friday morning
and we've already signed three good players and we hope to add another one or
two.  
So that will improve the depth. They need to -- when they come back from
spring break March 30th, we'll start individual development as well as a
strong discipline strength program. It all adds up. And so the question that
they have to ask themselves every day is "what have I done today to improve
myself and Colorado basketball for tomorrow?"  
If they can answer something yes every day, then we're headed in the right
direction.  
  
Q. Jeff, Cory might have had his worst game of the year, at least
statistically. Did he have an off night or was it something Texas was doing?  
COACH BZDELIK: They started off man-to-man and they really had a hard time
guarding us, I thought. We were just able to go by him and shot a high
percentage. The zone, we were very passive initially against the zone for
whatever reason. We weren't -- we have to get the ball inside the zone and our
bigs weren't moving real well and our perimeters were just settling and
standing around. We weren't penetrating gaps.  
Cory had some good looks and I thought pretty much -- if you wanted to single
out one play is when they stole the ball and went in there and got it blocked.
It was kind of the way the evening went for us offensively.  
Their players were longer and stronger and finished and played above the rim
and we played below the rim.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you very much.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Oklahoma State  81  
Iowa State - 67

  
CHARLIE FISS: We are joined by the Cyclones of Iowa State University and Coach
Greg McDermott and his student-athletes, Craig Brackins and Jamie Vanderbeken.  
Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: The zone did what we hoped it would do in the first half.
They made some good adjustments in the second half and probably the most
important one was they played Obi more minutes. We had a hard time getting to
him and he made us pay for it when we didn't get to him. They were a little
more aggressive on Craig in the second half with the double teams. When you
play 37 minutes and you see double teams and physical play, virtually every
time you touch it, it wears on you as the game goes on.  
I am proud of my team. They competed for me all year. They didn't quit on each
other. We just didn't quite have enough bullets in the gun tonight.  
  
Q. Craig, what did you notice from the crowd tonight? Obviously you know you
are playing a road game in a neutral spot. Did you guys notice it as a big
factor?  
CRAIG BRACKINS: I noticed they had a lot of fans. We had a lot of support,
too. So I mean, it felt like a road game but I felt we did pretty well and we
should have executed a little more but that's how it goes.  
  
Q. Craig, what was Moses able to do to make him so effective inside
tonight?  
CRAIG BRACKINS: Moses had a really great game. He was very aggressive on the
inside. His confidence was up. So when you have that going and the way they
can shoot it, I mean, they are a really tough team to guard when that happens.  
  
Q. Craig, Coach said it was a tough game for you tonight. Can you talk about
how tough it was.  
CRAIG BRACKINS: It is a very tough game, it was tonight. They came out with
four guards in the big. The way they can shoot the ball is very difficult to
guard. The way Bryan Petersen can lock on, they are a tough team to guard. I
thought we did a pretty good job of doing the best we can.  
  
Q. In the second half, they said they tried to kind of change up when they
double teamed you, like they didn't come at you every time. Was that difficult
at all to read or figure out what they were doing? Was it a little bit tough
to get in a rhythm against them not knowing what they would throw at you?  
CRAIG BRACKINS: It was because in the first half I didn't feel like they fully
committed to a double team. In the second half they did. I had to watch my
back every time I caught the ball.  
I felt they were still shading in the middle and trying to trap me and not
going to the middle when I caught the ball. So they just did a really good job
in the second half of trying to make it difficult for me.  
  
Q. At what point do you make the decision about whether or not to come back
next year or try to make a jump to the NBA?  
CRAIG BRACKINS: I don't know right now.  
  
Q. Jamie, you stepped up pretty big tonight and a few other role-players
made some key shots at key times. How much confidence does that give you next
year knowing that some people besides Craig can step up whether he is back or
not?  
JAMIE VANDERBEKEN: It is just like we knew we had a lot of good players here.
It is just finding the right rhythms and stuff. I think we had a pretty good
core coming in next year. With the shooters and what Craig can do inside, I
think we will be able to surprise a lot of people next year.  
  
Q. Coach, when you saw the draw and you saw you were going to be getting OSU
in the first round, what was your reaction to that knowing you were playing
here in Oklahoma City not too far from their campus?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: Last time we played in Oklahoma City we played Oklahoma.
So... (smiling). That's kind of the way things have gone.  
You take your draw and you get ready for it. There is a lot of talented teams
in this league, and regardless of who you were going to draw, they were going
to present a certain set of challenges. And Oklahoma State certainly falls
into that category. They are unique in that James Anderson who some day is
going to be a NBA off-guard is playing a power forward. For us to use our size
to our advantage, one of our big guys has to guard him. That's just a very
difficult matchup. We did a good job getting to James and making his looks
tough.  
One of the keys of the game is we needed to get to the free-throw line more
than they did. We fouled them four times for eight free throws the last four
possessions. Otherwise, they only shot six free throws and we shot 23 but we
didn't step up and made them. Had we shot free throws like we are capable of,
it could have changed the game. I thought that would be a telling statistic at
the end of the game.  
  
Q. Is that the most you played zone in a game all year? And it looked like
in the second half did you switch up the alignment a little bit to make it
look like they were getting a little bit of a rhythm?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: They got into a rhythm against our 2-3 zone so we switched to
a 3-2 zone in the second half and tried to switch where we were on the floor.
By far the most zone we played in any game.  
Out of respect for Byron Eaton's ability to drive the ball, we couldn't keep
him out of the paint in the second half in Stillwater and we put him on the
free-throw line a bunch.  
Over the course of the season, not a lot of people have zoned Oklahoma State.
We just thought if we could make the right rotations and the right reads we
could cause some problems and we did a better job of it the first half than we
did the second.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the challenges that Obi and Marshall provided in the
paint for you guys tonight and for Brackins in particular, too?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: When you have four shooters out there with you, it is a post-
player's dream because you cannot leave Keiton Page, James Anderson or Obi
Muonelo. Oftentimes he was able to catch it deep. When we tried to help, we
were late. He made tough plays over top Alex and Jamie, really strong,
physical, aggressive post moves.  
Against a team like Oklahoma State, you have to give up something, and I guess
we had going into it a lot of their respect for the ability to shoot the
three-point shot. So we took our chances with Moses inside.  
  
Q. Obviously it is no secret that Craig's name has been bandied about for
him to make the jump into the NBA. When do you sit down and talk about the
pros and cons of making that decision?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: Those conversations are ongoing because as soon as it comes
up for a guy that's 20 or 21 years old and your name starts to get thrown
around in that regard, as a coach you better address it because it will weigh
heavily on his mind. I think that's human nature. I think all of us would
probably feel that way.  
So we've talked about it some and just made the decision during the season
that he is going to try to stay as focused as he can on helping his team win
basketball games and then when it is over, we'll sit down and talk about it.  
Spring break is next week. He will go back to California, spend some time with
his family and decide exactly what their plan of action will be. My job is to
provide him as much information, do as much research as I possibly can and try
to provide him with sound advice so when the time comes to make a decision, it
will be an educated decision.  
  
Q. Coach, you tied the game at 50 with 12 minutes left. From there it kind
of started to get away from you. What changed at that point that you saw the
game start to slip away?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: At 49-48 we turned it over three straight times. There was
really an opportunity there for us, I think, to make a move. That was also the
stretch where I think Muonelo scored two three-point shots and a tough
17-footer from the elbow fading away. He was really the difference in the
game. The last five or six games he hasn't played the minutes he's played
throughout the season and his minutes weren't as productive as they have been
during the season.  
So he was really the wild card for them. They had somebody step up and have
really a great night.  
  
Q. You talked earlier about the tough game that Craig Brackins had to play.
Can you talk about just how tough that was on him tonight.  
COACH MCDERMOTT: Every game is tough for Craig. He has seen every imaginable
defense that there is. I think people, if they hadn't seen him play until
tonight, got a taste of what he's capable of. He can score -- he can score
really hard baskets. That's why the NBA has an interest in him because he is
so talented scoring the basketball different ways.  
His body has taken a pounding during the season, the number of minutes he's
played and the physical style of defense that has been played against him over
the course of 32 games will take its toll. I think he has held up remarkably
well and has been very consistent. Another double-double tonight.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you very much.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Baylor  65  
Nebraska - 49

  
CHARLIE FISS: We are joined now by the Huskers of Nebraska with Coach Doc
Sadler and his two student-athletes. Coach, your thoughts on today's game?  
COACH SADLER: Thanks, Charlie. First of all, you know, got to congratulate
Baylor. I don't think that they did anything different than what we saw down
there. It is just that we didn't make shots. Our defense again has been our
solid point all year at 60. We have been averaging -- giving up 62 points a
game, and we gave up 65.  
So there wasn't that much difference there. We haven't turned the ball over.
We didn't turn it over today. It comes down to one thing. It comes down to you
making or missing shots. You are not going to win very many ball games
shooting 31% from the field. And we didn't get to the free-throw line enough,
but give Baylor credit.  
And as far as my team, I told them after the game, there is not a team that I
have been more happy with than the guys that we got. It is just the shots
would not fall today, and that's something you can't control.  
I think we got great shots. I was talking to the coaches. I think there was
two bad shots in the whole ball game I wish we wouldn't have shot. If you can
say that in most games, you'll be happy.  
  
Q. Ryan and Ade, Baylor was in the zone just about all for a couple of
possessions. Can you talk about the challenge of that and how you all
responded to it?  
ADE DAGUNDURO: Yeah, Baylor is a team that heavily relies on our three-point
shots. And today they were falling a lot today. We were hoping that they might
go on a cold streak, but they just continued for 42 minutes hitting.  
RYAN ANDERSON: 2-3 zone they played on defense, is that what you are saying?
They have big guys. We were banking on us hitting our shots, but they weren't
falling. That was just kind of the case today.  
To get them out of the zone, you have to hit some shots to make them respect
the shot so they come out of the zone. But they didn't come out of it.  
  
Q. In the first half against the zone, you guys did seem to kind of get some
shots inside. And the second half, was the three the only shot that was there?
It seemed like you took a lot of threes in the second half. Is that because
you couldn't get -- I think 18 of your 29 shots in the second half were
threes. Was it just because you couldn't get anything inside?  
ADE DAGUNDURO: I think it was a matter of us just stop executing our zone
offense.  
In the first half, the middle was wide open. We tried to attack the middle.
For some reason in the second half, we did a poor job of attacking the middle.  
RYAN ANDERSON: Again, what he said. The middle was wide open. Second half, we
didn't do that, even though the shots that we did take, they were good shots.
They just weren't falling.  
  
Q. I know it is hard to think about this after a loss, can you take a
measure of satisfaction from this season so far? It may not be over for you
guys, but can you talk about the level of satisfaction for this team this
season.  
RYAN ANDERSON: Definitely, we have been -- we're not satisfied with where we
are, but I'm satisfied -- we are satisfied with the team, how we play hard and
come out and execute and just give it everything we got every game. Like Coach
said, you couldn't ask anyone more from us. I think the team, we have given
everything we got.  
We can't control if the ball goes in or not, but we can control if we come out
and play hard and give it everything we got every time on the court.  
CHARLIE FISS: Ryan and Ade, we'll let you return to the locker room. Now we'll
take questions for Coach Sadler.  
  
Q. Doc, they say the first half you guys did get the ball around the free-
throw line against their zone. The middle was open. That kind of broke things
down. Was it not open in the second half, or did they make some adjustments to
take that away?  
COACH SADLER: I thought we was real able to get the ball down in the low post,
especially -- you know, but then you get yourself in a situation they were
spreading it out. The inside was much more open than the outside. We just
didn't attack -- we didn't attack the block the way you have got to attack it
against the zone or the baseline.  
I thought unfortunately the last five or six minutes we started doing what we
needed to do. But, no, I don't think they did anything different. We wouldn't
be -- you are not going to win many ball games shooting 31 percent. It is just
not going to do it. That's been the Achilles heel of this basketball team all
year.  
You hold them to 65 points, you got to think that you got a chance. And I
don't think -- I think this may be one of our probably -- but you got to give
Baylor credit. They are awful big down there against us. They had a couple of
guys make some threes. But even that, 65 points is not too many points.  
It is just our lack of ability to score. Again, you look at it and you turn
the ball over eight times. You just get frustrated as players. When shots --
24 threes is probably too many. But as I said before, I think out of 24
threes, I think there is only one I wished we wouldn't have taken.  
  
Q. Doc, you hate to single somebody out. Paul had a tough day shooting. Do
you want to see him continue to take that and shoot his way out of it?  
COACH SADLER: Oh, yeah, if I'm going to play Paul, that's what he does best
for us. Again, I think he took good shots. I don't think he took bad shots. It
just didn't fall for him. Paul Velander, guys, is -- he's the -- you are never
going to take anything because, you know, Paul Velander, make or miss shots or
whatever he's doing, is always going to do it in the best interest of the team
and not even have him -- I mean, there is not a selfish bone in that guy's
body.  
So he did what he was supposed to do. He knows for us, this team, he needs to
shoot the ball. It didn't go in.  
So, yeah, I'm not disappointed that he took 10 shots at all.  
  
Q. Talk about the play of Josh Lomers down low. How much did that affect you
guys today?  
COACH SADLER: It is not difficult to look at our team and understand that
anybody with any size -- you know, you get down in that lane and stay in there
for a long time, you know, it is hard to defend. And he is a big 'ole guy down
there. It definitely had an effect on us.  
  
Q. Along those lines, Kevin Rogers had a career high 20 rebounds. Did those
two big bodies in the middle make it hard for you guys to get into the routine
on the boards?  
COACH SADLER: Sure. Everybody -- Kevin Rogers, I think, is one of the most
talented players in this league. I know he's probably disappointed in his
season. But Kevin Rogers, you don't see many 6'9" guys that does the things
that he does. He has a chance to do something special if that's what he
chooses to do.  
Who are we going to match up with Kevin and Lomers together? We are just not
going to -- you have to take something away, you know? When they went to the
two big guys as late in the year -- I think it started with the Kansas game. I
think that's when people really just started attacking the offensive boards
against us. I mean, it has been a concern every game from that point.  
We had done a decent job. But from the Kansas game at Kansas, people really
exposed that and I think they did that today.  
  
Q. You like this team's chances of moving on and playing post-season?  
COACH SADLER: There is no question about that. If you're playing in supposedly
-- if it's the third-best league in the country -- I mean, if it is not, then
people in our conference office need to take a long look at themselves and
wonder why you don't have more teams in post-season.  
If you are the third-best team and you got teams below you that's getting
seven -- or talking about six, seven teams in the NCAA tournament, there is no
way an 8-8 team in this league is not going to continue to play.  
If it doesn't, then they need to take a long look at themselves because the
teams are doing what they need to do. So that's my opinion. I'm sure some
people don't want to hear that, but that's how I feel.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Ade's performance today?  
COACH SADLER: Yeah, I mean it's like it's been, just gutsy. Ade is a guy that
gives you everything he's got. And the thing that you got to be careful with
him sometimes is trying to do too much because he wants to so bad. But, boy,
how can you get -- you are not going to get any more out of a 6'4" guy than
what we are getting. He is a total warrior.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Texas  67  
Colorado - 56

  
CHARLIE FISS: We're joined now by the Texas Longhorns, Coach Rick Barnes and
his two student-athletes, A.J. Abrams and Dexter Pittman.  
Coach, congratulations on today's victory. Your thoughts?  
COACH BARNES: One, obviously, happy that we got the win and did some good
things. Looking at Dexter, I just saw it here for the first time, he got
26-10. He should have had 35 and whatever. Right, Dexter?  
DEXTER PITTMAN: Yes.  
COACH BARNES: Again, I thought our guys did the right thing, really trying to
play through. We definitely knew we wanted to put the ball inside and make
Colorado defend.  
Second half, we obviously did a much better job of not giving them free throws
and keeping them off the free-throw line.  
  
Q. A.J., is this the most you guys have looked all season to make sure you
got him the ball?  
A.J. ABRAMS: For the most part. We always try to look to get him the ball
early in the game. But, you know, tonight we knew he would be a big dominant
force which he always is. He was going to work inside. He was getting close to
the paint, getting close to the rim. He was making the shots. He played a heck
of a game tonight.  
  
Q. Dexter, how come you didn't have 35 and whatever?  
DEXTER PITTMAN: Because I missed some free throws. Five free throws I think? I
missed five free throws.  
COACH BARNES: What about the lay-ups?  
DEXTER PITTMAN: I missed some lay-ups.  
COACH BARNES: Who guarded you on that last lay-up?  
A.J. ABRAMS: Me.  
DEXTER PITTMAN: I think A.J. did.  
  
Q. Both of you guys can talk about your new zone defense, is that your new
staple? Where did that come from?  
A.J. ABRAMS: Is that our new staple? We work on it. We just haven't used it.
We have been pretty much a man-to-man guy, trying to apply pressure. I think
Coach would agree, you have to mix-up defense this time of year and just try
to be good at both of them.  
  
Q. Dexter, did you run out of gas at the end referring to those lay-ups?  
DEXTER PITTMAN: No, I wouldn't say that. Probably concentration. I wasn't
concentrating on it, like Coach said, at the end of the game.  
  
Q. A.J., can you talk about the confidence that you guys have in Dexter now,
how that view of him is changing and maybe when it changed that you would feel
comfortable running everything through him?  
A.J. ABRAMS: We've always had confidence in Dex. I mean, he has put in so much
work over the years. He has worked hard. He deserves what he is getting. Not
too many people can stop him. We will keep giving him the ball and play
through him because he is a dominant force, like I said. We will just try to
play through him.  
  
Q. This is for both A.J. and Dexter. You will advance to the quarterfinals
and take on the Kansas State Wildcats. Kansas State is notorious for giving
the Texas Longhorns grief in basketball, whether you are talking football or
basketball. How are you planning on breaking the streak for your team?  
A.J. ABRAMS: We will go out and play hard. That's what it is going to come to.
That's what it is going to come down to is just effort and working the game
plan. I mean, we are a better team than what we did last time we played them.
We have to go out there and, like Dex said, we have to concentrate for a full
40 minutes.  
COACH BARNES: Does the Big 12 reprimand for that? (Smiling).  
  
Q. Dex, you weren't a factor in the game at Colorado like here. What
happened in that one?  
A.J. ABRAMS: Couldn't breathe.  
DEXTER PITTMAN: That wasn't it, man.  
COACH BARNES: He couldn't breathe.  
DEXTER PITTMAN: Yeah, I was a little tired up there. It was quick.  
I don't know. I was so worried about them, just them having smaller guys
trying to drive me and I didn't get caught up in the game quick enough. I
wasn't ready. But Coach and Coach Todd was talking to me and said I didn't
play that good against them. I had to come in with the mind-set that I could
show Colorado that I could play.  
  
Q. Did you teach Jim Boeheim that zone defense or did you get it from him?  
COACH BARNES: We started using it actually -- it was the year -- I don't know
what year it was when Daniel Gibson -- Daniel's first year here. We had gotten
down. I remember going to play Colorado up there. That was the game we only
had seven scholarship players with us. That's when we really started using it.  
But, yeah, I did talk to Jim about it. I really did. Back then we talked about
it. As A.J. said, we've had it, we just haven't used it very much. We knew
coming in that we really are -- our game plan was to use it 70 percent, 80
percent depending how it was going.  
Colorado does a great job of driving the ball out of their man offense and
they did a good job against the zone really. And we wanted to push out a
little bit which is going to open up some driving lanes. We've had it. We just
haven't used it quite as much as we have in the past.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Dexter's confidence and what you're seeing from him? I
know he has missed some lay-ups and whatnot. Can you just talk about his
confidence?  
COACH BARNES: I think the difference is we walked in the locker room today --
I'm sorry, when we walked out of the hotel coming over here after we watched
our personnel tape, he said, Coach, I didn't play well at all at Colorado. And
I asked him the same question you guys asked.  
He said the same thing. And today we actually said, "Stay back, don't allow
yourself to be driven, make them come through you. You get deep post up on the
offense end, they won't have an answer."  
The difference in him is, again, I think he keeps working and keeps going. Our
guys are starting to learn to get him the ball, throwing it up to him, which I
think is good. We had a couple of really nice post feeds in there.  
The one thing he did, Coach Sutton asked me about how he became such a good
free-throw shooter, the year he spent losing a bunch of weight, the one thing
I said to him from the day that we recruited him, he said, you must become a
good free-throw shooter because you are going to get fouled a lot. That's the
one thing of all the things he's done that I think he has worked really hard
on.  
I think we are all very confident in that situation that he will make his free
throws. I still think some of those shots at the end, it's concentration
really. But the biggest thing is, he has more minutes, he is playing more
minutes. We try to get him out before each -- before each time-out if we can
for a little bit. I thought he showed really some toughness today because he
rolled his ankle a little bit and came back in.  
Again, he is just getting started to what he can be.  
  
Q. Did the fact that you played zone so much, did that also help Dex? He is
a little bit better off when he can just stay back in the zone, right?  
COACH BARNES: Well, you would think that. But honestly, that middleman in that
zone is in some way the most important guy.  
So it is not an easy position to play. Obviously, he is not moving as much.
But that's not an easy position, it really isn't.  
Again, at Colorado, our whole plan up there was, again, to play about 70
percent zone to keep Dexter in that game and he gave up eight quick points up
there in the middle of a zone where he was just -- like you said, he was
worried about people driving him. They got him up in the air and they went by
him. That was the real reason he didn't play at Colorado. He wasn't effective
in the zone, and that's the reason we are going to do it.  
Man-wise, we wanted a smaller lineup out there. I think if he can keep getting
better in the middle of it, it is going to help him. It is not an easy
position to play, it really isn't.  
  
Q. You just referenced that we are just beginning to see Dexter. If he
continues to work, continues to progress, what is the upside there for Dexter?
How good can he be?  
COACH BARNES: Again, I do think he will continue. I mean, it is really
amazing, if I could put up the before and after pictures of his -- the way he
has changed his body and where he started, he really -- believe it or not, he
is at 13 percent body fat. It is amazing where he is at and where he came
from.  
His body, it changes. It is amazing how it changes, and it keeps continuing to
change. I still think that he will continue to -- his stamina will keep
getting better. I said before, I think as he continues to lose weight, which
he will, he's got great hands. I'm telling you, you don't realize how hard it
is to shoot a basketball when your hands are as big as his hands. It is
unbelievable how hard it is. For him to have the touch that he has is really,
I think, a compliment to him how hard he's worked.  
How hard he has worked -- and he really cares. He is very conscientious. When
we do walk-throughs, he is at the point now where he asks more questions than
anybody on our team because he really wants to do the right thing. So this is
all kind of new for him in terms of playing the minutes he is playing and
knowing that we're coming at him every time pretty much on the offensive end.  
So I think that in itself is an adjustment for him, knowing that he has got to
produce. I think people don't realize that. It is hard to be a legitimate
20-point scorer, 15-point scorer because every night people are game planning
for you. There is no doubt that people have to game plan for Dexter now.  
  
Q. Rick, on the zone D, also if you may be playing four games in four days,
does that help? How would you rate your defense down the stretch this
season?  
COACH BARNES: Well, now, we didn't play it thinking in terms of we are going
to rest or any of that. We didn't do that. Again, looking at our tape with
Colorado, they just -- when we had them pretty much in the same position we
had them today, they just kept staying in the game and caused us fouling
because they drive the ball so well.  
Any time you look at the fact they shot 35 percent, you will feel good about
that. They scrapped and came up with offensive rebounds. One of the drawbacks
in the zone is the rebounding. Some of those shots come off and there is one
area of the floor that it goes against everything we taught because we don't
block out in the zone. If you do go block out you get penalized or you get
hurt by it most of the time because the way the ball is going to come of.  
That's the thing that's hard, again, getting guys to block out of it
consistently and getting the guards to come down. Dogus came down with great
rebounds today and the guards have to rebound out of it. We'll use it. We get
in it now. We'll stay in it until I think people get comfortable against it.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Louisville 76  
Syracuse 66

  
COACH RICK PITINO: First I'd like to congratulate Syracuse on a tremendous
performance. It's not easy to do what they did and they did it again tonight
most of the game and sooner or later, you know your legs are going to give out
sooner or later. But they were brilliant throughout the stretch. Our guys have
a lot of respect for their basketball team. I want to congratulate them on a
great season. We're real proud of our guys.  
Tonight the first half we were doing some good things. The shot was not going
down. We missed some easy ones are the ones outside and inside. At halftime we
said, look, it's not going to happen in a matter of a minute or two like last
night but it did. We got a great run. We turned it around where we shot 61
percent and they shot 30-something percent.  
Got 15 steals again and these two seniors are taking us on a great run. T.
Will (Terrence Williams) had his normal brilliance tonight, the steal record
tonight of 7, he had six assists, he rebounds, he carries the trophy, he does
just about everything, so he had an unbelievable senior year and this young
man Andre McGee puts more pressure on -- than any mother-in-law in the country
(laughter).  
  
Q. Rick, your first year in the Big East, you said a number of times after
games that the opposition is back to the woodshed. Where is this program now
is my first question?  
COACH RICK PITINO: We entered the Big East for us the wrong year. We entered
it coming off a Final Four where we lost our talent, our leadership and we
knew we weren't going to be a good team that year. We were competitive so we
had to rebuild. We were going to reload Conference USA. We had to rebuild in
the Big East. Asking, boy, how does it feel to finally win a Big East
championship? I've only been in the league four years. They forgot we just
joined the league. We had to get the talent back up certainly and these guys
came in the inaugural year and going out tournament champions.  
  
Q. You have just about everything in your resume. Now you have a Big East
conference championship in this building. What does it mean for you?  
COACH RICK PITINO: I'm really proud of what the guys have done. Personally, to
me to see these guys smile and have such a good time because I get after them
very hard. The last two half times I've acted like a typical coach being a
horse's ass, but they know me and I know them very well. They know -- we all
are starving to win and this is a very tough group of guys to coach, the age
group. We're all into instant gratification, AAU basketball, what's happening
now and points and touches. I think the word "touches" probably infuriates me
more than anything in life. These guys have just bought into total team. They
all want to do what they can do but winning is the most important thing. We
had to get that through to is a Samardo Samuels and Terrence Jennings. These
guys have been a part of it. Terrence can do anything on the court. Andre
McGee averaged 30 points a game in high school. They know we're going to win
and sacrifice and play.  
For me personally being part of this team is great. I love the fact that we
did it in the toughest year in the history of the Big East to sweep both of
those things and then the thing I'm most proud of is the way we played on the
road the last three years. You know, your program turns when you play -- when
you play terrific on the road.  
  
Q. Coach, you kind of disappeared when all the trophy and everything and I
understand you went back to the locker room. I mean were you just kind of
reminiscing back there?  
COACH RICK PITINO: I also just prepare. It's their time to be cutting the
nets. They do all the work so it's their time and I just wanted to put some
things on the board and my insides are gushing with pride. Coaching these two
guys has been a special treat for me. They're like children to me, both guys.
I'm hoping Andre stays with me as a coach and the other young man is going to
go on (to the NBA). I'll be borrowing money from him real soon.  
  
Q. Rick, as far as the conference goes, do you see three number one seeds
coming out and where would you put the chances of a national champion coming
out of the Big East?  
COACH RICK PITINO: You know, I think there's a distinct possibility we'll get
three Big East teams number one. I think it's well deserved by all three
teams.  
You know, there's so much banter and talk about seeding. I've been doing this
quite sometime. I've never seen so much talk about in-and-out seeds. I'm
amazed that everybody is getting so much into it. It's great, it really is
great but I can tell you from coaching in the tournament, it really doesn't
matter. You're going to have to play good basketball and all the teams in the
Big East play great defense so that's why you have a shot. That's what we try
to drill every day. No matter what we do offensively, if we play great defense
we have a chance to win and great defensive teams are going to get to a Final
Four. We've got a bunch of teams in the Big East that play great defense.  
  
Q. Terrence, you could have been the most outstanding player. I saw you go
over to Jonny Flynn. What did you say to him?  
TERRENCE WILLIAMS: I told Jonny to keep his head up. You guys can ask Andre,
watch him play against UCONN and Seton Hall, I say he reminds me a lot of
Chris Paul. I told Andre that was the best point guard in the country to me
just the way he handles the ball, the way he runs his team and the way he is
always smiling. I told him to keep his head up and have a great run in the
tournament because at the end of the day we're all from the same conference.
It's like a family and we were at the Lebron Skills Academy this summer, we
were on the same team so we have a history.  
  
Q. Terrence, you weren't giving the trophy back to anyone after the game. Do
you plan on giving it back to anyone? And how gratifying just is this whole
thing for you guys to double up this year?  
TERRENCE WILLIAMS: I might share it with Andre holding it a little bit but I
was just being greedy with it. It's a team thing and for us to win this, it
means so much to not only me and Andre but the team, we've been here three
years in a row and got sent home early every time so everybody says we can't
play well in the Garden. So come here and prove that wrong and say we're in
the toughest league and in the paper it says we're supposed to finish 2nd and
finish 1st and come in here and finally be able to hold that trophy and be
part of the history of the Big East, it means a lot for us.  
  
Q. I'd like to ask the players how big of a motivating factor was it to fill
in that line on Rick's resume, Big East tournament champ?  
ANDRE McGEE: I wasn't sure he won that yet. We're glad to give him one more.
We came in the inauguration year and Louisville into the Big East together,
all three of us and me and him are leaving as Big East champs. It feels good.  
TERRENCE WILLIAMS: I actually heard it I guess being one of the few times I do
watch ESPN, that he didn't have that, the conference champion and Big East
champion. I didn't want to say it to the guys. I kept in it my mind that he
didn't have that and me looking to him as a father, it's like your father
leaves and you change the oil for him. You help him out in some way. That's
what I tried to do personal as a player.  
  
Q. Coach, how about the fact that your career began in the Big East world,
at least on the national level, and now you bring the Louisville program back
to the Big East and win it outright. What does it feel for you and your
staff?  
COACH RICK PITINO: You know what's interesting? I don't think I would have
taken the Louisville job if they were in the Big East when it started. I
wanted to do something different. Not that I would -- it's been a secret
desire of mine to be in Conference USA. I don't mean that. I wanted to try
something different, play against different coaches, play against different
competition, do different things. That's why I took the Louisville job. It was
very difficult for me to take the job because of Kentucky. I felt, you know,
one time every two years, it would be difficult and I would get through that.
I wanted to try something different. I wasn't looking to go back into the Big
East, whether it was a Big Ten or Conference USA or the PAC-10.  
Then when it all happened, Tom Jurich said could you call Michael Tranghese
and help me to get into the Big East. Some football schools are going to
defect. I said, Tom, you're not right on that. He said, yes, I am. I called
Michael. Is there something going on? He said, I can't talk about it. I said,
can you put us down because we need to get in there football-wise.  
I forgot what I was getting back into. We were just trying to get in because
of football. We felt we had a big time football program and seeing that we're
back in the Big East. We've been number one revenue producer in college
basketball five straight years in row. We always sell out, 19,500 tickets. We
have a new 22,000-seat arena and $350 million, there's no money. For us I
notice everybody leaves early Conference USA, everybody shows up late. Our
people are rivetted. They tailgate for basketball. So what the Big East has
done for the basketball program has just been unbelievable. I didn't expect
it, didn't think about it until it happened. It's been a tremendous gift for
our city and our state.  
  
Q. For both players, can you -- do you guys feel that it's only a matter of
time before your defense gets to the opponent whoever you might be playing?  
TERRENCE WILLIAMS: Well, our four guards do a heck of a job pressuring the
other guards the whole game and you may handle it for a short period but if
you don't have a nice amount of point guards to handle the ball it's going to
get to them and wear down. The way we practice we run so much and we don't
feel that there's other teams in the exact same shape as us. Even if they go
by the guards the back pursues and the forwards will level them off and really
slow them down in the second half.  
ANDRE McGEE: Our defense, it's a relentless attack when we play the way we
like to play. In the first half we didn't do that. They had runouts on us and
get easy buckets. We made sure we came in the second half and stepped up our
intensity. Even breaking the press through dribbling, it's a hard thing to do.
That wears guards out trying to dribble through two, three, four guys and
we're bringing in so many different guys and we lose nothing when go to our
bench. Our depth is one of our great assets, so when guys come in ready to
keep pressure on the ball it really helps us out and teams do end up wearing
out late in the second half.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed like in the second half you came out really consciously
wanting to work it inside out. I was just wondering if that was something that
was bugging you or you felt was hurting you in the first half.  
COACH RICK PITINO: I think we missed a few easy shots in the first half around
the rim. We got our shots blocked a couple times and that's a tribute to the
defense. The guys did a good job in the second half of distributing the
basketball.  
One big key for us besides the pressure, besides the passing is, stop the
three, make the three. And if you look at our run since we've been hot, you
know, disparity from the 3-point line the way West Virginia; Providence,
you're looking at sometimes 30 to 15 (points) or you're seeing a lopsided
point total from making the three and stopping the three. I don't think the
3-point is a weapon unless you stop it. I've always believed that, even going
back to 1987 at Providence. I didn't think if -- if we didn't stop it, it was
of no value. So we're doing a very good job in this run of stopping the three.
We did it in all these games as well as West Virginia at West Virginia to win
the regular season championship.  
  
Q. Rick, all the years you've been doing this, is there some type of art or
science in doing during the conference tournament it's really emotional and
then switching gears and then begin the NCAA? Is it different or what?  
COACH RICK PITINO: I think it's sometimes like last year I think it really
helped us going home but this team, the bench is so deep that they all play. I
just yell, give me two new guards. I don't even say their names and they go. I
say, give me two new guards and they go. We have a deep bench and it's the way
we play. Some teams -- I always -- well, they have a deep bench. Every team
has 13 scholarships. It's whether you want to play them or not. We want to
play our guys. We don't play (Jared) Swopshire and T. Will (Terrence Williams)
plays 40 minutes. About 30 seconds before a timeout I take them out. We can't
play in the game without T. Will. It's impossible because he gets every
rebound, every pass, makes all the plays. Andre is -- he's the most relentless
pressure guy. This young man spent his whole high school career in the
hospital when I was recruiting him with cramps. We figured out the cramping
problem. Now he's gone from about 18 percent body when I first came to 6 or 7.
Never gets tired. I think sometimes it's not bad going home. I think it helped
us last year, we went to an Elite 8. I think this year was very important for
our guys to continue winning because our bench is so deep.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned you were back in the locker room writing some things
on the board. Can you just give us an idea of what some of those things
were?  
COACH RICK PITINO: Some of the statistical things we did in the second half
and I said, you know, you got to soak this in now guys. Regular season champs,
tournament season champs. Two different things. The regular season
championship is a body of work for two and a half months. So that's the most
special thing. The tournament championship is playing great for those three
days and I said you're going in the Knick locker room every time. That's what
you get in Madison Square Garden. If you're the 8th seed, 9th seed, you put in
a little high school locker room maybe some of the maintenance people change.
When you go into the Knick locker room and you're number one, relish all of
this and understand it going into the tournament.  
It was a big treat for us and for me to go into in Knick locker room and have
all the plaques and to just reminisce and think of those things and think of
Mike Saunders, the trainer, and Patrick (Ewing) and Mark (Jackson) and Gerald
Wilkins and Oak (Charles Oakley), all the fun we had. It was a security thing,
this whole thing, not so much winning it, just memory lane.  
You played Providence where you coached in '87. You play Syracuse with me
getting your first job at the major college level. You're in the Knick locker
room where you coached. For me it was just a trip down memory lane. Sometimes
really happy and sometimes reminiscing and becoming an old son of a gun now.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Louisville, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2009

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Jonny Flynn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19433)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Louisville 76  
Syracuse 66

  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: I thought, you know, the first half we played as well as we
played down here on both ends, defensively especially. I just thought we did a
great job defensively in the first half and we made a couple bad turnovers and
they converted them. That's what they do. Second half we made a couple bad
turnovers and they converted them and I think there was just a point there
where we got the three, four open looks and, you know, couldn't -- you have to
make shots against them. They're going to gamble and you're going to get some
open shots and you have to make them, and when you don't, you know, they're
going to score on the other end.  
But I told our players that the way we played the last two weeks has been a
tremendous -- I think tremendous for what we can do next week.  
We really had to start playing at the St. John's game. We were on the edge of
not being anywhere. We started to play better defense. We got our offense
going. I think we really played as well as we could play for three, four games
and coming in here, we played very well the first game. Obviously, even better
in the Connecticut game and better yesterday and the first half tonight was
really as good as we played down here.  
But you have to give Louisville tremendous credit. They've been the best team
in the league. They've won 20 I think out of their last 22 games and they're
very, very talented basketball team.  
We just made a few too many mistakes and we think we went 0-for-8 from the
3-point line in the second half. You have to make those shots. But I told our
players that we won this thing the last two times we were in the finals and
I'm just as proud or maybe a little bit more proud of what they've done this
week in New York even though we didn't win, some people would not think that
was good, but I do.  
I really believe that. Jonny was unbelievable here for these five games that
we played.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Jim, did fatigue set in on this one?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: I'm not going to talk about that. Louisville played better
than we did the second half. That's it.  
  
Q. Coach, would you prefer to play Friday next week and get the day off?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: I'd like to play about two weeks from today. We'll be fine.
We were fine tonight in the first half. Going into like five games, we were
fine if we got a little. If we got a little tired, we might have gotten a
little tired. We'll be fine whether we play Thursday or Friday. It doesn't
matter.  
  
Q. Coach, you brought up a couple years ago when you guys played four games
in four days, the first team ever to win the championship like that. You
mentioned about five games you played up to here. Coming up just a bit short
in this one, did it have shades of a couple years ago?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: I really think what this team accomplished is as good as
what Gerry (McNamara) and his team accomplished, and the thing -- the one last
thing I said that I would share with you is that when this is all over, you
know, five years from now there's going to be two things people remember about
this Syracuse basketball season. Two and only two. They're going to remember
the Connecticut Syracuse here and going to remember what we do in the
tournament. That's all that they'll remember.  
  
Q. Jim, just talk a little about it, about where you will be --  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: I don't know where we are. The committee has got an
impossible job. They've got an impossible job to pick the last whatever teams
they're going to pick. You could argue -- I saw something with like 12 teams
that -- you couldn't hardly tell the difference. You really can't tell the
difference. You make a decision and it's like -- it's getting so close now
that it really, you can't even tell the difference. Then with the seeds,
honestly, I don't know how you can tell. I mean it's -- I'm not going to get
into the whole bracket thing but it's obvious to me that Louisville is a 1 and
Pittsburgh and Connecticut are going to be 1s based on what everybody has done
in the country and North Carolina for me. We'll see what happens. See if my --
that would be my prediction, anyway.  
  
Q. Jonny, right at the end there you had your hands on your knees. Were you
disappointed, exhausted or little bit of both?  
JONNY FLYNN: Just very disappointed. I was so proud of my team for just
battling this whole week. I really think we came together as a team. Lot of
people didn't even see us making it out of second day in this tournament and
we came together and really put in a lot of work and made it. Just a lot of
disappointment. I wasn't even fatigued. I was feeling actually pretty good out
on the court today but just made too many mistakes and we missed a lot of
shots that we made in the first half, so Louisville is a great team and they
just really put it to us tonight.  
  
Q. Can you describe what it's like to play against their defensive
pressure?  
JONNY FLYNN: It's non-stop. To put it so you can understand it, it's like
being chased by eight pit bulls and just got to keep running for your life.
Rick Pitino does a great job of rotating fresh bodies in and you just don't
have a chance to stop. I think Louisville -- the guys call themselves the
Louisville Pitt Bulls. That's a good name for them.  
  
Q. Jim, your thoughts on Jonny receiving the Dave Gavitt Trophy?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: He was phenomenal down here. You can't even describe how he
played down here. He played as good as you can play the game.  
  
Q. I was going to ask for Jonny, what happens in the second half? It seems
like Louisville has consistently been able to wear down its opponents. Do you
sort of feel the pressure taking a toll as the game goes on?  
JONNY FLYNN: I think we got a little too lackadaisical. When you get a big
lead like that you tend to do things you wouldn't do when you are down. They
really know how to capitalize on other people's mistakes. Proud of my
teammates. A great team to play against. We battled.  
  
Q. Jonny, what was it like to have to come out after the loss or accepting
the trophy, bittersweet?  
JONNY FLYNN: I would trade the trophy in to win the Big East Tournament any
day. The team awards are way better. Lot of people are going to remember who
won this tournament. They're not going to remember who won the outstanding
trophy award. Like the coach said, they're going to remember who won the
tournament. I would like to be able to accept the award for my team.  
  
Q. Jim, is there any article or science or something putting everything
you've had in the tournament and now switching gears and is there a different
mindset?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: You know, I think the two times we won, we were -- we
really were riding a couple guys especially the last time. Gerry had nothing
left the next week. That's not the case this time. We'll be fine and ready to
go in a couple days; Jonny and all these guys will be full strength by
Tuesday. We could play Tuesday right now if we had to without any -- no doubt
in my mind.  
You know, the thing that we try to do is come down here and just play like
you're in the NCAA tournament and try to -- don't want to lose, don't want to
go home. That's the way you got to play and now next week that's the way it
is.  
  
Q. Is this more emotional than what you're getting ready to --  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: The next thing is what you're playing for. This is great,
it's as good -- it's a dress rehearsal in front of 19,000 people every day.
So, you know, you don't want to -- it's not empty out there. It's a dress
rehearsal with a lot of people watching and lots of things people are going to
remember. Lot of good memories for the players and fans, everybody.  
I'm a big fan of conference tournaments unlike a lot of people I think because
I think it gets you ready and gives you great experiences, great memories for
the players and we've now been through a -- as tough a three games as we're
going to get the next three games we play, these last three games. Nothing
tougher. So it should help us. That's the way I look at it.  
  
Q. Jonny, despite the loss tonight, how much of a confidence boost has this
tournament been for the team moving forward?  
JONNY FLYNN: It definitely does wonders for our team. You've seen a player
like Kristof Ongenaet an unheard-of to anybody in the country, come here and
play as hard for us and you see Ricky Jackson come up and step up. Players
that virtually get no media time or things like that come out here and really
help us win those long overtime games giving us a chance to go out and win the
Louisville game. It really gives us confidence boost as a team. I think
despite the loss, you know, I hate losing more than anybody in this world, but
I think you can take a lot of good out of this. We came together as a team and
a lot of players are on the confidence boost that is really going to help us
in the next tournament.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: This last two weeks has been tremendous; and the last two
weeks. We'll look back on this as being a great, great thing for us these last
-- not just this tournament but the last two weeks. Okay.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Thank you, Syracuse.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2009

  

### [Earl Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18396)

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

### [Jerry Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18429)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Louisville 69  
Villanova 55

  
COACH RICK PITINO: Well, at halftime I told the guys I was speechless for the
first time this year. I said, I don't recognize any of you, I don't know who
you are. That's not Earl Clark, that's not Terrence Williams, that's not Jerry
Smith. I don't know who you guys are. Everything that we've gone through to
become a good basketball team you totally changed in a 20-minute half.  
Key to our basketball team is passing. When we pass, we shoot great. We go
one-on-one we shoot poorly and go one-on-one to pass we do a great job, and I
think our guys recognized what they were doing wrong and I thought these two
guys had a tremendous second half and the good thing about these guys is when
you say something, when they know you're right, they step up and admit what
they were doing is wrong and they stepped up and played great team basketball.  
We only had five assists at halftime and had a lot of the assists in the
second half. We didn't turn it over and that's the Louisville basketball we've
been playing.  
The good thing is when you can learn your lesson and win, it's going to really
help us come tournament time not to impersonate another basketball team. I'm
real proud of the guys.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Rick, did you think your defense improved in the second half also?  
COACH RICK PITINO: One thing feeds into the tide. Earl was tired but he
wouldn't give into fatigue. I play him too many minutes all the time but he
cuts it out and he's a big-time basketball player.  
  
Q. Rick, did you do anything in particular to keep Scottie Reynolds from
getting off any shots in the second half?  
COACH RICK PITINO: When we play man or zone we really put great emphasis on
pressure on the basketball. We did it with West Virginia, we did it the
overnight with Providence. If we get beat we rotate well. So these guys are
very intelligent people and this young man to the left, Jerry Smith, Earl and
T. Will (Terrence Williams) are All-American. Last ten games he's been the key
to our run. Absolutely spectacular basketball. His defense is as good as his
offense. I'm real proud of Jerry.  
  
Q. Both Rick and Jerry, the front court has gotten so much hype, deservedly
so and you come to this game particularly where their guards are very well
respected. Have these guys not gotten what they deserve this year?  
COACH RICK PITINO: I think they get with a they deserve because they won a
championship. We realize that all your glory comes from winning and individual
glory is nice but the team is what it's all about, and these guys have been
very unselfish all along. I think we appreciate Jerry and I think he knows
that.  
He knows how much his teammates need him, how well he's playing and I think
Earl would speak how good our backcourt is because they do that dirty work in
the backcourt for 90 feet and don't give in.  
  
Q. Has there ever been one moment in this season where you felt is anyone
ever going to realize there are actually guards on Louisville?  
JERRY SMITH: Not so much. I think the more we buy into winning, you know, like
Coach said, if we win a championship, everybody will get recognized and if we
buy in and guys back each other up, we'll be fine. It's not about personal
accolades.  
  
Q. Coach, Terrence Jennings, how big of an improvement?  
COACH RICK PITINO: He played great. Terrence Jennings, when you have two
freshmen, they're going to make freshmen mistakes. Terrence has caught up to
Samardo in a different way. He's longer and been a rebounder and shot blocker.
Samardo is better at certain things and he's (Terrence Jennings) better at
certain things. He's really improved, by far the most improved player on our
basketball team, but you know when you have that guy really bothering shots in
the lane, it makes it real easy for Earl and T. Will (Terrence Williams) to do
the things.  
I thought Earl and T. Will in the second half were brilliant with passing the
basketball.  
Jerry, I don't know if he stole it from Sam Young from Pittsburgh, but he's
got that ball fake down like Sam does. I'm going for it on the bench when he
does it. He's really mastered that.  
  
Q. Coach, Earl and Jerry, is part of the celebration at the end there
getting over the hump, getting to the title game for you guys, is that what
was going through your head there?  
JERRY SMITH: Definitely. We were down big at the half and for us to come
together the way we did, definitely. We were very excited about it.  
  
Q. Specifically getting to the title games, the success hasn't been here.  
JERRY SMITH: In the past couple years together with this group we haven't had
a lot of success in the Garden. For us to get to the championship of the Big
East tournament, that's saying a lot for us and what we've overcome.  
  
Q. Rick, was part of the problem offensively in the first half, was
Villanova pushing you guys farther out?  
COACH RICK PITINO: Villanova is a great basketball team, they're great
defensively. We just kept abandoning our offense and going one-on-one and
that's exactly what they want to do because they don't give you second shots.
You've got to create player and ball movement. They're going to converge on
the basketball. And Villanova are very similar. You've got to make the second
and third pass. You've to got to work inside to out and we weren't doing that
and we didn't have many assists. We shot a low percentage. Look at what we
shot in the second half.  
So, you know, it's been a special year. I think even our own fans and I know
it, didn't realize, probably until West Virginia played Pitt, how great a team
West Virginia is and I think one of our better wins in the last few years was
Senior Night, game day at West Virginia with the championship on the line.
That was an unbelievable win because the atmosphere was really, really
difficulty. You've got to be a tough group of guys to beat West Virginia that
night and these guys were.  
That win -- people say you didn't play Connecticut or Pitt. West Virginia is
one of the premiere teams like Villanova. Wouldn't surprise me to see any of
those teams in the Final Four before it's all said and done.  
  
Q. Coach, you played back-to-back games now and you're going to pretty much
play a close game. Are there things you learned about your team through
this?  
COACH RICK PITINO: They're a pretty tough group. We played quite a few
Saturday/Monday games and our guys -- we don't have curfews and things like
that. Earl gets in about 4:00, 5:00, Jerry goes about 11:00 to 12:00. Earl
doesn't get until about 4:00, 5:00. We let him sleep until 3:00 or 4:00. I'm
only kidding.  
  
Q. Rick, what were you guys going to do to keep Dante Cunningham not scoring
in the second half?  
COACH RICK PITINO: I think we picked up the pressure on him on the perimeter
so when did he get the basketball we were smothering him and digging. We
played a poor a half as we played in the first half and we were brilliant in
the second half. It was a brilliant group in the second half.  
  
Q. For both players, you opened the second half with a 17-to-2 run. They
tried two timeouts. Did you get a sense that they had not seen that kind of
pressure before?  
EARL CLARK: I think we just pressured and we digged in, got back to what we
do, forcing turnovers and our guards did a great job, Andre, Preston and
Jerry, they just forced turnovers and they just put the heat on the guards and
we hit open 3s.  
  
Q. Rick, I'm curious, what you thought of the second game last night, if you
saw any of it live and if you think as a result of what's happened here, you
guys are pretty much assured of a number one seed?  
COACH RICK PITINO: I think we have a very good chance. If we get to the final
game you have a very good chance. When you win the regular zone championship
and you win the final game, you've got a great shot. We have to great play
teams no matter what. It's not a major thing to us. We don't talk about it a
whole lot.  
Last night I watched the game with my daughter and my niece, Christine. We
were sitting there and when it went to the first overtime, let's go to bed.
The girls said, no, we're not going to bed. In the second overtime my niece
Christine said, "Uncle Rick, when do they stop an overtime? How many do they
go?" I said they, go on forever. They never go past two or three. At the
fourth let's go to bed. Two young kids were glued to it. I've never seen
anything like that in my life.  
I really had a great appreciation for Flynn. It's not easy taking on those
pick and rolls the whole night like that and that was amazing, amazing thing
to me and I thought A.J. Price was amazing. It was a great game but that's
what the Big East is all about. I know all these guys watched it and I think
you were blown away with it.  
JERRY SMITH: Definitely. That was definitely a great, you know, great game,
the best I've ever seen in my life. Everyone that kept going on, we got to get
some rest but we couldn't do that. We had to stay up and see the end ever it.  
COACH RICK PITINO: The interesting thing will be normally when something
bizarre like that happens, Syracuse will really gut it out and play well in
the first half and somewhere in the second half they lose their legs,
normally. If they don't, you're really looking at something special. If they
can hang in there for a whole game, that's a special basketball team.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2009

  

### [Da'Sean Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17188)

### [Devin Ebanks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19504)

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Syracuse 74  
West Virginia 69

  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions, please? Responsibility.  
  
Q. Bob, after the first game, Pitino said he thought Syracuse would hang for
a half and lose their legs. Most ordinary teams do that. Are you at all
surprised they played as well as they did after last night?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: Not at all.  
  
Q. Why?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: I think style of play has a lot to do with it. It's just
the way Jim has played for awhile. They play 2-3 zone so they're not chasing
like, you know, like Rick (Pitino) when they're pressing and doing all that. I
think the way they play defense is one thing and then, in all honesty, we
don't have a whole lot of depth. It's hard for us to go out and chase them
around. The game was -- the game was not an up-and-down game. If it was an up-
and-down game I think it may be -- could affect them but that's not how we
could have won the game.  
  
Q. Flynn's performance.  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: Full of questions, aren't you?  
  
Q. Nobody else has asked. Flynn's performance, 67 minutes last night, 45
minutes tonight. What he means to their team.  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: I think he's the most talented point guard in the country.
He's really hard to stay in front of. He's a great, great athlete. He's got
great speed. He's as fast with the ball as anybody is in transition. He shoots
it. You try to go under a screen, he steps behind it and makes it. He's just
-- he's a great player.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Do we have any questions for the players?  
  
Q. You guys, anything contribute in particular to the turnovers against that
zone tonight?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: We were really tentative in the first half, not being
aggressive and put the ball in terrible positions like in a corner and they
were trapping us. We didn't take care of the ball and, you know, some guys had
a lot of turnovers., myself included and, you know, kind of still in the --
didn't have as many in the second half. Again, you play terrible in the first
half and no matter how you play in this conference, you might lose like just
regardless.  
  
Q. Devin, the free throws at the end of regulation; there were a lot of guys
coming in trying to throw off your rhythm. Talk about the young guy, what was
going through your mind in that situation as you came back out and hit the
second free throw?  
DEVIN EBANKS: What I try too do is basically clear my mind, not let the crowd
affect me, just focus on the big free throws that I've made and fortunately I
made them. I made them. Unfortunately in overtime we couldn't finish down the
stretch.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Bob, did "Truck" (Darryl Bryant ) just hurry things in the last 20
seconds?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: No. It was my fault. 20 seconds to go, I wanted to make
sure we were organized defensively and I should have been -- in hindsight,
what we wanted to do if we needed a three under ten seconds and I didn't do
that. I mean he just tried to make a play.  
I get very upset when we're not assertive and Truck just tried to make a play.
You know, I don't know. I think they took a chance probably trying to block
it, in all honesty, you know. But I mean they made -- they apparently played a
good play. I didn't really see it so I don't know. He was just trying to make
a play.  
  
Q. Bob, what kind of lift is this week going to give you going into next
week, a win last night in?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: You walk in our locker room there's not a lift in there,
that's what we kind of talked about at halftime is, I know these two guys want
to hang a banner that says Big East champions and we're disappointed. I mean
we'll bounce back, we've bounced back all year. They're very resilient,
wonderful people, but we're a little dejected right now.  
  
Q. Coach, since you mentioned about being upset, there was one timeout there
where you actually took your play board and broke it. Was there --  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: No, I was trying to flip it. It won't break.  
  
Q. Looked like --  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: No, they've got the damn things now you can't break them
(laughter).  
  
Q. Looks like it actually broke.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Last question over here.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the first half, you went into a free zone. You
had to pick your poison, you played in the free zone.  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: We didn't rebound it out of the 1-3-1. They scored out of
it, on second shots. We were out rebounded, what was it guys, 18 to 10 or
something like that at halftime and I think they had 13 offensive rebounds. It
doesn't do any good to run a defense if you don't rebound it out of it. So,
you know, I thought we went -- we went man and point drop in the second half
and didn't play any 1-3-1. Thought we rebounded it better. It still wasn't
great but thought we rebounded better.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: West Virginia, thank you.

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Kristof Ongenaet](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19503)

### [Andy Rautins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19502)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Syracuse 74  
West Virginia 69

  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Sorry we didn't give you a longer game tonight. We tried.
You know, what can I say? I'll tell you, West Virginia, I watched a little
tape of them and watched most of their game the overnight and, they were so
impressive against Pittsburgh that it was scary coming against them and Bobby
has done such a great job coaching that team this year and just changes the
defense.  
We're pretty good finally against man-to-man and went to the 1-3-1, we saw
that against Pittsburgh and we just had our shooters out there and I think
that, you know, we settled that. But then the second half they really did a
good job matching up. We were struggling to score.  
These guys, you know, just move the ball and kept getting good opportunities
and took the ball to the basket. Our defense was the difference except for one
stretch, you know, we let Ruoff and Butler get away from us a little bit but
for the most part we found those guys. Ebanks had a huge game. He's really
improved from when we played in Syracuse. He really struggled. He really has
really improved and Butler has had a tremendous year.  
I think West Virginia has got a tremendous basketball team and, you know, this
was a tough game going into the overtime, you know, I wasn't sure Jonny was
going to make it but he always does, and, you know, he made some big plays but
these two guys were tremendous tonight.  
Andy is good on defense. He made one little steal down there when they were
going for a layup that just knocked it away and we got a basket and it was a
huge play. Kristof (Ongenaet) was just tremendous on the boards and made some
passes. When we were struggling to score there we got it to Ricky (Jackson)
and Kristof gave him a great bounce pass for a layup. But everybody
contributed. Everybody has made big plays for us and -- in the four weeks
we've been here (laughter).  
  
Q. Coach, kind of surprised they didn't come out and press you to see what
kind of legs you guys had early?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: I'm not surprised a team that's well coached and is a
really, really good team never presses, doesn't press. That would surprise me
if they did. If you've seen us play, we're pretty good against pressure. So,
that sometimes has given us baskets. But, tomorrow night we will be pressed
for 40 minutes because that's what Louisville does, but I would never expect a
great coach to try to do something his team doesn't do, no.  
  
Q. Jim, as tired as Jonny was, he never lost his smile. Can you just talk
about what his will means to this team?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: You know, I'll tell you the truth, Jonny does have a huge
will but Andy and Kristof, you know, Paul (Harris), Rick (Jackson), Eric
(Devendorf), they all do. One guy can't will a win. One guy can't. Eric made
some huge plays today and Andy -- these guys all have tremendous will. You
can't win these games, you know -- just less than two, three weeks ago we were
7-and-7 and, you know, hadn't played well for 12 games. We played all right
but we didn't play great, and we had a couple injuries, Andy and Arinze
(Onuaku) and we were struggling to get through that time and we actually had a
couple great games in there against West Virginia and Georgetown and Notre
Dame that were huge because if we hadn't got those games, we could have been a
1-and-10, 1-and-9 stretch and then when we got there, everybody healthy, with
St. John's down here, we played our best game of the year and went back and
Cincinnati, played great, and, you know, obviously played really well from
that point on.  
You know, these guys have all got a tremendous heart and it starts with Jonny
because Jonny has got the ball.  
  
Q. Question for Andy. I think probably everybody in the building was
wondering if your stamina would be affected by the amount you guys played last
night. I know you're in the position of speaking for the whole team here but
can you describe the way those 70 minutes may have had an impact on how you
felt today?  
ANDY RAUTINS: I think we felt pretty good overall. We were able to come out
and compete and, you know, just a tribute to our strength and conditioning
staff that did such a good job of keeping us in good shape. Ours guys were
persevering. All the credit in the world to the staff. Very well prepared.
Credit to our guys for having such a heart to compete.  
  
Q. Andy, just to follow-up, what were you guys doing at 2:30 or 3:00 in the
morning last night? Were you looking for McDonald's?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: That's exactly what we were doing. All of us. New York City
-- Syracuse, you can get something to eat at 2:30. I couldn't find anyplace
last night.  
  
Q. Jim, I don't mean to slight the other guys when I ask about Jonny. How
hard is it to play at his level 67 and 45 minutes. He's played in all but
three minutes in these two games.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: I don't know why the coach took him out those three
minutes. He was not thinking, not good coaching probably. He wants to be out
there, he doesn't like to come out. All the great players I've had hate to
come out. I had first eight games we played one year, we were winning by an
average of 35 points a game and Billy Owens was only playing 30 minutes and
said, Coach, I didn't come here to play 30 minutes. Learned a long time good
players, they want to be in the game.  
  
Q. Kristof, when you went to overtime, were you thinking, geez, here we go
again? What were you thinking when you went to that overtime period?  
KRISTOF ONGENAET: I think definitely after last night I think we're pretty
good in overtime, so I think we're a tough team to beat and I think we were
stronger than yesterday. Yesterday, we had six, now we only had one. I think
it was really important for us to stick together as a team and play together
as a team and I think did a pretty good job of that and that was pretty much
it.  
  
Q. Jim, can you talk about the rebounding and more offensive rebounds than
defensive rebounds.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: They're one of the best rebounding teams in the league, I
think. I don't know. Statistically I thought that, anyway. You know, we've
done a little better on the boards than I think we're credited with. We're not
a great rebounding team but I thought our guys tonight -- we've got a little
size advantage when we have the two big guys in there. We just don't have the
two big guys in there very often at the same time, but I just thought we went
after the ball better than we have, Kristof and Andy and Arinze, especially
when he went back in, he really, I thought went after the ball well and that's
maybe not our strength, but I thought tonight West Virginia is not a big team
and they just do a tremendous job going to the boards, they really do.  
  
Q. Jim, you know, you've been here a couple of times in this championship
game, different teams?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: 14.  
  
Q. I know.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: I'm not counting, though.  
  
Q. It's a difficult team to play tomorrow night. Can you get that relaxed
kind of atmosphere to your players, I'm saying the game is important but you
have the --  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Every game we've played lately -- when you play college
basketball every game play is important. You start out the year and if you
blow a game that you're not supposed to, it can put you in a bad situation
later on because you're going to lose unless, you know, one of the top four,
five, six teams in the country, you're going to lose some games along the way
and if you lose a game, the 8th game of the year that I shouldn't at the end
of the year it can come back and bite you. Every game is important. When we
were 6-6, 7-7 (in The Big East) that next game was huge for us. More pressure
on us than certainly in this game, and, you know, these guys have played well.
They know Louisville won the league. They know Louisville has played -- Rick
just monkeyed around a little bit earlier in the year getting his team
organized. Since then they're like 28-and-2 or something.  
So, you discount any of those early losses they had. They were just figuring
out. He was just trying to give everybody an idea that they weren't that good
or something but they're playing as well as anybody.  
I think Villanova is a tremendous team. We couldn't beat them twice and I just
think Louisville is a tremendous team. They've got all the answers. They've
got a lot of depth, they've got inside, outside combination, couple great
players. So, we have our work cut us for us tomorrow night but we'll come
ready to play.  
  
Q. Jim, Eric's shot at the half, was that redemption?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: He must have owed us one, somehow. We gambled on the
defensive play and got a wide open look but, I guess Eric -- maybe -- I hope
he's got another one or two of them. The shot he made last night was
incredible. I couldn't believe watching the tape, that shot, but that -- we've
seen two half court shots this year. One good, one not so good.  
  
Q. After playing for almost four hours last night and looking forward to
today, tell me about anything you saw that was maybe any different in your
players, any ill effects from your last night. Did anyone look fresh?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: I thought we looked good for a long time tonight, really. I
didn't see that. I know Jonny was feeling it the most but I didn't see it in
these -- you can ask these two guys. The other guys, you know, didn't play
quite as many minutes, maybe but I didn't see it, you know.  
I think that at the end -- I think probably both teams were a little tired.
It's their third game, you know, in three days so I think both teams could
have been a little tired.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Syracuse, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2009

  

### [Dwayne Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18324)

### [Dante Cunningham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18132)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Louisville 69  
Villanova 55

  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Obviously disappointing loss. I thought at halftime that we
were playing well enough defensively to hold them down and be able to grind
one out there, but we started the second half, you know, not aggressively.
Shot blocked, they come down. We don't guard Clark, he hits a three. They get
another three and bank, there's the ballgame right away. We never seemed to
recover from that.  
They did a great job coming out in the second half and getting -- just taking
the lead quickly and taking control and I think it was Earl Clark was just
awesome and, you know, that's what big time seniors do and we got two great
ones, two, and they had a rough night tonight but they've had a great season
for us and we got to take this lick and recover. It's going to be tough but,
you know, right now it just hurts me. Got to get to tomorrow.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, you have a great player in Reynolds. How could he have two points
on a night like this? What was your impression?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: They really did a great job on him. They doubled him every
time he had the ball in the backcourt. Anytime we ball screened they iced him,
forced him down the baseline and doubled him and I actually thought Scottie
did a really good job of not forcing too much, you know, and they just flew
out of every -- they did a great job defensively. They're the best defensive
team in the country. On a night like that when they're going to put so much
pressure on Scottie, our other guys have to step up because there were
opportunities for other guys. We just didn't do it tonight.  
  
Q. It's pretty fresh but what do you guys take out of not just this game but
these games up here that you think may pay off for you a little bit later down
the road?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: You know, we got to come out aggressively if we have a lead
in the second half. Now, you go to the NCAA tournament, you will be playing
really good teams. You don't know if you're going to have a lead in the second
half. That's two games we've played great first halves and come out in the
second half and just lethargic -- and that's not the right word -- not
lethargic; not aggressive. That's not fair, lethargic, because I thought we
played pretty hard. We weren't aggressive, defensively or offensively. That's
two games in row now and you can't do that. You can't do that at this point in
the season.  
  
Q. My question revolves around Dante Cunningham. With all the defensive
pressure they were putting on Scottie Reynolds it made it difficult for you
guys to get the ball inside.  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: I thought we got Dante the ball pretty well, actually. I
wasn't -- you know, in the second half he got in foul trouble. When he picked
up his fourth, that was a killer for us, and, you know, in the first half he
did a great job of getting the ball to him.  
Second half, you're right, it was tougher because he was out and he had some
good looks, even first play of the second half he had a hook shot coming right
across the lane. We missed it and he got a jump shot blocked early that he had
a good look.  
You know, he's had great games for us, a great first half. I think the job
they did on Scottie was the key and we need other guys to be more aggressive.
Fisher was and he picks up his fourth foul. That was big for us when he picked
up his fourth. That's what we got to get better at, too.  
  
Q. Jay first and then for the players: You hear so much about Williams and
Clark and their front line. What was your impression of their guards coming
into this and now coming out?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: What I think makes them the best defensive team -- they're
the best defensive team we've played and we've played a lost really good ones
especially in this league. I think those four guards, the pressure they're
able to put on the ball for 40 minutes, full court, 40 minutes, it never
stops. They get 10, 12 point lead that pressure is still there and it's still
as intense as it was at the beginning of the game.  
That's really impressive. It is. Offensively it doesn't hurt you. McGee hit
some big shots and obviously Jerry Smith was great but he plays great defense,
also. So, you have four guards that can all defend like that is really
impressive.  
Conditional page break: 2  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Players respond about their guards.  
DWAYNE ANDERSON: They won the Big East championship so, of course, they have
all around great players from the forwards and the guards. We didn't
underestimate them. We just didn't come through on every little play and
that's what hurt us at the end.  
DANTE CUNNINGHAM: You know, they had, like I say, they had four guards, you
know, that was just pressure our guards, you know, for 94 feet and it was
tough as far as getting the ball up the court, you know, get it inside and
they just made all little plays down the stretch.  
  
Q. Jay, it seems like part of the difference in the second half, they came
right out there and punched you guys in the mouth with those two back-to-back
3s that sort of just stole the momentum away from you.  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: It did. I think it was really important. We were playing
well in the first half. They came out and jumped us and got the lead
immediately. Now it's a different game. Now they're pressing and you know
they're doing it with a lead. They're not behind. We can't spread them out and
I give them credit. I say that's the second game we've done. It's something
we're trying to work on before we get to the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Jay, you talked a lot yesterday about how much you love this setting and
everything. How elusive is it to not to have gotten to the finals?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: It's sad. Don't want to go home. Would have loved to have
been here Saturday night. Friday night at the Garden is special. It's a
special night to be a part of and tomorrow night would have been really cool
I'm sure.  
We've not been here since I've been here. We really wanted to be here. I think
we're good enough to be here but we didn't play well enough tonight and
Louisville did play well.  
You could be a good team, you play a good team and one of them has got to play
better that night. Louisville played much better tonight.  
  
Q. Jay, you have a veteran team. Went on a run last year. The object is to
move on. How do you put this behind you and say, okay, we've got another
season?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: We've been good at that, Mike, this year and I think we'll
be good at it but honestly, this one, you know, I thought we had a chance, we
had a chance to win this, a chance.  
We knew this was going to be a tough when you're playing the Big East
champions. I love how they play. So, we got to get over this one, there's no
question. This one is tough, really tough because now you're running out of
chances. I told the guys, we'll never have a chance at -- they'll never have a
chance at this again, these two seniors being in the Garden, and a chance to
win the Big East championship. This one hurts but we always get over them. I
don't want to say it's going to be easy.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Villanova, thank you.  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Thanks guys.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2009

  

### [Andre McGee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13750)

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

### [Jerry Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18429)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Louisville 73  
Providence 55

  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Sure. Questions?  
  
Q. Rick, at the start of the game going inside to (Earl) Clark, Samardo
Samuels, like you did, was that part of the game plan or what?  
COACH RICK PITINO: The mistake we made at home, we like to play fast but we
don't like to quick shoot and we kept doing that and playing their style and
they shot 75 percent in the first half.  
Fortunately for you we were only down one. Second half we played smarter
offensively. We do a very good job of moving the ball and defending. Did a
very poor job of rebounding and taking care of the basketball, but sometimes
in the first game of any tournament, whether NCAA or Big East, guys realize
what's at stake. Nobody wants to be home and throw the ball away too much. We
tried the make some spectacular plays rather than basic fundamental plays.  
  
Q. Talk about defending them on the perimeter.  
COACH RICK PITINO: We've done that the last two games. I say this, take away
one thing but you give up something else. The last two games West Virginia,
really wanted to -- almost looked like a half court trap -- wanted to get the
ball on the perimeter. It opens up the lane sometimes for offensive rebounds,
so you had give up one thing but take something else away but I'm such a
believer that the 3-point shot must be taken away that sometimes we'll
sacrifice others to take that away. We held (Alex) Ruoff without a three and
held these guys to two. If you give great players the 3 point line you're
going to have a long night. That's the great equalizer in college basketball.
You have to defend it as well as make it.  
  
Q. Rick, do you have an opinion on whether Providence should make the NCAA
tournament? They appear to be on the bubble and also can you just assess
Sarmado's Performance.  
COACH RICK PITINO: I've been in this league both when there were few teams and
now a lot of teams. Anytime you go over 500, in the ACC, the Big 10, the Big
East, you should automatically be in. I don't want to hear about all the other
stuff, automatically be in because you're playing the toughest competition. If
your league is down in a given year then it becomes subjective but we all know
that this league is not down.  
We all know Providence beat the number one ranked team in the country. They've
got five 1,000 point scorers. In my mind if someone is over 500 in the Big
East they deserve to be in the tournament.  
  
Q. Rick, what about that Notre Dame game and what did that game a month ago
do for these guys as you look back in hindsight? Was it an a abberation?  
COACH RICK PITINO: Sometimes. Like I saw West Virginia play the greatest game
on tape I've watched all year against Villanova. They were up 20 late in the
game. I think they wound upbeating them by 22. Villanova is a terrific team,
well coached and it was just one of those nights where West Virginia did
everything great, put on a clinic passing and shooting the basketball.  
That night, Notre Dame is coming off 30-point loss to UCLA and everything they
did that night -- we tried hard, didn't play well but everything they did. So
we go home and whether lose by one or 30, try to give the other team credit.  
Notre Dame was brilliant and we weren't that one night. It was really no big
deal. The guys will tell you it's not a big deal. It happened to me as a pro
coach all the time. You go on the third game in a four-game road trip and have
a bad night. You don't worry about it. You just concern yourself with the next
opponent. We never worried about -- this is not football where they total up
the points at the end of the game to try to move up in the rankings.  
  
Q. Rick, I know you're here to coach and win a game but when you come in
here to the Garden what kicks in for you just looking around?  
COACH RICK PITINO: Well, the freight elevator still smells (laughter).  
  
Q. That's one.  
COACH RICK PITINO: Walking in, you know, I always remember because I was an
assistant with the Knicks. We used to have to park across the street, at the
time it was called Park-n-Lock; I don't know if it's still called that. We
would always stay at the Park-n-Lock. We would go over to about 180 stats
before we were able to leave the building and I always remember the people if
we lost yelling at us so we were walking so fast downstairs and then we got to
park inside and so many unbelievable memories of Bernard King and obviously
being a head coach and winning the Atlantic Division Championship and coaching
a young team and I remember laughing about the broom incident in Philadelphia.
So many things come to mind. I really can go back when I was just an average
basketball player myself and signed my letter of intent or my scholarship
papers on the Garden floor when Julius (Erving) lost to Marquette by 30
points. It's something to be a New York kid and sign the scholarship papers on
the floor of Madison Square Garden. I have so many things, I would worry to
death.  
  
Q. At the finals Saturday night, do we expect to see the white suit?  
COACH RICK PITINO: Unless the Garden goes goes white-out. If they go out
white-out, I'll bring the white suit. It's a thing we do at Louisville.  
  
Q. Rick, I know it was a long time ago, whenever you coached against
Providence, do you ever sort of catch yourself in flashback, particularly your
special team that went to the Final Four?  
COACH RICK PITINO: I always root for Providence. It's like my unofficial alma
mater. I always just root for them. It's a really, really special town, a
really special place for those people who have never been there. If I had to
pick anyplace in America, just live, not do anything else in life and live, it
would be Rhode Island. Providence College is a small community that has great
basketball tradition, special school for all students and I just think of
those two years and how magical it was and how much help they gave me to grow
as a coach.  
Conditional page break: 2  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions for the players, please.  
  
Q. Rick what did you think of Samardo tonight?  
COACH RICK PITINO: I thought he was good. I thought his teammates got him the
ball and he had easy shots. He finished the shots and I think he's improving
and getting better and better and better. I think Samardo had an excellent
season as a freshman. I don't think he did anything spectacular tonight. I
just think he stayed within the framework of teamwork and got a lot of good
shots that his teammates got them.  
  
Q. Andre and Jerry, can you guys talk about I guess the depth perception. It
seems like gauges in the Garden, you fellas have a tendency to struggle
shooting from the outside.  
ANDRE McGEE: It does play a little part sometimes. Coach always tells us to
take great shots and takeover shots. We do that. Whether it goes in or not, we
can't control it. If the shot is there the coach always tells to us take it.
If it doesn't go in we all just try to our best to get the offensive rebound.  
  
Q. Just from what you see, how different is it from shooting here than at
Freedom Hall? Is there there anything that you see today?  
ANDRE McGEE: When you're playing you don't focus on the crowd or anything
behind you. It's a court. It's the same depth, same height, ten feet and the
same ball. So you just try to shoot it the same way.  
  
Q. For both or either, does Coach ever bore you with these New York stories;
do you get a sense that this means a lot, this tournament, this building to
him personally?  
JERRY SMITH: Not at all. You know, it's great to be around him and I
definitely enjoy hearing those things. I mean it's special.  
ANDRE McGEE: It's hard to get bored because he has so many great stories. He's
also a great story teller. He keeps you interested in anything he has to say.  
  
Q. Is there anything he told this week or anything like that?  
ANDRE McGEE: No specific stories this week.  
JERRY SMITH: I don't think so, no.  
  
Q. Jerry, just your defense on (Sharaud) Curry, obviously that was key to
the game is the pressure. Either one of you guys talk about that?  
JERRY SMITH: Curry is a great player. Last night I was four for five in the
first half from beyond the arc. We didn't even want to try to give him an
attempt. Coach told us to pressure the ball as much as possible and that's
what we did the first and second half.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Anything else for Louisville? Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2009

  

### [Keno Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18291)

### [Weyinmi Efejuku](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19406)

### [Jonathan Kale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19447)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Louisville 73  
Providence 55

  
COACH KENO DAVIS: Obviously, you know, it's disappointing anytime that your
team loses, especially in a championship. You're at the Big East. We knew
coming in today, that playing, you know, the team that won this conference and
arguably, you know, a number one seed in the NCAA tournament, that we were
going to have to play at a very high level.  
But when you look at our shooting percentages today, only going 2-17 and
turning the ball over 26 times, that's not a great recipe for winning. But I
think what it shows from our team is when you think about those numbers and
then throughout that second half the game was an 8, 9, 10 point game, that
shows the heart of this Providence team to be able to find a way to stay in
the game.  
We couldn't make a run at them there in the second half, partly because of
their great pressure defensively and partly because we couldn't seem to buy a
bucket on the offensive end.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Keno, did they extend their defense that much at Louisville or was it an
extra level Louisville team you had today?  
COACH KENO DAVIS: Maybe a little bit more today. It was pretty extended down
there, too. They disrupted us especially in that second half but I think Coach
Pittino can obviously answer this better than I can but similar to us getting
ready for DePaul, knowing that they were playing back-to-back days, I think
you want to take advantage of that and you attack the other team even moreso
and it seemed to be that was their plan and they did a great job of it both
halves.  
  
Q. Keno, you said yesterday that you thought your team was squarely on the
bubble. Is that kind of where you still think you are and how hard will it
be?  
COACH KENO DAVIS: I've heard kind of like everybody else, you listen to a lot
of the, you know, the predictions and the one thing that those people that
predict have in common is they're not sitting in that committee room and I
know that we're going to be a team that they're going to discuss at length in
there and I think when you talk about finishing in the top half of the Big
East, is that enough? Is finishing 10-8 with wins over Syracuse, wins or Pitt,
is that enough?  
You have to compare it to other teams in other leagues. If any league is going
to get half their teams in, you would think with the potential three teams as
number one seeds that they would look favorably.  
As far as this game, I think all it does it just puts us right on the bubble.
You know, we'll see what happens. We'll have our fingers crossed on Sunday
and, you know, look forward to playing some more basketball.  
  
Q. Keno, do you think you should get credit for losses; for example, three,
four losses against teams that are number one seeds.  
COACH KENO DAVIS: I think one thing that the committee will look at or I would
hope that they would look at is sometimes you look at, you know, your record
against the top 50 or the top 100 I really find it hard to believe that you
would -- that it would hurt a team to have played so many teams that are
quality NCAA teams, and so you're in another league and you don't have that
opportunity to play as many top 25 teams or number one seeds as we do, you
know, that's why you try to build up your non-conference schedule but we know
that coming in, you know, that we were going to be up against it in the
conference.  
So, yeah, I think you really will get credit. I don't think it's just
something you should get credit. I think they look at how strong your schedule
is, especially at the end of the year.  
  
Q. Keno, did you think fatigue played a role in the low 3-point shooting
percentage today?  
COACH KENO DAVIS: I think fatigue did somewhat. You know, I think a
combination of fatigue and very aggressive defense from a lot of players that
are going to be playing in the NBA against us.  
We've got some guys that, you know, are going to try to continue their careers
as well. They've got some guys that, you know, might be a little closer to
getting there.  
They came out with great pressure and I think they forced us outside of some
of the range but we had some very good looks that just didn't go in today that
they did yesterday.  
So fatigue, yeah, of course, it played a factor but they deserved it because
they were in the top -- they had the double bye and we had to play in and it
just was a night or day where we couldn't quite knock down enough shots.  
  
Q. Keno, just talk about how they took away (Sharaud) Curry today.  
COACH KENO DAVIS: I'm sure it was nice for them to be able to have a lot of
days to prepare, you know, knowing that we would likely be one of the teams
they could see in their first round and really took them away from, you know,
being able to bring the ball up the court.  
They had two guys on him the whole time and I think rightfully so after they
saw the games he's been playing, especially in the Big East.  
Not many people picked him out of a lineup as far as being, you know, a
difference maker because of coming off that year long injury and really only
playing his best basketball once our Big East season has started, but they
identified him as a key and they disrupted our offense but I felt like we had
kind of controlled it enough that if we could have made some more plays we
could have made a run at them in the second half.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Do we have any questions for the players?  
  
Q. Weyinmi (Efejuku), is Louisville the best defense you've had to go up
against all year?  
WEYINMI EFEJUKU: I think they're the most aggressive defense we have had to
face and they're consistently aggressive. For 40 minutes they're in your face,
have long athletic players. They might be. They're up there.  
  
Q. John, can you just talk about the aggressive nature of the play inside
and basically that's most of your offense?  
JONATHAN KALE: Well, this is how the league is. It's aggressive play all
around the court especially down low. Their front line, like coach said,
they're all pros so it's tough. You can't really just relax on any possession
down low. So it's really tough.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Any other questions for Providence? Thank you. Thanks, guys.  
COACH KENO DAVIS: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2009

  

### [Jim Calhoun](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13682)

### [A.J. Price](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16952)

### [Stanley Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19481)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Syracuse 127  
UCONN 117

  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: Well, obviously it was a journey by two teams and it seems
to me -- obviously everybody is prejudiced from their vantage point. We had a
lot of opportunities to close the door, make a foul shot, make a stop. We
weren't able to do that and I could think before six different times -- I
think we controlled or had either a lead or chance to take the lead at the end
of four, five of overtimes and we found ways not to do that and Syracuse found
a way to win the game. Congratulations to them and that's it.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions, please?  
  
Q. Just how exhausting was this whole process?  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: I'm not exhausted. The players are probably exhausted. I'm
not -- I could practice right now. Foul shooting, probably.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Do we have any questions for the players?  
  
Q. A.J., just tell us, did your legs cramp up at anytime? How physically did
you get through it?  
A.J. PRICE: No, didn't cramp up at any time. I felt good for the most part as
best as you probably can feel after six overtimes or whatever it was. I felt
physically fine, we just couldn't get over the hump. We didn't make free
throws down the stretch and it cost us.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys have faced some pretty tough opponents so far this
season. Looking into this game tonight, going into six overtimes, what do you
think it was that officially did you guys --  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: 27 turnovers. I don't remember a team of mine having 27
turnovers.  
Once again we haven't played in six overtimes. We were going to get in the 20s
that is. We weren't ready to play. We played one game in 12 days; that's not
the reason we lost. We played two games tonight practically. It wasn't rust.
We turned the ball over and two guys who wanted to shoot are here with me and
nobody else seemed to want to make plays. Give all the credit to Syracuse.
They fought back, made great plays. They brought kids off the bench who hadn't
played very much and closed the deal for them. We had ample opportunities to
close the door and we never could. Syracuse is a top 20 team and should be. We
didn't play like a team that had won 27 games and should be able to close the
door. We did that a lot this year. See we certainly didn't do it today and had
ample opportunities.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you lost the game but how would you rate that game as far
as in your coaching history, one of the greatest games you've ever been a part
of?  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: It's a loss. There was -- there was something certainly
about the game. That stuff doesn't really get into the play of things. Both
teams competed. A.J. had big plays, all kinds of plays that went on during the
game and I'm sure in the summertime I'll look back and say what a historic
battle it was. Right now it's a loss. There's no other way.  
We wanted to get to Friday. We didn't get to Friday and it's very
disappointing, and I said before that the double bye -- and this is not an
excuse -- but Villanova for all rights and purposes was on the edge.
Pittsburgh lost and we lost and just making that for point of reference. When
you have a bye week the week before, it's a difficult time.  
That isn't why we lost. You all saw the opportunities we had. Make one foul
shot and we could have ended it or made a couple plays.  
You know, am I going to think about this game? Yeah, I'm going to think it was
a loss and we wanted to play tomorrow night and playing in Madison Square
Garden on a Friday night is pretty special. That was one of our keys, be here
on Friday night with the new format, only playing one game. I don't like it.
I've said it all along. Open up against the top 20 teams, not exactly the way
you want to get into a tournament. Only having one game in 12 days.  
We lost the game because we turned the ball over 27 times and couldn't make a
foul shot. You know, in a journey like this, I think all A.J., Stanley, all
our kids, you know, when you put that much effort into something and you end
up shorthanded you're not going the feel great. We really gave it our all.
We're a good basketball team. I thought we could have done a lot more with the
situation we had especially because we're a great closeout team this year.  
It took this group three years to be the kind of closeout team it wanted to be
and it was and tonight we had closeout opportunity after closeout opportunity
and we weren't able to take advantage of it. In the summer I'll probably think
of that. That's sick but that's what I'll do.  
  
Q. Coach, I noticed Jerome (Dyson) was kind of chomping at the bit --  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: I was.  
  
Q. What was he saying to you?  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: He was trying to coach the team. I probably should have
slid into the seat. He might have been better than I was. He wanted to win for
the team. I think he wanted to continue for us, to stay here tomorrow night
and get the opportunity to play West Virginia in the semifinals. I've always
said the finals are great, we've been able to be there a few times. The semis
are great and I wanted this group particularly to play on Friday night, just
four teams, very special and I saw those opportunities right there and
something would happen. We would make a mistake. All the various things we
did. We turned the ball over 27 times and get to six overtimes, you have to --
wonder to yourself, you know what else could you have done or miss as many
foul shots as we did.  
  
Q. Jim, going forward was obviously a difficult loss and the loss to Pitt.
How do you go forward in the tournament to prepare these guys mentally?  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: We're not going to play (Nos.) 2-and-20. I'm not trying to
be sarcastic. We just play -- I said -- it's been a while ago, Pittsburgh a
week ago, and said they were as good a team as anybody in the country at their
building and then we lost to a very good Syracuse team.  
So our Big East season is over. Quite frankly, I can't wait to get the hell
out of it right now. I would like to be here tomorrow but very simply not
playing the same teams and playing a little different style. We all know each
other. Jimmy (Boeheim) and I say the same things. If I win, next week is more
important. He said tonight, don't worry about it, next week is more important.
Neither one of us means it but we say it (laughter).  
  
Q. For Stanley, did you think it would be this easy to get -- crash the
boards and get to the rim? You were getting to the rim at will tonight.  
STANLEY ROBINSON: No. I mean that's one of my key things to do, like as far as
like playing basketball is getting to the rim, as long as I get to the rim and
get rebounds, that can start my game.  
So I mean like Coach always tell me to get to the rim, just rebound first and
my game opens up so that's what I did and it just opened up for me.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: UCONN, thank you.  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: Can I make one statement?  
I keep hearing the fact the Big East is not as powerful as everybody thinks we
are because we don't have Notre Dame and possibly Providence going into the
tournament. Someone has to get to the -- I know they have time in here to just
inform them. They did the math and they're playing top five and four and ten
teams. Someone's got to lose. And so, therefore, if you don't pick Notre Dame,
and Providence and Georgetown are good teams, they have to lose in order for
us to win. I read a statement last night how come they don't have ten teams
going? Because mathematically it's impossible if you play all the right teams
to have a good record. Providence, they were using as an example. They haven't
played enough of the good teams. If they did, that's what I'm trying to tell
you why the league is so good. People kept losing the math of it. We're 15 and
3. Everybody is supposed to be 15 and 3. Do the math and play two Big East
teams, you're going to get 500 for the league. One team will win and one will
lose.  
After being through this, and this is my final Big East say, the idea that
this is not a great, great and maybe the greatest conference for one year ever
is ludicrous. Someone just do some simple math to truly understand -- when
Georgetown got caught in the washer in the rinse cycle and the same thing that
happened to Notre Dame, you played five straight top 20 teams. Try that on for
size. So they don't seem to understand the fact the math can't work out,
they're not going to have ten teams with 15 and 3 records.  
You know, I really was put off by the fact that this is not a strong
conference. Trust me, the team we played tonight was a terrific team. The
problem is it's hard for a team that doesn't have everything to show it just
because of the greatness of the league. Thanks.

doing.  
  
Q. The 1-3-1 was tough.  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: Yeah. Last time we played them, we have another defense called
point drop. We play them a lot of man and coach kind of talked about, you
know, like we stayed in a lot of things because they can adjust to things very
quickly. We stayed man too long and they adjusted to that and they have great
players like DeJaun Blair and Sam Young. We never really ran 1-3-1 against
them. We wanted to switch defenses on them, keep throwing different defenses
at them so they can't adjust to them and it worked.  
  
Q. Da'Sean, both you and Devin are from the area and Newark and Long Island.
Talk about what it feels like to win in front of the family and friends.  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: It feels good. This game, they beat us twice in the season
and, no, we're not a team to lose three times to any team, you know and just
came out, we played well. Devin played excellent tonight. He was on the glass
and made big play after big play and I'm just happy for him, you know.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about Devin's play today in front of his home town.  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: It's not just today. Devin has been terrific, you know,
from the Big East season on, at one time he was averaging 12 points and 8 and
a half rebounds a game in Big East play. These guys can tell you, he's gotten
so much better. He's gotten so much better defensively. He does a lot of
things for us. I think that's what's great. He's played point guard for us,
he's our leading rebounder. He's just been really, really good and he's a
great guy on top of that.  
I've said this many times but these are great guys. I mean this team is just
full of absolutely great guys and we bring the three New York guys in and
they're as good guys as what these guys are. That's important to us.  
  
Q. Coach, John Flowers contribution today seemed like a pretty big
difference?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: Yeah. John is good in a 1-3-1 because of his length and,
you know, none of them -- probably a lot of it is my fault. John has gotten
very tentative and, you know, I told him with the clock running down, I'm
standing right there in front of him, I said, step in and shoot it in. He
stepped in and made that big 3 for us and he got some really, I think, key
rebounds for us, took a big charge there at the end of the game and I just
think he's more assertive, you know.  
I'm a big believer in you can't play tentative. You've got to take the fight
to people and I think John did that today.  
  
Q. Alex, are there major differences in the 1-3-1 you're playing with Coach
Huggins than what you were playing with Coach Beilein or is it similar?  
ALEX RUOFF: You know, it's a little different. We got -- we don't got as many
rules as we did before. We're kind out there trying to just get to the ball,
really. We're trying to explain to the young guys what are rules used to be
when Coach Beilein was here. There's too many. We're kind out there trying to
get the ball and make people comfortable.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask the players, what impact Coach Huggins has had on the
program and specifically tonight, you guys played with such confidence. It
seems like you reflect him.  
ALEX RUOFF: I think it speaks for itself. First season, Sweet 16. The season
we've had this year, going back to the tournament. It speaks for itself and
that passion he has on the sideline he brings to practice. That's something we
try to put out on the court and I think that's noticeable.  
  
Q. For Bob first please and then the two players. Just talk about taking the
fight to people. Your players talked yesterday a lot about matching Pitt's
physical play. You beat them on the boards tonight. I'm curious your thoughts
on how physical they were tonight.  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: Well, in all honesty they were too physical for us, I
think, and that's why we went 1-3-1. The 1-3-1 -- now -- Alex, correct me if
I'm wrong, it's hard to get -- to have post play with it because you're
dropping so many people in around them and we just -- you know, the first two
games against Pitt we were in both games and they came out and they just threw
it inside to their bigs and we had a hard time. They're just bigger and
stronger than we are and, you know, we went to the 1-3-1 to try to keep from
them getting the ball inside and you saw they didn't really get the ball
inside much and, you know, it's a tremendous credit to these two guys. I just
let them go. I'd screw it up.  
Alex says we don't have a lot of rules; it's because I don't know any of them
(laughter). But, you know, I think they'll tell you this: The one thing that
I've really stressed in the two years that I've been here is learn how to
play, you know? Learn how to play the game. I'm not big on, you know, run
here, run there, you know and have a whole bunch of things that are concrete.
I wanted to learn. I want them to learn how to play basketball.  
  
Q. Do you guys feel you were more physical tonight?  
ALEX RUOFF: I think we're the aggressor. I think that's big. In the first two
games we matched up against them. We had stretches there where they kind of
out manned us the second half of both games. Everyone was emotional coming out
of halftime with a two-point lead.  
  
Q. You said no.  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: Honestly, they're a strong team. I know with my frame and
things like that, they got some pretty big guys. Honestly, Coach -- the rest
of the coaches talked about they might be bigger than us, be a lot more
stronger, but if you play aggressive and go at them, attack them, it will
probably be a different game. That's what happened. We didn't really focus on
trying to out-man them as far as strength but being more aggressive as they
are and matching their intensity and play. I think we did that tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, did you make a major point to go after Blair and Biggs in the
first half there or did that just kind of happen?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: We were going to, initially but it worked out better than
-- I wanted Wells (Wellington Smith) to attack him but we had to get the
spread first because they do a great job of defense. We wanted to spread them
and attack them.  
The first time we did get them a little bit spread. The second time Al (Alex
Ruoff) made a great cut and drew a block but DeJuan is a great player. He's a
great person. We just -- you know, we're just trying -- we try to do what we
do. I thought we really controlled the game with our offense. I mean I thought
the 1-3-1, was really, really good.  
We talked about controlling the game with our offense and I thought we did
that. I thought we shot it too quick early on and once we kind of got settled
down, were in offense, I mean shot a lot of layups and made a lot of great
cuts.  
  
Q. Kind of sneak in a second question here about the two New York guys,
(Devin) Ebanks and (Darryl) Bryant. Can you describe a little bit about how
they've become so important to your team and either one of the players, can
you describe if they've been excited about the idea of playing in this thing
in New York?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: The honest to God's truth is if you're not excited as a
basketball player about playing in Madison Square Garden in the Big East
tournament, then, you know, they need to check your pulse. They're great guys.
They're fun-loving, great guys. They've really bought into what we want --
"Truck" (Darryl Bryant) had a huge game and it's just hard to play 1-3-1 with
Truck. He had a huge game yesterday for us.  
Devin had a huge game and Kevin kept us in the Louisville game, our last home
game and he hasn't shot it quite as well as what he was shooting earlier in
the tournament but he's played really, really well and I think the thing
that's great about -- and Truck, it's hard because he has so many
responsibilities handling the ball, but with Devin and Kevin, they've got a
great aptitude to learn basketball, and these guys can tell you how much stuff
we throw at them and they've picked it up and done a wonderful job with it.  
  
Q. How have those guys been about the idea of coming back too New York for
this event?  
ALEX RUOFF: You know, they're excited. They're excited coming back to New
York. They got their friends and family here. They've been playing in big
games all year. I don't think they're starstruck by the Garden. They played
here before in high school and big AAU tournaments. They're not starstruck at
all. They're playing like upper classmen.  
  
Q. Bob, going back to DeJuan for a minute, was there any thought in your
mind that maybe you had blown it at halftime when he played so many minutes
and were you perfect at the foul line and only up by two?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: No, I didn't think we'd blown it. I didn't think we did a
very good job carrying out the game plan that we talked about doing and I
thought we were much, much better in the second half carrying out the game
plan.  
You think about it, Dave is in foul trouble. We don't start him in the second
half and we still were able to build a lead without him in the game and you've
seen this all year, know how important he is to us but I think that shows the
level of maturity that our other guys are starting to attain.  
  
Q. Bob, just talk about the adjustment, you lose. How this team sort of came
together as the season kind unfolded together here.  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: It's been a hard year in a lot of regards. Losing Joe and I
mean we all miss Joe playing and Joe gives us that -- you want to talk about
toughness, Joe gives you toughness and I think in the long run, it's really
helped these two guys because they really had to expand their game. Both of
them have played point guard for us and, you know, for a long time I was
trying to figure out how Alex could throw it to Alex and -- or Da'Sean could
throw it to Da'Sean and you got give Truck a lot of credit because there's a
lot of things that he has to know and in losing Joe -- we lost Al for a couple
games and lost here in the Garden and he couldn't play and we really toughed
out a win at Duquesne without our two starting guards and that may have, I
think, maybe in the long run -- I think maybe we grew a little bit then
because it forced our other guys to have to do more things than what they've
ever done.  
Honestly, I can't say enough good things about these two guys because you
know, I've played them out of position. I've asked them to do a lot of things
that they hadn't never really done before, but in the end, again, I think it's
made us one, a better basketball team and I think it's made them better
players.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: West Virginia, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2009

  

### [Jimmy Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19458)

### [Wesley Matthews](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16971)

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Villanova 76  
Marquette 75

  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: I thought it was a great college game. Played in the
world famous Madison Square Garden. Thought Villanova was extremely good off
the bounce. I thought that in the first half predominantly we really struggled
because we were in foul trouble. We had four guys with two. One guy with them
three and I thought in the second half we were much better defensively. I
thought we were out of character on both ends of the floor for too much of the
first half. I thought in the second half we played much more the way we have
to play in order to give ourselves a chance for success.  
We had kind of a similar situation at South Florida. At South Florida we were
down one and Jerel (McNeal) recently had already fouled out of the game so we
kind of ran the same action for Wesley and then same situation today.  
Obviously we were up one, five-second difference in the shot clock and they
made a great play at the end to win it. We lost. They deserved the victory and
we'll handle it the right way and try to get better over the next few days.  
  
Q. Buzz, would you breakdown what you saw from you guys defensively on that
last play?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: I thought we guarded the ball then we call it "helped
uphill." So dribble penetration and I don't even remember who it was, but we
stepped uphill to help penetration. They went behind us. I think they scored
five baskets on that throughout the game.  
  
Q. On Jerel's drive on the previous possession there, did you want to get
something going to the basket, maybe create some contact if nothing else?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: Yeah. We wanted to make sure that we took it as low in
the shot clock as we could while still giving ourselves a chance for a great
look and Zar (Lazar Hayward) set a flat ball screen. Wes was coming off the
stagger from the opposite corner. Yeah, that was our intention, to get
something going towards the basket.  
  
Q. Buzz, how big of an accomplishment was it holding them to 29 points in
the second half, that offense of theirs?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: The 8 players they play are high major players. They have
a synergy between them in regards to what they do, in regards to how they play
on offense. They're really good in transition, really good in secondary and
then once it becomes a half-court game, they spread you out so much.  
Most of the time they were playing with four guards in the second half and so
it spreads you out and it's hard to help off penetration but I wish we would
have been like that in the first half but we got better in the second half and
were more in character. Wesley and Jerel did a much better job in the second
half of creating shots with other guys which helps us because Mo (Maurice
Acker) was able to help us, Zar was able to help us and those guys need the
help of Wes and Jerel to create shots for them. I thought defensively we were
much better in the second half than we were in the first half.  
  
Q. Wes and Jimmy, can you talk to your ability to get to the line today.
Especially first half, it kept you in the ballgame.  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: Yeah. I mean that was what kept us in, made it even remotely
a game in the first half and what put us pushing towards them in the second
half, we just wanted to be aggressive and that's the type of team we are, the
type of players we are is we want to force the issue, make you guard us, you
know, with your defense shifting, make you run out at us and we drive past and
that's where we're at our best. We converted at the free throw line.  
JIMMY BUTLER: I think we're just playing our game which was driving and
kicking and, you know, forcing help, with a lot of attention on Jerel and Wes.
It created a lot of opportunities for other people and of course, you know, on
the offensive glass and just pushing it in transition and being in the right
place at the right time to get down by the basket and just get a quick look
and get fouled and get to the line.  
  
Q. Wes, can you take us through that last play when Villanova scored? I
think I know the answer but what was going through your mind when you saw the
ball go through the basket?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I don't really know if there's a word for it. I was shocked,
we fought so hard in the second half to get to the point where we were and
five seconds changed it completely for us and the coach said, helped uphill.
They made a play. For the most part we all converted back on the defense, we
all stopped the ball. We ran a play against a set defense and there was more
of a bailout than anything. I mean they really had no idea what was going on.
They were just trying to push and hope for something to happen and we let it
happen. We gave it up and they took advantage.  
  
Q. Wes, for your senior year, Big East tournament to end like this, does
this just add to your desire for the NCAA tournament?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: It sucks. We're supposed to be playing Louisville right now,
getting ready to go play Louisville. We're not. Wasn't in God's plan. We just
got to learn from it, keep fighting and get ready and get this taste out of
our mouth now because it's going to be the exact same feeling if we play
another 20 minutes like we did in the first half, you know, come Selection
Sunday, who we find out we're playing against. We got to make sure we bring
the second half 20 minutes every time. Otherwise it's going to suck again.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Buzz, do you remember that three that Jerel missed from the top of key
there with your second last possession, did you want to get a shot quick to
get a final possession?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: We were trying to play 2-for-1. I do remember it. I think
there might have been -- I don't remember the exact number. What was the
number; how much time was left?  
  
Q. Probably, roughly, a little under a minute if I'm correct.  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: No, we weren't trying for a 2-for-1. It played out that
way. The five-second differential was probably as it related to when Jerel
took the shot as the possession they had, second-to-the-last possession. It
just played out that way. We just wanted to get a good look.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Anything else for Marquette? Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2009

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Jonny Flynn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19433)

### [Paul Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18095)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Syracuse 127  
UCONN 117

  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: I've got no words to even try to describe it. I've never
been prouder of any team I've ever coached. We lost our guys, big guys first
and they had some in there, still, and somehow we survived and I think the
strategy was just to try to get them into overtime far enough so we could get
all their guys out, too and just play them -- Paul finally got a little guy on
them he could get to the basket with. Andy made shots. You can't even talk
about the plays in this game. When we were 6 down in the one overtime,
whichever one that was, I don't know how we got out of that one.  
We did have a couple opportunities in overtime, one or two of them to win a
couple times where they could have won the game, too, but, you know, would
have been a lot better if they just counted Eric's shot and we could have gone
home two hours ago laughter.  
I'm just proud of these guys for hanging in there and especially Paul because
Paul was just, I can't describe how awful he was for most of the part of that
game. For him to come up and make some of the plays he made finally, he was
even smart enough to miss the dunk so he could get a 3-point play (laughter).
How much smarter can you be than that?  
This was just two teams going at it. A.J. Price was unbelievable but just an
unbelievable effort from both teams and I can't imagine being involved in a
better basketball game.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: We are joined by Jonny Flynn and Paul Harris.  
  
Q. Jim, you coached the triple-overtime game in 1981; did you ever think you
would approach that one again?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: We wouldn't if Leo's (Rautins) son (Andy Rautins) hadn't
made the three coming off the screen there. You just don't think about games
going more than one or two in overtime. I know in one of the overtimes I told
them we were undefeated in overtime so we should be able to keep that streak
going. I forgot when that was. I think that was around 12:30, 1:00 (laughter).  
You know, just -- I can't really describe fully my emotions about this team in
that game.  
  
Q. Coach, before tonight, what was the most unique experience before tonight
that you've had?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Before time --  
  
Q. Professional career.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: On the court or off the court (laughter)?  
  
Q. On the court.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: This game. I don't think there's anyway to describe --
triple overtime game with Villanova was unbelievable, an unbelievable game.
You get involved after 30 some years and thousands of games, there's a lot of
games in there that are pretty memorable, but I don't think I can -- I think
it would be hard to top this game.  
  
Q. Coach, was it a relief when Rick and Arinze fouled out to see Hasheem
(Thabeet) go not soon after?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: I don't remember when it happened exactly but certainly
when he went out, that helps ultimately -- we were attacking him better
tonight than we have ever. He's going to block shots. We were going at him.
Ricky (Jackson) went at him a couple times, Jonny went at him. He's a
tremendous shot blocker. I said many times he's the best shot blocker I've
seen in this league and, you know, obviously when he goes out, that's a big
weapon, but we already lost two, three guys by then and, you know, (A.J.)
Price was the guy, he was just unbelievable. I thought Kris Joseph went in and
played for whatever it was. He's never played center, never been in that
position. He drew a charge, he scraped in there. J.T. (Justin Thomas) has
never been in a big game. He got in there and had a rebound. He stayed in
front of Price. He's a senior. He did a tremendous job out there for us. I
really can't say enough about those two guys who were hanging in there against
this team.  
  
Q. For the players, Johnny and Paul, can you tell us how does your body feel
right now and what are you thinking about playing tomorrow night as far as
mental mindset and physically.  
JONNY FLYNN: I can't even feel my legs right now. We battled it out. It's
great we got the victory but we got to turn around today and get a big win
over West Virginia; a scrappy team we beat before who showed a great
performance tonight versus West Virginia (Pittsburgh).  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: West Virginia was unbelievable tonight. Pittsburgh has been
a tremendous team all year and for West Virginia to play the way they were,
they were absolutely spectacular tonight.  
  
Q. Paul, I mean everybody looked like the legs were gone. You looked like
you had a little extra left in that 6th overtime. Did you feel a little
extra?  
PAUL HARRIS: Coach kind of rested me before the first game (laughter). I'll
have my legs a little bit. Kept blowing layups at the end of the game. I was
asking God, please let me make some kind of great play. I thank God we won
this game.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: The free throw shooting was absolutely unbelievable
tonight. We had to make two free throws at least seven, eight times. It was
Johnny most of the time but Paul a couple times, Andy. We must have made 16
straight free throws that had to be made just to stay in the game, and that's
hard to do. That's hard to do. They missed a couple for us to give us a chance
to stay in the game, too.  
  
Q. Jonny, when did you start to kind of, I mean, feel your legs kind of go.
It looked like you were cramping up there and dying. Do you remember?  
JONNY FLYNN: It had to be between the second and the fourth overtime, right
around that time.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Around 1:00.  
JONNY FLYNN: The feeling started setting in. Paul Harris and other guys kept
saying we fought this long, we can't give this game away right now. The
players, the bench players, all the coaches and everybody really picked us up
and carried us through this game for us to withstand an onslaught from
Connecticut.  
  
Q. Paul and Johnny, were you guys concerned at any point during the
overtimes about your own stamina and being able this -- if this game kept
going?  
PAUL HARRIS: I got to give a big go to our strength and conditioning coach. He
worked us so hard in the off-season. He prepared us for a 40-minute game. Not
one like this. Our legs were there. We're glad we just got the victory.  
  
Q. Jonny, why did you lose the head band in the last overtime?  
JONNY FLYNN: I just wanted to get the game over with. For a second I'm just
thinking, Lord, let's just get this game over, go home. Whoever wins, wins the
game. It was getting near that time.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: It was getting to the point that -- it's a lot better
winning the greatest game that ever played. It was almost time to like let's
go home.  
PAUL HARRIS: I think that was because I missed that lay up.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Which one? (Laughter.) I can't even tell you how much --
you missed four in a row at one time.  
  
Q. Jim, you were behind for most of the overtimes. How big was to it get
Andy's three at the start of the 6th?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: It was the first tip we got, I think. Paul got it.  
PAUL HARRIS: We lost every tip. Jonny Flynn said we need to get one tip.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Sure enough we got -- set the play. We had Andy coming off
that screen and boom, he made it. That was pretty big.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: All right, Syracuse. Thank you.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Thank you guys.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2009

  

### [DeJuan Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18154)

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

West Virginia 74  
Pittsburgh 60

  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: Obviously, congratulations to West Virginia. I think they
really deserved the win. I think we were outplayed. We really talked about
rebounding and they really -- they obviously beat us on the glass and it's
something that we do well and if we don't, it's something that will catch up
to us.  
I thought we battled through some things in the first half, put ourselves in a
position. In the second half, we just didn't execute. I think we were -- we
weren't coached well, we weren't prepared well again for some things and we
just got outplayed in every area.  
So, you know, it's just one of those games. We've got to do a better job and
again, this is a very good team. They've only lost to good people. We had
beaten them twice this year but both were tough games and they really did
outplay us in every aspect today so, you know, we understand that we got what
we deserved and the responsibility falls on ourselves.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Coach, last year you guys win four games in four days to take the
championship. Here a little bit more of a layoff for the teams playing today.
Could you feel that had any impact on it at all?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: I don't think so. I mean that's last year and this is this
year, different players, different teams. Obviously the fouls early, foul
trouble. We had to do some things differently, play some different guys and in
different spots. We got into the second half we're down two and need to
execute and I just don't think that we did and had good preparation.  
Thought we practiced Monday and Tuesday. Even Wednesday. But it just -- we
didn't come out. I didn't think we moved the ball well enough, the 1-3-1
bothered us in the second half. We didn't attack it as well as we have
attacked it in the past and against other teams and it was really again,
responsibility falls on us. Nothing about a layoff. It was really us and our
execution.  
  
Q. For either of the players, this is obviously a disappointment. Can you
use it as motivation, do you think heading into the NCAA? How are you feeling
right now and going into that tournament?  
DEJUAN BLAIR: Of course you feel down right now. The next couple hours, days,
you're going to feel down watching the Big East and, you know, watching
everybody but this is motivation. It's hard to bet a team three times and, you
know, like Coach said we weren't prepared and the foul trouble.  
We didn't grind it out like we usually do and, you know, like you said, we
just got to blame ourselves, you know. We beat ourselves. We didn't shoot that
well and we got outrebounded and we're going to keep this as motivation, you
know. I hate to feel like this -- I felt like there at Providence and we
bounced back so we're a good bounce-back team. Hopefully we come back in the
NCAA tournament no matter where they put us and just play. We can't worry
about where they put us or worry about nothing else. Just got to worry about
us.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about what you were missing when Tyrelle
(Biggs) wasn't able to start the second half?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: I wonder if that was the right thing to do at this time now
as I look back at it. I think I got us out of our rotation and had the three
fouls, obviously. We tried to get through the first half without him getting
the third one. We had to play, take some chances and some things. We had a
number of guys in foul trouble early and it really changed our rotation a bit.
I thought we kind of got back into it second half and were able to.  
It put us in a position to play our game in the second half but it just didn't
happen. Probably in retrospect, probably either not put him in the first half
to get the third foul or should have started him in the second half.  
  
Q. Jamie, you said that you guys kind of didn't come out, didn't play very
well it sounds like a silly question but at this point in the season does that
surprise you after --  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: It's hard to play well every game. It's easy to say and a
little harder to do and, you know, it's not for lack of desire or effort. I
mean we just didn't -- we got in some foul trouble. We changed our rotation
around and then the second half we didn't execute against the 1-3-1. We didn't
rebound well enough. I think -- I didn't think we were patient. They were more
patient with the ball than we were. I real thought we were on defense for most
of the game and that's something that we talked about going in and I think
they wanted to do that and were able to do that.  
So, they showed more patience offensively than we did on both the offensive
and defensive end.  
  
Q. For DaJuan and Jamie. DaJuan you talked where you get put in the NCAA
tournament. Do you think this affects the one seed possibility at all? Does it
even matter or do you even care about that?  
DEJUAN BLAIR: Yeah -- I don't know. The selection committee is who they are
and I don't know that we're really high on the list. We're there because we
were winning games and it really don't matter, you know, it really don't
matter where they put us. We just going to have to grind it out. I know this
is hard to say but I'd rather lose in the Big East and win the NCAA instead of
winning the Big East and lose in the NCAA. I think this is a little setback
for us but we can't take no steps back. We got to take steps forward, you
know, just let the Big East ride out. Whoever wins, congratulations to them
and we we're just going to have to play no matter what.  
Our team has got some great players and we got to keep working hard, and like
I said, still the sky is the limit for this team. We had a little of a little
letdown but everything is going to be all right for us. We just keep playing
and Coach keeps motivating us and we can't worry about nobody else and where
they put us or our head won't be on the game. It's going to be where they put
us, should have been there, should have been that. We'll be all right.  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: Obviously I think this is disappointing, this loss hurts.
It's not what we wanted but obviously to go over what you've done in your
previous 31 games and I know we came in with the number one RPI and, you know,
wherever they put us we've got to play better than what we did today. That's
what we understand. Everybody -- 64, 65 teams wondering where they're going to
be this weekend, you know. It's whoever -- everybody has the same opportunity
and we'll have an opportunity that a lot ever people wish they had. We'll be
in a good spot and I think the 31 games obviously, you know, everybody has got
a number of losses. There's only a few -- only as few as we have.  
  
Q. DaJuan, going into halftime you got ten guys out there, the bench was
pretty empty, down by two; did you really think you guys were in pretty good
position to come back in the second half and win the game?  
DEJUAN BLAIR: Of course. Going down by two. The dagger was -- that shot they
made at the buzzer, I think that was motivation for them and a little dagger
in the chest for us but I think we just let it slip a slip away from us, man.
I don't know what was wrong with us. We couldn't hit shots and, you know, they
put that 1-3-1 on us and it was tough to guard with all the foul trouble we
had, so, yeah, I thought we was coming back but, you know, obviously we didn't
and, you know, we got what we deserved.  
  
Q. DaJuan, this is for you: We did see in the first half, you were a little
bit limited, little bit of foul trouble. What did you see that West Virginia
was really able to do to sort of stop you in the second half. What did this
specifically do that stopped you during the game?  
DEJUAN BLAIR: I guess the 1-3-1 and Biggs, they were trying to come down on
me, you know, a lot and we wasn't making shots, so you stop me and then it was
some tough shots we were shooting. We weren't shooting no great shots. That's
all they did. The 1-3-1 kind of killed us a little bit. We got to just be more
prepared for 1-3-1 defense and obviously play better defense and we gave them
motivation and they were kind of hyped up on defense, you know, rebounding and
all that.  
They deserve to win. We played terrible and they played good. So, give them
all the credit.  
  
Q. Is there any way, you know, you guys have grinded it out into the finals
the past few years, using it as a rest could be beneficial rather than playing
a couple more games?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: I don't think it feels like it right now, obviously. We're
disappointed to lose and I know our guys would rather be playing. We're going
to have to figure out what our schedule is and look at it. We were hoping to
stay and play like everybody else in the tournament. This is surely a
disappointment and not what we wanted.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Pitt, thank you.  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: Thank you very much.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2009

  

### [Dwayne Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18324)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Villanova 76  
Marquette 75

  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Number one, I'd rather be lucky than good so we will
definitely take that. We've been on the other side of this in this tournament
and this side feels great.  
I also want to say I think Buzz Williams has done a great job with that team.
They've gotten to a point they know how to play without James. They've learned
it, Cubillan and Acker, now, they've got it figured out. They're really good,
really good, and I just -- I want to give Buzz a lot of credit. Number one
what he did this season but then to lose James and get them playing like they
are now is incredible.  
And then, you know, Scottie Reynolds has been great for us. His whole career.
He's always made big plays and, you know, at the end of that game some
rebounds and dives, loose balls besides the shots he makes. He's a leader for
us and of course Reggie Redding made a great play. I'm really proud of Reggie.  
  
Q. Coach, at 40 seconds you called that timeout. What were you discussing?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: You know, there was about a five, six second differential in
the shot clock so I didn't -- we didn't want to be confused with are we
fouling, not fouling, what are we going to do when we get the ball, going to
timeout afterwards and we wanted to get a bigger team on the floor, we wanted
to play bigger defensively.  
So might have been -- turned out okay, might have been a bad move not having a
timeout left. We had to make that decision there.  
  
Q. Jay, how difficult is that? You have absolutely no control. You created
control in that game.  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: That's the key. We had a real small group out there for
offense. We went offense/defense and I wanted to get the subs in. And I made
sure we knew what we were doing. I did have more confidence with this group.
It's Scottie and Reggie, both of them making a play and Dante (Cunningham),
and we have older guys on the floor. I really do have confidence.  
They did a great job even after the miss, they face-guarded Scottie. We
couldn't get Scottie the ball. They did a great job on that and then that's
why Reggie was trying to get it to Scottie and they wouldn't let us get it to
them. Reggie made the play.  
  
Q. Jay, being you didn't have any timeouts. If you had a timeout, what was
the play going to be. Would it have been a pass from Reggie?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: No. That's definitely -- it might have ended up that way but
that wouldn't have been the plan. It usually never works out like the plan is,
but we wouldn't have -- we would have got Dante and Corey (Fisher) involved if
we had a time out.  
  
Q. What do you feel about what the guys did without a timeout doing it on
their own?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: You know, Reggie Redding is a guy that, you know, he had 11
assists and no turnovers in our last game. He's a guy that we all know can
make plays and that's why we keep him in there.  
A lot of times we actually want him at the point, Scottie at the 2. He threw
the lob to Dante Cunningham. We have great confidence in Reggie there that's
the guy we want the ball in his hands if not Scottie.  
  
Q. Dwayne, could you run through the last play? How you were able to get
open and the basket it is?  
DWAYNE ANDERSON: We were on defense. I think it was Shane Clark got the
rebound. He kicked it up to Reggie Redding. As coach always says, we have to
run offensive score and that's what we did. We tried to get the ball to
Scottie. They face-guarded like Coach said and they did a good job, Reggie, as
a player, so he tried to make a play and I guess he saw me cutting at the last
second, game winning shot.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Dante's play when (Jerel) McNeal drives, if he gets
fouled or scores there.  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Dante struggled today. I don't know why. They did a really
good job on him but, you know, that's what stars do. McNeal had a lane to the
rim and Dante went straight up and really went up and contested without really
bringing his arms down and challenged the shot. That was a big time play. They
had run that ball screen before. We got beat on it. So that was huge right
there.  
  
Q. Jay, how much of an adjustment did you have to make early in the first
half when Dante and Dwayne picked up two quick fouls?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: We actually played better which is crazy. I got to go back
and think about this again. We played better without our best players today.
But I told the young guys, Corey Fisher, Corey Stokes and Antonio Pena carried
us in the first half. That's where depth pays off especially at this time of
year. Those three were great, they really were.  
You go with your older guys down the stretch but I'm gaining a lot more
confidence in those three.  
  
Q. Coach, this team was comfortably ahead most game. Is there a concern that
the team would make a comeback at the end?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Not at this time of the year. You know, at this time of the
year-in tournament play, crazy things happen. There was a series there where
it just seemed like every loose ball we went after we fouled. We did. I'm not
complaining. We just fouled, you know, and they had 50 percent free throw
shooters making every free throw. Those things happen this time of year. Dante
is getting good looks, missing them. You've got to battle through that. That's
what this season is all about.  
  
Q. Dwayne and Jay, what's going through your guys' head in the last second
when that ball is rolling around the rim the last few seconds?  
DWAYNE ANDERSON: I'm nervous, but it's a great feeling at the end of the day.
We actually go back and watch film, there's plenty of plays that we could have
avoided being in that situation but that last second, it was nerve-wracking
and then it felt good afterwards.  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: That seemed like it rolled forever, man. I can picture that
in my mind. I wasn't sure it went in. They were all sure. I brought them all
together. They were all saying, "it's good, it's good." I think I'll always
remember that one.  
  
Q. Jay, you talked about your three younger players a second ago. Can you
talk about Corey Fisher?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Corey Fisher has been great. Believe it or not, we have to
get Corey Fisher to look, to score more, believe it or not. The last play he
made it, a wide open jumper, tried to get it to Shane Clark and turned into a
turnover and, you know, we took him out and explained to it him. We need him
to be more of a scorer. So it was incredible today. He played great defense
and hit big time shots. I love the play he made at the end of the game. If
they're going to call it a travel, it's a travel. I'll take that every time
from Corey Stokes. I love that play.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the overall defensive effort, the top scorers in the
Big East are 5-for-22; talk about the defensive effort you guys put forward.  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Until you said that, that's pretty good. Those two have,
over their careers, killed us, they really have. I love those two. I had them
on the USA team and Dominic (James), too. I just have so much respect for them
and our guys know how much I love those three.  
So, they know to do that kind job on them, that's quite an accomplishment
because they can score a lot of ways and they make their teammates better.  
  
Q. Dwayne, talk about how good it feels to make your career almost come full
circle. Great article about you in the paper today talking about your
struggles early on and you hit the game-winning shot and what would have been
your final game in Madison Square Garden as a senior. I grant you that.  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Mike "Curry" is a prophet.  
DWAYNE ANDERSON: It definitely means a lot. I've been though a lot. Highs and
lows, we've struggled and we're not quite there but we're getting close to it
and just hitting that game-winning shot after having a lack of performance on
myself so I'm hard on myself. I don't think I played well but that shot kind
of saved me. Next time we'll have to pick it up.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Villanova, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Jerry Wainwright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16943)

### [Will Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19359)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Providence - 83  
DePaul - 74

  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Coach Jerry Wainwright. Dar Tucker and Will Walker.  
COACH JERRY WAINWRIGHT: Obviously, we think we took an awful lot from our stay
here and played two good basketball teams, teams that we had faced only once
during the year and had a lot of respect for both programs.  
I have always had great respect for Wayne -- I always say his name wrong,
Weyinmi, is a wonderful kid. He's really improved his game and he's got a
great smile and great personality. Really enjoyed watching him grow up. He
certainly was a difference maker today.  
We had to change our matchups, started to get in a little bit of foul trouble
and seemed like our whole team was in foul trouble through most of the game
and short bench right now. Our guys got a little bit tired in the second half.
We missed free throws that would have maintained the lead. We went a lot of 1
for 2s there and we needed to get to the three minute mark maybe we could get
Mac (Koshwal) with four fouls.  
Didn't work out that way but I couldn't be prouder of how we played and how we
attacked the tournament and hopefully this group of young kids will stick
together and grow from this experience and take positives from it and know how
hard you have to work to be successful in the Big East.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Jerry, did you almost expect at some point you're going to hit some kind
of wall? What was it going to take at that point to get over that?  
COACH JERRY WAINWRIGHT: We talked about it at the pregame talk was, we just
had to find a new level of -- we -- again, we have three guys go 40 minutes.
That's back to back for Will (Walker). Close for Jeremiah (Kelly). Dar
(Tucker) was able to go 40 tonight. He switched with Mac in terms of foul
trouble. It was going to take its toll on us at some point, Brian. You do get
a little bit tired.  
It was a little bit more of a fast-paced game tonight. We turned the ball over
at inopportune times for points. I think there were two straight times in the
game where against the press we just made lazy passes and they got two
straight baskets which closed the lead real quick.  
We only had 9 turnovers and I think we lost our legs at the free throw line in
the second half but again I don't want to demean anything Providence did but I
can't -- couldn't have asked for more in terms of effort.  
We don't have a lot of guys left standing and I was proud the ones who played
and got a lift today from Mario (Stula) his shots meant a lot to us and
overall, anybody who played did the best they could.  
  
Q. Did you ever sense you were about to pull this off and win another
game?  
COACH JERRY WAINWRIGHT: We certainly thought we could win. We thought we were
very positive in the locker room. I thought we were really solid during the
game.  
You know, we knew we had to play 40 minutes. We had that one wall. We hit that
one wall and really hurt us. A lot of that is dictated by personnel, foul
trouble. You have to be able to manage your way through that and it did hurt
us today and so we played with different lineups and I think ultimately that
hurt our defense and -- but we certainly felt we could compete with
Providence.  
We knew they were a team that's had a great chance to make the NCAA
tournament. We knew we had to play our best. We had a two minute span where we
didn't and that decided the game, really.  
  
Q. For Dar and Will. Jerry talked about taking stuff away from these two
days. What do you guys take away from the past couple days?  
WILL WALKER: We take the experience and just take that we know we were working
hard, we can keep winning and be a force in the Big East with the young guys
getting a lot of experience, especially Jeremiah. He got a lot of experience
at the point guard position.  
It's going to carry on and keep trying to get better and better throughout the
year and we also going to take this in the preseason and keep working hard so
we can get better next year.  
DAR TUCKER: It was like Will said, we just going to use it to get better. I
mean sit back on this and think about it all year. Get better and work on our
game, watch film, see what we got to work on and just do better next year.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm guessing that DePaul is actually not a team that people can
say that if 16 teams weren't mixed to come into the conference, that you now
are more encouraged by what this team has done in these two games as opposed
to the regular season. Now you can now have one person. I would say that would
be a --  
COACH JERRY WAINWRIGHT: Right. Again, I talked a little bit about this
yesterday. These kids played 18 conference games as did, I don't know, exactly
the order of the Final Four teams. This is a really difficult league, very
demanding and I think we would all agree that an awful lot of the teams that
are at the bottom have younger players. This is an incredible classroom,
Madison Square Garden with the attention, you guys, neutral floor.  
If you're not motivated by this then you probably won't be much of a success
at basketball and why should those guys at least not taste that? Why shouldn't
that be something that allows them to say, you know, this is why I came to a
Big East school, this is what it's all about and I really do believe,
circumstances, that it motivates them.  
I think -- if you're -- I think as a student athlete, for all that they give
up -- everybody thinks they give get a lot but they give up an awful lot.  
This is a great, great experience, life long experience. Just think of Matija
Poscic, a kid from Croatia, who ultimately will go back with a college degree
to his country and be able to relate memories of this tournament to a whole
different group of people.  
So I do believe it's a positive to have everybody here. I think, you know, in
a different setting every team in this league is competitive. Certainly will
help our program, without question as a springboard maybe the next year, but
for all the kids I've always been -- it's like I told you yesterday, by the
NCAA rules, the teams that didn't make it couldn't even get a T-shirt.  
You battle all year and you do all the things you have to do and this is a
great league. I know these guys take a lot of pride in saying they're from the
Big East and they want to be part of it at the end and we didn't have the best
year for sure but I think we showed that we can be a representative team in
this league and we're just a couple of guys away from being pretty good. I
agree with you, I think that's a great boost for your program.  
  
Q. Dar, have you given anymore thought about your future? I know, are you
considering turning pro or going through workouts? Have you given anymore
thought about that?  
DAR TUCKER: It's a thought, you know, but right now, I'm just focusing on what
I got to work on and things I got to do. I still feel that I'm really -- my
game ain't up to the pro level yet. I watch a lot of pro basketball, a lot. I
don't think it's there yet so I just got to work on my game, just play for
him.  
  
Q. Is it fair to say you expect to be back at DePaul next year?  
DAR TUCKER: Yes.  
COACH JERRY WAINWRIGHT: We're a quarter school. He's got finals next week. I
know --  
DAR TUCKER: I brought a couple papers down here.  
COACH JERRY WAINWRIGHT: We brought our academic advisor. These are two
exceptional kids. I hope they have all their dreams come true in their lives.
Both of them are Dean's List kids and that's -- we got to get back to reality
here real quick when we get off the plane in Chicago. Anything else?  
  
Q. With the season over, can you just reflect on what type of have toll it's
taken, what you guys have been through?  
COACH JERRY WAINWRIGHT: Well, you know, we made kind of a personal comment
today that afterwards it's been very, very difficult but in no way has it been
embarrassing. Somebody used the word "disgrace", which is as far from anything
that we feel. I got good kids that go to class, work hard in school and really
conducted themselves as men. This is an unforgiving league. We knew what we
were getting into when we got into it and that's the beauty of it.  
So we never asked -- we haven't looked for a shoulder to cry on. We are a
maker of our own. We didn't make -- we did this or that. We go back over every
game and identify weaknesses. Obviously what we're committed to is going back
and correcting them.  
Disappointed? Maybe a little bit frustrated but in no way embarrassed or in no
way do we feel like at some point we're not going to be a team that the Big
East is proud of.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: DePaul, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2009

  

### [Michael Tranghese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14274)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
JOHN PAQUETTE: A bunch of you have asked for a chance to talk to Mike and, you
know, I thought this might be the best practical way to handle a lot of the
stuff and talk to Mike about his last tournament here as Commissioner and,
Mike, unless you want to say something.  
COMMISSIONER MIKE TRANGHESE: Not really. I'll answer questions.  
  
Q. Mike, you went the other way after the ceremony at halftime in the first
game. What was going through your mind when everybody was out there and all
the ADs and everybody?  
COMMISSIONER MIKE TRANGHESE: Truthfully, to get me the hell off the court. I'm
not good at that kind of stuff. People know me. I have difficulty -- I think
I've spent my life trying to make things better for our coaches and our
players so, you know, I have a lot of friends out there in particular our
Presidents, to be there, meant a lot to me, for them at that time to do that.  
You know, I told myself coming here I wasn't going to get into this reflective
mode. I don't want to get emotional about it because I don't want to take away
from the tournament, because this has a chance to be, in terms of the level of
play, as good a tournament that's ever been played in this building.  
In fact, I was talking yesterday to Louie Carnesecca and John (Marinatto) and
Chris Mullin about the level of play.  
People say it's just the best year. To me, the best year is '85 because we're
ultimately judged by what we do at the end of the year. But in terms of a
level of play in the recent season, it's just been so many great games and so
many players -- I think the reason is besides coaches, we've got so many four-
year players in this league.  
You don't get a lot of four-year players. Take a look at the rosters of our
teams, four-year players all across the board, and I think that's one of the
big reasons why we are so good and why I think we have a chance to really do
damage in the tournament.  
  
Q. Just put it harshly, will the tournament be a disappointment because the
Big East Conference has been so strong?  
COMMISSIONER MIKE TRANGHESE: I never looked at it that way. I'd like to us win
a championship because they're hard to win. I think we've got a number of
teams that could win. It's not like I'm going to wake up and lose sleep over
it. You'd be disappointed. I think we have teams capable.  
It's hard to win, but I just think we've got three of the best 7 or 8 teams in
the country, so I think we've got a chance.  
I was talking to Jimmy Calhoun about it yesterday. It all depends. It's where
you get matched, who you play. When you have big players like Thabeet and
DeJuan Blair, wins become an important part.  
That's a big part of the tournament because you know when our teams come out
on the floor they look and see three officials that they know. Trust me, our
coaches know tendencies. They understand what officials might or might not do
and you get in the NCAA tournament, you're seeing people you've never seen
before.  
If you ever talk to coaches, that's one of their great, great fears is when --
I've seen it. I'll go see a coach before the game, and it's like Bobby Huggins
getting ready to play Duke. I go back to him and he says, "Look, who are these
guys?" He didn't know. Bobby did not know who they were. I said, "Bobby, he's
from the PAC-10, he's from here." "Oh, God", he said. "That's it, Bob, don't
worry about it."  
Q. Mike, you mentioned 1985. That year the Final Four, was that the year that
you knew and maybe Dave knew this league had made it, it or was it even before
then?  
COMMISSIONER MIKE TRANGHESE: No. This sounds crazy. I mean Kevin McNamara and
Billy Reynolds from Providence are here.  
Dave Gavin was the smartest man I've ever been around. Before the league
formed in -- we had talked about it for so long and just, you know, I said,
"Dave, why don't you do it?" He said, "The time is not right, but when we do
it we've got a chance to be really good."  
I think the only question was, is it going to take two years, three years,
four years? I saw the look in Dave the day that Patrick Ewing announced he was
going to Georgetown. We're going to New York now and now we're going to be
good. You can't predict '85. It hasn't happened since. It may never happen
again. Getting three teams in the Final Four is just -- it's incomprehensible
to me. I know how hard it is.  
The thing that amazed me about that, most people forget, Boston College got
beat in the semi-finals in overtime by a point by Oklahoma with Waymon
Tisdale. If they had won that game, I bet my life they would have beaten
Memphis because when Villanova played Memphis they pressed and trapped, and
Memphis turned the ball over a sill I don't know how many times.  
Boston College was a better trapping and pressing team than Villanova. Gary
and I talked about it. We went ahead might have had four teams. You go back
and look at Georgetown and Villanova and St. John's. They came very close to
losing on the way there. You got to get lucky, make a free throw, somebody
blows a whistles; it goes your way, it doesn't go your way.  
  
Q. You're not going to get totally away from the Big East. I'm guessing
you're going in the crowd now and then?  
COMMISSIONER MIKE TRANGHESE: I'm a fan. That's what my wife asked me. "Do we
still get tickets?" I say, "Yeah, we'll be okay, we'll get in" (laughter).  
  
Q. Coach. Given the wear and tear and the grind, maybe about teams going
forward in the post-season, is that a problem?  
COMMISSIONER MIKE TRANGHESE: You're playing here on Saturday, home Saturday
night. That's why we moved this tournament back to Saturday. That's one of the
things that people forgot.  
You don't have any idea what a dogfight it was to get this tournament back to
Saturday night. One of the things I'm most proud of. We were playing on Sunday
afternoon and our Presidents were talking about the inconvenience of the fans.  
I said we have to get back to playing it Saturday night to give our teams
another day of rest but I wanted to play at night in this city because there's
nothing like Friday and Saturday night in the city.  
That was also the same year that we went to the ESPN and got our tournament
from start to finish on ESPN. First year we did it was '96. We get the Allen
Iverson, Ray Allen final. One of the four, five best games ever played in this
tournament, Mike so, yeah, kids are pretty resilient, though. Give them two
days off, they're ready to play.  
  
Q. Mike, what challenges does the Big East face as you leave, that are the
challenges of the future?  
COMMISSIONER MIKE TRANGHESE: Well, we're so big that we have to pay attention
to the size of our membership because every time somebody talks about
expansion they seem to have their eyes towards us.  
Plus, we have schools that play football, big time college football and
schools who don't and therefore their days and times can be different.  
I think in reorganizing we've done a great job of really integrating our
people. Today, we had a Presidents' meeting, all 16 schools. I can tell you we
spent 40 minutes today talking about the whole championship series.  
We've really made a concerted effort to take our football issues and talk
about them in front of everybody. The thing that's interesting it's really
helped -- really allowed our so-called non-football playing schools to feel
more engaged. We don't have clandestine meetings. You got to work at it.  
John knows this is the biggest challenge. Our size is a challenge. But, you
know, our coaches, you all hear they complain it's too hard, it's too big. I
tell them, there are a lot of benefits to it. We're the conference in this
building playing. It's the best tournament in the country because it's in this
building, in this city. Nobody else has that.  
Coaches are talking about splitting. I told one of the coaches, fine, where do
you think you're going to go play your tournament? Why don't you go play in
Cleveland if you want? They're going to lose that.  
Secondly, they all complain we're getting unbelievable players. It isn't by
happenstance. Louisville is coming in here now, Marquette is coming in here,
you know, and the old standbys, Villanova and Georgetown are still here. We're
so good and competitive.  
The thing that's struck me the most and I don't think the coach will admit it,
I think they are scared silly because if they slip, they're not going from 1st
to 3rd, they're going from 1st to 8th or 9th. I think they're scared and work
harder than they ever worked.  
They know if they slip up what's going to happen. It's driving us to recruit
better. We have great players coming into this league next year. This is like
the third, fourth year we're bringing in players and, you know, we still have
to recruit against the Carolinas and the Dukes and that's hard a lot of times,
once you get past those couple of schools.  
I mean we're beating people for players. It's hard for people to come in this
city now and get players out of this city. It's because of all the our people
here. Every 10, 11, 12 year old kid is watching us.  
For those of you who aren't New York, we've all struggled with what I call a
season-long presence in New York. This deal we made with SNY, I'm so pleased
with that deal and basically people talk about the Big 10 television network.
We've got Georgetown, a Big East network in New York City. We had 80
basketball games on, 25 football games on. This is what's going to influence
young kids to play in the city. Where do they want to go? Why would you want
to go anywhere but in this darn building and play? I think we're starting to
see the benefits of that.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Cleveland is a very nice city.  
  
Q. Mike, I was just wondering if could you give us an update on where the
bowl stuff stands right now.  
COMMISSIONER MIKE TRANGHESE: Close to getting it done. I don't know what I
want to tell you because, you know, I haven't even told our people much. I
just said trust me, you know. We're working at it. You know we're in the
middle of this basketball tournament but we're talking to a lot of people.  
In fact, we've got some of our bowl partners here as guests. Football teams do
come to Madison Square Garden.  
  
Q. I just wanted to go back to the New York issue. How important is it for
the future of this league for schools like St. John's and Seton Hall to up
their level of play and success?  
COMMISSIONER MIKE TRANGHESE: I think it's important for them. First of all, I
think it helps us. The better we get in New York -- my theory in New York is
the better the teams in New York are, translates to more ink for the Big East
Conference in New York.  
That's always been the way. Because you struggle for space in New York because
of the competition with the pro league.  
Nothing is perfect but -- we're not going a away because the New York teams
haven't won a high level. It clearly would help if all of a sudden there was a
significant improvement in the three metropolitan programs simply because
we're in the media capital. It would help.  
  
Q. Mike, throughout your history in the Big East, you have a favorite team
and a favorite player?  
COMMISSIONER MIKE TRANGHESE: Chris Mullin was always my favorite player. The
thing I loved about Chris is when he played -- John and I talked about it. I
mean earlier in the year I heard people talk about how physical the Pitt-
Connecticut game was.  
What I really wanted to do was bring everybody back about 20 years ago, come
in this building when Georgetown with Patrick was playing St. John's with
Chris and everybody else. Those were physical basketball games.  
The thing I admired about Chris, he used to get the crap kicked out of him
every night by everybody. In four years of watching Chris Mullin play I never
saw him complain or whine.  
He was my favorite player. Not the best player. The best player and most
influential player in this league was Patrick.  
Favorite teams? I don't know. I loved the Seton Hall team in '89 because I was
a staffer and traveled with them. I cried after that game for P.J. because we
got -- I think they got a bad official call at the end of the game.  
What I admired most about P.J., who I love to death and all the years I've
known P.J. never once have I heard him complain about the call. Never once. I
never heard him talk about it, I never heard him complain about it.  
It was a tough call. John (Paquette) was there at Seton Hall. He and I talked
about it, but P.J. doesn't.  
I think the Providence team in '87 -- I'm very bias about Rick Pittino. I
think it's a flat out joke the last two years of the Hall of Fame voting that
Rick Pittino hasn't been a finalist. It's dominated by the NBA.  
You look at Rick's history of accomplishment, three teams in the Final Four,
three different teams, National Championship and also when the 3-point line
was introduced in 1987, virtually every coach in the country said this is the
dumbest rule we've ever seen. The coach that embraced it and utilized it and
made it part of the game is Rick Pittino.  
He took the Providence team to the Final Four and I will tell you that is by
far the least talented team to ever make the Final Four in my lifetime. There
was not a lot of talent on that team. It was because Rick embraced it.  
I think that, you know, he was in the NBA so you get this -- he wasn't
successful in the NBA. He wasn't an unsuccessful coach. He was an unsuccessful
General Manager. There's a distinct difference.  
I also remember '84, the -- '85 the thing I also remember is when Villanova
won the National Championship, the first people to congratulate the Villanova
people were the Georgetown people. John (Thompson) and Frank Rienzo and all
those people. Those are the kind of things that I remember.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: We're getting close to the game time.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Marquette 74  
St. John's 45

  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: I've never been here obviously so I wanted to make sure
that I followed the appropriate protocol.  
I thought we were much better this game than we have been in the previous four
from a defensive perspective. Obviously when we're able to get consecutive
stops we're able to score much better playing downhill than we are taking the
ball out of net.  
I think that the thing that was best for us and we spent a lot only it St.
John's set 88 ball screens on us at Marquette when we played and yesterday
against Georgetown they set 55 ball screens and so it was paramount for us to
have a chance to win from a team defensive standpoint that we would have to
guard their ball screens and then once the shot goes up, they were leading in
conference play, they were averaging 37 rebounds a game. We had to block out
and make sure we secured the defensive rebound in order to finish the
possession. We were able to do that at a very efficient and high rate
particularly in the first half. We shot 13 percent and then in the second half
there were some breakdowns for us, not only on out-of-bounds plays but in
half-court situations. In general we were much, much better defensively. We're
not the same team when MARK roar recently to is not playing and that's the
first time in a long time that he picked up two fouls that early. I thought
that the guys, Cubillan was big for us. The last ten minutes of the half and
all of the other guys were able to step up and play around him. We're thankful
for the victory. And we know that we'll play the Coach of the Year, the most
improved Player of the Year, the 6th man Player of the Year in the Big East
tomorrow and the last time we played them they shot 73 percent in the last
half that we played them, so we'll have our hands full.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Buzz, you stressed defense so much throughout the season; was the first
half a perfect defense?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: They scored three baskets so it was relatively close
(laughter). We did a much, much better job. It's not that we haven't been
working on it, I think that Dominic definitely changed us defensively because
we're able to put so much pressure on the ball and keep the ball high on the
floor and I think that each game Maurice has gotten better as have the rest of
our guys because we're so deficient inside, we have to keep the ball on the
floor and we were able to do that. They had 7 offensive rebounds in the first
half but only one of them translated into a put back. That was less than a
minute to go in the half.  
Then other thing where we struggled over the last four games, we've been
giving up an average of 19 and a half points in transition and for the game
they only got 7 and so that definitely helps. That will be the story of
tomorrow's game in regards to how many points we can give up or not give up in
transition.  
  
Q. What did this do for your psyche getting back in the left-hand side of
the column?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: It feels good. We were never down on ourselves as a team with
the four straight losses because I mean in three of them we were up. We had
the lead in the second half. At Louisville we were within a MARK one
possession game the whole time so we were never completely down, never
completely out of it. We just kept fighting and working. The tide was going to
turn, the ball was going to bounce our way and get that break. That's what we
did tonight. We had two great practices focusing on defense and really showed
it and it just feels good for the work to pay off.  
  
Q. Does this game, is it an indication you've adjusted now to the loss of
Dominic James both strategically and psychologically?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: That's probably the best question I've had in a long
time. I think it's probably something that you progress through possession by
possession and I agree with Wes MARK not to stand up for one of our players,
but I really don't feel -- I mean this genuinely -- we've lost the last four
games but I don't think it's been because they weren't confident in what we
were doing.  
They were confident. We had won 23 games and were 12 and 2 up until that point
and we do the same thing. It's Groundhog Day every day at practice. They know
what we're doing.  
I think that there is -- the result is the efficiency on both ends and I think
we were much more efficient in our possessions defensively and offensively and
I think that's continued to get better. We weren't getting whipped from start
to finish in any of the previous four games but there were sections of those
games where we weren't efficient on either end, and I think they've continued
to get better each of those games and I think today we were much better
overall from start to finish and so I hope that it continues to trend in that
direction.  
  
Q. What do the players think about that, about adjusting to the loss?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: Like coach said, it's a process and Maurice (Acker) is
playing better every game. Even Jimmy has been playing well every game. We've
got to make sure along with Lazar that we did the same thing that got us the
23 wins that we had. Like Coach said, putting together full, full possessions.
We were never out of any game. We just got to make sure that we play a full 40
minutes and I think that's what we're going to adjust to.  
  
Q. Buzz?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: You want Jerel to talk? When you say players, Wes is
going to talk so you got to say Jerel. He wants to know.  
JEREL McNEAL: Okay. Going off of what Wes said, when you got somebody like
Dominic who is such a vital part to our team as he is, it's hard to replace
but like you said, Mo (Maurice Acker) has been doing a really good job
stepping up, filling the role and he's been getting better each and every day
in practice and with each and every game, just as far as the team standpoint,
you can't make up a loss with somebody that's that important to your team,
just one, two guys stepping up. Everybody got to step up.  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: The one thing I would say -- I'll let Todd, ask a
question. It was partly Dominic in that he started 127 games and 127 games in
prior to his injury, there were built-in decisions that we didn't ever have to
talk about because they're built in. That's not just on offense, that's on
defense.  
And these are our two best players and because of their character, they wanted
to absorb as much of Dominic's loss as they could, and as I've told both of
those guys, I told Wes there the other day, I understand that they want to
absorb it but when they try to become what Dominic was to us, then we lose
what Wes and Jerel is to us. So they've got to go one step towards Dominic but
they can't go nine steps towards Dominic because then we lose who Wes and Rel
are on both ends of the floor.  
When those built-in decisions those decisions now become the responsibility
not just specifically to Mo but they become the responsibility of everybody
and that includes me and that's why ten days -- when Dominic got hurt there
were ten days left in the regular season. From a practice standpoint, all of
us had to figure out from a responsibility perspective how we could shoulder
more because it wasn't Dominic's points, he was field goal percentage. He was
the worst player on our team. He wasn't shooting a lot from the free throw
line but it was what he gave us. He created a lot of opportunities for these
guys to score. His pressure created a lot of opportunities for us in
transition.  
So it's not all just Mo, it's not actually just Jerel or Wes, it's Buzz and
the assistants and everybody. We've continued to get better and we've been
accountable even though our record is 1 and 4.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about transition defense is a big key tomorrow. What do
you see as some other keys with these two teams and talk about Jimmy Butler
and his role on the team since James went down with the injury.  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: Jimmy has been outstanding, absolutely superb. He may be
as smart as Jerel and Wes even though he's a sophomore. We put him in about as
many different positions as we put Wes. His rebounding has continued to change
us on both ends of the floor and, you know, a lot of his points he scores on
offensive rebounds or he gets fouled. So any points he gives us is a bonus but
he's gotten a lot better defensively. He's very intelligent on both sides of
the ball.  
For Villanova to answer that part of the question, we better get back in
transition or they'll score 100 like they did the last time we played them and
if they score 100, that probably means they're going to shoot a very high
percentage which is why they shot 72 percent in the second half.  
In the first half we were up 9 at the 8 minute media time out and we were
guarding them and then it got completely away from us in the second half and
we were out of character offensively but more so we were out of character
defensively. I'm not sure how threes they made. I'm sure you can figure it out
before you write your story. They absolutely whipped us, more so than any
other team in our league.  
  
Q. Jerel, going off kind of what Buzz was saying, obviously Villanova put
that 72 percent shooting on your guys in the second half, especially you
taking such pride in the defense; does that kind of fire you up to go play
them again like when you saw the matchups for the Big East Tournament? Are you
looking forward to the chance to play these guys again?  
JEREL McNEAL: Yeah. I mean it's one of the things we talked about just
throughout the course of the year. Coach called it out. He told me like almost
toward the end of the season we were going to play them in the Big East
Tournament, we get a shot at them. I think not only me but the entire time has
been looking forward to it because, like he said, they put a pretty good
beating on us there at their place, so we're looking forward just to getting
back and compete and come out with a different mindset defensively and come
out, try to impose our will on them defensively and see how everything else
just plays out.  
  
Q. For any of you, Coach and the players, what has it been like to have
Dominic on the bench, what kind of things does he bring, you know, in his
warm-ups that maybe help, bring to the team?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: Go ahead, Wes. It was an open question. We'll let you
answer it.  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I've known "Nic" for a while, for the years I lived with him,
rolled with him on the road. He's changed a lot and grown up a lot over these
four years. If he would have had this injury his freshman or sophomore year, I
don't know if he would have been the same person that he is but he's grown up
and he's pushing for us and for this team so much and it helps out a lot
because he could easily be on the sideline sulking, pouting being mad, but
he's not worried about his situation. He still feels as much a part of this
team as anything and our success is his success. That's how he feels.  
Everything that he sees on the court, he has great vision on the court and off
the court it's even better. He can really see what's going on and he tells us
what he sees and we all trust him, you know, from his standpoint, from that
standpoint and he's bringing a lot, you know, just being a part of it and
keeping his head up and not worrying about his situation, staying in this
moment where we're at right now.  
  
Q. This is for buzz. Are there any coaching in training or physical
preparation differences being that you might play four games in four days?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: Probably. I think ideally you like to have your major
players and then you probably have more alternatives. I'm trying to figure out
who I can sub Rel (Jerel McNeal) for and it was Rob Frozena. Rob did a good
job.  
I don't think he turned it over -- he did a good job. Played four minutes and
zeroes all the way across. With that being said, I think sometimes you know
the question from our guy here, talking about Villanova, the real answer is
this: We better beat St. John's or that's the end of it and so we beat St.
John's and then over the next 24 hours -- I guess it's 21 hours now, we need
to get our guys as best prepared physically and mentally for our next opponent
and whoever it is, I don't know because I don't pay attention but whoever it
is that we would play after Villanova, there's no need to talk about it
because if we don't beat Villanova tomorrow you guys will be asking me why did
you give up so many points in transition, why didn't you block out. Man, they
shot the ball really well, it was a replay of Villanova at Villanova.  
So, let's just make sure that we do it today and I don't mean that in
condescending way but we're not a prophet and we're not smart enough to think
we're going to beat St. John's.  
St. John's won four out of their last six. St. John's played 12 games in the
Garden. This was our first game in the Garden. We're grateful for the win and
we'll get our guys something good to eat and got to figure out how to give
ourselves a chance, not to ensure it, to give ourselves a chance to beat all
those guys at Villanova, Coach of the Year, 6th Man of the Year, Most Improved
Player of the Year, arguably the best guards in our league. They've got 8
major players and all have a distinct role on their team.  
  
Q. Question for Wes. St. John's and this ten point first half, 3-22 from the
floor. It's very different from who we who cover St. John's have seen.  
You took a look at them live and you've also looked at them on tape. In what
ways did St. John's look different to you tonight than they have in all of
those other viewings of them?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I think it was just the fact that we took them out of what
they wanted to do. St. John's, they're a hard playing team and they pride
themselves on their intensity and their work and all that and that's the same
thing we pride ourselves on.  
When they played their hand and we played ours and we were just able to take
them out of what they wanted to do. We were able to out-work them on both ends
of the court and that's the story.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Marquette, thank you.  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: Thank you.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Marquette 74  
St. John's 45

  
COACH NORM ROBERTS: Give Marquette a lot of credit. They played very well. We
played like a tired team. We had some opportunities early, didn't make shots.  
They capitalized on it and then we hung our heads a little bit when we
shouldn't but it's all a maturation process with our guys.  
We know we've got a lot to learn and to get better, they've got veteran guys,
seniors, and they made plays when we didn't.  
I thought we got some good looks early and we didn't capitalize on it. They
took it better.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Coach, how soon did you see possibly the mental fatigue of your team in
the first half, particularly the first six, ten minutes?  
COACH NORM ROBERTS: The score was close, 13-6 or 5 or something like that. We
had some bunnies, had some easy shots inside and they just missed them. We
just missed them and they came down really where they hurt us was on the glass
and usually we hurt other people on the glass and long shots, long rebounds,
they were a little bit quicker to the ball than we were at times and they
scored mainly early on second shots and, you know, that's uncharacteristic of
us but we give them a lot of credit. They really got to the glass and did a
good job.  
  
Q. Norm, you know, I know that even in defeat you have shown a lot of -- you
felt a lot of positive things about the way your guys played, the effort.  
Are we at a point for the St. John's program where effort is not enough yet,
not enough anymore where there has to be some sort of production and results?  
COACH NORM ROBERTS: I think there's been production this year and just like I
told my team, I'm not going to let one game dictate what happened this year.
We've had a decent season. We worked through a lot of things, toughness
things. We worked through a lot of things with injuries. Today was their day.  
They just made shots, shots that Paris Horne and D.J. Kennedy made last night,
they didn't go in today. Those things happen and they took advantage of it but
we've got to learn as a team to be more mature which we will and be able to
deal with those things and fight through it and I thought we tried to but when
things didn't go well for us, you know, they got out to a lead and they've got
some really good players, I mean (Jerel) McNeal, half the shots he makes are
unbelievable with guys right on him, he's falling down, he's making them and
Wesley Matthews played very well for them and (Lazar) Hayward is one of the
better players in the league, so, you know, they made the plays and we didn't
but there's nobody going to tell me that things aren't bright, things aren't
bright and we're moving totally in the right direction. I love my guys, I love
the attitudes they have. I love how hard they try.  
  
Q. Going into the off-season now to work for next season, will you be taking
what you did yesterday, which was a lot of good things and throughout today's
game, will you want to accentuate what happened yesterday?  
COACH NORM ROBERTS: We learn from every experience. Do I dwell on the
negative? I don't have time to do that. That's not my job to dwell on that. We
move on. Just like when we do good things, we move on, too. We don't dwell on
that, either.  
So I think our guys know they've got the taste of playing in the tournament,
gotten a taste of playing against high level people and doing well and we got
to learn from that. That's what Jerel McNeal did, that's that Wesley Matthews
did.  
It's a process and that's what Paris Horne will do, that's what D.J. Kennedy
will do. We'll get to the off-season, little bit of time off and then get in
the off-season and get after it and get better.  
I said that now people know that D.J. Kennedy and Paris Horne are good players
so they're going to guard you. Now you got to develop your games. You got to
make your games even better. You got to get stronger in the weight room, all
that stuff. All our guys know that. They'll work hard.  
  
Q. Norm, just from talking to some of your guys including Paris and D.J. in
the locker room, things they said were, you know, to explain the first half,
were not mentally ready or maybe a little bit of fatigue.  
In your mind, why do you think the first half went the way it did and did you
have any idea it might be going that way from what you saw before the game?  
COACH NORM ROBERTS: No. I think we missed shots. We missed shots early and we
kind of got down and then when you're playing against a veteran team, you
know, it's similar to the situation we played DePaul earlier in the year and
when we were at DePaul they weren't making shots early and we were and I kept
saying to our guys we got to get them right now because they're not mentally
in it. We're going to have a chance to get them.  
Okay. That happened to us tonight. We didn't make shots. We kind of got down
and they took advantage of it and, you know, we had a couple of plays there
that we needed to make and we didn't make them and they did and sometimes it
goes that way. You hate for that to happen but it goes that way.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. What's going through your guy's minds early in the game when you're
having so much trouble getting shots to fall and especially knowing that that
could be the way that your season ends?  
D.J. KENNEDY: I mean we had a few games this season where we wasn't making
shots early. I mean as -- we started off like that a few games. We just kept
trying to fight through it like we thought eventually we'll make shots because
we work hard and shoot a lot in the gym everyday.  
So, being a shooter and a player you can't keep working on the negative.
Hopefully they will drop. They weren't dropping today the shots we took so it
was just -- got to give Marquette, a lot of credit. Veteran team. They walk
away with a W today.  
  
Q. Both of the players, guys struggled this year but I know you're less than
an hour away from the game being over.  
Have you thought about how much potential you guys could have next year, all
you guys are coming back, getting (Anthony) Mason back next year, maybe a
certain high school player, we'll see, but have you thought about that for
next year?  
PARIS HORNE: Yeah, just a little bit. This program is up and coming and we got
a lot of talent coming back and we're going to take this loss and go back and
work hard and get better.  
D.J. KENNEDY: We felt before the season started we felt we were great players.
A lot of people didn't realize how much talent we had on this team. Throughout
the season a lot of teams realize we have a lot of great young players on this
team and we was able to show them. Next year they'll be ready for us. We've
got to develop new things for our game and come back next year stronger.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Anything else? St. John's, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2009

  

### [Bobby Gonzalez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18121)

### [Jeremy Hazell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19394)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Syracuse 89  
Seton Hall 74

  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: Just start with an opening statement. Our kids battled.
We gave everything we had. You know, I'm proud of them. You know, there was
some stretches in the game where the game got away from us. Syracuse is just a
really, really talented team. They can hurt you a lot of ways. This shoot 3s,
they can go inside. Their murder in transition and Jonny Flynn is almost
unguardable.  
Paul Gause is about as good of a defender as you can get and we just didn't
have any answers for Jonny Flynn. He got 15 in the first half.  
Big key I thought in the game was when the things got emotional, it hurt us
more than it hurt them because they can absorb a couple technicals or a guy
getting in foul trouble. We can't. John Garcia had four fouls with 16 minutes
to go. That really hurt us. I think it was a two-point game at the time or
something like that, so that hurt us and then they got hot and made shots.  
When they make shots they're a very, very, very good team. They're up there
with the top four teams in this conference, in my opinion.  
  
Q. Bobby, considering they like to run so much, was it a tough matchup
considering you guys having played and they were fresh?  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: When you play a team like Syracuse to get ready for
their -- for their transition offense where they lead the league in scoring at
80 points a game you got to be rested, you got to have your time to work on
your transition D. You got to have time to attack their zone. We literally
didn't have barely anytime on getting ready for the zone because their length
kind of shocks you. It's just a tough situation when -- it's not excusable
when you play a game and play a team like Syracuse the next night when they
haven't played. They're the kind of team you need some time to get ready for.
You just don't have it in a tournament situation. That's why they're so good.  
  
Q. Bobby, after the double technicals right there, I think they went on 18-3
run, something like that. Why did they all of a sudden just capitalize off
that?  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: Like I just said, one of the reasons was John Garcia got
four fouls and out of the game. Without him inside, that's pretty much it for
us and then I think they got momentum because they got the two shots, they got
the ball, they -- they hit a three out of the timeout. They spurted and it
hurt us, you know. You know, they capitalized on that run and, you know, we --
we didn't have a -- we didn't have a lot of things going for us and they had a
lot of things clicking. Devendorf got hot, Jonny Flynn spectacular. Onuaku is
a tough matchup inside.  
  
Q. Bobby, talk about your chances for NIT bid. I know you think you should
get one.  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: I do. I guess a lot of it is going to come down to
Selection Sunday as far as how many teams does the NCAA take from the Big East
into the NCAA.  
You know, I hope they take at least eight. I think Providence deserves to get
in. I know I'm not an expert. There's 18 million people out there talking
about it but I'd like to see the 7 teams everybody has been talking about all
year and Providence. If not, more than that but it sounds like Providence
should get in. If they take 8 teams in the NCAA, maybe they'll take two, three
in the NIT. They start taking two, three teams in the NIT, they got to start
talking about Seton Hall because we beat Cincinnati, we beat Georgetown. Of
course Notre Dame is going to be probably in the NIT.  
If not, I mean maybe go to the NCAA. I don't know. But so I think that we
deserve it. We won 17 games. We weren't expected to do that this year. We won
8 league games this year in this league this year. Then we had two great out-
of-conference victories, Virginia Tech and USC. We're a tough team that plays
hard and I think we give everybody a run. And, you know, I hope that we make
it. I'd like to continue to coach this team.  
  
Q. Bobby, if this was his last game, could you comment on Paul and he
finished four steals behind the record.  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: It's another reason I want to extend the season, I would
like to give him a chance at the record. I want to see if we can get to 18, 19
wins. It's the kind of -- Paul Gause was hard in the end because I didn't want
to say to him, Paul, this is your last game. So I tried to act like it was not
really his last game. I just said, go out there and play hard until the end,
you know, we're going to play a game in post-season. You're going to play
again, you know. It was tough because he's giving me everything he had. I
didn't want him to go out this way, even though we battled. I was glad we got
it down to 15. You know, I think everybody that saw the game tonight knows we
gave them a fight. So Paul Gause had a lot to do with that.  
  
Q. Paul, is that why you didn't want to come out of the game at the end?  
PAUL GAUSE: Actually I came out when the coach told me to go back in. I was
kind of tired.  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: He wanted to take himself out.  
PAUL GAUSE: He told me to stay in and finish it out. I stayed in and finished
it out to try to help my team as much as possible.  
  
Q. Looks like were you still trying for steals there.  
PAUL GAUSE: The refs said don't reach. I said I was trying to get the steals
record.  
  
Q. Paul, what happened from your vantage point? What happened with that
whole double-technical fracas right there. Could you see --  
PAUL GAUSE: It's just a real physical game. Guys battling. It was back and
forth, they go up by two, we go up by two, an emotional game. We know their
players, they know us. There's no bad blood between us at all. After the game
we all shook hands and said, good luck and fair well. Wasn't nothing. It's who
responded and they responded a little bit better than we did.  
  
Q. Jeremy, was their length -- Coach talked about their length; was that a
tough thing as far as getting open shots just how long they are in that
zone?  
JEREMY HAZELL: Yeah. Especially Syracuse, they played a 3-2, the best in the
whole country. Their wings get out and the guards down low shaded me, made it
tough for me to get shots. They just pressured the ball and they had just a
great game today. They hit a lot of 3s. They made it tough for us inside and
outside. I just give it up to Syracuse. They was a hell of a team. They
deserved to win that game.  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: I wanted to point out something. We took care of the
basketball all year. We were second in the conference in turnovers. We had 18
turnovers tonight and again that's the length of their zone. We showed an
efforts stat with 18 offensive rebounds and the fact that we beat them on the
boards by four.  
We don't beat many teams on the boards by four. It shows how hard we played.
We couldn't make shots. We were 9 for 28, you know, we didn't get to the line
much, 7 for 14, 50 percent. You know, our legs a little bit, I think most of
the teams have played a game yesterday, I don't think anyone won today that
played yesterday. The higher seeds all won and they all looked more rested.
It's not an excuse. They earned it. During the regular season, they earned it.  
  
Q. Paul, Coach mentioned when John went out with his fourth foul, it sort of
the changed the way things were going. Did you guys feel that way once he had
to come out, that -- because were you feeding him pretty consistently to get
back in the game.  
PAUL GAUSE: Yeah. John, he's a tough guy down low. You can really rely on him.
I think it's kinds of unfair to put our younger guys in that position in such
a stretch of the game like that where John, he has good hands. He finishes
around the basket well. You know, our bigs came in and did as much as they
could. It's tough to put them in that situation. We definitely missed John.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Any other questions for Seton Hall? Thank you.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Providence  83  
DePaul - 74

  
COACH KENO DAVIS: I think overall, you know, what you saw today is why I've
been so proud of this team. I'm not disappointed that we weren't able to win
any easier than that. I'm very proud that we were able to battle through and
find a way to win. It's kind of been the story of us all year, isn't it, those
games we found a way, even when we haven't played our best basketball, we've
been able to dig down and find another level, whether it's rebounding, whether
it's running the court, whether it's our pressure, found a way to win games.  
And so a lot of people remember our wins, you know, last second win against,
you know, URI or a win against Pittsburgh, the number one team, or Syracuse,
they'll remember those big-name games for us, but it's really these kind of
games that have set us apart from the other teams in that we've been able to
go through the Big East season and get a winning record, it's because of games
like this.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Did it take you 32 minutes to get your offense going?  
COACH KENO DAVIS: Well, I think first and foremost I have to credit DePaul. I
think people outside the Big East that haven't seen them play. They see the
record, you know, for the overall season and they think that's not a very good
team, but, you know, I talked to several people that I know, NBA scouts and
other friends that got to see them play yesterday. They said, how is that
possible, you know, with their record. But that's the Big East for you. That's
when there's not many days off and there's finding a top 25 team each and
every night just about, and you get a couple injuries and young people and
that's what DePaul is up against. They've got some great young players that
are playing by far their best basketball and, you know, they did some things
to disrupt us. They knocked down some shots. They controlled the tempo. I
think for that part of the game, I think you got to give them the credit.  
  
Q. Do you think they got tired, do you think DePaul kind of hit a wall in
the last several minutes?  
COACH KENO DAVIS: I was expecting them to get tired before that, you know,
playing the day before and playing a lot of guys 40 minutes. But I think their
adrenaline kept them going that long. And we were trying to use more pressure
defense than we have in a long time even though we haven't practiced it a
whole lot, because we felt playing DePaul that was -- you know, a way for us
to win the game. We stayed with them even though they knocked down some
jumpers and made it look not so good there in stretches, but to be able to try
to wear them down, get them in foul trouble is what we talked about before the
game and stayed with that plan even when it wasn't going our way.  
  
Q. Did you expect them to shoot the 3 ball that well from beyond?  
COACH KENO DAVIS: You know, I think we knew who on their team were capable,
you know, shooters, guys that could have a hot hand, and those are the guys
you want to make sure you take away. I would have to kind of look back at it,
sometimes you have a feeling after the game of how you played on shooters and
you go back and you watch the tape and you realize that they made really tough
shots or you go back and look and say, well, our defense wasn't very good, we
gave them open shots.  
I'm really not sure until I go back and look at it, but I know they're
capable. I knew they were improving as a team. Sometimes you just don't see it
with the quality of schedule you face each and every night.  
  
Q. Keno, how would you assess the team's chances to this point; do you feel
you've done enough or do you feel you need win this game tomorrow?  
COACH KENO DAVIS: I think we've done enough that we're going to be considered
strongly. I think we're squarely on the bubble and so I know that playing
Louisville tomorrow, win or lose, you know, I don't think it hurts us if we
lose.  
I think that, you know, there's not going to be many people that are going to
expect us to beat the team that won the Big East, and I think in my mind are
definitely deserving of a number one seed in the overall tournament regardless
of what they do down here.  
We're up against it, playing, you know, back-to-back days but if I learned
anything from this team, is you don't ever count this team out.  
  
Q. Keno, can you talk about the full court trap you guys used at various
points during the game?  
COACH KENO DAVIS: Yeah. We felt yesterday when we were watching, scouting the
Cincinnati/DePaul game that Cincinnati had bothered DePaul with some of their
pressure and playing back-to-back days that we wanted to try to give them a
good shot of our full court pressure, and our three-quarter court pressure
and, you know, when we were behind and we weren't getting the momentum. I just
felt like if we would stay with them there, would be a run where we would get
three, four steals in a row and be able to maybe pull away, pull away. We made
that run in the first half, with our pressure defense. It didn't give us any
cushion and then DePaul came down and knocked some big shots out of the
pressure, out of transition and in the half court to kind of keep us at arm's
length.  
  
Q. Keno, do you still think having all 16 teams is a good idea?  
COACH KENO DAVIS: I don't think there's any doubt it's a great idea. Had
DePaul beat us, I wouldn't have thought so much. In my mind, the NCAA
tournament field, when people talk about extending that field, well, that's
your conference tournament is really start it for some team. It started for
DePaul. They get a chance to play in this. If not, you know, last two, three
weeks of the season they don't get to experience, you know, Madison Square
Garden, experience the Big East tournament, and guess what we got to see
yesterday, a great upset. Come in there and win a game and almost win two.
It's not going to surprise me -- everybody said it wouldn't happen, nobody
would win four games and then Syracuse did and you know some day it might be
awhile but some day there's going to be a run where a team comes from that
first day, and makes a run all the way to the tournament and you know, I think
that will answer a lot of critics.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about that first meeting with Louisville and what you
see, you know, the second half of that first meeting kind of where it got away
from you; what do you see doing different?  
COACH KENO DAVIS: I think it shows when we came in at halftime and we were up
one at their place, it shows that we can play with anybody in the country. It
also showed when we shot 75 percent that we had to play about perfect to beat
them at their place.  
But we met with the team after a tough loss at Villanova the last game of the
year and said, you know, we're done with playing on the road.  
Now, we get neutral games and we've got an opportunity, we can play with
anybody in this league. It might take our best game to beat them but I know
our guys are going to be striving to play that best game and as long as the
effort is the way it was there in the last, you know, 10, 15 minutes of the
game today, you know, I'll be pretty proud as a coach.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Any questions for the players, please? Kevin.  
  
Q. Weyimni, can you talk about the early start, can you point to anything
that you guys obviously didn't play as well awe wanted to in the first half?  
Are you a morning person?  
WEYINMI EFEJUKU: I'm an anytime person. I think it's like what coach said,
they came out and played great defense on us. We missed some shots we wanted
to make. They made a bunch of shots and just got going.  
  
Q. Just talk about deepening the 3-point line. Obviously, they shot -- I
don't know how many they shot.  
COACH KENO DAVIS: (They shot from 3) 13-31.  
WEYINMI EFEJUKU: I thought we were contesting the shots, but they just went on
a run. They started hitting some tough shots, Tucker and Walker and both hit a
bunch of tough shots and they had the big kid come in and hit a couple and
just executed their offense.  
  
Q. Sharaud, how did you guys regroup after you were down, after the
technical foul, how did you regroup to come back and overcome a deficit?  
SHARAD CURRY: We came together. We knew DePaul was playing great and, you
know, we just tried to keep fighting and you know keep working hard. We were
chipping away and once they got the technical foul, you know, I think that
kind of fired us up a little bit and seeing Keno fight for us, you know, he
does a great job of doing that, at the right time and I think, you know, that
inspired us to go out and play even harder.  
  
Q. This is for any of the players. Was the mindset different coming into the
game today; coming to New York in the past hasn't been too successful?  
JEFF XAVIER: Me personally? Not at all. I wasn't thinking about anything in
the past, what we did the past four years with these guys at Madison Square
Garden. I just came in with the mindset of who we're playing. We found out
yesterday we were playing DePaul. I had the mindset we're coming in and show
them what we're about. Come with the victory. None of these three guys were
thinking about what we did in the past. We were thinking about what we could
do today.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Any other questions, please? Providence, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

West Virginia 74  
Notre Dame 62

  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions, please. Questions for West Virginia?  
  
Q. Bobby, do you feel like you guys were taking things away from Notre Dame
in the first half or with a combo of them, missing shots?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: I thought we did a pretty good job defensively. I think the
whole tone of the thing was we were very aggressive the first half. We were
very aggressively defensively and trying to rebound the ball and then in the
second half, we got native and they became the aggressor.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Alex's performance tonight after not scoring
against Louisville?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: He threw three out of bounds in the second half. He waited
four, five possessions before he threw the next one out of bounds. He makes a
great cut and the 3 point play I think when they're starting to really get --
make the thing interesting and, you know, that's a strong shot and these two
guys have been just -- they've been terrific for us all year.  
You try to make some adjustments and it's hard to do it when they're not on
the floor because they know what's happening and they know what I want done
and they do a great job of coaching our younger guys through it.  
  
Q. Alex, your last game going scoreless, how much did you think about that
between that last game ending and tonight?  
ALEX RUOFF: You know, the advice I got from my coach was put it behind me. It
happens. Of course, it hurt me because I care a lot about winning and our
team, but that's one thing you have to put behind you so I wasn't trying to
think too much about it, just come in tonight.  
  
Q. Alex, the first half you guys really seemed to kind of be able to get to
the middle. Was that something you saw before the game; is that something you
recognized?  
ALEX RUOFF: It's the 1-2-2 zone, put the perimeter shooters out and kind of
spread the shooters. We knew the foul line was going to be open and we did a
good job of taking advantage of it.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Are there any other questions for West Virginia?  
  
Q. Da'Sean, did you talk with "Truck" (Darryl Bryant) performance tonight.
Seems like --  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: He stayed in the game a lot longer as far as the past games
because he was doing a lot of things right today and he was -- yeah, he scored
very well. He just did all the things, basic, correctly and stayed good.
That's all I can say.  
  
Q. In the second half of the game, Notre Dame really sort of pulled within
7, 8 points. What did you guys say in the huddle, during any timeouts to
really get yourself going and close out the game?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: That's why I keep the cameras out of there (laughter. ) No.
I think we needed to stop. I think that's what we said. We were -- we had kind
of slowed them down and I think they had an out of bounds with whatever it
was, ten seconds to go or whatever and I said we just need to stop and we went
down and got a stop there and then we got a pretty good look at the other end.
In fact it was a two-footer that didn't go in but, you know, I think it was --
at that time, they were -- they were kind of on a roll in terms of scoring the
ball so I thought that was a critical stop for us.  
  
Q. You guys got Pitt up next. You guys lost to them twice this season. What
do you guys have to do differently to beat them this third time?  
ALEX RUOFF: We got to man-up. They're a physical team. We got a lot of foul
trouble at their place and kind of opened the game up. We got to match their
physical play. We made a few mistakes down the stretch. That opened up the
game at our place. Limit our mental mistakes and match their physical play.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Do we have any other questions?  
  
Q. Coach, people look at the box score of this game and see it was a great
game by Alex and Da'Sean. Wasn't this game actually more about defense, you
guys played than the shots that your guys were making on offense?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: I think it certainly was in the first half and then I
thought we made -- we made critical stops in the second half. You know,
they're good. You're talking about a team that was, I think, in the top 10 in
the country early in the year. They're talented. And they shot it well today.  
When they make perimeter shots it's so hard because they spread you so much
and Luke is so good down there as we talked about all year, we're so small in
there that it's hard for us to guard somebody big and strong like him, you
know, in a 1-on-1 basis. We're pretty good when we help. They spread you so
much because they have so many guys that make shots.  
  
Q. Did they not make a conscious effort to get him the ball in the post like
they did in the second half or was it the pressure you guys were putting out
front, they couldn't enter it?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: You have to ask Mike that. I don't know. I have a hard
enough time coaching these guys.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Anything else, please? West Virginia, thank you.

### [Luke Harangody](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16984)

### [Tory Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17106)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

West Virginia 74  
Notre Dame 62

  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Coach Mike Brey.  
COACH MIKE BREY: Well, I mean first of all, they really shot it well. You
know, you're worried a little bit. They go 3 for 11 in the Louisville game.
Bryant really hurt us out there early. We didn't expect him shooting jump
shots like that really got them started.  
But at the end of the day the offensive board just killed us and it hurt us in
Morgantown. We couldn't keep them off the offensive board. They only shoot 30
some percent and you score 74 points, but the backboard has been an issue with
us at different times.  
It's been an issue with us and with them both times and, you know, I thought
they were in a great rhythm. They defended us well, too. You don't beat -- to
beat West Virginia you're going to have to score in the 70s and 80s to beat
them.  
In the first half it was hard, hard to get entries with their -- their length
bothers you on the backboard and it bothers you in passing lanes.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: We've been joined by Tory Jackson and Luke Harangody.  
  
Q. Mike, the start, how tough is that when you're dropped in such a big hole
so early?  
COACH MIKE BREY: It's tough to dig out. I'm very proud of our group. We made
it, I told them at halftime you're not throwing -- fellas, we're going to make
it interesting. The climate is going to change a little bit and the crowd will
get in it.  
We'll have some offensive success. We did but every time. I think we got it to
single digits and you wanted to get over the next hump, usually an offensive
rebound cost you but when you're digging out of a hole like that, it's
exhausting and it's very, very hard with a real good team like West Virginia.  
  
Q. Mike, it seems like you were stuck in zone for awhile. Did you think
about pulling out earlier?  
COACH MIKE BREY: I mean sometimes you try and ride out some of those 3-point
shots early. We got out of it -- we got out of it pretty quick if my memory
serves me right, but in all honesty, they were in a better rhythm shooting 3s
when we were in man the first couple possessions. They continued to knock them
down even when we went in man. (Alex) Ruoff got into the act. (Darryl) Bryant
was a guy who we wanted to play off of a little bit and maybe be able to help
and he made us pay. I give him credit. He made big shots to start them.  
  
Q. Tory, can you talk a little bit about the difficulties you guys had
offensively in the first half?  
TORY JACKSON: They did a good job of getting up under us early. They came in
-- their offense, it was clicking and they kind of just fed off of that on the
defensive end. They took us out of our offensive zone but we did a great job
in the second half. It's just sticking it out and fighting and making a run.  
  
Q. Luke, you had a big second half as opposed to your first half where you
seemed kind of quiet. What was the biggest difference for you?  
LUKE HARANGODY: I think the second half hit a couple shots, got a little bit
of rhythm, established myself better in the post than I did in the first half.  
  
Q. Coach, what does -- the people the past couple years say nobody wins it
after playing five days. What does it mean now that a team has to work even
harder to try to maybe get to that championship game with five days?  
COACH MIKE BREY: Well, yeah. I mean we're fatigued playing two nights in a row
and then especially having to play like we did in the second half digging out
of a hole. It's hard for me to imagine playing five nights, quite frankly
physically, you know, cranking it back up.  
It just seems really, really difficulty. We never talked about trying to play
five nights. We talked about trying to get on a little run and making it
interesting and we were fortunate enough to win the first one last night, but
it's draining when you have to turnaround.  
I think when you play three in a row -- we played three in a row in Maui. Most
of the other exempt tournaments have a day off. We played three in a row in
Maui. By the time we got to the Carolina game because our Texas game was so
physical -- he kind of had pneumonia and we were dying. So, I know what three
in a row does, so, five, that's tough.  
  
Q. The two players and then Mike. So much was expected out of you guys. You
guys expected so much out of yourselves. Is there a sense looking back on it
all that disappointment, frustration?  
TORY JACKSON: I'm not disappointed at all. We still get a chance to play so
the season didn't go our way maybe but things happen. This is college
basketball. I'm not disappointed at all. I love all of my teammates and the
coaches so just to have the opportunity to continue to play is good for me.  
  
Q. Luke?  
LUKE HARANGODY: The same thing Tory said. This season maybe didn't go as we
expected it at the beginning. We never gave up. We went on a 7-game losing
streak at one point. We could have just laid down. We kept fighting and as
Tory said, we stayed together as a group because we're such a tight-knit team.
I'm not disappointed at all. I love my teammates.  
COACH MIKE BREY: I think it's disappointing we won't play in the NCAA
Tournament. That's what we expected. I don't know with all the -- some of the
preseason stuff had some real interesting predictions for us. I don't know
quite frankly if I believed in all of those and you've seen us play in the
best Big East and, you know, where we're at. I really thought we were a
9-and-9 team in the regular season before the season started.  
I told my staff if we can pull off 9-and-9 giving who we were going to repeat
and who we were going to have to play, playing the A schedule, we got 8-and-10
and could never quite get the next quality win. We get to the edge of it and
would never really get it.  
We'll be honored to play in post-season. We'll get a chance to do that. I
talked to them about 97 teams out of 340 get to play in the post-season and,
you know, we'll find out Sunday hopefully that we'll be playing somewhere and,
you know, we'll be honored to do it. But, yeah, the other thing, we got kids
here now that have played in two NCAA tournaments. I don't want them taking
that for granted. We're on the longest post-season run with our program than
we've ever had with ten in a row. Certainly you like them to be all NCAAs but
we're kind of 5-and-5.  
This is where we're at. We talked about getting rest and then finding out the
next challenge and this group get to go play some more basketball and maybe
getting back to New York City in the Garden.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Any other questions for Notre Dame? Thank you.  
COACH MIKE BREY: Thanks.

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Jonny Flynn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19433)

### [Arinze Onuaku](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18096)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Syracuse 89  
Seton Hall 74

  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Yeah. You know, Seton Hall is a difficult team to play
against. They come at you hard. They were very patient. They got back in the
zone. We didn't hit some shots early. The second half we were better, moving
the ball. We moved the ball better. Jonny did a great job of finding people.
Kristof did a tremendous job in the middle of the zone. We don't see that much
zone. We do see it in practice every day so we should be playing against it
but we got it out to Eric and Andy and did a good job there.  
It's always a difficult game to play this first one down here and we're glad
we played well the last 10, 15 minutes of the game.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions, please.  
  
Q. After the two altercations that happened, what was in the huddle, what
was being discussed?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: We just wanted to play basketball. It wasn't that big of a
deal. Just put that behind you and just concentrate on playing basketball and,
you know, offensively we need to get some good shots. We weren't getting them,
some of the shots that we needed to get and Jonny hit Eric open right way and
Eric again and Andy and got a little breathing space and we did a better job
defensively on the boards the second half. The first half we didn't do a good
job on the board.  
  
Q. Coach, you had 30 assists in the game, tied a Big East record. Can you
talk about your team's unselfishness?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: I told Kristof he got his career high. He might have got
more assists than he got all year. He was open in the middle of the zone. He
found the big guys down low and found the shooters on the wings. Jonny is
every game there looking to pass and find people and he's done that all year
long, you know, second in the league in assists and he's been looking for
people trying to get people involved all year long.  
  
Q. Coach, you made a little adjustment playing a little small ball, taking
some of the big guys out.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: It helps a defense a little more. We cover better on the
wings. We didn't cover the first two shots of the second half. We covered
those areas better with a smaller lineup and we have Andy and Eric in there
when they play zone, guys to shoot from the wings. Jonny can get in the lane
and find those guys. If they spread out, then we got the guy down low. The
small lineup is our best offensive team but we also cover better out of it.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just comment on Paul's play tonight?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: He struggled and got back and did some good things. He got
a couple great rebounds and put the Paul on the floor. He's got to get it back
out, but, no, he's fine. He'll be fine. He's playing good at the end of the
year. We'll need him against the physical team that we play tomorrow night.  
  
Q. You had Andy and Kristof come in less than two minutes after the opening
tip. What was your mindset there?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: I didn't like the way we started the game. Just thought we
need some change and again they're going to play zone, we're going to get Andy
in the game, to get smaller, to get the extra shooter in the game. It really
has no reflection about how anybody is playing out there, it's just a matter
of not feeling the game is going right and sometimes those things work,
sometimes they don't.  
  
Q. Jonny and Arinze, playing UCONN tomorrow with the rivalry and the Garden
crowd going for either team; what do you guys anticipate?  
JONNY FLYNN: We just wanted to get past this first game. We came out a little
flat and struggled shooting a little bit but picked it up in the second half.
It's always good to go against a rivalry like UCONN. They put it to us in
Connecticut this year. It's great to get a chance to get back at them and beat
them.  
  
Q. Jon, after the intentional foul and the double technicals, you guys shot
right off. Did that motivate you in any way?  
JONNY FLYNN: I think so. Altercations like that always brings a team together.
When you can get a team together and get a team fired up on one goal and with
one strong mindset that can always help us out. I think the two altercations
we got in really pushed the button for our team to go out there and be
aggressive and really stay focused in the game and put it to Seton Hall.  
  
Q. Jonny, you guys had your lowest point total of the year against UCONN;
what are you going to do different?  
JONNY FLYNN: We can't let them dominate us, the big guy. He really basically
dominated the game and controlled the game from a defensive standpoint. I
think we just have to go in there stronger, look to get it down low to Arinze,
looking for kick outs. Really go at the mindset we're not going to let this
guy control the game from a defensive standpoint.  
  
Q. Jonny, after the double technicals, Eric had 16 of his 19 points. Did you
guys feel him feeding off the positive or negative energy in the building?  
JONNY FLYNN: That's the kind of player Eric is. He's an emotional player and
we knew we can ride on his back for the last such and such minutes of the game
and, you know, he really carried us.  
Eric is a great player, great shooter and he feeds off emotion and he really
took us.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Last question right here.  
  
Q. Arinze, in the second half there's about three, four straight possessions
where you got fed the ball and put it down and scored.  
Was there anything different going on that really caused that to happen all of
a sudden?  
ARINZE ONUAKU: We were going to flat screen. I just tried to get in open spots
and finish them. Jonny is going to penetrate. I shot it in the right spot with
the defense around the basket.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Syracuse, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2009

  

### [Dar Tucker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19358)

### [Jerry Wainwright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16943)

### [Will Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19359)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
DePaul - 67  
Cincinnati - 57  
  
JOHN PAQUETTE: We have Dar Tucker, Will Walker and Coach Jerry Wainwright.  
COACH JERRY WAINWRIGHT: Okay. Just little bit -- couple guys on our staff is
under the weather and I'm one of them. But first of all, I thought Cincinnati
did a great job this year. They're a great story. Coach Cronin has got some
really good players and is well on his way to getting them back into the upper
division of the Big East.  
We're -- had a great game at our place and we obviously are excited beyond
reason to -- for what we did today, but in due respect to Cincinnati, we know
and hopefully they're headed for post-season play and will represent our
league the right way.  
I also have to say this: That I know there's been a lot of discussion, pro and
con, and there's a lot of good points to be made. I'm just speaking as a guy
that's coached kids for the last four years.  
For the last four years this is our second trip to Madison Square Garden. It's
our first Big East tournament win. There's a lot to be said -- I know there's
a lot of other factors, financial and everything else, but to have kids go
through an 18-game conference schedule as tough as ours is and not have the
reward of coming to New York, I think is kind of -- it's what college
basketball should be about and I know there were logistic problems. We didn't
do it on purpose.  
Hopefully we proved there is a lot of value in bringing everybody. We've had a
tough, long season. We've kept our heads, lot of young guys and I can't tell
you how much this experience will help them next year.  
So even though it's a little bit of the Big East, hopefully, our young players
who had the opportunity to come to this tournament will be energized by their
experience and be able to represent our conference at a high level next year.  
So, with that said, obviously, I'm really proud of our kids and how they
approached the game and it's been a long time without a win and it's nice to
get a little bit of sugar.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions, please?  
  
Q. How difficult was it throughout the year, game after game not winning
one?  
COACH JERRY WAINWRIGHT: It was -- it was difficult. I've said this, of course,
I've said this -- I made a mistake. We're too young and we lost our senior
guard. I didn't bring in a junior college player or two and, you know, I'm not
looking back on that, but it made us really young after that injury and we've
had a lot of close calls.  
The only thing I can tell all of you is this: The kids that are in our program
really have never had a bad day of practice. It's been a little bit
frustrating and you run the gauntlet this year.  
It's a bad year to be young in this league and a lot of our teams have faced
it but they've all -- all the kids have improved. We've had good practices but
certainly, you know, you walk around with a cloud. They know their record and
it's been tough for them but they've done a great job in the classroom,
they've done a great job on the streets of Chicago.  
I couldn't be prouder of them. It's nice to have a little success. Certainly
keeps them going. Instead of getting a bone, maybe a little bit of steak meat
on that bone and makes them believe how hard they're working.  
  
Q. Dar and Will, how did you guys feel at the end?  
DAR TUCKER: I feel good. You know, as far as -- for us to get a win, it's been
so long, just to get a win, been kind of frustrating like coach said but we
pulled it out and after all that we've been doing in practice and the hard
work and it does pay off.  
WILL WALKER: It feels real good because we've been working real hard and also
help us for next year so let the guys know we can get victories when we work
hard. As long as we keep up with the hard work and practice it will pay off in
the long run. Hopefully we can keep working and pushing forward.  
  
Q. Jerry, did you sense that the team thought they could win today or would
win today?  
COACH JERRY WAINWRIGHT: You know, we've been -- offense has dictated our
momentum all year. We've really not been a real good offensive team but there
-- I just told them, I forget exactly -- right before the 8-minute mark, Dar
asked out, one of our guys asked out.  
I think we went from down 7 to tie before there was a timeout and I believe at
that point in time -- that was really a time where they faced fatigue and
again, you know, that's not coaching.  
We've all had to do that at some point in our life, you've got to find a
second wind, figure out a way to do it. That's the first time this year or in
a long time this year where we did it collectively. When we had the TV timeout
at 8, I thought we would win the game because they thought they would win it.
We obviously did some amazing things, behind the back, 2 on 1 pass.  
You know, I'm more amazed by what happens the older I get, but then the kid
came back and made a really nice bounce pass at the end of the shot clock.
That's kind of what age teaches.  
We've all been through those things in our own levels. I thought the kids
really hung together and we had to Ironman it a little bit. Probably helped us
that Dar was in foul trouble in the first half and we stayed close and he was
rested. Will, I think went wire to wire. Jeremiah went wire to wire and Mac
went wire to wire. We probably got a break, I know it sounds stupid, but to
have him in foul trouble.  
He was sitting next to me. He really had a good second half and one last
thing, one of the key components of a team hanging together is a guy like Will
Walker. Will Walker played on a 20-win team that went to the NIT quarterfinals
when he was a freshman and he's, I think, kind of maintained our belief. We
only have one junior in our program and he's it. He's been a really quiet
leader. Been playing his best basketball the last six weeks. I think he had a
real sense of we could do in this tournament and I'm sure he passed it on to
the other guys.  
  
Q. Jerry, can you talk about regrouping in time for tomorrow considering you
did play those guys 40 minutes today?  
COACH JERRY WAINWRIGHT: I know our guys will tell you, we practiced at 9:30
every morning. We're really getting done at noon to go to class so in some
ways getting you will -- we were in pretty good mental condition this morning.  
We have a big test -- we're going to have to find a couple other guys to play,
there's no question and I do believe that when you get to taste something good
you'll find another breath. We won't be able to do anything on the court.
We'll just look at tape.  
Providence was our second game a long time ago. They've changed, Coach Davis
has done a great job with his team. In all honesty, over last few games all
we've done is concentrate on ourselves and guys have done a pretty good job.  
  
Q. Was there a panic or concern about going down as one of those teams take
didn't win a game in the conference? Were you guys worried about ending your
season and sort of being on that list of teams forever?  
DAR TUCKER: When we was in the locker room we just said we're going to have
fun, we ain't going to worry about what happened. This is a new season, Big
East tournament. That's what we thought about. Brand new start for us. That's
what we thought. That's how we was going to come out and play as far as the
game.  
  
Q. Just wondering, you were down 7 early in the second half; how did you
keep -- after all the games you lost, how did you get what you did?  
DAR TUCKER: Just keep doing what we're doing. We already had momentum. It was
just fatigue, we were a little bit tired. After the timeout we got a little
bit rested. I think we caught our second breath. We kept pushing, kept
working, doing what we do best.  
  
Q. Did you get any sense when you started to come back that they started to
panic a little bit?  
DAR TUCKER: Yeah, a little bit. When we got down by like two, they started to
foul us a little bit and really relaxing because most of the time they was
focusing on Will and hopefully that's when I came in and tried to do what I do
and that was good.  
COACH JERRY WAINWRIGHT: The biggest difference in the game for us, and I think
we had a fourth guy in double figures, we've had three guys do the majority of
our scoring and Matija Poscic had a couple baskets early. Jeremiah Kelly hit a
couple of big 3s to keep us in it. When we got the fourth guy with double
figures, it made a difference. Their box score, you know, they got a lot of 6s
and 4s. And Deonta Vaughn is obviously a terrific player.  
We had that happen to us -- Will has had games where he had 30, 31 but we
haven't had the balance and to win in this league you have to -- you're fourth
and fifth guys got to get points. Hopefully that will give some of those guys
confidence for the rest of their careers.  
  
Q. How much were you guys looking to the Big East tournament as the chance
to almost have a way to salvage what has been so tough --  
DAR TUCKER: Say that again.  
  
Q. How much were you guys looking forward to this tournament as an
opportunity to almost salvage what has been a tough season that you can have a
moment like this, something you were really looking for?  
WILL WALKER: Yes, because we feel it's now or never. We need to get our
respect now. People have been throwing dirt on us all season because we've
been losing. This is a chance to get a little bit of respect now and --  
  
Q. So your coach talked about what it was like for you guys on campus, that
was a little bit difficult from a student perspective; can you take us to what
it's been like on campus having not been able to win a game?  
WILL WALKER: It's a little tough. We try to stick together and just hang out
with each other, not really separate too much. It really brought us close
together those losses, helped us come together as a team. It made us stronger
in practice because instead of getting relaxed in practice after winning, we
started going hard because we were losing, so we had to go hard so we had
something to push for.  
COACH JERRY WAINWRIGHT: I might make a specific comment to that. Obviously
we're in a pro town. The Bears, the Cubs, there's rise and falls and the mood
of our town is oftentimes dictated by sports.  
We are the number one university in terms of diversity in the country. We're
an urban university and I think what happens with our guys is there's more of
a -- more -- they have a really -- we don't have football, obviously.  
We have a real good relationship with the student body and really I think they
would agree, our students have been great to us. You know, there may be a
comment or two but really the university has been behind the kids. They really
have been and now, we're next to the Bulls and the Blackhawks and obviously
we're a story because things haven't gone well but I think from -- I think
we've had a lot of comfort at the university, I really do, and the university
has really backed the kids and we're obviously proud that we're able to give
them a win.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: DePaul, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2009

  

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

### [Chris Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19364)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

St. John's 64  
Georgetown 59

  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON, III: Questions? I don't know.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Coach, this team has had to take a lot of tough lessons for a young group
of people. Can you just talk about where this one ranks?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON, III: I don't know. I don't know where this one ranks.
It's disappointing.  
  
Q. Coach, last week you said last week's loss against St. John's was the
most disappointing loss in your career.  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON, III: I don't think I said that. Barker asked me was it
amongst and he rattled off a couple (losses). I said yeah, okay. I don't think
I said it was amongst the most disappointing losses in my career. Maybe I'm
wrong but I don't think I did.  
  
Q. How does this one rank?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON, III: I'll take some time to digest it before I figure it
out. It's extremely disappointing. They all are. I can't think of any loss,
"Oh, that's a good, happy loss."  
This is the Big East tournament. When you lose in this tournament, it's tough.  
  
Q. Coach, when you guys -- they were up nine and you went up three. At that
point do you think "we made a push"?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON, III: I did. I felt we were in a pretty good position, I
thought we were in a pretty good mindset but coming down the stretch, you
know, we didn't make the play -- we didn't make plays. We didn't execute at
the offensive end or the defensive end and they did.  
I got to give them credit. It felt like they had three, four 3-point plays in
a row. There were several possessions we played decent defense for 30 seconds
and then all of a sudden the last five, four, three seconds they get a foul,
they get a layup; that happens. That happens as we focus on execution. That's
a tribute to them. That's good focus and execution on their part.  
  
Q. Talk about the physical nature of that game, it was really physical,
particularly the first half. The second half calmed down. Everybody is
obviously in foul trouble. Is it harder to get a flow in a game like that?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON, III: No, not necessarily. I don't think that the physical
nature of the game took away from any kind of flow. I mean -- most games in
this league are extremely physical. It was clear from the beginning that the
refs were going to let us play and weren't going to call it, with the
exception of hand-checking away from the basket they weren't going to call too
much going to the rims. That was equal. They did the same thing at both ends
of the court.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Do we have any questions for the players? Anymore questions for
Georgetown? Go ahead.  
  
Q. Chris (Wright), can you just talk about the challenge, keeping your heads
up? It seemed like over the course of the last few games the confidence has
been fragile at best for this team.  
CHRIS WRIGHT: I don't understand your question. What is your question? I mean
-- I understand you're saying that our confidence -- what is the question?  
  
Q. Do you agree? Does it feel like this team has struggled to find its
rhythm, to find its signature way to play down the stretch?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON, III: Let me jump in, then he can answer however he wants
to. I think that's two different things. In spite of everything we've gone
through this year, I don't think this group has not been confident.  
We still struggled but I don't think we've ever shown up not confident that we
can go out and play well and get a win. So I don't think it's struggled -- I
don't think we've had up and downs in terms of our confidence. We haven't
gotten wins consistently. We haven't, necessarily, executed as we should have
but I don't think confidence is part of the equation.  
  
Q. Chris, that last play with 15 seconds, down three, what was the design,
what did you see from St. John's?  
CHRIS WRIGHT: Well, I think we were a little confused when we came out because
somebody -- one of our teammates was supposed to be at center. We had so many
perimeter guys we got confused. At that time we had to go to another option. I
don't think -- we knew they were going to come out man-to-man. We didn't set-
up in the right spots and unfortunately we didn't make a play.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Are there anymore questions? Georgetown, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2009

  

### [Stan Heath](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13792)

### [Dominique Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19392)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Seton Hall 68  
USF 54

  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions, please?  
  
Q. Stan, if you can just talk about Hazell in the second half. He's one of
those guys you can't leave open like that.  
COACH STAN HEATH: He's a really difficult guy to guard. He's improved his game
from last year. He was more just a spot-up shooter and guy who can hit shots
in transition.  
This year he really moves well without the ball and he's able to put the ball
on the floor and do things. You know, once when Chris picked up some fouls and
Dominique obviously was trying to play both ends of the court so it's hard. It
created a big problem for us trying to slow him down. He took advantage of
that and that was, I think a big plus for Seton Hall being able to win the
game.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about the second half how shots didn't fall. What
do you think that the other team was able do that you guys really weren't able
to counter?  
COACH STAN HEATH: They turned up the pressure. Couple things happened. They
picked us up and just straight man and really made us bring the ball up the
floor under some heat. I thought that was -- the initial part of it.  
The second part was when he picked up his fourth foul and had to leave the
game, when Chris did that, it forced Dominique to solely be the sole ball
handler and it's hard when you're the guy who has to initiate your offense and
you're the guy who has to finish the offense.  
That was the tough role he was placed in and I thought that that was a factor
for us to make a run and us maybe having a harder time scoring the ball.  
The first time around we did a much better job of being a scoring factor on
the block with our big guys and this game, you know, they did a little bit
better job and we missed some shots. We never really established the inside
game like we wanted to.  
  
Q. Dominique, if you can just talk about what this does in terms of setting
things for next year, being here, going through this whole process.  
DOMINIQUE JONES: I think it was a good experience for the younger guys, you
know, this is my first time being here, you know and I kind of had butterflies
at first, you know, so I could only imagine how most of the other people on
the team felt.  
I think that us coming in here next year, we'll have a feeling for how it is
out there, you know, we'll come out here and be comfortable. We'll be more
effective on the court.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Do we have any other questions? Any other questions? Thank you
USF.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [John Garcia](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19393)

### [Bobby Gonzalez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18121)

### [Jeremy Hazell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19394)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Seton Hall - 68  
USF - 54

  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: Just start with an opening statement. Obviously I'm just
very proud of these two guy sitting next to me and our whole team. This team
has just been a fun team, a great team to coach. We're extremely resilient. We
don't go away a minute.  
We're just tough. We're iron tough. We play 6, 7 people, maybe at the most
and, you know, in the beginning we started out great, then obviously the tempo
got slowed down, we got a lot of foul trouble. It wasn't to our tempo. The
game got skidded to a halt. Hazell jumped in our press against turning the
tempo up and that was the difference in the game. John Garcia had 8, 9
defensive rebounds in the second half , Jeremy made big shots. Eugene came up
big at 16 and 6, I believe and it was just a tough grind it out type of game.
These guys, this is how we've been playing all year. Right now we got a lot of
confidence. We're highly motivated because these guys wants to get to post-
season.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Bobby, it looked a little bit like the last South Florida game, close at
halftime and you guys sort of did your thing and pulled away a little bit in
the second half. Was that sort of what you were preaching to them at halftime
in?  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: Absolute. It's easier to slow a game down than it is to
speed it up. We sped it up in the beginning, they slowed it down. The key for
us at halftime, we talked about was if this game is going to be in the 40s,
50s and turn into like a kind of a mug you, slug you, it turns ugly, I'm not
saying we can't win but it's not good for us. We have to find a way to get in
transition, get stops and run outs and all that kind stuff and we did. John
got rebounds, kick it out. Jeremy, we got steals, threw it up ahead.  
The other thing I didn't mention I should have mentioned Jordan Theodore, a
freshman in the seconds half when the game was tied or whatever, hanging in
the balance, he came up huge for a freshman in Madison Square Garden, first
game ever in the Big East tournament. Hit a 3, guarded the heck out of
Dominique Jones. Just was terrific. Jordan Theodore was really a big key in
helping us pull this out.  
  
Q. Bobby, I know you're big on history. Part of this is the program's first
win in this tournament since 2003; what does that mean?  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: It means a lot. We talked about it in the hallway, Joe
Quinlan, Monsignor. We knew exactly how many years it had been. We stayed at
the same hotel, went to the same restaurants P.J. (Carlesimo) and them used to
go to. We hope we could get some ghosts from -- they just wanted to win and we
talked a lot about getting 17 wins, being in a situation where maybe somebody
would consider this team for the NIT. These were all the things that motivated
us and you know, even though South Florida we're supposed to win, we're
favored, we talked a lot about single game elimination, survive and advance,
neutral site, anything can happen. We talked about DePaul winning today. St.
John's beat Georgetown. Just anything could happen and you just have to come
to play. It's a 40-minute situation.  
  
Q. Bobby, you put the focus on the players but you won 17 games this year.
With all the obstacles that was given to you, this has to be one of the
greatest coaching efforts that was made anywhere, I would think.  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: Well, I appreciate you saying that but let me tell you
something, when -- this guy, Jeremy Hazell makes shots and makes you look
good. It's an old coaching saying that shooting makes up for a multitude of
sins. When we make mistakes defensively, he makes shots that makes any coach
look good. I would give Jeremy me a lot of credit and John.  
  
Q. This is for John. John, how big is the motivation of getting to the
NIT?  
JOHN GARCIA: It means a lot. At this point in the season it comes down to
whoever wants to continue to play is going to win. Whoever comes out with the
most energy will win, still has that drive to keep playing. At this point a
lot of people packed in it and want the season to end. I think we've got a lot
of guys that are motivated and we want to keep playing. We don't want the
season to end. We had a lot more. -- lot of people didn't think we could go
far this year. We remember where we were picked in the preseason. We come out
and tried to prove everybody wrong. Just carried us throughout this whole
season.  
  
Q. You got a ten-point lead pretty quick but you end up going into halftime
down.  
During that stretch of time, I mean is it that they've got control of the pace
or how do you feel about the way that the pace changes?  
JOHN GARCIA: Yeah. The pace, that's pretty -- the pace kind of grinded to a
halt. It took us out of our game. We knew we came out in the second half with
a lot of energy, we tried to come out and play our game and try to pressure
and get the game going up and down the court that we would have an advantage.
That's kind like what happened at the start of the second half. Our guys,
Theodore gave us a spark. Jeremy gave us great plays. We didn't want to season
to end. We kind of made an effort that we were going to play as hard as we can
for as long as we could.  
  
Q. Jeremy, looked like you hurt your neck on that three there in the second
half. Can you talk about what happened and how do you feel?  
JEREMY HAZELL: On the three, when I shot, fell back, you know, I hit the
little table like this on the back of my neck but I was fine. Hurt a little
bit but I was cool after that.  
  
Q. Coach Gonzalez, talk about the adjustment in the defensive game plan for
Syracuse tomorrow.  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: We're going to go to St. Patrick's Cathedral and spend
about five hours praying and hoping Paul Harris doesn't show up. We know
they're going to play 2, 3 zone. Coach Boeheim is a hall of fame coach. There
will be 15,000 people, man knee accidents in the building. We're in the
building playing Syracuse. They're an NCAA team. They've got great talent,
Johnny Flynn is a special player.  
We're going to go back and figure it out, talk about it and spend time. We
only have 24 hours. You know -- we just got to come out and play them. You
don't have a lot of time. They've rested. They're back sleeping right now.
We're waiting to get to the hotel but you know, I love our guys. We've got a
chance. That's what matters.  
  
Q. Question for both players. When you guys are getting it going in the
second half, who is the -- on the court who does most of the talking and the
pumping you guys up and what exactly do they say?  
JEREMY HAZELL: It's a lot of guys but really it's the captains, John Garcia,
Paul Lawson, Eugene Harvey. They keep us together no matter what. We can be
down 20 or up 20. Stick together and stay together and play hard for 40
minutes and everything will be all right. I really give the credit to them
three guys right there.  
JOHN GARCIA: It's different. It varies from game to game. This game, give
Jordan a lot of credit. He came in even as a freshman. He came with a
different kind of energy in the second half. He was inspiring. Paul was in
foul trouble. We knew we had to step up. He started the second half and had to
give us a spark. Today, this game it was Jordan. Jordan got out there with his
body language. By his attitude playing on the court, playing with energy.
Today was one of those days. It was just everybody today in the second half.  
  
Q. Can I follow-up? Bobby, you recruited Theodore. Are you surprised that a
guy like that would take this leadership role in his first conference
tournament game or did you know that this was there?  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: I knew that he had the ability. He's special young man.
He played with truck Ryan from West Virginia, Kimba Walker from UCONN. They
were all on the same team in the Gauchos in the summer. He played the point
guard on that team with four, five other point guards and they won like every
game. He was interested in coming to Seton Hall even though we Eugene who was
a starting point guard going into his junior year. That says something about a
freshman who is coming in saying he didn't say like, I have to start, I don't
care if I'm a backup point guard. It just says something about the kind of kid
he is and the kind of leadership. He doesn't care if he plays with Eugene,
behind Eugene. I can put him at the 1, 2. He's going to be a special player.  
  
Q. This is for John and for Coach. How much do you both relish the
opportunity to play Syracuse considering both of you weren't there the first
time?  
JOHN GARCIA: I mean, me personally, definitely it's something that I look
forward to. It's a great team, great challenge going against, Arinze Onuaku.
It's going to be a great challenge. It's something I do relish because it
hurts sitting on the bench watching my team the first time around when I was
hurt and I always wanted another shot at it. It's going to be a good
opportunity. I do relish it. We'll try to go out there and do our best.  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: I have to add something to that. Of course, I knew
somebody was going to ask the question. I thought it might be Mike from
Syracuse. I'm only joking. I did miss the first game in the Carrier Dome and
you know I tried to behave since then, so it's ironic we played in the first
game of the year. I'm happy to have a chance to coach against Syracuse at
least once this year.  
  
Q. I'd like to follow up with Roger, considering, Bobby, your history with
Syracuse, playing them in the NCAA tournament and you almost beat them; do you
feel something growing with your coaching career in Syracuse and Syracuse?  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: Maybe people that followed me. I worked at Syracuse
basketball camp when I was a kid, Coach Boeheim put me with U.S.A. Basketball.
He's helped me a lot. We played them three, four years in a row when I was at
Manhattan. We lost when he had Carmelo Anthony. There's a lot of history there
we've never been able to beat them, unfortunately. He usually has the better
players and they usually come out on top. The history will be better if we can
beat them sometime.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Seton Hall, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2009

  

### [Anthony Farmer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13759)

### [Fred Hill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19388)

### [Hamady Ndiaye](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19389)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Notre Dame - 61  
Rutgers - 50

  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions.  
  
Q. Obviously you played well defensively but offensively did you get shots
you wanted or what do you think happened?  
COACH FRED HILL: I think you saw a microcosm of the season. The shots we
wanted, we missed layups, wide open looks, 12, 15-foot pull ups. Offensive
rebounds.  
We did a terrific job on the glass, had 14 offensive rebounds and didn't
score. You get an offensive rebound and two feet from the basket you've got to
lay that back in. If you can't, you can kick it out and get another wide open
look usually from 3. That's also a microcosm of where we are.  
I have to commend our defensive effort and I have the utmost respect for Luke
Harangody. He is reigning Big East Player of the Year or was coming into the
season. I'm sure there was a new one today. Great player. You guys will know
better today. He probably averages in the mid 20s. I wanted to kill Chris
Carton on the radio show. He told me coming to this game today that (Luke)
Harangody shot 30 percent against us the last two years and goes 3 for 17
tonight.  
Just a phenomenal job on the defensive end. We have to become a better
offensive team. We've got to shoot the ball better. We've got to be more
consistent in our decision-making and we've got to get a little better with
our ball handling. I thought tonight we did a good job. Didn't turn the ball
over.  
Couple key ones when we were down 3 but we did a pretty solid job of not doing
that. When you get open shots, you got to knock them down if you want to give
yourself a chance to win. We certainly give ourselves a chance to win on the
defensive end every night out.  
  
Q. Just for anybody, it seems like you guys outhustled Notre Dame. It seems
like you did everything right energy-wise but the shots wasn't there.  
Does it make the loss especially tough to take?  
COACH FRED HILL: Every loss is tough to take. Certainly when do you those
things like we talked about, we've talked about it all year long with these
guys, getting rewarded for what they do.  
Guys, make no mistake, it when you don't win games you don't get rewarded.
It's hard to come out and defend and play with energy especially when you
don't score on the offensive end. This game is about scoring. You catch guys
score and there's a pep in their step. They run back on the defensive end with
a little more energy. We don't score when we do that, do it pretty darn well.  
So it's very frustrating when you miss easy shots. You know, someone asked,
did we get the great shots? We took some bad shots but few, a few bad shots.
We took good shots and got good shots and, you know, execution is getting good
shots and then you got to make and it's very frustrating when your teammate
sets a great screen for you and gets a great look.  
We set a good ball screen and get a jumper and it doesn't go down. Yeah,
that's very frustrating but it shows me we're doing the right things and we
just got to get guys that are a little better. That's what we just talked
about. It's time just to become efficient and consistent and we need to get
better on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Hadamy, what is it about playing against Harangody; you've had a lot of
success against him in the past and tonight?  
HAMADY NDIAYE: Well, I also always come on the court and give it my best
whoever I'm playing. Tonight, was something different for me because this was
my first chance to get in the Big East and I've been waiting for this chance
for three years now so I think it doesn't really matter if it was Harangody or
whoever else, I came out today and did not expect to leave and I was not ready
to leave tonight. I really wanted to win.  
This is my first chance so that's maybe why I pretty much gave it my best when
I was on the defensive end and also knowing that for the past two years, every
time we played against Harangody. I had a pretty much good game against him
playing defense which is one of the things I do best.  
  
Q. Y'all had a really tough shooting effort in the first half. Do you think
that you were a little bit wooed by the Garden?  
ANTHONY FARMER: No, not at all. We played here earlier. I played here before.
I love the arena. That didn't have any effect on us.  
  
Q. Anthony, Coach talked about how this game is a make for the year. How has
the year been? People said there were good things this year.  
ANTHONY FARMER: Yeah. Take nothing away from it. The time I spent, you know,
with the guys I love the most, my other family, away from home if nothing
else, but definitely, you know, it was, you know, rollercoaster ride but, you
know, you're judged on how you bounce back, you know, how you fight adversity,
you know, and that's how good character is measured.  
  
Q. Your coach talked about how it's hard to find that effort when he you're
not getting rewarded with wins. Where did you guys come up with that?  
ANTHONY FARMER: Bunch of competitors. We love to compete and this is a game we
love the most so regardless, you know, you love this game and you respect this
game. When you step on that floor you have to compete.  
  
Q. Fred is Mike okay?  
COACH FRED HILL: Yeah. I didn't actually see him. From what the trainer said
obviously went flying into the stands there and banged his head.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Anything else? Rutgers, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2009

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Tory Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17106)

### [Kyle McAlarney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18163)

### [Tyrone Nash](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19384)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Notre Dame -61  
Rutgers - 50

  
COACH MIKE BREY: Well, you know, we had to defend to win the game. I told our
guys keeping them at 50 points was the key to us winning it because I thought
they really defended us well. They got the shot blockers back there. Hard for
us to maybe establish our low post as constantly.  
That's kind of what happened in South Bend when we played them and it was a
close game. We made some big free throws, made some big shots and our bench
was fabulous. Guys coming off the bench really gave us a lift, Jon Peoples,
Luke Zeller and Ty Nash.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Coach, do you think that mixing zones between the 2-3 and the man caused
a lot of problems?  
COACH MIKE BREY: I was hoping we could stay in zone a little longer tonight
like we did Friday night against St. John's. (Mike) Rosario hit those two and
then when we were zone early in the second half, they got ghem to the foul
line and I think enough. The only way we were going to win the game was by
manning up and playing man-to-man. You got to guard a lot of ball screens and
drive with them. For the most part we did a good job of putting our chest in
front of people when they really forced some drives.  
  
Q. Ty, what was kind of going through your head there at the end with the
free throws?  
TYRONE NASH: I was concentrating going to the line and knocking them down.
Coach trusted me, keep me in the game late. I wanted to reward him with two
free throws.  
  
Q. For all three players, starting with "Joey Staten Island" (Kyle
McAlarney) over here, so much has been made of your season, what the
expectations were, the struggles that you guys have gone through and now
getting here.  
What is your thinking going through this tournament, is it still we can make
the NCAA? What's the thought?  
KYLE MCALARNEY: I think a lot of credit has to go to the coaching staff for
keeping us positive and keeping us confident. We're pretty confident group but
it's very easy, you know, in the stretch that we had to get kind of down on
ourselves and Coach Brey did a great job of keeping us up and positive.  
We know we have a good shot at making a run at this thing and there's some
opportunities left here this week and that's really all we're focusing on
right now. I think the standings and the records and the streak we had gets
thrown out the window when we come to New York.  
TORY JACKSON: I have to agree with Kyle. The coaching staff did an excellent
job of keeping everybody positive, keeping everybody together whenever
somebody struggled. It didn't even seem like it fazed us because the coach
always had us smiling and always had us thinking on to the next play and just
we can do better, we'll get better, and all the credit goes to the coach and
with the NCAA tournament and all that right now, I don't think we too much
focus on that. I think we're getting ready to focus on the West Virginia game
tomorrow. That's all it's about.  
TYRONE NASH: Yeah. My two teammates, I just -- Coach tries to make us focus on
the task at hand. All we can control is the game we play so we just go out
there, try to have fun, work our butts off and win each game one at a time.  
  
Q. Coach, Rutgers had 46 rebounds; is that a concern?  
COACH MIKE BREY: Rebounding the basketball for us is always a concern,
especially going into tomorrow tonight. What beat us in Morgantown was 16
offensive rebounds. I'm not worried of us outrebounding the other team but not
getting beat up there.  
The nights we struggled in this league we've been beaten, you know, there. So
certainly that's going to be -- it didn't hurt us as bad here but tomorrow
that's got to be a big focus because that's what really changed the game in
Morgantown. We were in position.  
  
Q. Mike, when you come into something like this back-to-back-to-back, do you
coach differently? Is it a different way of looking at the game?  
COACH MIKE BREY: You got to get the first one and for us, you know, just
focusing on New York. One of the things we talked about when we came back from
UCLA and that was seven losses in a row, let's get in some kind of rhythm to
make it interesting, you know. We didn't talk about, you know, we got to do
this to get a bid and all that. Just was not realistic for them to grasp that.  
You know, we made it interesting until the last week. We couldn't pick off
Connecticut or Villanova. We at least came back and got St. John's. Kind of
back in the mode of let's see if we can make it interesting again.  
Now, I was looking last night and I can't -- I don't know if this has ever
happened before. The four one seeds that Joe Lunardi has up there, we played
six games against the four 1 seeds. Has that ever happened before in three on
the road, two at home and one at a neutral site? We have 13 losses. Do we have
a bad loss? Look at it and tell me if we really have a bad loss. We don't have
enough good wins. Don't get me wrong. We've got work to do.  
But we will make it interesting again. That's what we said when we came here.
You got to get the first one to make it interesting.  
  
Q. Mike, how much was Luke Zeller struggling?  
COACH MIKE BREY: Probably struggling a little bit. The shot blockers back
there, you got to give them credit. They pulled him out a little bit and so we
played a little different front line.  
Luke Zeller made some big shots for us and also was really big between
defensively for us. Certain Ty Nash gave us good minutes. Using the personnel
that you felt was going to get it done for you and it was great that those
guys finished.  
  
Q. Mike, you heard your guys say a lot of credit to the coaching staff, you
kept them up. Where did you go for your strength?  
COACH MIKE BREY: There's a bar around the corner -- laughter.  
  
Q. You know it's making The Post, right?  
COACH MIKE BREY: Irish bar. Irish bar.  
You know, we've been in survival mode since January 20th, probably so what
else new toys come here and people say you've got to play a couple games.
We've been in survival mode for a while.  
I think our staff has been good at staying positive and getting confidence and
then certainly getting on these guys when there's things we needed to do
better. When we came out of that Cincinnati, UCLA stretch, there were some
things we had to do better and addressed it. We've been better since then.  
We haven't won enough games to be in the discussion but I think we're playing
better and our frame of mind is better there. But I think my staff was good at
that, certainly my wife Tish was good at that. I don't know if she's going to
still be there after the season but she was great.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Any other questions? Pete.  
  
Q. Mike, I think your best two defensive performances have come in the last
two games. You've tried to out score people a bit this year?  
COACH MIKE BREY: Pete, two different ways of doing it. We were able to stay in
zone against St. John's the whole game and I was kind of hoping maybe we could
tonight but, you know, the karma said no. (Mike) Rosario hits a couple and we
move better. So that's encouraging that, you know, we didn't have to get 82 to
win a game. We had a couple at home that we did that in, Louisville only
scored 57, South Florida scored like 55 and we had to gut that one out. These
guys have been tough enough to gut a few out when we're not in a offensive
rhythm. It's good we didn't have to because we may have to do it tomorrow
night again.  
  
Q. I guess, Mike, can you change like the personality of your team this late
in the season? Can you become a lock-down team?  
COACH MIKE BREY: I don't know if we're going to be -- we're not going to get
out and contest and turn you over, ever, but I think we've become a pretty
good position defensive team. I think probably since that UCLA, we've played
better together on the defensive end. We've always played pretty well together
on the offensive end. We're up there in assists, we don't turn it over, we
know where the ball should go for the most part.  
I think we've been unselfish defensively. We've rotated over and helped our
teammate much more willingly and I think we've done that the last two games.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Notre Dame, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2009

  

### [Malik Boothe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19362)

### [Sean Evans](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19363)

### [Norm Roberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16973)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

St. John's 64  
Georgetown 59

  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Coach Norm Roberts, Sean, Malik Boothe.  
COACH NORM ROBERTS: I thought it was a terrific basketball game, two teams
battling every possession. We knew even when we got up there that Georgetown
would make another run. I thought our guys hung in there, did some toughness
things, made some tough plays and I'm really proud of my team because they
really fought through it the whole time.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Coach, how satisfying is this considering a year ago this game would not
have been played? Was it on your mind going in here?  
COACH NORM ROBERTS: No. No. We were happy to be here in the tournament. I
think it's right that all 16 teams go to the tournament. If you're in the
league, everybody should be in the tournament, but it's just like I said
earlier in the year, that, you know, anybody can beat anybody in this league.  
It's the -- the league is so good, there's so much good coaching and
everything and we were fortunate tonight to win.  
  
Q. You guys talked a little yesterday about St. John's not having been here
and not having won a game in a long time. When the clock finally went zero you
guys had the win. Tell me the first gut thought you had.  
MALIK BOOTHE: The first thought, I said I thought it was a great team victory.
There were some moments in our game we could have hung our heads because
Georgetown could have got it. We pulled out a win. That was great for the
whole team.  
SEAN EVANS: I thought a lot of hard work is paying off, you know. Some teams
if they got off to a start like us would have put their head down but I think
we kept fighting and it just shows the character that we got on the team and
how much the coaches believe in us to keep pushing and I was just real proud
and happy that we got the win.  
  
Q. How is it for you guys to defend at home?  
COACH NORM ROBERTS: Obviously we play our home games here and this is our
home. I think that gives us familiarity with the place. We played pretty well
at home.  
We've had some games we didn't play very well but most of the time we played
well and I thought our guys were really excited about today's game and just
the opportunity of playing in the tournament and playing in Madison Square
Garden again.  
  
Q. Both players, do you think the fact that you guys beat them a week ago,
does that give you a little bit of an edge knowing you've already done it
once?  
MALIK BOOTHE: It doesn't give us an edge because we go into every game
thinking we can win. We just knew that coming into the game we were going to
have to play 40 minutes. We couldn't let little things affect us.  
SEAN EVANS: Kind of like Coach always says, anybody can beat any team in this
league on any given day, so we knew it was our day, that game and maybe it
could be their game this game. We've got the mindset we've got to limit our
turnovers, our mistakes and execute.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Paris Horne playing, the 3-point play and the
3-pointer?  
COACH NORM ROBERTS: Paris has done this pretty much all year because our
quarterback, Malik Boothe, knows how to get him the ball. We ran a play called
"Four Up" for us. Even before he shot, Malik is jumping around going, "It's
good, it's good." When your point guard feels that way about you, that gives
you a lot of confidence.  
  
Q. Both players again, I don't think either one of you were at the point yet
but did you notice the coaches behind the bench?  
MALIK BOOTHE: I noticed during the game but I didn't pay any mind. We had the
task at game.  
  
Q. When you noticed Coach Carnesecca, did you think about the tradition of
this program and how you guys might do?  
MALIK BOOTHE: I knew the tradition before the game started. I wanted to come
out here.  
  
Q. Sean, did you notice it?  
SEAN EVANS: I have tunnel vision.  
  
Q. Norm, when you guys beat Georgetown last week, you described it as one of
the best wins you've been around as a coach, maybe the best win you've been
around as a coach.  
Does winning a conference tournament game top that?  
COACH NORM ROBERTS: I think it's a great victory today and every win is
something that you got to savor and enjoy. I'm really happy for our kids, our
hard work is paying off. We weren't dealt some very good cards throughout the
year with (Anthony) Mason going down, losing our point guard (Malik Boothe)
for nine games, then Justin Burrell having to wear a mask the whole year.  
We haven't been dealt great cards but these kids fight and do what I ask them
to do. I think we're coming together as a family and they just worked really
hard. I'm happy that we're able to get this victory and we're going to the
next round.  
  
Q. All three of you guys, it's great to get into this thing but what do you
think about an empty feeling of not winning?  
COACH NORM ROBERTS: I think the tournament is run terrifically and -- but I
said to them that the bottom line is, here's the moment, you're going to
either define your moment or let the moment define you, and I've been telling
you that for the last three weeks do not let the moment define you. People
think that this is what's supposed to happen. That's not always true and you
can define the moment and these kids today defined the moment.  
  
Q. I used that quote already.  
MALIK BOOTHE: I don't think it would have an empty feeling that we came out
here and competed and lost. But if we lost without giving it our all, it
wouldn't have been good.  
SEAN EVANS: I think that just being in the tournament is a big opportunity. We
come into the tournament like any game, trying to win and we got the best of
both worlds today.  
  
Q. Guys, less than 24 hours you guys have to come out here and do this
again. Are you physically up to this? Sean, looks like you're about to die up
there?  
SEAN EVANS: I've been sick for a couple days. Just a cold. I'll get over it.  
Conditional page break: 2  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Any other questions? Thank you, St. John's.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
JOHN PAQUETTE: We appreciate your attendance and would like to introduce Mike
Tranghese, Commissioner of the Big East. Mike?  
COMMISSIONER MIKE TRANGHESE: Thank you and good evening. Thank you for coming.
This, in my opinion is a very, very important session because it recognizes
the accomplishments of what has been arguably the most difficult and exciting
regular season that I've seen in my 30 years affiliated with the Big East
Conference.  
I can't remember a year in which we've had competition at such a high level
and the quality of the games and the quality of the coaching in this league I
think is unmatched.  
Our first award this evening will be for our scholar athlete. Alex Ruoff has
been on the Dean's List every semester that he's been enrolled at West
Virginia University. Earlier this week we announced him as the winner of the
Sportsmanship Award. He's an honorable mention All Conference selection and
Alex was with John Beilein for two years and then Bob came and I think the
transformation that Alex made personally typified the change at West Virginia
University as a teammate and as a result they've had a tremendous season and
as all of us expected following this, they'll be receiving an invitation to
participate in the NCAA tournament which is a great accomplishment.  
The winner of this year's Scholar Athlete of the Year award from the
University of West Virginia, Alex Ruoff. Alex, congratulations.  
ALEX RUOFF: Thank you. I just want to thank the Big East for this award. You
know, it's a great honor. You know, it's just a great honor to play in this
great conference.  
I've had a great four years at West Virginia and, you know, very proud to be
here and to accept this and bring attention to the university is great. So,
thank you.  
COMMISSIONER MIKE TRANGHESE: If you go back in the annals of the conference
and you take a look at the kinds of players who have been Rookie of the Year
in this league, it's a who's who of greatness and I think this year we had our
first introduction to Greg Monroe, the starting center at Georgetown
University joining an illustrious group of players as the winner of the Big
East freshman of the Year from Georgetown University, Greg Monroe.  
GREG MONROE: Hi. I just want to thank the coaches of the Big East, my coaching
staff and my teammates. Without them, I would not be a success. Thank you.  
COMMISSIONER MIKE TRANGHESE: We've had some very close voting in the past for
the Defensive Player of the Year. Needless to say, I don't have to tell you it
was close this year. I think the performance on the defense I have seen by
Hasheem Thabeet this year ranks with some of the performances we've seen in
the past when we've had great shot-blocking centers going back to Patrick
Ewing and Dikembe Mutumbo and Alonzo Mourning and so many others.  
We add to that list and it's a real privilege for me to introduce to you our
Defensive Player of the Year from the University of Connecticut, Hasheem
Thabeet.  
HASHEEM THABEET: I just want to say thank you for all the coaches and for this
and I just feel honored to be out here and hopefully I'll get another chance
to win this for third year in a row and congratulations to all the award
winners. Thank you.  
COMMISSIONER MIKE TRANGHESE: I think senility is setting in because John
reminded me we already announced Hasheem as the Defensive Player of the Year.
I think the third or fourth time in our history we've had co-players of the
year. We never divulge our votes for a variety of reasons. You probably
disagree with that but that just goes with the territory when you run a
dictatorship.  
We had five different players get first place votes this year for our Players
of the Year. It's the closest, and in my opinion, the most difficult vote
we've ever had for our Player of the Year. Could have gone to one of any five
players.  
As a result, we came up with a tie and it's an incredible, incredible
accomplishment, two young players from two of our programs that are ranked
second and fourth in the country.  
Our Co-Players of the Year, first of all, recognizing again Hasheem Thabeet,
and from the University of Pittsburgh, Dejuan Blair.  
DEJUAN BLAIR: I would like to thank the Big East for this award and thanking
my coach and my teammates, man, because if -- they wouldn't have got me the
ball, you know, if I wouldn't have played the way I did, I wouldn't be
standing here among y'all right now and it's an honor to be a Co-Big East
Player of the Year with Hasheem. I know he's a great player, and thank you
anyway. Thank you. All the coaches, too.  
HASHEEM THABEET: I just want to say thank you for the coaches. My teammates
make me the player who I am today and without them, I wouldn't be here and
thank you, all of you for all the coverage. Thank you.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Our final award is the Oppenheimer Funds Big East Coach of the
Year, and for some brief remarks we have Bruce Dunbar, Senior Vice President,
Director of Corporate Communications for Oppenheimer Funds.  
BRUCE DUNBAR: Thank you, John. It's an honor to be here on behalf of
Oppenheimer Funds to help present this Oppenheimer Funds Big East Coach of the
Year award.  
Before I go any further with this, this is obviously an award that is about
leadership and helping an organization achieve its full potential. I would be
remiss if I didn't congratulate Mike Tranghese on all the work he's done over
the years for the Big East. I think it's safe to say the equality of play is
only matched by the quality of the organization and we appreciate all of his
work on behalf of the corporate sponsors and partners as well as the student
athletes and the fans.  
This is our second year as the title sponsors of this award and our fourth
year of a very important partnership for us with the Big East. I think it's
well -- while our industry is going through the equivalent of a winless
season, we know that the organizations that are well coached, will find a way
to win eventually and we look forward to having many more great seasons with
the Big East.  
All of us at Oppenheimer Funds and the financial advisers that represent us
understand that great coaching really helps individuals achieve their goals
and maximize their potential, whether that's in athletics or in their personal
finances.  
So with that it's really our pleasure to help present this award to the
Oppenheimer Funds Big East Coach of the Year. Thank you.  
COMMISSIONER MIKE TRANGHESE: You know, I thought about what I could tell you
about our Coach of the Year Award. Let me tell you about the people who didn't
win because when I tell you about the people who didn't win you'll recognize
the accomplishments of our winner, Jay Wright.  
Thirty years ago when this league formed, Dave Gavitt told me on the day the
league formed in the Providence Civic Center, this is going to be a coaches'
league and clearly under Dave's leadership and hopefully under mine we've
never wavered from that.  
I think we have the best group of coaches in the country. That's why we've had
so much success. You watch our games and the level of coaching in this league,
it just blows me away and I've had the privilege joining it, but think about
this: This year Jim Calhoun, Hall of Fame Coach became one of very few coaches
in this country who has won 800 or more games. Jimmy Boeheim, won 20 or more
games for the 31st time in a Hall of Fame illustrious career.  
Jamie Dixon inherited a program from Ben Howland and together they have led
Pittsburgh to the finals of this tournament six times in the last seven years.
Sometimes we forget about that in addition to leading Pitt twice during this
season to the number one ranking.  
Rick Pittino led Louisville to a 16-2 record in this league. If you told me
somebody was going to get through this league with only two losses at the
beginning of the year I would have told you were crazy.  
In my humble opinion, I think Rick Pittino will be the next coach from this
league that will be and should be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.  
Buzz Williams came into the league, inherited a senior team but they were Tom
Crean's players. Buzz took that team and made subtle changes and Marquette had
an incredible win and they've suffered a terrible loss in Dominic James as
Connecticut has with Jerome Dyson, but if you know the kids from Marquette,
they're going to be a tough out not only in this tournament but in the NCAA.  
Then I turn to Cincinnati, what Mike Cronin did this year. He loses his
starting point guard, he's got three freshmen in his rotation, and basically
people counted him out but they come to play hard every night. They're well
coached and disciplined and they're on the verge of going to the NCAA
tournament.  
So with that, the winner of our Coach of the Year, a long time friend for the
last 20 years, from Villanova University, Jay Wright.  
JAY WRIGHT: Bruce, thank you to you and Oppenheimer for supporting the Big
East and this award. This is obviously an honor and Michael, to do this in
your last year, do I get a picture with you?  
COMMISSIONER MIKE TRANGHESE: If you have enough money.  
JAY WRIGHT: It will be nice to be with you on your last year and thank you for
everything you've done for the coaches, all of us even before we were in the
league, you've been great to us.  
You know, in this league, I think I speak for all the coaches, we're all
honored just to be a part of part of it and most of us, almost us in this
league came up learning from Lou Carnesecca, John Thompson, Rollie Massimino,
P.J. Carlesimo, all those guys. That's where we learned.  
And the funny thing is all of us also learned from going to clinics and
listening to Jim Calhoun and Rick Pittino and Jim Boeheim, the guys that are
coaching now, really treasure the opportunity to be on court with those guys.  
You know Jim is here and I want to congratulate Jamie (Dixon) on an incredible
year. I kind of wonder what I'm doing here looking at you guys what you did
this season, but in this conference, we all have great respect for one another
and to be the Coach of the Year and to be voted by these coaches means the
world to me because I just have such great respect for the coaches in this
league, what they do with their teams but also what kind of men they are.  
We really go at each other in recruiting and on the court but we have a great
amount of respect for each other. I think Michael sets that standard and we
all respect it.  
So, as everyone knows, if you have a good team, you've got great players and
we do, and on behalf of our players, our assistant coaches, we have an
outstanding staff that I'm extremely proud of and, of course, my wife, Patty,
who is here today. I accept this award on behalf of all those people who make
this possible. This is a great honor. Thank you.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Thank you everyone. The award winners will be available
informally. Next game starts at 7:00.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

DePaul - 67  
Cincinnati - 57

  
COACH MICK CRONIN: First of all, I want to congratulate DePaul and their
players. They played with tremendous effort in the face of a very, very tough
season and it's a credit to Coach Wainwright that he's been able to hold these
guys together and continue to compete through some very, very tough times.  
That being said, we continue to struggle on offense and it's a very, very
tough game to play. When you can't score with the basketball you're not going
to win very many games.  
We don't make layups, we don't make free throws and we're not making 3-point
shots. The second half, our defense fell apart on us but we put too much
pressure on our defense. We had some crucial turnovers and gave DePaul some
layups. It's kind of been the same story for us here lately. Critical second
half, turnovers or layups and we don't finish around the basket. We don't make
shots and when we get fouled we don't make free throws. That part of the game
is not real complicated, defense, rebounding and offense. We didn't do a great
job of any of the three.  
Again, I would say to our local guys, we lost the game in the first half.
Should have been up at least ten in the first half. Come out, miss two
uncontested layups from two guards after we steal the basketball. Eighty
percent free throw shooter goes 0-for-3 from the foul line, 0-for-2 in the
first half.  
Missed numerous wide open shots, shots in close. Just gave DePaul a chance to
hang in there and a chance to win and when you do that, teams find energy,
they play harder, the basket shrinks on our end.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Do you think it's just been the lack of shooting ability these last five,
six games? You've lost six out of seven.  
COACH MICK CRONIN: I told our team when we were -- we won 7 of 9 we were
shooting the ball well, over 40 percent from the 3-point line. I told our guys
it's a dangerous way to live. If you look at Big East games, you look at
games, look at the teams in our league, the other night they (Lousiville)
scored 62 points in a victory. The game becomes more physical around the
basket so you got to be able to finish with strength if you go inside.  
You know, Yancy (Gates) struggled with that. He's a young guy, we're relying
upon a 19-year-old guy. He's 6 for his last 27 in our last two games.  
We've obviously got to work with him and he's got to get stronger finishing
the ball around the rim. Those are crucial baskets that we've got to have when
you go inside.  
So, it's not all shooters is I guess that I'm telling you. We're not finishing
inside. We missed two layups to start the game from our guards. That's got
nothing do with the perimeter shot. You cannot rely on 3-point shooting.  
Our problem is finishing in the paint, giving away numerous fast break
opportunities, either miss a layup or turn the ball over, don't even get a
shot or we get fouled when we should get it.  
Our passing is not what it needs to be. That hurts us at times. But I don't
know if there's an area we're playing well at offensively. I wouldn't point to
perimeter shooting. I think it's interior shooting, free throws and passing is
not what it needs to be, either. It's just -- it leads to a snowball effect.  
  
Q. The way you finished the season after you were 17-8, how much of a bitter
taste does this leave?  
COACH MICK CRONIN: I told the guys two things. Number one, we don't have -- if
anybody watched the game, we're pressing, scrambling all over the floor. It's
not like guys aren't trying but we have to realize why we were successful and
why you're unsuccessful.  
As teams play harder against us, I think what we found out was when you earn a
team's respect, when -- there's was a point we were an NCAA tournament team
and the way Louisville came in and played against us, the way teams prepared
for us after we earned everybody's respect, I don't think we've handled that
really well.  
We haven't -- I think our league is a much more physical league at the end of
the year. Our big guys have really struggled with that and I think -- I know
we've struggled with -- to maintain the intensity level that got us the wins
we got.  
We don't have overwhelming talent yet. Obviously, you hope to get there but
that is not the case with us.  
We're in the second phase of a massive rebuilding project and the first year
of that phase. We do not have overwhelming talent. We need to win with
defense, hustle, scrap out wins and fight as hard as we can.  
You got to be able to win, grind it out, tough games and here lately we
haven't been able to win those type of games. There's too much pressure being
put on our defense because of our offensive struggles. We're too young out
there.  
Anything else for me? I'll let these guys -- are you done with me?  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Rashad Bishop, Deonta Vaughan, Yancy Gates.  
  
Q. Yancy, why do you think you struggled so much around the basket lately?
Are you getting bumped a lot or what's going on?  
YANCY GATES: It's a lot more --  
  
Q. Would you speak up on the microphone?  
YANCY GATES: It's just a lot more physical under the basket. You see more
double teams toward the end of the year. It just becomes harder to score as
the season goes on.  
  
Q. Rashad, the way you guys have finished the season, has it left a bitter
taste in your mouth or what does it say about where the program is?  
RASHAD BISHOP: It's just -- it's a bad feeling having a 17-8 record and
finishing 18-14, it's kind of frustrating. I think you can see it in our play
a little bit.  
We're just not as confident as we were when we were 17-8. I think it just got
a lot to do with confidence. In the off-season we just need to work hard and
get better and come back next year.  
  
Q. Do you think you're going to get to play in the post-season somewhere?  
RASHAD BISHOP: Hopefully.  
  
Q. Deonta, you took 21 shots today which I think some people wanted you to
shoot more. Do you think you had to shoot today because nobody could score?
Did you start looking to shoot more after awhile?  
DEONTA VAUGHN: I don't think -- I just came out, we got to play defense to win
and Rashad kept screaming over and over like I was passing up some shots he
thought I should shoot and things like that.  
So, you know, my teammates started telling me to shoot and I was looking to be
aggressive but, at the same time, give my teammates to do other things than
shooting the ball.  
I know I'm capable of shooting the ball at anytime, getting players open. I'm
trying to get everybody else in a fluid game, in a crucial moment of the game,
me being the veteran here and things like that. I just figured I started
passing up some shots and started shooting some shots I normally take or I
took last year.  
  
Q. Does it make it worse you lost to a team that hasn't one a game in the
Big East all year?  
DEONTA VAUGHN: Yeah. Coach came in, told us this team is going to get a win,
they don't want to be the first team in history to ever go a season without
winning a Big East game and they wanted it.  
We didn't do things in the first half and in the second half we had a nice
lead. We just didn't defend like we're supposed to. I think we did get a
little too relaxed out there on the court. We didn't take control of the game
when we were up by 8 and we were up by 10. They came back and made a run.  
  
Q. What did it look like when they came back on you in the second half and
got close to you?  
DEONTA VAUGHN: We didn't do the things we were doing earlier on when we was
winning to get there. We started playing the harder teams and it got tough. We
had a game plan. We just didn't keep our poise. We didn't execute everything.  
We did start shooting a little bit more 3s but we got uncomfortable where our
shots were falling. We were doing everything and everybody got too comfortable
with that and relaxed.  
I feel we didn't do the things we needed to do as far as getting into the NCAA
tournament. We knew we were capable of getting in there.  
JOHN PAQUETTE: Anything else? Cincinnati, thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 29, 2009

  

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The first coach up this morning is Illinois head coach Bruce
Weber. Weber enters his seventh year at the helm of the Fighting Illini
program and welcomes back eight letter winners from last year's team that
finished tied for second in the conference.  
Opening statement from Coach Weber, and then we'll open it up to questions.  
COACH WEBER: I think we're I guess cautiously excited about the upcoming
season. We were -- finished second last year. Kind of had a great deal of
improvement, but maybe faltered a little bit at the end of the season.  
The majority of our team is back and we've added some quality freshmen group,
but I think -- at the same time I think the cautiousness comes because of the
depth of the league. It seems like not only do we have a lot of people back,
but everybody else does. And I think for the first time in a while our league
is getting some great national publicity, as maybe possibly the strongest
league in the country.  
We're led by our group of juniors would be our mainstays of our team, Demetri
McCamey, Mike Davis, Mike Tisdale. We also have only one senior, Dominique
Keller, but a group of eight upperclassmen.  
We feel great about it, but at the same time we'll be a little cautious until
we see how everything unfolds.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, with all of the leagues, some of you having to play people twice,
some people once, would you be in favor of 20 Big Ten games so everyone plays
twice?  
COACH WEBER: I think it's probably coming down the road. I'm not sure as a
coach -- I think we all don't feel great about it. I think it's a good thing
for having a true league champion.  
Your problem is you don't have the opportunity then to play the nonconference
games, some of the national games, possibly the exempt events, some of those
things. You would have some limitations with that.  
For our fans, there's no doubt. But we're trying to win games. The question,
too, comes down to the RPI. They always say it doesn't mean anything, but we
have a pretty good RPI as a league last year. We have more teams in.  
So I'm not sure which way to go, but it will come in the future.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you had a couple of bouts with Indiana in the past. With
both of the teams getting a little better this year, what do you expect from
that match-up?  
COACH WEBER: I think Tom Crean did an excellent job last year coming in,
trying to reenergize the program, did it with a bunch of young players. Added
some more young guys. I think they'll take a step forward. But how big a step
will probably be determined by the rest of the league. And that's the problem.  
We think we're improved, but everybody else has improved in the league. And
the quality of your players, I think the quality of coaching, just makes the
league so tough.  
So I think that's Tom's biggest dilemma right now. He could have come in the
league at a different time when it was a little bit down, he might have been
able to make a bigger step. But they were very competitive. Played everybody
close. And now I'm sure -- I think with all of us, can you win a close game
early? And when you win the close games early, now you start getting
confidence and then maybe you win when you're not supposed to.  
It's probably the key to who ends up winning the league at the end.  
  
Q. Can you talk about D.J. Richardson and the impact that he might be able
to have with this team in the upcoming season?  
COACH WEBER: Our whole freshmen group has shown signs of being very, very
productive players. D.J. is the one that's maybe gotten the most publicity.
Nationally he was from Peoria, went to Findlay Prep. That experience of being
out at a prep school out in Vegas, being away from home, I think his maturity,
the travel, the playing on national TV, they win the national -- so-called
national ESPN championship, prep school championship, I think it's all helped
him.  
He replaces what Chester Frazier gave us, that tough, hard-nosed guy that has
great intensity and just gets after it as soon as he steps on the court. He
has shot the ball better in practice than we maybe anticipated.  
To go along with that, Brandon Paul was Mr. Basketball in our state, a high-
flying kid that cannot only get to the basket, can jump up and shoot even a 3.
He gets off the floor when he shoots the ball.  
And then another young man, Joseph Bertrand from Sterling, Illinois, has good
athleticism. They -- all three of those guys kind of mix guards. They really
push each other.  
And then maybe the biggest surprise might be Tyler Griffey, the young man we
got from St. Louis, showed some better toughness than we anticipated. Our
whole freshman group has pushed our upperclassmen. So it's been great for us
in practice.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the value of playing tough nonconference teams at
home? Do you think there's any advantage there to get some of those early
competition?  
COACH WEBER: I don't think there's any doubt. It's that fine mix. Obviously we
have to have a certain number of home games to provide income for our athletic
department. At the same time, we have to mix in some games that are going to
prepare us.  
We try to get -- not only for the Big Ten, but hopefully for the post-season
play also. So we try to play teams from a variety of leagues, variety of
styles, even venues.  
If you can get in the venues, the neutral venues which possibly might be NCAA
sites in the future. But you want to be ready. You want some close games. You
want to play against pressing teams, just a variety of things that will help
prepare you.  
And you hope you win games, too. That's the biggest thing. And last year that
was what our league did. We won not only a lot of nonconference games, but we
won big games in the nonconference also.  
So I hope that trend continues this year and that will determine what our
conference ends up at the end.  
  
Q. Bruce, the 38-33 game last year got a lot of strange press all around the
country. And it really was seemed to be disregarded how tough the game was and
really just how unsightly it was. It got a lot of negative press. Did you hear
that? Did you see it? And do you think it affects the whole league at large?
It seems like people wanted it to.  
COACH WEBER: Well, I don't think there's any doubt it got some national
attention. I don't know how many of the national guys called me the next day.
I probably had six, seven calls. And I'm like -- to be honest, I'm wondering
why the heck they're calling me, but they were looking for I guess a negative
story, a story kind of what's wrong with the league and the whole bit.  
I just think it was one of those games where we couldn't make a shot. They
couldn't make a shot. Now it got -- guys get a little tight. The defense picks
up, and it just becomes a hard-fought game down to the end.  
Obviously I wish it wouldn't have happened. I wish we would have won the game.
But I think it was just one of those situations. We played them at the end of
the season. It was one of our better offensive outputs. We seemed to get down
the court better and score baskets and they ended up beating us on a buzzer
beater there. And I think it was exaggerated, to be honest, and maybe gave a
little bit of a tough light on our league.  
  
Q. Coach Izzo talks often about you. You're friends. Can you talk about when
you have to go head to head and compete against friends? Some guys like it.
It's enjoyable. Some don't. I know for him he's talked before he doesn't like
going against his friends.  
COACH WEBER: I don't think it's any fun for anybody. But at the same time now
in the league, not only Tom, Matt Painter was my assistant, and you get to
know different guys.  
I think once it's before and after is the toughest time. Once the game starts,
I don't look down. We're playing Michigan State, they're in green, we're in
whatever, we're in white, and you're just competing.  
But the before factor, you know, a little bit -- you know, not looking forward
to it after, depending if you win or lose. It's a tough thing. And Tom wants
to beat us, Matt wants to beat us but we want to beat them. I think there is a
very good respect between us, and that's what kind of keeps us together.  
We're able to compete in recruiting. We're able to compete on the court. But
at the same time stay friends and I think it's because of the respect that we
have for each other.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 29, 2009

  

### [Bo Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17045)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Wisconsin head coach Bo Ryan. Ryan is in his ninth year
with the Badgers and welcomes back three starters from last year's squad to
finish 20-13 on the season.  
Coach, we'll begin with an opening statement, and then questions.  
COACH RYAN: First of all, I was delayed downstairs, we were a little behind. I
didn't want you to think I was slow in getting up here.  
I'm excited about this year, like the rest of the coaches, we know how good
the league is going to be, we know we have a lot of work to do. We have some
players that have to grow up in a hurry.  
And that's our challenge right now with our practices and our nonconference
schedule. Will definitely prepare us for the Big Ten.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about how competitive the league is? Some of the
coaches talked about this might be as strong as it's been top to bottom?  
COACH RYAN: Well, I think it's going to be tough for the obvious reasons when
you look at a stat sheet, when you look at rosters, you look at what's
returning. People did not lose -- I don't know about other teams' total stat
sheet, but for us Krabbenhoft and Landry, if you look at their lines straight
across, we lost a lot with those two guys.  
And on the defensive end where there's a lot of stats that aren't even kept on
how they helped and recovered and how they blocked out or how they did some
other things, but I think when you look at the rosters and the stats and the
experience that's back, that's why I think the Big Ten top to bottom is going
to be that competitive, and you can have a pretty good team and maybe not make
a whole lot of noise in the league. And that's happened before.  
  
Q. Talk about you've had big, strong people up front and tough rebounders.
Are you going to be able to do that this year? Do you have that kind of talent
to be strong in the center and power forward positions?  
COACH RYAN: There's no question that was a weakness for us last year.
Physicality up front, but mainly because two of the guys that played a lot of
minutes were just sophomores and young sophomores.  
There are older players, sometimes, depending on their age when they graduate
from high school, and there's also players who have already matured while
they're in high school. Well, both Keaton Nankivil and Jon Leuer were still
guys growing and filling out and maturing even after high school.  
So that's one of the things that I thought, one of the areas I felt we could
definitely get better this year is the fact they were going to be older in a
physical sense, a mental sense, and they certainly seemed that way right now
because we're going to need that.  
And also hopefully a player like Jared Berggren, a player that redshirted last
year -- one thing when you redshirt, you can get into the weight room an extra
day because you're not playing. So he's a little bit further ahead as a result
of redshirting. So hopefully he can use that on the court and help us up
front, because that's an area where we need it.  
  
Q. You said you had some guys that need to grow up in a hurry. Who are two
of the three that you really need to grow up in a hurry?  
COACH RYAN: Well, I think a guy like Jim Jarmusz did grow up last year. He got
some good minutes for us, and while he was hurt, and again you didn't see a
lot made of it when we play. But in all fairness to him the only reason I
mentioned the injury is because it did hold him back some.  
But I think he'll be stronger and better. But Ryan Evans is another redshirted
freshman who at times you don't know he's at practice and other days he has a
great -- he dominates practice. But that's so typical of younger guys when
they're raw.  
And we've had in our program some guys who were raw coming in, and by the time
they leave they've developed into pretty good players. So Ryan's one of those
guys we need some help from. Jordan Taylor and Rob Wilson, both are guards
that so far have been asked a lot about, Jason Bohannon and Trevon Hughes, but
those guys played some pretty quality minutes. Jordan Taylor more so than Rob
Wilson.  
But those guys are really going to need to help us, because Bohannon and
Hughes, it's great to have two senior guards like that, but you can't play
through the nonconference that we have and into the Big Ten with two guards.
You've got to have four.  
But Jared is the guy that has the ability to help us and he's got to get older
as the season goes on, and by that I mean mentally pick up things. Seems like
he picks things up rather quickly.  
So that's where we are. We haven't had enough practices to really say too
much. But a couple of the exhibition games and get into the nonconference and
we'll see who it is. But we definitely need some help.  
  
Q. What skills did Jared come to campus with last year and how has he
amplified them through his redshirt year and so on in the summer?  
COACH RYAN: He likes to play. He likes to compete. And as a big man, he's
pretty mobile. So he doesn't try to knock people over to get things done. He
plays off of other people's bodies very well. And for those that have ever
coached or maybe played as a big, that ability to play off of contact is so
important, with your footwork, balance, things like that.  
And he's got that. He's got if jump hooks. He's got the up and under. He's got
the bank shot, short jumper. And he's not a bad passer. He's developing in
that area. But the one thing is if we just get guys who want to be good and
who like to compete and can handle Wisconsin, the challenges, then those are
the kind of guys we like. Jared is in that category.  
  
Q. You mentioned Ryan Evans as being a raw player, could you also talk about
the development of Rob Wilson. You mentioned him a little bit before. But just
what he's shown you so far this year?  
COACH RYAN: What we've got to get him to understand is sometimes there are
younger players who kind of defer to the older guys. Well, that's okay. Until
you get out on the court and start competing.  
He just, at times, I just think he could be a lot more physical in his play
and he can. It's being able to do it all the time. But there's so many players
that would fit into that category over the years at a lot of places. So the
turn that he has to make, the next step he has to make is really understanding
that he should want to dominate the guy that's across from him in every drill.  
I never ever have to worry about Jordan Taylor and Trevon Hughes on any drill
or any possession. Those two go after each other like there's no tomorrow.
That's where I have to get Rob to understand every, every time we get into a
drill into a 4-on-4, 3-on-3, 5-on-5, you have got to want to dominate that guy
across from you. That's the best way to show respect to him, is take it to him
or stop him.  
So that's the next hurdle for him. It doesn't mean he's not competitive. It's
just sometimes younger players look at a senior and, oh, okay, I'm going to
defer to him a little bit.  
No way. I like those young guys that come in and just want to help make that
older guy better. And if I can take some of his minutes, I'll take his
minutes. And it's okay.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 29, 2009

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll jump forward to Purdue. Up next is Purdue head coach Matt
Painter. Painter begins his fifth year with the Boilermakers and welcomes back
all five starters from last year's team that went 27-10, won its first Big Ten
tournament title and advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament.  
Coach, we'll start with an opening statement and go with questions.  
COACH PAINTER: I thought I should have been batting instead of -- in front of
Ed DeChellis, anyways, and he could bump me over. But these guys didn't think
so. They're the manager.  
Obviously we're very excited about this year's team and really looking forward
to getting into nonconference play. I think when you finish the season on a
good note and you're able to win the Big Ten tournament, go to the Sweet 16,
you're excited about the season starting. You want it to start immediately.  
And having everybody back, having guys that are healthy and the thing that
we've really tried to encourage with our guys and explain to our guys is that
injuries are part of the game. And you can't use them as excuses, and last
year we did not. And we got better as the year went on.  
We also got better as we were healthier. But we didn't use that as an excuse.
We kept plugging. I thought we had a strong finish and our guys embraced it,
which was something that was great for our team instead of making those
excuses like I talked about.  
And now I think we're stronger because of it. So we're really looking forward
to playing this year and hopefully getting some breaks in terms of health
issues, and just staying -- I think from sickness to injury, I think you get
that at the wrong time, it really hurts you.  
With all that being said, Coach Izzo's team won the league by four games, and
his best all-around player was really in and out the whole season. So they
were able to overcome it and then do some things that are special. Hopefully
we can do some things that are special this year.  
But we've got a great league and every game is going to be a challenge, and
that's probably something that's different in the Big Ten this year. You can't
grab your schedule and say: Well, I think we can win these two or three games
and have some wins on your schedule.  
There are absolutely zero wins on a Big Ten schedule this year. Anybody can
beat anybody else on the road, home, and I think that means you have a great
conference.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Could you describe how your players embraced all that hardship and was
that organic or did you have anything to do with it or did it happen by
itself?  
COACH PAINTER: The issue really was the uncertainty if Rob was going to play
or not. And I think it would have been better for us if he was just going to
be out two to four weeks, three to five weeks, and we would have adjusted to
that. The uncertainty of whether he was going to be in the lineup on a
Wednesday when it was Tuesday night is difficult as a coach because you just
want time to prepare.  
Obviously we would play small without him at times even smaller than we do.
And at times we would play bigger. We would use Chris Kramer as a 4, we would
slide JaJuan Johnson down to the 4 and bring in Chalison (phonetic). But these
were some lineups we didn't work on. We really wanted to keep it consistent
and we weren't able to do that because you want to put your best guys on the
court.  
But our guys didn't -- they didn't bat an eye. We lost some games through that
and nobody pointed fingers and nobody made excuses. Like I said, I just felt
we became a stronger team because of it.  
With that being said, I don't want to go through it again. I think we've
learned our lesson through it. You don't have to do it twice. But I was just
proud of our guys for sticking with it.  
  
Q. You returned a lot of guys. What road do you think returning players has
had to do with the parity of the Big Ten?  
COACH PAINTER: I think with our team, just the returning guys, just the
leadership and their experience of being through the grind, I think, is very
important to future success.  
In terms of our league, we just have an unbelievable junior class in college
basketball. And it's evident, obviously, in the Big Ten. There's a lot of
juniors in that class that are stars. And when we have some guys that had
opportunities I think to go in the draft that stayed I think that really
strengthened our league.  
And I think we'll have the opportunity now to grow and be one of the premier
leagues if not the premiere league in the country.  
  
Q. What can you tell us about the guys who are going to be backing up
Johnson and Hummel in terms of size and power in the post?  
COACH PAINTER: I think that's a big question for us. I really like the guys
that we've signed. Sandi Marcius and D.J. Byrd and Patrick Bade.  
With that being said, they're all freshmen and unproven. Sandi gives us more
of a true post. Six-ten, 260. Patrick kind of gives us that 4-5, probably more
leaning towards the 5, at a six-eight, six-nine, 235, 240, a lefty, a guy that
can score the ball a little bit. Can shoot 3s, can stress the defense but can
play inside. He was probably more heavily recruited in the Big Ten as a
football player as a tight end than he was a power forward.  
D.J. Byrd is a big strong kid at six-five, 220, kind of a combo forward play
small with him backing up Rob, where we can push him over to the small
forward. And he's a skilled kid.  
But that's a question because you haven't seen those guys in games yet. You've
seen them a lot in AAU. And you've seen them a lot in high school. But they
are unproven. If we get an injury like we did last year they're going to have
to step up and play major minutes. With backing those guys up and giving us
that depth and the bodies, I think they're going to be great in those roles.  
But if they have to step out of those roles, there's some uncertainty there.
Not in their ability, but just in their experience.  
  
Q. How is Lewis getting along after his deal? Is he showing you what you
would like to see off and on the court and then on the court? What are your
expectations for him in this second season?  
COACH PAINTER: Lewis is, he's done a good job. But I'd rather not comment
after somebody does something five, six months later. He has time -- he has
this time to prove himself and it's just not through the course of the season,
it's his career and it's the rest of his life. Great kids make mistakes. And I
think he falls into that category.  
If you continue to make those mistakes and it's a pattern of behavior, then
that's another deal. I don't think this is a pattern of behavior. I think he
made a mistake. So hopefully he can improve and learn from this mistake.  
He's been out of practice a little bit. He's had kind of a hip flexor or
something in his thigh, strain. Then he scratched his cornea the other day in
practice. So he's been out a little bit but he's not going to be in the first
three games, two exhibition and the first game. So we'll have to learn to play
without him, but he gives us a great spark.  
We have some good athletic combo guards in Kramer and Grant and Moore. And he
gives us a different look. He gives us that quintessential point guard that
can pressure the basketball, that can push the basketball, and he allows us to
steal some points in transition.  
He was All-Freshman Team last year. People don't really talk about that. But
to get that experience as a true freshman at that position, those guys always
seem to make a big jump their sophomore year after getting that experience as
a point.  
  
Q. How does Keaton Grant look to you? Last year he admitted he was just kind
of cautious coming off the injury. But in the pre-season he's been saying, you
know, I will not be that way.  
COACH PAINTER: Well, he had a surgery. And he didn't play for five months. And
our team went to Australia. He wasn't able to play on that trip or practice.
And then he did his best last year, didn't make excuses and fought through it.
And now he's had a great offseason. Had a great spring, summer, here in the
fall he worked hard. He's in the best shape of his life. He put a lot of time
into his game.  
And I think he'll shoot the ball like he did his sophomore year. But he needs
to do other things. I think at the end of the year I always point to the
Washington game. He had 12 rebounds against Washington when we advanced to the
Sweet 16.  
It was just a huge boost to our team when he was able to get those 12
rebounds. But, no, I think he's going to have a great senior year. He's worked
very hard academically. He'll need one class in the spring to graduate. Both
with him and Kramer. I expect them to have very good senior years.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 29, 2009

  

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now at the podium is Ohio State head coach Thad
Matta. Matta enters his sixth year with the Buckeyes and welcomes back the
squad that went 22-11.  
Opening statement and then questions.  
COACH MATTA: I think it's an exciting time as we near. I think our players are
getting tired of banging on each other, and for us we open up college
basketball on November 9th. So trying to get ourselves as ready as we possibly
can is very important to us.  
As you look at the schedule -- I was just sitting in my hotel room changing
and a friend of mine texted me and said, geez, I saw you're playing five of
the top 10 teams this year. I said, yeah, we've heard something about that.  
So I think as we continue to move forward and you take your nonconference
schedule and get yourself ready for the Big Ten, and for us we open up with
four of our first five games on the road in the Big Ten, which is going to be
a tremendous challenge for us.  
And I think that this season, as you look at the Big Ten and just the parity
in it, it's going to be the team that catches a break here or there, stays
injury-free and gets on a roll at the right time.  
So, like I said, it's an exciting time for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Now that you recently moved Evan Turner to the point guard spot and a lot
of guards within the league that people know about, what do you expect from
the guard position in the Big Ten?  
COACH MATTA: Well, I think that you're looking at a league that is very guard
heavy. You've got some great guards, some great wings. And you look and say
those are the guys that make plays for their teams. And as you look down the
rosters, and you're looking at guys that have the ability to make plays,
there's a lot of them. And there's multiple guys on a lot of teams as well.  
So I think it's where the defense is going to come into play. I think in
regards to Evan, what he is in my mind is a play-maker. Would I call him the
perfect point guard, I don't think that, but I don't want him to be that. I
think the way that we're trying to play is maybe a little different where it's
not like a few years ago where you've got a true great point guard and you put
the ball in his hands and let him go from a certain spot on the floor.  
I think we want to do that with Evan because he has I think made major
improvements in his game over the course of the summer.  
  
Q. You're picked third in the pre-season voting behind Michigan State and
Purdue. What do you think your team has to do or maybe some key aspects of the
game or some key positions that have to come through for you to challenge for
the title?  
COACH MATTA: Well, I think that we have to -- in those regards, I think,
number one, you've got to be a great road team. You're going to have to get
some wins on the road that maybe you're not projected to get.  
I think that we've talked about we're going to have to rebound the basketball
at a high level. We're going to have to take care of the basketball. We're
going to have to be a team that is very sound and very disciplined with what
we're trying to do offensively.  
And then I think in regards to staying together as a team and as you look at
this season for I think any team, there's a possibility for some highs and
some lows. And I think really just keeping the focus on exactly what our job
is and what we have to do every single time we take the court.  
  
Q. Coach, you said that you heard about playing that tougher schedule, five
out of the top 10 teams. Could you elaborate? Did you feel you had to play a
tougher schedule? Or did it come from some circles where you had to beef up
your schedule? What did that mean?  
COACH MATTA: I think, first of all, a few of them are Big Ten teams, which I
think says how good this league is. And, like I said, we open up Coaches vs.
Cancer on November 9th, we play two games and we go to Madison Square Garden,
we play North Carolina and then either Cal or Syracuse. And we have to go to
West Virginia this year in a return game in the course of the Big Ten season.  
I didn't feel that we had to -- I think we've always played a pretty
competitive schedule and this just is one of those years where everybody's
going to be really good on our schedule.  
  
Q. Back to that Evan Turner thing, how much is based on what you saw in late
games last year when you did that and how much of it has to do with Lighty and
Buford who may be able to play the forward positions? Are they healthy at
all?  
COACH MATTA: Both. I think to answer your question, I think seeing the things
that Evan can do in watching him this summer and with a foreign trip that we
had, you know, getting David Lighty back is huge for this basketball team.  
And I thought last year right at the time when he went down we were playing
some great basketball. We were undefeated. Had the No. 1 defense in the
country. And I think we're 13th in the country. And I think that speaks
volumes to what David is, what he brings to our team. And he's a guy a lot of
times that you may not see it on the stat sheet, but he's a guy I know that I
need on the floor as much as we can possibly have him on there.  
And having a guy like William Buford coming into a second season, I thought
Will last year, as he got thrust into when David went down into a position of
saying we need you to play and we need you to produce, I was very pleased with
what he brought to the table.  
  
Q. Talk about your center position and the injury there and the loss of
Mullins?  
COACH MATTA: I think that's the great thing. I don't have to sit up here and
talk about one-and-dones because I have no freshmen. I think in regards to our
center position, I think that Dallas Lauderdale with the break in his hand has
set us back a little bit. I think Dallas was -- had a great offseason. But I
do hope the surgery went well. It will be three weeks I think next Tuesday,
the surgery has happened.  
We've got him in doing things in practice. We put a quarterback jersey on him
where nobody can hit him. He's able to condition. The hand therapy is going
great. So hopefully we have him right around the opening of the season or
shortly thereafter.  
Kyle Madsen being a fifth-year senior, he knows the system. He knows his role
on the team and have been very pleased with his play and also adding a seven-
foot Zisis Sarikopoulos who sat out last year but has been able to practice
with us, we're pleased with what he brings to the table. Very cerebral
basketball player and knows what he needs to do to help us.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit more about just the impact of having David
Lighty back and what that adds to this team?  
COACH MATTA: As you look at David, and he's a guy that has won a Big Ten
championship, he's played for a national championship, a key role in a run to
the national championship game. He's a guy who has been in your program now
for four years.  
I think this: I think David Lighty is a strong candidate for Defender of the
Year. I think he's a great defender. The thing that I like is he started this
year he's really shooting the ball well and just he's a glue to a team that's
been through a lot of different situations in the time, in the games that he's
played at Ohio State.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 29, 2009

  

### [Todd Lickliter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16034)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Up next is head coach Todd Lickliter. Lickliter enters his
third season with the Hawkeyes and returns four starters from last year's
team.  
Coach, if you'd like to start with an opening statement, and then open up to
questions.  
COACH LICKLITER: Good morning. It's an exciting time. It's always exciting to
start a new season fresh and have new opportunity.  
Without even needing to be said, it's an incredible league. We have I think 22
out of the top 30 scorers back, we've got the All-Conference team, All-Members
back from the First Team. The systems are incredible.  
And the coaching is fantastic. It's a terrific challenge and one that really,
if you love the game, you appreciate it. So we're excited about the
opportunity. This year our veterans are still young, but it's fun.  
At least we have individuals that have a good understanding and a true
commitment that is necessary. I can see the results of their work in the
offseason just by the strength they've gained, and we have terrific
leadership.  
And you have to have leadership. And those leaders have to have an
understanding of what you want. And Jarryd Cole and Devan Bawinkel, Jarryd's a
junior and Devan's a senior, I think will provide the leadership we need. And
the sophomores we have returning that have a lot of game experience will
actually be veterans, and we've added to that a good recruiting class.  
So we're excited about the opportunities. We know that the expectations are
low, but if predictions always came true, then there would be no need to play
the games. And so that's the beauty of the sport. So we're looking forward to
the season and to the opportunities ahead.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Tom Izzo has said that the best thing for basketball in the Big Ten is
for football programs to do well, that's why he's been such a fan of Spartan
football. How much does Kirk Ferentz' 8-0 start help getting kids excited
about Iowa basketball?  
COACH LICKLITER: I love it because Kirk Ferentz does things. He's a great
coach, great program, and he makes you proud to be a Hawkeye. I think our
players appreciate the way they play, and so there's definitely excitement and
we just keep pulling for them. Keep playing. I just love their approach.  
So I don't know that it helps as far as the way we're going to play or
anything. Although, it gives you a vision of what needs to be done, there's no
question about that.  
If we could emulate their approach, I'd gladly do that.  
  
Q. Last year IU got its only Big Ten win against you guys, and obviously you
guys did a little bit better. What do you expect from that match-up this
year?  
COACH LICKLITER: I think every match-up is something that is so demanding, and
I told time last year I was really impressed with the way that his kids just
continued to fight and play. And you knew they were dangerous.  
We were a team that had very little margin of error. We won a few close ones.
But we had to play at a very -- at our highest level to be able to compete.
And so I give Indiana a lot of credit for the way they played that night. They
were a better team, without question.  
I think there were other games that they were in that they were very
dangerous. So I thought Tom did a great job with them. I think that that's a
game that we see it as just another challenge, just like the rest of the
opportunities in the Big Ten.  
  
Q. I was wondering about Devon Archie. First, exactly how did he hurt his
shoulder and how is his progress and how does this kind of prevent him from
grasping your system?  
COACH LICKLITER: Well, it's too bad, because you're always disappointed when
somebody's injured. It's so frustrating for them. And you're thankful that
it's not more serious, obviously.  
It goes to show how fragile it was. Because it was really a noncontact drill
and he just happened to lose his footing and fell back on his shoulder and had
-- I always hesitate to go into medical terms or aspects because I don't fully
understand everything that's happened, but the way I understand it is he
dislocated or separated his clavicle, which is pretty unique.  
They had to go back and set it. And now they've got to watch and make sure
that it stays without having to pin it or anything. And right now that's the
hope, and we don't have any reason to think it won't happen that way.  
Obviously it sets him back. He's going to be out four to six, maybe seven
weeks. But he's an eager learner, very bright, pays attention. And I know
he'll catch up. And I also know it's frustrating, disappointing for him. And
we miss him.  
But it's something that you deal with, and we've dealt with a lot of injuries
in the last couple of years, and that's something that I'm hoping this is the
last one for the year. That's for sure.  
  
Q. Is there any thought that you might have to redshirt him? I mean if this
lingers on past seven weeks?  
COACH LICKLITER: You can always -- that's not a decision we have to make right
now. And as long as he doesn't play, it's a decision that we can make. And
we'll just have to evaluate as we go.  
He is a player that his best years are ahead of him. He just keeps improving
every year. And so an extra year of college would not be detrimental to him,
but we're just going to have to see how quickly he progresses. And obviously
we'd have to talk with him about it and it's not something that we made a
decision on at this point.  
  
Q. With the way the Big Ten schedule falls off, some teams you play twice,
some once. Would you be in favor of just 20 games, play everyone twice?  
COACH LICKLITER: It's not something that I've done a lot of -- given a lot of
thought to, because it's not pressing. I've got bigger issues, to be honest
with you.  
But if we did that, then you've got to look at your nonconference schedule and
make sure that things fit accordingly. But I don't know that that's a problem.
Although I do think with the Big Ten conference tournament, 18 games, it's a
demanding schedule. Last year our schedule was ranked in one ranking 32nd in
the nation, when you're playing the best league, it is demanding.  
So it really almost doesn't matter what I think. If they decide to go to 20,
they'll go to 20. Right now it's 18. And we just accept it and prepare the
best we can. So it's not something I've given a lot of thought to.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 29, 2009

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Up next is Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo. The dean of the
Big Ten's coaches, Izzo enters his 15th season with the Spartans and returns
three starters from last year's team that went 31-7 and finished as the
national runner-up.  
Coach, we'll start with an opening statement and then open the floor for
questions.  
COACH IZZO: I wish last year were still here. But it's not. It's time to move
on. And you know hopefully we learned something from last year. We went
through a lot of adversity. Had three major illness or injuries during the
year that kind of set us back and yet if a team ever learned how to persevere
and kind of hang with it, with a lot of pressure on them to get to Detroit, I
think this team did.  
My biggest fear are two-fold. Number one, we lost more than I think people
give us credit for. When you lose the best defensive player in the year in
Travis Walton, who was also your best leader since maybe Mateen Cleaves,
that's a big loss.  
We had a walk-on defender who could guard anybody from six foot to six-six.  
And two, Suton was a loss because of his play, but he averaged nine points, or
ten points, nine rebounds, whatever, but he was a glue guy, he was a chemistry
guy.  
Maybe the third factor on that would be we lose Idong and Gray and in big
games when you needed a lot of bodies against big guys, they were great backup
guys that all of a sudden Idong plays 17 minutes against Pittman or Texas or
plays against the beat. Nothing else we had 10 follows to give, that was
worthwhile.  
So we lost 15 years of experience with those three guys, because they were all
three of those centers were fifth-year seniors. But I like what we have back,
too. The other issue would be I think the league's gotten three times better.  
I've been in the league now 26, 27th year as a GA on up. And I definitely
thought early it was great when I first got in with all those great coaches,
and then maybe we had a little bit of a lull. And then in '99, 2000, we had
two teams in the Final Four and I thought it was really good but I think this
is the best it's been since maybe that date.  
And because of that, I honestly see nine or 10, eight, nine teams that
realistically could win the league. And, yeah, some are better than others
right now. When you look at Purdue, Ohio State. I think Michigan is going to
be much improved. I think Illinois will be much improved. And Purdue, with
everybody back, we won it by four games last year, but understand Robbie
Hummel made a lot of that possible.  
And he's back healthy and Matt's done an incredible job with that program. And
you just start looking around. Bo's teams are always going to be good.
Northwestern, I mean, Bill's -- I told him I was going to put pressure on him.
This is his year to get there. And I think it is. I really honestly do.  
So top to bottom, the league is the best it's been in a long time and that's
going to leave a lot of great games and a lot of pressure on everybody night
in, night out.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. How is it going with finding a way to replace Suton and the guys that
backed him up?  
COACH IZZO: It continues to go. I'm just not sure if it's in a good way or bad
way. We have 100 minutes. Tom Herzog has played 100 minutes in two years. So
our experience went from the 15 years to 100 minutes.  
And yet he's improved. He's up to 250, seven-foot frame that doesn't look
great but it looks a lot better than it was when he was at 220 and 225. He's
made some progress. He's athletic and can shoot the ball.  
Derrick Nix, 340-pounder a year and a half ago; he's down to 277 and has made
incredible sides, especially since summer.  
And Garrick Sherman is a kid who you'd think you'd redshirt him most years, we
don't have that luxury, and yet every practice he's a very smart kid, he's
gotten better and better.  
So I think adequate, maybe. Find out a little bit more. But do have the
ability to go small some. But we'll have to go big, especially with some of
the teams we play early in the nonconference. I think that's one of our
negatives. We've always had the versatility to go big or small. And now our
bigs are completely unproven. And only time will tell.  
I can't even answer it yet because we haven't played against anybody or
scrimmaged even much ourselves.  
  
Q. You've always had the attitude play anybody, anywhere, anytime, and it's
hurt you from time to time that you only play some teams twice and others do
once. Would you just be in favor if everyone just played each other twice and
settle it on the court?  
COACH IZZO: You know, I do -- I look in this crowd and I see Steve Bartle back
there and I saw Jimmy Jackson. Back then when it was a true champion, I think
we all liked it better, to be honest with you. I just don't know if you could
play 22 conference games and get it done or 20, whatever it is. And 20 I
guess, and get it done and still be able to schedule some great nonconference.
It's a problem.  
I mean, it's an issue. I think we're better off now than we were from the
standpoint of only two games' difference, when it was four games difference
somebody could get a huge advantage.  
And so I think we're better off in that way but it's hard playing 18 games. I
thought the last year or so when you play 18 from 16, those two games seem
like ten sometimes, especially late in the year. These conference games are
just more grinding. There's more you do.  
I'd like to see a true champion, but I don't know if I could even vote for it
because I think we'd be beating ourselves up and I still think when you play
in a league like this, wins are important, too, at the end of the year,
because you're going to play so many good teams and it's so hard to win on the
road in this conference.  
  
Q. You said that you started as a GA 26 years ago. And now you're at the top
of your profession. Was the goal to get to this point in your career, or when
you got into it, did you say: Let me see where this takes me? What were your
thinking back then?  
COACH IZZO: Survival. I was thinking of getting through the first year or two.
Survival. I worked for Jud for 12 years. That's survival in itself (laughter).
And I was with Bruce Weber last night, and the Jud and Gene days, you know, us
two became great friends just out of survival there, too.  
But that taught me a lot because I had no dreams of getting it where it was at
right now or where we've gotten to. I just dreamed of trying to get it to be a
better program. And then as we had some success, I mean, now the goal is what
everybody's goal that had success, can you sustain it.  
And I've had 50 coaches tell me it's harder to get there than it is to stay
there. And I would have to -- I mean harder to stay there than get there,
excuse me. And I would have to agree with that. It is harder. And yet it's a
challenge that it's fun to meet and now our deal is try to grow a program, not
just a team.  
And I kind of like that. As evident by the 200-some guys we had come back for
the Final Four last year, former players.  
I look at the great programs and you see it even more in football. That's what
I love about it. When you've got people coming back and you realize that it's
not for one team, but it's for your program. That's the next goal. That's the
next step. And still somewhere in there I'd like to win another championship
for our university.  
  
Q. You yourself just talked up the Big Ten and on paper we have all these
teams that are ranked. We've got all these players coming back. Good season or
bad season to be picked No. 1 in the league?  
COACH IZZO: (Chuckling) you know, I like being picked high, because that's
where I'd like to end up. So I probably would complain about you guys orphans
picking us high. I look at it, I love Purdue right now. They've got everybody
back. I think Matt's done a great job. I think some of those other teams have
more back than we have.  
But I like the fact that maybe some of it is respect for the program. Maybe
some of it is somebody's got to be picked 1. I could see somebody picked 1 or
5 and not be much different.  
But I kind of like it. I kind of like it because it means that our program's
in the right spot. And the pressure, even though I complain about all you or
all our fans, you don't put as much on as I do. So it's good. It's good and I
think it's good for our league that we've got five, six teams ranked in the
top 25, maybe seven or even eight in the top 35, 40.  
One thing I learned from the guys, I mean, it was Knight and Keady and
Heathcote and Henson and Davis and Clem Haskins. Those guys were all 15-year-
plus guys when I first got in the league and they believed in the Big Ten. And
it's hard when you have a lot of transitions.  
I think the coaches we have right now in this league, I'm prejudiced, but I
think are the best any league can put together anywhere. If you look to the
top to bottom. And so being a Big Ten guy, too, I think it's good, and I think
it's good for Michigan State.  
I'm probably going to have after five losses somewhere just when we get to the
nonconference, I'll probably say it's awful. But just take that for a grain of
salt.  
  
Q. You raised your eyebrows when the moderator said you were the dean of Big
Ten coaches. Does that surprise you sometimes when you think of it that way?
It doesn't seem like it's been that long?  
COACH IZZO: I think what's amazing is to me I've had some incredible things
happen since I've been a head coach here. At our own university, we've had a
lot of ADs and football coaches and in the league there's been more teams that
have had three new coaches. Not two, three. And there's 13, 14 years I've been
a head coach. So I guess I appreciate surviving.  
But I don't look at it as I'm definitely not any more experienced than some,
and I don't really -- I've just been in the same league. There's some guys in
this league now when you bring Tubby in and John Beilein in that have done it
in the other leagues that have had experience more than I do as a head coach.  
I've just got more years in in the Big Ten, and I have to say I'm proud of
that and excited about it. But it doesn't put me in any different place. Bruce
Weber, like I said, we've been friends for 20-some years, and he knows more
about the league than I do. He was in it a couple years longer.  
  
Q. Pick your brain as a coach and historian. Five juniors are on the Pre-
Season All-Big Ten team. Where does this junior class rate from not just
Michigan State but in the Big Ten as a class?  
COACH IZZO: I think it rates high. But I think we always look to the present.
As I look back at some of the teams and look at some of the guys in this room
that were on some of those teams, you know, there were times, Michigan,
Illinois, Indiana, seemed like they had five on their own team that were that
good.  
There were just incredible teams and we have a tendency to look at what we
have now. I mean, I definitely feel good about it as far as for a league. I
feel bad about it as far as a coach because they've got to play against four
of those other guys.  
But I think it's great for the league and yet it's hard for me to put it in
perspective because I feel like I've been here and, man, I could name some
great players back 20 years ago, 25 years ago when I first was a GA, there
were some incredible teams.  
But to keep five sophomores and now have five juniors that all stayed, that
was getting to be a problem, too, everybody was leaving. I think it speaks
volumes for what guys want to accomplish. I think guys are starting to look at
-- one thing I loved about Cleaves and Peterson when I had them, we had the
big run last year and we had the big cause of Detroit in the state of
Michigan.  
But if I was a fan, North Carolina had the best cause. Guys stayed in school
to win a basketball championship. Cleaves and Peterson stayed in school to win
a championship. They want to be like Magic, win one in college, win one in the
NBA, win one in the Olympics.  
We don't have a lot of that anymore. So right now I hope our fans enjoy these
guys because a lot of them are doing that and that's being here for the right
reason, winning a championship, getting closer to your degree and I'm proud of
all five of those guys even the ones I don't like much which are the other
four.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 29, 2009

  

### [Ed DeChellis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17001)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Up next is Penn State head coach Ed DeChellis. DeChellis enters
his seventh year at the helm of the Lions and welcomes back three starters
from last year's team that won the National Invitational Tournament.  
If you'd like to start with an opening statement, then we'll open it up to
questions.  
COACH DECHELLIS: Another year. Great league. Everybody back. We have four,
five teams back in the top 20 today. Very competitive, it's -- in my seven
years probably as it's ever been.  
We're very, very excited about it and looking forward to it and it will be
here shortly.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Nowadays in college athletics some coaches only get three years to
rebuild a program. Congratulations on the offseason for you, but could you
talk about the fact that Penn State is letting you build and let you build
up?  
COACH DECHELLIS: Well, yeah, everybody's philosophy's a little bit different,
I guess, and where you start from.  
We started from ground zero. We think we've made progress every year. We like
the direction we're going. Our recruiting efforts have been much better. We're
finally recruiting players in the 2011-2012 classes that we were never able to
do before because we were always trying to play catch-up. Now we feel we're on
solid ground and moving forward.  
We like the direction we're going and obviously the university likes the
direction we're going in.  
  
Q. Do you have particular guys who are going to replace Pringle and Cornley,
or is it more by committee?  
COACH DECHELLIS: I don't know if you replace, Cornley's numbers were very
good, but more important for us, Jamelle's presence, his toughness, his
spirit, the command of the locker room that he had is most important. I'm
hoping Talor Battle can provide that leadership that Jamelle provided in the
past.  
I think the U.S.A. Basketball experience for Talor, he's playing with a lot of
confidence. So I'm hoping that he can be that spiritual emotional leader that
Jamelle was.  
The numbers on the floor, we think that our front line's improved. We think
our players have improved in Andrew Jones, Jeff Brooks, David Jackson, we
think all those three guys have improved.  
And Andrew Ott, the young guy that transferred in last year, has probably had
the best camp of almost anybody on our team other than Talor this fall so far.
So we hope he's showing improvement.  
So I don't know who the one guy is, but we're hoping by committee that we can
take care of the front line. The back court, Chris Babb has played well, our
freshman last year, sophomore, who played at times. We think he's done a nice
job in the summer and in the fall he's practiced pretty well.  
We like our freshman guard Tim Frazier from Texas. I see him playing quite a
number of minutes, if things go and he continues to play how he's played in
the fall so far. He's done a nice job.  
And with him and Battle on the back court together you have two very, very
fast athletic players who we feel can spread the floor, hopefully and make it
a little easier for the other guys offensively.  
  
Q. Ed, Jamelle gets a lot of the we're going to miss him, but Pringle,
Pringle did so many different things really well or maybe the best on the team
for your on-ball defense and 3-point shooting, and he was the one guy who
could break the press and just everything, did the pull-up shot. Is there any
conceivable way you can replace all that stuff, even with all -- tell me about
Frazier, his ability to do some of those things, maybe.  
COACH DECHELLIS: Pringle was such a solid guy for us. He was a guy, kind of an
unsung hero. He just played hard every night. Worked hard every day in
practice. Tremendous 3-point shooter, very athletic, very fast, could defend
on the ball. He did some great things for us.  
I think Tim Frazier, the freshman, it's not fair to compare, but he has the
ability to do that. He is probably faster than Stanley with the ball. He's
probably more athletic than Stanley. Hard to believe. He's not the shooter
that Stanley is. And he's not defensively he's not there because he's a
freshman.  
But offensively he can really push the ball. He can use ball screens very
well. He's a better drive/kick guy than Stanley was passing the ball. But
Stanley made so many big shots for us and big defensive stops that Tim will be
able to do in time. Just as a freshman he's not there yet defensively.  
  
Q. How difficult is it to make headway in this league especially in a year
like this where it looks so tough top to bottom?  
COACH DECHELLIS: Making headway is -- I was talking to coaches last night, and
you could be an 8-and-10 team in this league this year and be very, very good
in terms of a conference record.  
Moving up, you know, you kind of look at it in the spring and summer, okay,
who are we going to jump over. But I think you continue to do what you gotta
do and work hard and stay the course. I think this year it will be like every
other year, the team who you play and when you play them, who has the flu, who
has got some sickness, who has got some injuries, and you get by somebody
because maybe somebody wasn't at full speed.  
All those things, unfortunately, are part of the game. But the league is as
good as it's been from top to bottom. Good players. So to making that jump,
you just never know how you're going to jump. Can't get too high. Can't get
too low. And there's nobody to point to that says I think we can get them at
home or here's a win here. There's none of those. So you better be ready 18
nights.  
  
Q. You've got a schedule this year that a nonconference schedule that makes
a lot more sense than the one last year. What did you go through with your new
guy? He's not your old guy, not your old schedule-maker, and how much input
did you have in that?  
COACH DECHELLIS: Well, we tried to upgrade. But I know the year before we
didn't make the schedule not to make the tournament. We thought some teams
were going to be better, they just weren't. And we played the odds again. We
scheduled some teams who were pretty good last year and have good RPIs and we
expect them to hopefully do the same thing that they did last year or play a
little better.  
If they do, the schedule looks pretty good. If we have some teams that don't,
they get some guys hurt, they have some difficulties, then all that can
change.  
But I think we're playing a good schedule. I think the tournament in
Charleston will be good for us as well, playing hopefully a Miami team and a
South Carolina team, a Tulane, South Florida, some good teams in that as well.
Virginia, Virginia Tech, Temple. And we think our schedule is solid. It will
be more challenging, the teams are better and hopefully we can come out of it
with a positive nonconference record and head into the Big Ten season.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 29, 2009

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Indiana head coach Tom Crean. Crean enters his second season
with the Hoosiers and returns nine letter winners from last year's team.  
Coach, if you'd like to start with an opening statement, and then we'll open
it up for questions.  
COACH CREAN: Hello, everyone. I think right now the best thing for all Indiana
is that we're on the upswing. When we're in practice, when we're recruiting,
when we're planning, we really feel good about the direction, and the team is
getting better. The program's moving forward. The program has always been in
great shape. It's just that our teams are going to take a little time to get
back up to speed.  
But we're really trying to be focused I think for the most part on three
things right now as we start our season. And number one, the biggest thing for
us right now is to sustain energy, effort, a level of competition. That's the
stuff that you have to work so hard with, with a young team.  
And they have great attitudes, but they just don't know how hard they have to
work for how long they have to work and at the level they have to work. So
that's definitely taken some time.  
I think, number two, we're trying to focus on them trying to understand
exactly what Indiana basketball means to us in the sense of how we want it to
be on the court, the style of play that we want to have, the ability to be up-
tempo, the ability to get the ball up the court after misses and makes on the
break, the relentlessness that goes into being an excellent rebounding team
and a steadfast defensive team and the ball movement that has to go on the
offensive end. So we're working hard on that.  
I think another big thing we never want to lose sight of, and this was the one
thing that became very apparent last year to our guys, is that it's a constant
quest and desire for improvement. And irregardless if it's practice,
individual instruction sessions right now that we're using with them and
during the mornings or at night, that they are constantly being monitored and
measured and pushed and prodded to get better.  
And not only improve as a team on the practice court, and hopefully in the
games, but improve as individual players throughout the season.  
So those are the three biggest things that we're focused on. We see
competition at every position right now. And unfortunately Jeremiah Rivers is
not on this trip. I'm sure J.D. might have made that clear. He sustained an
injury yesterday in his face in a pick-and-roll situation. He ran into an
elbow and we decided to keep him back, let him fully recover.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. For a team on the upswing, how difficult is it to move up in this league,
given the state of it right now?  
COACH CREAN: Well, I think upswing in relevance to us is that we feel like
every part of it is better. But that really may not be relevant to where the
rest of the league is. When you look at this morning there's five teams in the
U.S.A. Today top 25 that are in the top 20, and then we look at the teams
we're playing in the nonconference, there's no question it's going to be a
challenge to move forward.  
Everybody is well coached. Everybody has players back or teams back that are
incredibly balanced or have that style power.  
So there's no question that it's going to be hard to move up. But that's not
our focus right now. The focus is how much better we can improve and let's see
where that takes us.  
  
Q. Kind of following up on that, you were in the Big East for a while. Does
it feel somewhat similar to that in the ability to move up and kind of the
struggle there?  
COACH CREAN: They're two different leagues, and really I haven't been in this
league long enough to compare the two. So it wouldn't be relevant from where I
sit.  
But the Big East was outstanding, is outstanding, with a lot of excellent
basketball teams and certainly the big ten. This year especially on paper as
we go into the season looks to be as good as any league with what you look at
in the form of coaches, returners, pass successes, things of that nature.  
  
Q. Would you be in favor of a 20-game Big Ten schedule so everyone just
plays each other twice and no one gets an advantage of having to play one
person once?  
COACH CREAN: I never really thought of that. So I really couldn't answer that
at this point.  
  
Q. Can you describe the relationship you have now with the high school
coaches, how have you been received and how do you feel your recruiting in the
state of Indiana is coming along?  
COACH CREAN: I think it's really growing. I think it goes without saying that
over a period of time we might have lost a generation not only of fans but of
recruits. And I think we were products of this at Marquette in our recruiting
of Dominic James. Good, bad or indifferent, a lot of very good players have
left the state. And that's still happening to a degree.  
There were a few players in the 10 class that we really never had an
opportunity to recruit for one reason or another. There were some others that
chose to go other places, some that we chose not to recruit. But what we're
trying to do in the classes of 11, 12, 13, moving forward, is really be
factors in their recruiting and their lives and getting them on campus and
being in to see them.  
I mean, there were numerous ninth and tenth graders last year that we maxed
out our seven looks on. And a lot of those cases I personally made those seven
looks. So we're trying to really get it established between myself as the head
coach, outstanding staff that I have, that we really want to be -- we want it
to be the Indiana that their coaches and the high school coaches that you
referenced to have grown up on, that their parents are used to seeing.  
And it's going to take some time to get that because some other programs have
come into the state and done an outstanding job. Purdue's done an outstanding
job. Notre Dame's done an outstanding job. Look at what Butler and some of the
other schools in the state have done, and then you've got people all across
the country that have come into the state.  
So we're certainly not going to get them all, but I think as time goes on I
have no doubt that we'll be a major factor again in the state and people will
want to have their players at Indiana.  
  
Q. Bruce Weber talked about the league being a little bit better this year,
and it seems like a lot of that strength is at the guard position. So what do
you expect to see?  
COACH CREAN: Bruce Weber said what about the league?  
  
Q. He's talking about the league getting a little bit better this year and
it seems like a lot of that strength is at the guard position. What do you
expect to see from that?  
COACH CREAN: I think again it's a balanced league. I think it's balanced with
teams. I think it's balanced with front line and guard play, and certainly
when you look at some of the guards in this league, you know, and he's got one
and certainly Michigan State with Kalin Lucas and Manny Harris, we can go down
the line.  
I don't have enough time to go down every guard with the next coach coming on.
But there's no question there's great guard play. You've got as good a swing
man in the country as there is in Evan Turner, and the front lines get a lot
of credit probably in the Midwest from year to year in the Big Ten, but they
probably don't get enough credit nationally.  
So I think from top to bottom this league is full of star power. It's full of
the balance that we're talking about, and it's hard to look on the schedule
and see any team that doesn't have a guard that can't carry their team.  
  
Q. How bad is Jeremiah's injury? And is this another one you can blame on
Tijan or --  
COACH CREAN: No, this just happened in practice. Actually it's the other part,
Bawa Muniru got hit himself, so he's learning from Tijan. They're buddies,
but, no, it was -- he was on his own team. He was setting a pick and roll in
the corner and it just was a very tightly contested play and it was just an
accident.  
But Tijan's made enormous strides. He really has. He's challenging for a spot
in the rotation and that will surprise those of you that saw us play last
year. But once you see him play some more this year, it may not surprise you
as well. And Bawa continues to learn a great deal. And, again, it's all part
of the competition of the team. And it's part of that tough play in practice.
But this was totally an accident.  
  
Q. The fact that all the First Team members were all sophomores last year
and they all came back for their junior season, are we starting to see a
change in the tide as far as kids staying in school longer instead of going
pro early?  
COACH CREAN: No, I think every case is different. I think as soon as you start
to think that it's going to be one way or it's going to be -- it's going to be
status quo, it will change in a heartbeat.  
Every case is different. And I'm sure that every player that stayed in
college, whether it's the Big Ten or other places, that were considering going
pro, you can certainly say that academics probably played a part in some of
it.  
But I'm sure draft status and opportunity to move up and that probably had
something to do with it as well.  
  
Q. In terms of Devan Dumes, how does he look and what are you looking for
from him?  
COACH CREAN: He's banged up. We had five guards out at one point in time
yesterday in practice, including Verdell who rolled his ankle but is still
here today.  
Devan tweaked his leg the other day. Maybe the practices are more physical
than I realized. But he's made improvements. His ball handling is not what I
hoped it would be at this point. But he missed some time in the summer when he
had knee surgery.  
But it's a great learning experience for our players right now that it's a
365-day-a-year improvement task. And if you're not up to it, somebody is.  
And with that being said, Devan has made strides. He's made strides in trying
to understand what we want. But it's really a matter of everybody really being
on the same page, knowing that we're going to move the basketball. We're going
to share the basketball. We're not going to overdribble.  
We had a situation Sunday night at the end of practice, and then all through
Monday -- you know, some coaches take the practice jerseys away, some coaches
take the locker room away when they're not playing well, we took the dribble a
way because we were a dribbling-abusive team at that point, and not just Devan
but numerous guys.  
And we just have to learn how to play. And Devan's in the same position. But
he's capable. He can defend at a high level. He's proven that he can get
points in this league. He can make shots. And we just need our entire team to
stay really focused on how the team gets better.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Bill Carmody](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16994)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Bill Carmody is entering his tenth season with the
Wildcats and welcomes back four starters from last year and earned a berth
into the post-season NIT.  
Coach, we'll start with an opening statement and then questions.  
COACH CARMODY: It's nice being back, seeing some familiar faces, some
unfamiliar ones. But we've had almost two weeks of practice. And November's a
funny time, because you start doing one thing, you're working on defense and
then you want to move to the next thing but you don't know if you really have
it down.  
So it's a screwy time, actually. We do have a veteran team. We lost Craig
Moore, who led the Big Ten in 3-point shooting a couple of years in a row. But
we have some young guys who I think are improved. And we had a positive year
last year. People are excited about it because we beat some pretty good teams.
But those teams also beat us. And now we have to back it up and do better than
splitting with teams.  
We were 8-10 in the conference. And you have to do better than that. You shoot
for winning your home games and stealing some on the road, and I think that's
a pretty good formula for success. And going from post-season NIT to finally
making it to the NCAA.  
So we're excited. The guys look pretty good so far. And just getting going,
trying to take care of business day to day.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. How are the sophomores and the freshmen looking now that you're a couple
weeks into official practice?  
COACH CARMODY: We started two freshmen last year, Kyle Rowley and Johnny
Shurna. Rowley broke a bone in his foot in the summer and he's just getting
back now. But he played a lot this summer, and I think he's really going to
help us.  
Shurna, as some of you may know, made the Under-19 team that went to New
Zealand and won the gold medal. He is confident about his ability, looks good.
And Luka Mirkovic added about 15, 18 pounds and is playing that way, much more
physically than he did last year. And then go along with those guys and Kevin
Coble, Mike Thompson, and Jeremy Nash. Things look pretty decent. There's some
depth there.  
I think in years before this maybe our ninth guy wasn't -- there was a big
drop-off between 5, 8 and 9, and I don't think that's the case this year. I
think we can go a little deeper this year, and so I'm looking forward to that.  
  
Q. I know you have a lot of kids from Chicago, as does Bruce Weber. But a
lot of them get away. How hard is it to recruit and keep kids in state?  
COACH CARMODY: Well, I mean, years ago when I came here, I don't think we had
any Chicago kids. I'm trying to think. I don't think so. And so we sort of
made it a priority to try to get Chicago kids and also the suburbs, because
you're getting good players in the near suburbs now.  
I don't think the teams are quite as good, generally speaking, but the players
are. There's one or two players that are very good. So we sort of -- we're
trying to mine that a little bit.  
And Chicago is a hotbed of basketball. So you're not keeping other coaches out
of it. So you just have to show them what you have and try and get on them
early, like any kind of recruiting.  
And you hope they see the benefits of your school over other schools that come
in usually a little later than you do because you've had access to them
earlier, probably.  
  
Q. Bill, it used to be that kids were being recruited as juniors and
seniors. Now they're being recruited as eighth graders, ninth graders. Is this
a healthy thing for the NCAA for them to step in and do something about that?
Or do you think that this is just the way that it's going?  
COACH CARMODY: I don't think it's healthy. And it is the way it's going. And
I'm not sure the solution, I mean, what to do. But can you limit it to high
school kids? Because you have to recruit freshmen.  
You have to at least introduce them to your schools. Things have accelerated
over the last ten years, five years, even three years. You're playing so much
AU basketball now you play 25 games in your high school schedule probably in
the summer they play, summer and spring they play 75 games. So kids are
getting better sooner.  
And because they're playing against different, better competition. And just
playing more games. And so I don't know what the answer is. But like I said I
don't think it is healthy. I don't really think it's healthy to recruit
freshmen. But it's just the way it's gone.  
  
Q. Tom Izzo just said this is the year for you guys to make the tournament.
There's a lot of that talk. Do you welcome that pressure?  
COACH CARMODY: Yeah, I don't think it's that much pressure. If you have some
good players, which I think we do, we look forward to it. That's why you're
here. There's 330 Division I teams and that's everyone's goal right now to get
in the NCAA. And we're just really looking forward to it. It's going to be a
tough year in the conference. That's the only thing.  
I think we have probably one of our better teams coming up. But just looking
around from top to bottom that the league is very strong and so it's going to
be difficult. But I don't see it's really pressure. I think the guys sort of
embrace that.  
  
Q. Where does Drew Crawford factor into the rotation at this point?  
COACH CARMODY: Drew Crawford is a true freshman from Naperville. We lost Moore
who is a long-range shooter. Drew makes shots, but he's not the kind of
shooter that Craig is. But I think I'm going to throw him in there because
he's a pretty athletic kid. He can score -- makes a jump shot. Gets to the
basket a little bit. Gets a few rebounds, couple blocked shots.  
I think he's going to be a very good player for us. So might have to live with
a few mistakes here and there early, but I like the way he goes about his
business. Smart kid, tough kid, and I think he's going to help us.  
  
Q. After missing the tournament last season, did you feel like your
nonconference schedule you could have used maybe some tougher opponents or do
you think you put together a schedule properly?  
COACH CARMODY: I don't think that it matters. I think we had a pretty tough
out of conference schedule. You play 30 games and 19 or 20 of them -- 19 are
against -- if you just play one game in the Big Ten tournament against
conference foes and then you have the Big Ten-ACC challenge, and we had DePaul
last year and Stanford. We had some pretty decent teams in there, and Florida
State in the challenge.  
I think we lost a couple of games that we sort of gave away and that was the
difference.  
But you try to -- every program is at a different stage. So you're trying to
balance that out wins and tough schedule and RPI and all that kind of stuff.  
But I think that last year we hit it just about right. And I think if we held
on to a couple of leads, I think we would have gotten into the tournament last
year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 29, 2009

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Next up, Michigan head coach John Beilein. He welcomes back
four starters from last year's squad, including Pre-Season All-Big Ten
selection Manny Harris.  
Coach, we'll start with an opening statement and then open the floor for
questions.  
COACH BEILEIN: We're excited to get the season going. I think we're really
playing an attractive schedule that will be demanding out of conference, and
then when we have the 18 Big Ten games now and the depth of talent in
returning players in the Big Ten, it may be one of the most challenging
schedules I personally have ever played and maybe Michigan's ever played in a
long time.  
But we're going after it. And we're excited about it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. You've been able to rebuild the program just by letting the guys know
they can trust in you. They talk about your influence on them and several
Michigan high school coaches have talked about that. Would you talk about the
trust factor that you've built back at Michigan?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think it's the way we've tried to coach for a long time that
really if you have a relationship, really strong relationships with your
players, that they will, they'll usually -- adds a lot of credibility.  
You use those old adages. I hate to use the cliches, but they don't care how
much they know until they know how much you care. Rules without relationships
equals rebellion. Those are two that we use all the time. But you have to
build those relationships and then you have that trust.  
So it's just the thing that we've always done as a coach. And hopefully it's
one of the things that can make our program special. And I don't think we're
alone in this. I think a lot of coaches, successful coaches do the same thing.  
  
Q. One of the kids on your team, Zack Novak, could you talk about his
development from when he came on campus. He was suspended one game and all
that just talk about how he's developed not only on the court but as a
person.  
COACH BEILEIN: First of all, he's in the business school. He's been admitted
to the business school at the University of Michigan, which is a great honor
to him.  
He is a wonderful kid whose body has really changed from probably being a
225-pound probably just slightly overweight, small forward, whatever position
is, he's sort of a hybrid of doing a lot of things. He played the two-man and
four-man for us last year. Not too many people get to do those two tasks.  
And he's really just -- he's done a great job of being a leader. As a
sophomore I would say he's one of our leaders, and it gives us a great
combination of a kid who can shoot and a kid who can really do a lot of the
glue-type of things to keep a team going.  
He dives on the floor probably more than anybody. Takes charges as much as
anybody. Those are winning plays that win games. Everybody looks at the scores
and the rebounds and all those type of things. Sometimes there's a lot of
winning plays in there that separate us from the other team.  
  
Q. You obviously have this program turning in the right direction. There's a
lot of positives, a lot of high expectations this year. Because of the recent
past and the struggles this program went through to get to this point, have
you told the kids: You know, let's not get too high on this thing, let's be a
little cautious going into this season?  
COACH BEILEIN: You know, I wrote them a letter at the beginning of the year or
just before we got here about how this was -- we're still hunting. Until we
can get Michigan to point where they're in the NCAA tournament, this is normal
to be in the NCAA tournament, we haven't turned anything around yet. I think
that's where Michigan belongs. If you're in the tournament every year, dang
it, you've got a chance of winning it.  
That's where we want to go, sustain the program. So this is the second year
with a very aggressive schedule, that's what we have to do. So I don't think
we've lost that hunger or anybody's thinking about last year as much as
saying, hey, hopefully we have a good team and we're going to be playing with
the big boys all year long and let's see what we can do.  
  
Q. With the ethics committee stuff and the board of directors voting today,
kind of what's your take on what has initially been proposed?  
COACH BEILEIN: Boy, there's so many things. Overall, I was in favor of many of
the things that they're going to vote about today, but I can't be too
specific. But I think we're making progress in some pretty significant areas,
I think, according to what we'll see what happens to that.  
  
Q. You played a tough schedule last year with UCLA and Duke. Could you just
talk about the value of playing some of those tough teams in the nonconference
portion of the schedule?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think when you have the right team, there's great value in
it. When you don't have the right team, it can really ruin the confidence of
your team. I think teams have to be very careful about when they do schedule
like this.  
And it usually comes down to the last couple of games who you're going to
play. Are you going to bring in a guaranteed game or are you going to take on
another difficult team.  
And really one of the reasons we do it to make sure that we get -- we've had
UCLA at Chrysler. Duke at Chrysler. Now it's UCONN at Chrysler and the
following year it will be Kansas at Chrysler.  
That's the back end of things. And in the meantime you have to go to Allen
Fieldhouse and try to get a W. But I think we have enough of those games that
it gives our kids a great taste. It's just difficult that we've had to space
one in the second semester.  
It looks like we may continue to do that. But we've got to be very careful of
that because of how tough the Big Ten schedule is in the second semester.  
  
Q. Do you worry about the NBA talk with Manny Harris and a little bit with
DeShawn Sims being a distraction? Or have those guys handled that stuff
well?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think if you frame that correctly it could be a great
motivator for them that you want to -- we want our guys, if they're going to
be going to the NBA want to have careers in the NBA. In order to have careers
in the NBA there's a lot of things that you need to be able to do, whether
it's getting all your assignments in on time and doing all the tests that you
have to do off the court of handling your personal business is a big thing.  
So you use that as part of this. This is going to help you if you're fortunate
enough to have that opportunity. So we try to use it as a positive there. And
some days you want them to practice like there's NBA scouts all over your
practice. But, then again, in games you may want them to play like there is no
NBA.  
This is your only opportunity to play basketball, make the most of it because
it's right here and right now is really what's most important.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what you feel the conference schedule is like right
now? Is there too many games? Too few games with the 18-game schedule?  
COACH BEILEIN: It's been difficult for us, because we have -- the opportunity
to be on CBS TV with a big game in the second semester has really cramped ours
together. I particularly am not in favor of the times where you play -- I
think this year we have -- let me see how does it go again.  
It starts on a Sunday and then it's a Wednesday, then it's a Saturday, and
then it's a Tuesday. There's like five games in a row. And it's very difficult
to go through those stretches with the amount of travel that we have to do.  
At the same time, everybody's doing it. And everybody has -- you know
sometimes when you're playing somebody, it's not who you're playing, it's
where you're playing them and when you're playing them that really will make a
difference in some games.  
So it is difficult. But thank goodness we have -- I was with Gene Keady last
night and they're talking about playing a Thursday-Saturday game, leaving on
Wednesday and coming back Sunday. So those are tough days, too.  
It's part of this league with the footprint that we have that there's a lot of
travel involved. We're very fortunate to be able to do it mostly with charter
planes and quick bus trips.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [JaJuan Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18331)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  65  
Ohio State - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, want to give us an opening statement and we'll go to
questions for the players.  
COACH PAINTER: I was proud of the guys' effort tonight. I think we did a good
job of playing hard. I felt good about the way we played at halftime. We
didn't make our free throws, we didn't make some open shots but we were
getting rebounds, we were taking care of the basketball.  
In the second half we did a lot of the same thing. We out-rebounded by 11 for
the game and had five fewer turnovers than them, only turned the ball over
seven times. Constantly giving ourselves a chance with 18 offensive rebounds
and seven turnovers, and that was a key part of the game, staying with it and
playing hard and getting stops.  
I thought Ohio State was making some tough shots coming off down screens and
curls. Evan Turner is a tough matchup. He's a tough guard. Buford is a guy
that can make shots and Diebler has great range. I thought our guys did a
great job of staying with things through the whole game and not getting their
heads down and continue to play and make shots.  
  
Q. E'Twaun, you guys were down a point, like 38-37,and the ball had not been
going in the hole and then all of a sudden it was just that baby must have
looked like a huge hole up there. Talk about the zone you kind of got in and
how you were finding seams to shoot the ball against that zone?  
E'TWAUN MOORE: First of all, my teammates, they did a good job of distributing
it, finding the open spots. But Coach also drew up a few plays out of the
zone. I can't tell you the play; I might spill out a secret.  
There were a few plays. So like they make the big man come out. And that's
hard for that big man to cover, and outside. Just gave me a couple of open
looks. After I hit the first one, gave me confidence because before that I had
missed like two. When I hit the first one, gave me a lot of confidence to step
up and knock down the next few.  
  
Q. Talk about being Big Ten Tournament champions and is this by far the
highlight of your basketball career?  
ROBBIE HUMMEL: Yes, I definitely would say so. It was a great feeling to watch
those seconds tick off the clock, and, I mean, in my basketball career I know
-- I can't say for E'Twaun or of them -- I guess I've won at youth
tournaments, but I've never really won a championship in a really structured,
organized basketball league. So it feels really good.  
  
Q. Rob, it's been an interesting journey for you, preseason choice Big Ten
Player of the Year and then you get hurt and you get sick. Rough at the end
and then you come back and you're the tournament MVP. In addition to winning
the championship, could you talk a little bit about giving everything you
personally have experienced, what this means to you to be Big Ten MVP?  
ROBBIE HUMMEL: That's a great honor for me. I think there's two guys sitting
next to me that are definitely capable, deserving of winning that award. And
that doesn't even go for the other guys in this league that are capable of it,
too. I think a lot of guys really stepped up and played well in this
tournament. So it's an honor to me.  
  
Q. E'Twaun, will you compare this to winning the state title here a few
years ago?  
E'TWAUN MOORE: Yeah, you sort of get that same feeling. But it's on the
biggest stage, of course, it's college instead of high school. So every moment
is different. But it definitely felt great to come out here and win a
championship here.  
  
Q. JaJuan, you were down 38-37 with 10 minutes to go. I looked at the stat
monitor, you were 12-of-42 from the field at that time. Yet you're down one
point. Could you talk about probably how your defense saved you today, and
would you agree that at that point the defense had saved you?  
JAJUAN JOHNSON: Defense definitely saved us. We did a good job of limiting the
other team to one shot. We were real solid on the defensive end. We knew if we
just kept staying solid on defensive end eventually our shots would fall in.
And that's what happened tonight and that's how we ended up winning.  
  
Q. Rob, this would seem like the perfect way for you guys to be planning to
go into the NCAA Tournament. Can you just talk about the excitement level of
today and kind of springing forward to next week?  
ROBBIE HUMMEL: I think it's a good momentum builder for us going into the
tournament. I think it's great we're able to win three in a row especially
with the way we finished the year. I think we're all excited to go into the
tournament with that winning streak.  
  
Q. Rob, just take us through your reaction and the team's when you found out
you're 5th seed going to Portland and what do you think about the seed?
Fair?  
ROBBIE HUMMEL: Definitely. I think we're all really excited. I don't think a
whole lot of us have been to Portland. So that will be interesting. But I
don't know a whole lot about Northern Iowa, haven't seen them play a whole
lot. I know they did well in their conference, though. It should be a tough
matchup for us.  
  
Q. E'Twaun, Coach Keady used to tell me it's not who you play but when you
play them. And a week ago this team was struggling to put the ball in the
basket and a week later, can you talk about how funny the game can be and
truly it is sometimes not who you play but when you play them?  
E'TWAUN MOORE: Definitely. Any team can win on any given night. Sometimes you
think the ball should go in for you, shoot the same shots that you normally
shoot that's wide open, like, dang, why the ball ain't falling? And this game
seem you can miss and hit everything. So every night is different and you have
to be ready each and every day.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Matt, I'll ask you the same question. I looked at the stat monitor, it's
38-37 and you're 12-of-42. You're not sitting over there staring at the stat
monitor, but you had to be aware we're not shooting the ball very well but
we're within a point. You had to have felt pretty good at that point knowing
that maybe you had a run left in you?  
COACH PAINTER: I felt great. Really the whole game. You can't base your
feelings or have a pulse on the game whether the balls go in or not. You just
have to take good shots. I thought we were taking some good shots obviously
against the zone. May not get as many shots as you would like inside.  
That's what we tried to work towards, get JaJuan on the inside for one-on-one
play against their zone. I thought we had to grind it. When the ball wasn't
going in for us, and just continue to stay positive, and hopefully some of
those shots would go in and obviously it did.  
And as we started to make more shots, so did they, it seemed like. Evan Turner
started to get loose a little bit, and when he wasn't going, Buford was going.
But I thought at that point in the game we were in a good position, but so was
Ohio State, whoever could step up and make a couple shots there and get a
little momentum was probably going to win the game.  
  
Q. Coach, ironically enough Indiana has not been very good to Purdue as far
as this tournament goes with the past results. Congratulations on getting to
the end here. Did you feel that your team was physical enough even though
that's not really your style tonight, because you really didn't -- you ran the
ball but you weren't able to run them off the court and you still managed to
win despite the fact you didn't get the big lead early?  
COACH PAINTER: I think really a key to Ohio State's win against Michigan State
was they're going back into that zone, and it limited some of their transition
looks. And so we knew with them falling back into the zone we wouldn't get as
many transition looks. We still tried to attack and push the basketball. But
they did a good job with their transition defense and getting set.  
I thought our guys did a good job in the half court. I thought we got some
quality shots. It is difficult against that zone when they have that kind of
size at the basket and they have that kind of length on the perimeter. They do
a good job when you are open of closing that gap and contesting shots.  
And I thought our guys really did some good things and adjusted to it. But I
thought we had some good looks early in the game. Their shots just didn't go
down.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts on being a 5 seed, what does it say about you win
a Big Ten Tournament, you're a 5 seed? Also if you win that first game you
play Washington in Portland.  
COACH PAINTER: I think, first of all, we feel good about just being in the
tournament. I think there's a lot of good basketball teams that are not in the
NCAA Tournament. And in terms of seeds and where things fall, you really can't
control all of that.  
I'm familiar with Northern Iowa obviously being in the Missouri Valley at
Southern Illinois, and Coach Jacobson does a great job and it's a tough team.
We're going to have a tough time with our first-round game and they're very
gritty, very tough. They have size. They have athleticism, and so that's going
to be a tough game for us.  
Obviously being in the next game if you are fortunate enough to get past
Northern Iowa, being able to play somebody like Washington, in Portland, it's
one of those things where you've put yourself in the best situation possible,
and now you've just got to go out and play basketball.  
  
Q. What's the biggest difference in how you guys ended the regular season
and how you're playing now? Is it a matter of health or are you playing at a
different level now, do you think?  
COACH PAINTER: I don't know, I think we're getting healthier, obviously, it
was just a couple of weeks or a week if you want to talk about Michigan State
game. Three out of the four losses we had, one was against Michigan on the
road where we simply couldn't stop them in the second half. And the other one
was against a 2 seed Michigan State, and other pretty good basketball teams,
and then Northwestern has just given us fits. And they do, they give us fits
offensively and defensively. We're fortunate enough to win in Evanston.  
But we have to play harder. I don't think we were playing as hard as we
possibly could. And I think we did a better job with that in the Big Ten
Tournament, playing harder, being quicker to the basketball, getting loose
balls and getting rebounds. And it was pleasant to see.  
  
Q. Rob's had an interesting journey, to say the least. I asked him the
question Big Ten preseason Player of the Year and then he gets hurt, then
comes back and gives you three days. Probably a month ago you would have never
thought he could do what he did this weekend. Could you talk about him being
tournament MVP and kind of the body of work, what this means for you and for
him?  
COACH PAINTER: Rob had a great tournament. And I thought he had good energy.
Obviously Rob's a guy that's going to always give you big-time effort. But I
think at the end of the year, from watching film and just letting him see
different things in terms of rebounding the basketball for us, you know, he
has to rebound the basketball for us to be successful. And I thought he did a
great job in this tournament of rebounding the ball.  
Obviously in the first two games he made more shots, and when he's making
shots and rebounding the ball, you know he's going to put some pretty good
numbers up on the board. But just happy for him.  
Any time you go through struggles, whether it's injuries, not being able to
find your shot, foul trouble, it's good to see somebody that works so hard be
rewarded for it.  
  
Q. Coach, can you put into perspective what this sophomore class has done to
get you to this point? It's one thing to get all the hype like they did coming
in here but it's another thing for all three of them to be up there and be on
the All-Tournament team. Can you talk about that?  
COACH PAINTER: It was huge to land these three guys, because really when they
committed to us, we were in last place in the Big Ten. And I think it shows a
lot of times guys make decisions for the wrong reasons. These guys made
decisions in my opinion for the right reasons, because there was a need for
them.  
And I think that's why you see a lot of kids transfer because they go into a
situation and sometimes you've got to wait your turn, because if you go to a
very good program, there's players, that's why they're a good program. With
us, we were in last place, we just tried to sell the opportunity, being close
to home, getting a great education. But also coming in and being primary guys
from day one.  
And they've been able to play through their mistakes. Really Rob and E'Twaun
from day one, JaJuan has really grown this year but he's also grown because
he's gotten more minutes.  
But they walked into a situation where they were needed, and now they've made
the most of the opportunity, and they're team guys, which is important,
especially at Purdue. We need team guys, and the other guys rallied behind
them.  
  
Q. If one of the main criterion for the NCAA Tournament is how you're
playing right now at the end, you're healthy now, you just won the Big Ten
Tournament, how are you a 5th seed?  
COACH PAINTER: Bob asked the question earlier, I haven't crunched the numbers.
A lot of times you crunch the numbers when you think you're going to be a
bubble team. I shouldn't say it, when you are a bubble team and you're worried
about getting in because you're trying to figure everything out.  
I felt we were in a good position if we got knocked out in the first round of
the Big Ten Tournament of getting into the tournament just from our body of
work. Obviously would have changed our seed, but we still would have been in
the tournament.  
So I haven't really looked at the line in terms of why we are at a 5 seed. I
told our guys that. I said we need to be excited about being in the NCAA
Tournament, no matter what number's next to us and no matter who we play, and
I don't care who we have to play. If they're in the NCAA Tournament, it means
they're a good team and you gotta go out there and prepare for that team and
go to battle.  
  
Q. When you look at the work you've done since you've become coach, what do
you think after seeing the success you've had and the turnaround of the
program?  
COACH PAINTER: I think it starts with players. You have to get the right
player, but you also gotta get the right person that fits your institution.
And I think our assistants have done a good job recruiting our guys. I think
after you're able to land some guys, they have to be good recruiters for your
program.  
And I think that's what we have really built on, trying to excite guys out
there that we're recruiting about being a part of this family, being part of
the Purdue basketball family.  
But the success we've had is because we've landed some talented guys that fit
at Purdue. And that's what we've got to continue to do. Obviously you've got
to get guys that can play. But you have to get guys that can play and
understand what it takes day in and day out to get after it and be blue
collar.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what it means for your team that faced such adversity
with injuries and illness and struggled down at the end of the season and put
it all together here in the Big Ten Tournament?  
COACH PAINTER: I think it makes you stronger. Any time you lose the three out
of four games at the end, there's two ways to look at it. You can complain.
You can say we should have done this, should have done that. Or you can stay
with what you've worked on throughout the whole year and try to do a better
job of what you do.  
And that's what we've done. We've just tried to stay positive and keep
plugging, and the injuries are going to happen. The sicknesses are going to
happen. You can't use them as excuses. It's very similar to foul trouble.  
You have to play the game. The other team has injuries, too. And that's the
message we try to send to our guys. Keep playing and just make the most of it.  
  
Q. You guys have obviously improved over the last week. You've been working
hard in practice. Can you talk about what you as coaches can specifically do
in practice to see that extra effort? And then kind of piggybacking on that,
how you help your team keep mental focus going into this next week?  
COACH PAINTER: We worked hard in practice before when we struggled, but you
have to be able to go out and transfer that to the games, and execute and be
efficient and be tough, and taking those practices and having some good
practices, that time, just trying to get them to be aware. We try to watch as
much film as we can without losing their focus to make them understand it
comes down to effort. It comes down to playing hard.  
It comes down to just play through the whistle. It's a football term, but it's
so true. You've got to keep playing and do not worry about things you can't
control. If the ball's not going in, just keep taking good shots. When we
struggle, it's because we force things, and we have defensive breakdowns when
we're at our best, which I thought we did some good things today, we're
playing sound defense, and you've got to make people make tough shots and make
those tough shots and you've got to get the rebound. You can't allow second-
chance opportunities.  
So we tried to work on rebounding and really work on our team defense and then
taking care of the basketball. And I think we made some improvements in taking
care of the basketball this week. I think we had 17 turnovers, if I'm not
mistaken, in three games. That's great for anybody.  
  
Q. What does it mean to you personally to win the Big Ten Tournament,
growing up in this state, having played in the Big Ten, never winning a Big
Ten title at Purdue?  
COACH PAINTER: It's a little bit different, because hopefully we can continue
to build on this and hopefully it anchors and stays right here in
Indianapolis, because that's how the tradition of the tournament is going to
grow. But there's no tradition in terms of when you are growing up and
watching this.  
Obviously the tournament started I think in '98; is that right? And obviously
I graduated from Purdue in '93. And so I never played in the tournament, nor
did I watch it growing up. So now just kind of getting the feel for things
here the last four years, we didn't hang around very long in the tournament.
So now it's a great feeling to hang around and win a couple of games and to
experience something like this.  
But it's a great accomplishment for our program. I'm just happy for our guys.  
  
Q. Coach, sounding off the question over here about the seeding, is it maybe
an advantage that your team is not getting a higher seed, that possibly being
like a No. 1 or 2 is more overrated than it is, you're playing an 8 and 9, for
as example, as a 1? Is it maybe a good thing ironically after you're in at
5?  
COACH PAINTER: We'll find out. You don't know. You can speculate all you want.
But I told our guys you're going to play a quality team, regardless of if
you're a 4 or 5, 3 or a 6. Last year we played Baylor in the first round and
we were 6 and they were 11.  
I felt Baylor had as much talent as any team we had faced the whole year, and
we faced some pretty good teams last year. And they were very, very talented.
We were fortunate to get by them, and the next game we were rewarded by
playing Xavier, the 3 seed. And I felt Xavier was just a great team, a very
good team. They got to the Elite Eight, got beat by UCLA to go to the Final
Four. But no matter if we can get by the first and second round, you're going
to continue to see great teams. It's just matchups. And I can't really answer
and talk about matchups until I watch film and kind of get a feel for
different things.  
Like I said, I don't mean to be boring with it, it's just one of those things
where you're elated to be in the tournament. Now you've got to go and figure
out what you have to do to try to be successful against Northern Iowa.  
  
Q. Just to bounce back to the game for one more question. 14 seconds to go,
you're up 3. I remember that same basket last year Kramer had a chance to beat
Illinois and the runner bounced off the rim. Now he's the guy going to step to
the line to give you a two-possession lead if he makes two free throws. Given
what he's meant to your program and how badly he wanted to win this, how happy
are you for him that he had that opportunity to put it away and he did?  
COACH PAINTER: I think he had a great stat line. He made some plays today. He
doesn't always score the basketball for us. And then when people are zoning,
we try to get him to be aggressive, we try to get him to understand the
different openings and the zone and what he needs to do to help us, to move
the basketball.  
So he does a lot of little things for us, but he made a good decision last
year against Illinois, especially the timing of it. We got a shot, had a
chance to tip it in, and went to overtime. But he got a good look at it last
year.  
And very similar to earlier in the year with J.J., you get cracks to win games
with a shot, and if it doesn't go for you, you've got to wait. J.J.'s came
around two weeks later and it was great he stepped up at Northwestern and made
that free throw.  
And with Chris, he stepped up, very similar to today, at Minnesota when he
made those free throws down the stretch right there to seal the victory for us
there. I'm happy for him and he's hung in there and played hard for us, done a
lot of little things. Thought he had a huge block late in the game against
Lauderdale. Got a huge rebound for them to foul him on those second free
throws.  
He's been great. Very good guy to have in your program. You can hang your hat
on the things that he does night in and night out.  
  
Q. From the ringside seats, the degree of momentum around your team right
now seems enormous. To what extent do you agree with that?  
COACH PAINTER: I do agree with that. Obviously when you pick up positive
momentum from winning games and the fashion that we've won the first two
games, I think this was great for us, because we had some struggles
offensively. You have to give credit to Ohio State.  
We were getting some pretty good looks but the ball wasn't going down for us.
Not to hang our heads and just to stay with it, I think that even helps us
going into the NCAA Tournament, because we had to win this game differently
than we won the first two.  
  
Q. You mentioned that you've been to the Valley and you know a little bit
about Northern Iowa. I think they're in the tournament for like the fourth
time since '04. What is it about them that makes them so successful?  
COACH PAINTER: I haven't watched them play this year. Obviously before when I
was in the Valley, Coach Jacobson was the assistant coach for Greg McDermott
at the time. They always do a good job of just giving themselves a chance.
They took care of the basketball. They took good shots. They were tough on
defense, very difficult to get the basketball inside, very difficult to use
your dribble against them.  
But always have been impressed with their style. Tough, hard-nosed, efficient,
very good players when we were in the Valley, very good players. I really
don't know their personnel, to be honest with you. But just something that you
knew when you face them that you're going to be in for a battle.  
  
Q. Looking at this bracket here, it looks like seven Big Ten teams got in.
Your thoughts on that?  
COACH PAINTER: I think we had a great year. Earlier in the year a lot of
people were plugging us in for four teams, and I think we had some first-year
coaches the year before. We're transitioning into that second year. And any
time you have that, with Tubby Smith and Lickliter and John Beilein, just
three great coaches, you're going to make improvements.  
I think we made a jump there. And then I think Illinois had great senior
leadership, and I think they did some very good things in the offseason. You
could just see it. Mike Davis made improvements. Tisdale made improvements.
You can go right down the line. Their whole team improved.  
That's what you have to do. If you want to jump from a team that is not
getting talked about going to the NCAA Tournament to being one and being a
solid one, you know you've got to make improvements in the offseason.  
But I think we had a great non-conference. We beat a lot of teams non-
conference. And that's so important to gain that momentum to go into
conference play because, like any other league in the country, when you start
shaving off the top a little bit, and I think Michigan State separated
themselves and nobody else did, there's very little difference between 2
through 9 in our league. Very little difference.  
Somebody said would you rather play Illinois or play Northwestern, one was a
2, one was a 9, I'd tell you I don't want to play either one of them. Both of
them are good. Both are tough, both give us fits, and now one is a 2 seed and
one is a 9 seed. If you go watch them play, different styles, but you could
sit there and argue who is a better team.  
And that's right through, if you went 3-8, 4-7, all the way down the line, we
just had great balance and a great year and hopefully we have a great showing
in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. How important was the crowd today, and did you feel your team fed off of
them?  
COACH PAINTER: I think the crowd can come into play when you play well. And
doesn't really give us an advantage when we don't have a series of baskets.
Once we started to get a series of baskets where we scored two, three, four
possessions in a row, got some steals, now I really thought they helped us in
that second half.  
But we had to give them more to cheer about. In the second half we did, and I
thought our guys fed off of that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  65  
Ohio State - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: Go ahead, Coach.  
COACH MATTA: Well, it was a hard-fought basketball game. I think Purdue made
some huge plays down the stretch and took the lead on us. I thought our guys,
I told them afterwards, proud of our effort here in the three days. You know,
it was one of those things where we -- I thought that we had our chances. We
didn't finish. We didn't rebound the ball. The rebounding was something that
really got us.  
We hold them 34 percent, 28 percent in the first half. I thought our defense
was pretty effective. But they had some guys step up and Moore really got
going there in the second half and got inside us and forced rotations and we
just weren't able to recover from them.  
But like I told our guys, this was a great experience for a young basketball
team. Proud of what they've done. We have to get ourselves picked up and get
ready to go next weekend.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions for Jon or Evan.  
  
Q. Evan, can you talk about how different Purdue is when they have a healthy
Robbie Hummel versus when he's either not playing or not 100 percent for
them?  
EVAN TURNER: I can't really judge that. I mean, I just think they're a good
team in general. And I think that they're such an even-keeled team they know
how to play together. And they all just do their part.  
So I can't -- I mean, he helped out a lot. And I think it's a good leadership
for them on the floor, and it probably gives them more confidence or whatnot.
But they're a good team all around.  
  
Q. Jon or Evan, in the second half, it looked that -- especially in that
segment of time when Purdue took the lead, it just looked like they raised the
level of play to a level that you guys weren't immediately comfortable with,
and that was enough to get behind and not recover from it. How did that --
number one, was that accurate? And, number two, how do you describe the level
of play during that time when you guys lost the lead?  
JON DIEBLER: I just don't think we played with enough intensity on defense.
Again, they made some big shots in the corner, especially E'Twaun Moore. He
had some big 3s.  
And like Coach said, the rebounding got us. We didn't come out with the
intensity we needed to, which we did in the last two games coming into this
game, I thought coming into the second half we did. But this game, it just
wasn't there coming out of the gate, and they took advantage of that.  
  
Q. Evan or Jon, can you talk about maybe the growth of this team from --
where it was before the tournament to where you think you are now?  
EVAN TURNER: I think we accomplished a lot. I think we get better and better
every single day, and just to make it to the final day that's -- is battle.
It's just an amazing accomplishment. We're not done, there's a lot more ahead
of us.  
And we did a lot of things and a lot of players stepped up, and just thinking
about losing David Lighty and how much our freshmen progressed and our
sophomores and people who haven't played since they've been here have just
progressed. It's real good. I think there's more to come.  
  
Q. Kind of along those lines, with the way you guys played, for either of
you guys, over the last couple days, confidence-wise for this team, knowing
there's something ahead, we don't know what yet, next weekend, do you feel
you've progressed a lot in that area over the last couple of days?  
JON DIEBLER: We feel confident going into next week because I don't think many
people gave us a chance to get into the championship game coming into this
tournament. We had confidence that we could do it, but this game Purdue played
great. We didn't get the job done. But, again, we're still very confident in
our ability to get the job done in the tournament.  
  
Q. Evan, during that time you guys were making the comeback, when Dallas
missed those two free throws and then he got an extra one because of the lane
violation, you went up after the second miss and said something to him, kind
of had your fist pumping a little bit. Tell me a little bit about maybe the
conversations you guys were having to kind of will that comeback that finally
fell short?  
EVAN TURNER: I was giving -- I know Dallas is -- he's capable of making free
throws. I see him shoot free throws. Every time I remind him you shoot these
every day, it's no big deal, make them and let's get a stop.  
  
Q. Jon, you mentioned Moore getting hotter in the second half. What did you
notice about him and how was he getting those shots from your perspective?  
JON DIEBLER: He was finding the open area, and I don't think we communicated
well on defense, and especially from the top, from the perimeter I don't think
we had enough ball pressure in there, just kind of moving the ball quickly
along the perimeter.  
He's a great player. He got hot, was knocking down shots, and I just don't
think we had enough awareness where he was at. And, again, I think it starts
at the perimeter and we have to communicate better on defense.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Thad, you're up 38-37. And I looked at the monitor, and they were
12-of-42 at that time. I guess my question for you is, with you doing such a
good job defensively, would you hope at that stage to have a bigger margin
than one point with Purdue shooting 12-of-42?  
COACH MATTA: Yes, but they're a heck of a defensive team, too. I think that's
kind of what they hang their hat on. And I thought they were defending us very
well, as well. It was a defensive battle there for a stretch.  
They're a team that got hot there.  
  
Q. Thad, it looked like a couple times when B.J. came out of the game you
were talking to him about specific things, whatever. Looked from B.J.'s body
language that he was a little frustrated about things. Do you think he got
frustrated at all today or did that affect him?  
COACH MATTA: I think he wasn't flowing out there the way he needed to be, and
we picked up on what they were doing there, and we were showing him in time-
outs you have to be here and here and he was slow to react.  
I don't know, this wasn't quite Mackey Arena, but it was pretty doggone close.
And we needed him to be a little bit more active and come up with a couple of
rebounds where Johnson slid off him and got around him and got the ball back.  
  
Q. Thad, the same question I asked the players, where do you think you are
now compared to where you were coming into this tournament? Do you think you
made strides here?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, I do. I think that this team has gotten a lot better in
three days. And you look and you beat a very good Wisconsin team. You knock
off the No. 6 team in the country.  
You know, you're there against Purdue, which I think is a terrific basketball
team. And I saw us making some plays. Maybe the fatigue, you think about for a
few of these guys, at one point Buford was sitting in timeout we had to take
him out. He was dizzy. He was spinning around. And those guys haven't gone
through this at the level.  
And so to see the progress we've made, to see the fight, that you go back to
three weeks ago we're playing in West Lafayette and they put a run on us and
we kind of -- we couldn't answer it.  
And, you know, to get back in it, we had a couple of attempts to keep chipping
away, cut it to 1, and it just didn't happen for us.  
  
Q. You guys had a fantastic tournament, there's no question about it. Are
you concerned at this point? What's a big concern? The big men are having huge
troubles finishing off. There's no question about it. If that element was
different, is there a lot of other things that you're really worried about, or
is that a major one?  
COACH MATTA: Number one thing I'm worried about right now is our guys start
finals tomorrow morning. But I think that -- and we talked about it last night
with our team, with the post -- and in yesterday's game against Michigan State
I felt like we got great play from all the positions all the way across the
board. And I think for Dallas and B.J., Dallas probably put together his best
three consecutive games maybe since early in the season. That excites me.  
I worry a little bit about B.J., long season, trying to get him -- we need him
back jump-started, because when our post play is what it's supposed to be, I
think that makes us that much of a better basketball team.  
So I think that's one of the things that I've got a concern of, just can those
guys get back to doing their job. And I think they can. I really do.  
  
Q. Jon talked about the lack of intensity coming out for the second half on
defense. I wondered, you haven't used any excuse of the short rotation and
guys playing a lot of minutes all year. I wondered if, number one, if that
finally might have caught up with you, three games in three days, and, number
two, were the shots that Moore made today maybe shots that Michigan State and
Wisconsin had but they just didn't make?  
COACH MATTA: I was a little bit concerned. We weren't as shorthanded as we
were three years ago or four years ago in this thing when Matt had his
appendectomy, we were down to six guys. We were trying to get guys a break
here and there when we could.  
It's one of those things, quite honestly, where we're talking about it and I'm
like, hey -- to the coaches, hey, this is the championship; we'll rest
afterwards.  
So I think that is something maybe we could have rested them, just looking at
Purdue's minutes and our minutes, a little bit of difference. And they had two
easier games coming in than we did.  
The second part of the question?  
  
Q. Moore's 3s?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, Moore's 3s, honestly they did a good job of spacing us. We
didn't cover out when we were supposed to. I can visualize three of them right
now where everybody saw it from the bench saying go, go, go, go, and we just
didn't move. And I think that's more what Jon was alluding to with the
intensity of seeing one pass ahead.  
  
Q. It seems like Big Ten people are constantly defending the conference. And
I wonder if you think this game says anything about the conference, maybe this
particular game, and what it might reflect about what the conference is about
and that sort of thing?  
COACH MATTA: It's funny you say that, because I do get a little bit tired of
having to defend the No. 2 ranked conference in the country. I think that
there's -- I mean, this to me was a big-time, high-level, high-caliber, talent
was high on the court. I think you look and you look at the youth of this
league and say to yourself, you know, it's just going to keep getting better.  
And I think the one thing -- and I told somebody this the other day about this
league, why I'm so proud of our guys, we played in this championship now three
out of four years and we've done it with completely different basketball
teams. And I think you look, and if you truly studied it, one of the biggest
things that's probably been a little bit different in our league, and
ironically it's our school, is guys have left early.  
You can go down to Chapel Hill in the ACC and guys, Hanbrough stuck around for
four years and those guys have been in there. And for whatever reason it
hasn't worked for us. But you think about, and not that I ever have, who we
could have been starting today and still wanted to start a senior on the
court, and four of them have started in the NBA.  
And so I think that's where you have to defend a lot of the talent. But I
think from coaching to environments, to just across the board, this is a great
league. It really is. I don't know if I answered your question there.  
  
Q. Jon started the ball game out knocking down a 3 for your first score,
then a couple 3s right before half, then started the second half with one but
then didn't get another bucket until at the buzzer. Your thoughts on the
sophomore and, boy, how Purdue took him out of the ball game after he hit his
first 3 there in the second half?  
COACH MATTA: I tell you what, I'm so excited about the way Jon Diebler has
played for us this year. And I think that Purdue obviously was really keying
on him throughout the course. I mean, Hummel was guarding him there early, and
his size -- Robbie plays extremely hard.  
We were trying to shake him loose, as much as we could. But they did a nice
job. And kind of goes back to the gentleman's question there of the post play.
You know, you gotta have one and the other going at the same time. And Jon
made a couple of nice passes off there. And what it does, it kind of softens
the blow for him when he's able to do that and we're able to finish.  
  
Q. Follow up on the previous question, 10 minutes from now, how many Big Ten
teams would you expect would be in the tournament?  
COACH MATTA: I'd love to see eight. I really would. I don't know if that is
going to happen. I haven't followed it as closely as maybe I should have. I
was more worried about us all the way through.  
But with the top four or five, Wisconsin in there and then Michigan and
Minnesota and Penn State, you'd love to see that shape up for us. And I don't
know what the feasibility is of that, how that works.  
But I know this, going through this league, we played eight NCAA Tournament
teams throughout the course of this season.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  82  
Michigan State - 70

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have Coach Izzo make an opening comment. We'll do
questions for players and finish with questions for Coach.  
COACH IZZO: I'm trying to decide am I more disappointed with us or more
impressed with the way they shot the ball, but I just didn't think we played
our -- our defense wasn't as good and that's been pretty good. And our
offense, we thought early we had some good shots and we didn't make them. And
we missed a lot of free throws, missed a lot of shots. They made a lot of
shots. Better team won today.  
So disappointing, because I don't think we gave it our best shot. But at the
same time we looked a little tired out there. And we're going to go home and
regroup and see if we can make another run.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Travis, can you just talk about what they did to your defense today and
why you guys seemed to have so much trouble, giving up open shots?  
TRAVIS WALTON: First off, they did a great job executing. They made shots
pretty much. They came off, cut us hard. And our coaches, like always, give us
a great scouting report how to guard them and what we should do, what our
business should do and what our guards should do.  
Today it was on the players. We didn't execute the game plan out. Coach said
you've got to give credit to them because if you are open you've got to make
that shot. We had some open looks and we didn't make ours and they made
theirs. So they played the full 40 minutes. Even when we made our run in the
first half and the second half, they made shots, players made free throws also
for them. So it was a good game for them.  
  
Q. Following up on that, did the jump shots they made in the first half kind
of change what you guys were doing in the second half, and open some things up
on the drive for them?  
TRAVIS WALTON: No, not really. I think we kind of stuck to our game plan, but
you're making game shots you've got to change it up a little bit. You want to
press up on them a little bit. I think when we did press up in them, Evan
Turner wasn't creating problems for us early in the second half. He started
the second half he had some good buckets and we started to have to help out on
him, which we was kind of afraid of early on, but he didn't do that early.  
Like I said, they made shots. Diebler made big shots and Buford had a great
first half hit one or two shots in the second half. But, like I said, you've
got to take your hats off to that whole team, because from Lauderdale to
Turner, they all did a great job today.  
  
Q. Travis, you mentioned that Evan wasn't getting his shots early in the
first half, what was the defense then in the second?  
TRAVIS WALTON: I think he started to attack even more. He started to pass the
ball, create for other people. And as you create for other people, then it
opens up for you. So early on he was creating and passing and often getting
other people's shots. And you couldn't cheat off him as much.  
In the second half, the start of the second half he kind of drove into the
hole and he got a couple easy baskets. And he also got to the free throw line
and made some free throws.  
  
Q. Goran, you said yesterday you think the best basketball is still ahead of
this team going into tournament play. What encourages you about this group
despite a loss like this?  
GORAN SUTON: Coach said it's not how good you are and how good you play, but
we've been up and down, but at times we play some of the best basketball. And
I think if we can really buy in and do what we're supposed to do, we can
really step our game up and make a run in this tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Tom, with you guys losing, North Carolina lost, the league champions in
five of the six major conferences have lost before even making it to the
finals of their conference tournament, does that indicate this is going to be
a wide-open NCAA Tournament, or is there something to be made from that?  
COACH IZZO: You know, I'm not sure. I don't know what other teams go through
at this time of the year. I've been a 1 seed in this tournament and a 1 seed
in the NCAA Tournament three or four times.  
And each time it seemed like something different happened. As I've said, I've
been a 1 seed and gone to a Final Four and been a 5 seed and made it to a
Final Four. So I think it's the ability to stay focused when things happen.
And sometimes the end-of-the-year accolades come and different things come and
I think everybody wonders why coaches are paranoid. It's hard to be 18, 19,
and 20 anymore. And there's so much exposure and so many things happen that
keeping focused I think is the key. And those that can keep their teams the
most focused have success.  
I did not think we played that well yesterday. And I did not think we played
very well today. And so I don't know how North Carolina played. I watched some
games the other night and saw how some teams played. Nobody's looked
unbeatable, if that's your question to me. But my eyeball is through the TV.
It's not there in person.  
But I was surprised by some of the losses and some of the tournaments and I'm
sure those guys are sitting there surprised at some of the ones in this. To me
this is not totally surprising. I did not think there was a big margin even
though we won the league by four games. I did not think there was a big margin
between first and ninth as we proved by getting beat by ninth at home.  
But nationwide I think parity is here to stay, guys. I think it is. I think
anybody can beat anybody on a given night.  
  
Q. Following up on that, did you detect any lack of focus coming into the
game?  
COACH IZZO: For our media, I've been concerned about our instability, and I
called it a lot of different words. Some probably wrong words. But I think
I've said I did not think we were a smooth team even though we kind of battled
our way through some things. And it's been for a couple of reasons. We just
haven't been able to get a rotation down, and that was one.  
And I think the other one is you know when you're struggling -- we're awfully
young. Durrell Summers, we need Durrell Summers and sometimes when young guys
struggle, they don't handle it as well as veterans that struggle. So have I
detected some things? Well, sure, but in talking to other coaches, I think
everybody's detecting something all over the country, as Pat said, nobody's --
teams that we thought were invincible have gotten beat on a regular basis.  
So we weren't one of those that we thought are invincible, and I'm just
disappointed we didn't play better. But I would agree with Travis: Ohio State
really made some shots and played awfully well.  
  
Q. Coach, although I'm sure you're pleased with how much depth you have, is
it getting to a point where you'd like to see more consistent and productive
play from guys like Kalin and Raymar, your other starters?  
COACH IZZO: No question, I think that's very important in tournament time. You
have to have some guys you can rely on. And I still feel for Raymar in some
ways, because he's battling back, but along with when you miss time, you lose
your confidence in your shot and doesn't matter even if you're Travis Walton,
everybody wants to be able to make shots.  
I really thought today -- and this takes nothing away -- but I thought in the
first half we had a lot of good shots. I thought the second half we didn't
have nearly as many good looks. The first half I thought we had a lot of good
shots and they just didn't go down. Even Kalin had some good shots in the
second but they just didn't go down. When we had a chance to cut it down, we
just didn't make the right free throws.  
You need consistency out of your best players, there's no question about it.  
  
Q. Tom, you've been talking about time possibly running out on this team.
How nervous are you getting that you aren't building to the peak you should be
at this time of the year?  
COACH IZZO: I'm not nervous, because it is what it is. I've said that the
whole season. You can't just snap your fingers and expect something to change
that hasn't progressed in the right fashion. But I'm not sure a lot of other
teams aren't in the same boat.  
We still have a couple of things to our advantage. We normally check very
well. We normally rebound very well. We almost always have depth. We still can
play big/small, slow or fast. Those things will be -- like everybody, you
always look forward to the NCAA Tournament more than your conference. We've
played some of these guys three times and they know what gum you're chewing
just like you know what gum they're chewing.  
And I think that's going to help everybody in every conference, to be honest
with you. The more publicity you get, the more games on TV, the better the
scouting is and the better people know you, and I think that has something to
do with why games are a little crazier and a little tougher.  
  
Q. You mentioned just in the past about how you needed Allen and Summers
down the stretch to really get that together, and neither one of them were
there today. How much, again, does that prove the importance of having them do
things in this case?  
COACH IZZO: I think you remember Diebler, last year or early this year, was
missing every shot and today he made a lot of shots. You need your shooters to
shoot well always. I was pleased with how Allen other than his shooting. I
mean, his defense is getting better, he's going to the boards, he's starting
to do the things we need him to do. But he missed some shots and he missed
some good shots. He took a couple bad ones late.  
For the most part, I had no problem with most of the shots taken. We just
missed them. I watch him make every shot in practice. I watch him make every
shot in shoot-around and Durrell was been struggling and he was the guy on
fire for half the year, half the Big Ten season. That's the way it works.  
And, remember, those guys are still young. We're in an era where we think a
sophomore is old because everybody should be leaving school. That's the rare
air, the rare breed that do that; most guys have to mature. And I think we
have some guys that have to do that.  
  
Q. When you go into halftime and you're only down by 5 and Turner hasn't
scored at all, is that a confidence booster at that point or are you more
worried that he's going to go off at some point?  
COACH IZZO: I wasn't worried that he was going to go off. We had a good game
plan on him. I think Travis was right, we didn't change everything. But I do
think we have to extend ourselves in the second half when we got behind.  
I thought a critical -- I don't know what the score was, 7 or 8, when their
3-point play they got underneath when Suton, I thought, had a charge. And then
once he got to 10, I think we started extending, which is right up Evan
Turner's alley, because we didn't do it the first half and I thought we shut
him down.  
But I agree with Travis, too, that I think Turner did more the second half,
but they could put the ball in his hands and just let him dribble because
there wasn't the same necessity to maybe score at a more rapid pace. So I
think it was a combination of both. He was more aggressive, but we did extend
a little bit more. We had no choice, just because of the way they were
playing.  
  
Q. You're plus 6 on the boards, plus 10 on points in the paint, plus 4 off
turnovers, plus 1 on fastbreak and plus 7 off the bench and you lose by 12.
What --  
COACH IZZO: Probably should have been more than that. 15 turnovers, that's
one, and we just missed shots. Chris was I think 2-for-11. I think he had some
pretty good shots. I guess we only had 10 turnovers. So I can't use that one.  
I mean, we were 27-for-71, 38 percent. I think that kind of says it all,
because when you do that you get more chance at offensive rebounds, things
like that.  
But we do have to play better and the NCAA Tournament's another chance. I'd be
remiss if I didn't try to straighten out ESPN that if you talk to any of our
writers, I'm not pleading or begging anybody for a 1, 2 or 3 seed in it; in
fact, I could care less what we get. I'm shocked of how that took a life of
its own when you could talk to any writer in here and I've said all along that
-- I said we don't even deserve a No. 1 seed. Now we've made it easy on them.
But more importantly it's not like we're the only team that struggles once in
a while.  
There's teams with better players that are struggling once in a while. And my
job in the next week is going to be see if we can get our guys back together.
You shouldn't be judged on one game on a plus or a minus. The way this in and
out has changed, one game seems to make a difference in 30.  
I mean, not for us but I think some of the teams that are going to lose out
because of one win or one loss in the tournament, that almost seems
ridiculous. I think Jay Bilas had it right today when I listened to him, why
should one game -- I don't mean it for us -- I'm talking about some guys I
feel for right now, guys in our own league, you earn your mettle over time,
and we've earned our mettle.  
We've had a hell of a year. I'd like to finish it off by making a deep run in
the tournament and we're going to see if we can do that. So thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  66  
Illinois - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let Coach Painter make a few opening comments. We'll take
questions for the Purdue players only then and then we will finish with
questions for Coach. So, Coach, go ahead and start us off.  
COACH PAINTER: I felt that our guys were ready to play once again. At the
start of the game, they did a very good job defensively of just not letting
Illinois get into a rhythm. They did have some open looks and we were
fortunate they missed on that first four or five minutes, but after that I
thought our guys did a good job of staying with them and staying off the
glass. I thought that was key that we did a good job rebounding. I thought
especially in the first half our guys did a good job of keeping them off the
glass.  
And then we got into a pretty good offensive flow, making some perimeter shots
and just kind of having that balance of shooting the basketball and trying to
drive it and also getting it inside. And it's difficult, as you see, you can
have a little bit of a drought like we had in the second half. Illinois's a
very good defensive team, one of the best in the country. And so we knew
having that separation at 20 points at halftime was huge.  
We just tried to come out with some energy in that second half. And I thought
our guys the first, eight nine minutes of the second half did a great job and
got into a little bit of a drought, missed some shots and got impatient. We
have to do a better job in that segment of the game.  
  
Q. Chris, Meacham hit his first two early and then I think in the last 16
minutes of the game neither he nor McCamey scored. Could you explain why that
happened?  
CHRIS KRAMER: Earlier in the game he came off some single-single screens and I
let him get away, just get a little separation. That's all he needs. He's such
a great shooter, and with him and McCamey we tried to clamp down on them and
stay tight on all those screens and make them put the ball on the floor and
make them make plays off the bounce.  
  
Q. Robbie, I think last game you had five turnovers. I know you had two
turnovers in the first half, I'm not sure how many you ended up with, but can
you talk about the offensive efficiency both in shooting the ball and the lack
of turnovers?  
ROBBIE HUMMEL: Yeah, that's been very important for us. It's something we
pride ourselves on. It's for us to not turn the ball over, to force their team
to turn it over. So when we do that and we rebound like we did today, we're
really putting ourselves into a position to win.  
  
Q. JaJuan, there's never such a thing as a comfort level in basketball. But
the three games you guys have played in Conseco this year, the first half, can
you explain what it is collectively about this building that seems to appeal
to the Boilermakers?  
JAJUAN JOHNSON: Yes, I would say any time you get a chance to play at Conseco
or a venue like this in front of a lot of people the team wants to do really
well. And they've been good games for us. I don't think we need much
motivation to come out and play.  
  
Q. What's the difference between this team and the loss to Illinois during
the regular season?  
CHRIS KRAMER: First of all, we're healthy now. We got Rob back and we
completely bought into how Purdue needs to play. We need to play as hard as we
can and just play to exhaustion. And just rebound the basketball. And if we
can get stops and rebound the basketball leads to good offense on the other
end, and we're just taking good shots and making them and that's leading to us
being able to get back on defense and stopping the opponent.  
  
Q. Robbie, in that same vein, is this the real Purdue we're seeing now that
maybe people hadn't seen before, and other teams might want to take notice
now?  
ROBBIE HUMMEL: I thought there were a few games this season where we really
played really well. For example, Davidson, Michigan State at home, it probably
helps that we're getting used to playing with everyone on the floor because we
did go through a time period where it was kind of tough with injuries and
sickness.  
But like you said, I think it's just good for us to be on the floor together.
The more time we have, the better we'll be.  
  
Q. Chris, how proud are you of you, your teammates and their ability to
bounce back after the way you guys ended the regular season, and not that it
makes your season advancing to the Big Ten Tournament, but just talk about
your thoughts getting to play for a Big Ten title?  
CHRIS KRAMER: You know, this is huge, just being able to bounce back after two
tough losses at home against Northwestern and at Michigan State. To come out
and play so well in two games, especially in the first half, and this is
another one of our goals. We still have a chance to win the Big Ten
Tournament.  
So that's another one of our goals and we put ourselves in position. So it all
comes down to how we play tomorrow and just try to take Ohio State out of
everything they want to do and just rebound the basketball and be effective on
the offensive end.  
  
Q. Rob, we asked you about whether or not you thought you'd be able to hold
up playing two games in two days. Obviously you passed that test, huh?  
ROBBIE HUMMEL: Yeah, my back feels real good. It's been good to get back out
there. It's a great environment to play in out here at Conseco. I thought the
fans were great today, Illinois and ours. And when we have support like that
it's easy to fire up and I think the adrenaline just takes over.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Matt, I asked Chris the same question, but in the last 16 minutes of the
game, if I would have told you this morning that Meacham and McCamey wouldn't
score, what would you tell me? If you said it's possible, why would it be
possible?  
COACH PAINTER: It could be possible. And with Tisdale and Davis, I think their
ability to shoot the basketball is really uncanny for big guys. They really
stretch you out.  
We made a couple of adjustments to that and tried to knock that out and when
it did happen we tried to rotate some guys to them and really contest their
shots with that.  
And we did a good job. You talked about like with Chris's breakdowns against
Meacham to start the game and after that Keaton Grant and Chris did a good job
on him, and I thought we did a good job on McCamey, just keeping him in front
of us and not letting him get going. He's a very streaky guy and he can get 25
points, go 6-for-6 from 3 like he did last year.  
We knew they had balance and that balance scares you because you just don't
know about two guys out of their leading scorers, they have four guys between
10 and 12. And they spread the wealth, sometimes that's tough to defend.  
  
Q. Going back to yesterday and the same theme, you guys get running and get
just flowing right off the bat, it just seems to crumble teams sometimes, if
you can get a couple down.  
COACH PAINTER: Yeah, it has to start with the rebounding. And I think that's
-- when we do a good job rebounding, when we do a good job of forcing some
turnovers, even though today we weren't able to force turnovers, able to get
some rebounds and get the breaks started, and then even when it's not there
immediately, just reversing the basketball and trying to attack while they're
trying to get their man or rotate and trying to stop dribble penetration, it
really helps us, because now you're just not scoring in the half court, you're
not scoring off the glass. You're scoring in transition while they're trying
to adjust.  
  
Q. Yesterday you said that you needed to out-tough Illinois, that didn't
happen the first two times. At what point in the game today did you sense that
your guys were going to out-tough them?  
COACH PAINTER: About midway through the first half. I sensed it when we played
in West Lafayette, I sensed it in Champaign the other way. It's a heck of a
feeling when you see your guys are quick to the ball, they're making the
fifty/fifty plays. When the ball got loose in that first half and every single
time it got loose it seemed like we got the basketball.  
The first two games Illinois got those balls, and that's the difference
between winning and losing especially when it comes down to a close game like
it did in Lafayette. I was proud of our guys for being ready and playing hard,
and at times that's not good enough. That ball has to go in the basket. Our
guys have to step up and make some shots and get that good lead going into
halftime.  
  
Q. The opportunity to play for a Big Ten championship and obviously improve
your NCAA Tournament seed, can you talk about that?  
COACH PAINTER: I think any time you have an opportunity to play a quality team
like Illinois who is going to be right in that mix with a good seed, you're
going to help yourself. And today this really helped us, with our seed. Maybe
you don't move up as much as you would like, but you know it's definitely
going to help you.  
With our team, we talk about the things that we need to do to beat Illinois,
to be successful and to do those little things, but in the grand scheme of
things, you're trying to improve your spot in the tournament. Anybody can beat
anybody, but you still want to try to put yourself in the best position you
can.  
  
Q. Matt, you talked after the win yesterday that you thought the positive of
losing the last two games of the regular season was that it would potentially
put your team on edge. Is that something you've sensed these last two games?  
COACH PAINTER: In the two games I did. Not coming into it I didn't. You never
know as a coach how they will rebound from getting beat three out of four in
the last two games, but our guys have done a great job. They played harder,
they played tougher. They did a better job on the glass. And that's what we're
going to have to do. Not turning the basketball over and just giving ourselves
a chance is huge. And in both games we haven't turned the basketball over.  
And this was a big game for us because Illinois is a very good defensive team
to not be able to turn the basketball over like we did really gives us a
chance in these games.  
  
Q. Matt, when the selection committee looks at your seed, do they need to
look more closely beyond the record but at your record when you have all your
guys out there?  
COACH PAINTER: I think it's something that probably a lot of teams across the
country go through. I think you have to look what that person or persons mean
to your team. And with Rob, it's just more than just points and rebounds. I
think he brings a lot of intangibles to the table. We didn't have Kramer for
one game.  
But there's a lot of teams out there that played this year without some of
their best players. So I don't know how they look at it. Obviously we're a
better team with him in the lineup, and I think we have proven that and it
gives us more balance on both ends of the court.  
So I don't know. I don't know how to really answer that question. Because they
really never give you that answer. You never hear somebody on the committee
come out and really talk about something of that nature, especially before it
happens.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the matchup tomorrow?  
COACH PAINTER: All right. I think it's going to be a good game. They're a very
good basketball team. Evan Turner and William Buford, we simply could not stop
in Columbus this year. I think they combined for 50 points against us. B.J.
Mullens is a very tough matchup for anybody. And they balance it with him and
Lauderdale at the 5, both of them can block shots. Both of them are good at
the basket, and to go along with that they have Diebler who is a great
shooter, one of the best shooters in the country.  
With that being said, I think their zone has given a lot of people trouble
throughout the year. They do different things with it. They tilt it different.
He does a great job with making adjustments with it. We're going to have our
hands full. It's going to be a great challenge. I know our guys are looking
forward to it.  
  
Q. How different was this Illinois team defensively without Chester Frazier?
How did you guys take advantage of that?  
COACH PAINTER: We didn't talk about it. I don't know if we did anything
different in terms of taking advantage of him not being out there. There's no
doubt that they're a better team with him. He's their glue. I thought
yesterday was a big-time game for them beating Michigan without him.
Especially in the style that they beat them in the second half. They had a
great second half.  
And it just proved they've got some good players. But now having back-to-back
games, not having that energy, not having that glue, that's difficult, because
when we played the first time, Frazier guarded Hummel. He did a great job. We
played the second time, Rob didn't play but Frazier guarded Moore and did a
great job.  
There's no doubt that Illinois is a better team with Chester Frazier and we
thought he was an All-Conference guy. That's how much we value guys like him,
Travis Walton, Kramer, Chester Frazier. Those guys just help you win games.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  82  
Michigan State - 70

  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome the Ohio State contingent. Coach Matta, if
you'd open up with a few comments. We'll take questions for the players and
finish up with Coach.  
COACH MATTA: Tremendous win for our guys, very proud of them. I think in the
first half our defense was active, it was good, but the key was the
rebounding. We did a very good job of rebounding the basketball.  
I thought we took good shots. We lost our minds there a little bit in
transition on a couple of possessions, turned it over and we had numbers.  
But I think at halftime the big key was telling them to keep rebounding.
Obviously we gave up 16 in the second half, so they didn't listen to that as
well as they should have. But for us today the key was getting the ball in the
right guys' hands and making plays and shots.  
The beauty of this team, Will kind of led us there in the first half and ended
up with one point in the second half and ET was scoreless. Jon was as steady
as he can be, and this was a great team win for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Evan or Jon.  
  
Q. How can you describe the aggressiveness and toughness that the team has
played with these first two games compared to the way maybe that you played
down the stretch defensively especially? It looked like a bit of a different
team.  
EVAN TURNER: I just think we're really focused right now. We focused on what
it takes to beat a great team like Michigan State. We know to win this game we
had to play tough. Our focus was being tough. Coach said toughness and
rebounding is going to win this game, and that's what we were trying to do.  
We just came together. This was a good team win all around. We all keyed in
for 40 minutes to play hard.  
  
Q. You were scoreless at halftime, what did you do different in the second
half to get your game going?  
EVAN TURNER: I made baskets, obviously, but Coach called some pretty good
numbers, pretty good calls for me to get me open and let me create, but also
my teammates were hitting jump shots which opened stuff up.  
And at the beginning of the game they were focused on me a lot, Michigan State
was. And as my teammates made more shots, then we were an all-around offensive
threat just as a team and it just made things way easier for me.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about how good of a shooter Jon is and some
of the shots he makes? You guys can't be surprised to see that.  
EVAN TURNER: I'm not surprised. When I first met Jon I was like a junior in
high school. We were getting ready to play versus each other in AAU. And my
coach said this is going to be by far the best 3-point shooter in your life.  
Once I seen that, I think every shot he shoots is going to go up, it's going
to go in. He's just such a good shooter. He works on it. That's what he's
known for and he just has confidence, he has great confidence in his shot and
looks the same every time he shoots it.  
  
Q. Could both of you guys comment on the play of your big guys, both of them
were really active. Looked like you were looking for them. They were playing
some offense and getting a lot of rebounds and blocking shots?  
JON DIEBLER: When they're a force inside, we're a totally different team.
These last two games, I think B.J., Dallas, and even when Kyle has been in,
and even when Evan has been in the post, when we establish the inside game,
it's hard to defend us because we have a lot of weapons on the outside, guys
who can shoot and Evan who can create for himself and other guys.  
I think they take it upon themselves to be a source inside and that's really
helped us a lot.  
EVAN TURNER: Just the second thing, I think Dallas has done a great job
setting the tone which gives B.J. energy as he comes off the bench. When we
have a presence down low in the paint, it makes the game way different. And it
helps out a lot and, once again, it's an all-around team game and makes us a
better team.  
  
Q. Jon, you talked a little bit about this the other day before you came
here, part of getting those big guys involved is hitting them with the pass
off the pick and roll. You guys seemed to be doing that a lot more and a lot
better in this tournament than you did at times during the season, what's been
the difference there?  
JON DIEBLER: I think just how the teams are guarding us right now. Usually
when we come off a curl, the teams are showing hard on the guy curling and the
bigs are doing a nice job of opening to the ball, to the basket and we're
finding them.  
And, again, I think they've worked extremely hard on getting us open. When
they do that, I think they're seeing the rewards, because we'll get it to them
and they're finishing really well around the basket right now.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks guy. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Same question I asked Evan about. They're too young to know this, but
this isn't the first time your team has seemed to transform itself into
something different at the start of the tournament season. How can you explain
what happens or maybe is it something in the way you coach teams going into a
tournament versus for a long season?  
COACH MATTA: I really hold back throughout the course -- no. (Smiling) I think
that you look -- and I said this yesterday. You look at all the Big Ten teams,
I think we've all gotten better throughout the course of the season, without a
doubt.  
For our guys, the motivational tactics and all that stuff, there really isn't
a whole lot of that for them. And like I said, we go into film last night,
they were attentive to exactly what we were going to do. We didn't have a
practice this morning. We didn't walk through in the hotel; it was more of a
pause, you should be here, pause.  
And I think those guys are starting to come together. I think the other thing
is these guys are growing together as a team, which I've been very pleased
from dating back to June 16th when they all got there and kind of the
commitment they've made. But when you're this young and really a lot of the
teams we've had here with the exception of the first two years have been
really young.  
So I think you're going to see that -- hopefully we'll see that improve as we
keep moving forward. But I don't think there's anything magical that we've
done in that regard. And a lot of luck. Michigan State didn't shoot the ball
particularly well for us.  
  
Q. Just wondering now with you guys beating Michigan State, the league
champions in five of the six Big leagues have been beaten before they made it
to the finals in the tournament. What's that say about this season and maybe
what's to come in the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH MATTA: I think it speaks of the parity across the board in every league.
I think I've always said this in conference tournaments. It takes a team to
kind of get on a roll and get going. If somebody's capable of doing that, they
can become hard to beat. It takes an eight-minute stretch to open up a game,
and legs and depth and all that stuff, foul trouble, becomes very crucial in
that regard.  
I think as you move forward, I've always said this, you get in the NCAA
Tournament, the cream will always rise. You'll have a guy or a team make a run
here or there, but you get a little more prep time in between and guys get a
little bit more rest. So usually your best four out of six teams will be where
they're supposed to be.  
  
Q. Have you emphasized getting the ball down low more or is that -- is that
just happening because of the way they're playing you?  
COACH MATTA: A little bit of both. We have been screaming to get it in there.
But those guys have -- it's a two-fold situation. We can look in there. We can
pass in there. But they've got to be in a position of where they can do
something when they get it. And it's one thing, going back to Bob's question,
that this team's gotten better out of understanding, hey, don't throw this guy
the ball when he's posting here. Don't give it to him. And we tell him not to.  
And before there's a lot of times where we're feeding it and they're posting
it at 16 feet. We don't want that situation because I know what the result is
going to be, and we actual saw it a time or two today.  
But then hopefully we're getting better, I think, and now 30 whatever games
that the execution and the timing's a little bit better as well.  
  
Q. How has your defense changed here at the end of the season and how is it
different today compared with the last time you played Michigan State?  
COACH MATTA: I think we have a little bit better understanding of roles and
actions that are coming at us and I think we're just a little bit more used to
it. When our defense was at its prime this year, we had Evan up top and Dave
was down low and that gave us a 6-9 wingspan up top and a guy that had a motor
along the bottom that helped us.  
A guy like William Buford, you look at the progress he's made defensively
throughout the course of the season. At times it appears he's made none. But,
believe me, he's made tremendous strides defensively, and I think Jeremie and
P.J. up there have really kind of developed an understanding of what they're
supposed to do.  
  
Q. Evan talked about the calls you made in the second half to try to free
him up there. At times before that happened, it looked like they had three
guys guarding him at the foul line. I don't think you'll be playing Michigan
State again this season, but what did you do, if you can talk about it?  
COACH MATTA: They do a great job of putting three on the ball off the passer,
off the screener, and really tried to move him a little bit higher. And to
their credit, and Evan even said it, we made some shots because they were
helping off of Jon in the first half, getting the ball moving I think helped
us. Once we got Evan to understand, if they're going to put three up there,
just get it swung and good things, which then opened up the post for us a
little bit as well.  
  
Q. Talk about the difference that B.J. yesterday obviously kind of struggled
a little bit with fouls and so forth, how much more he contributed today?  
COACH MATTA: He did a better job finishing around the basket. Both he and
Dallas. The thing I liked is he went up and he's got a tendency to play
volleyball every now and then on defensive rebounding and he goes with one
hand and tries to hit it and got on him on a timeout and got a big rebound
with two hands.  
I thought both he and Dallas did a better job of challenging -- when those
guys were driving in, they were more of a force of challenging shots. And you
see he got out, ran the floor, was just a little bit more active. He gave us
everything he had there in that stretch from the 15 to 10 or whatever, and we
got him a blow, and I think that always helps him and sometimes I don't
recognize it. I'm glad I saw it today and we were able to get those guys in
and out of there.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2009

  

### [Calvin Brock](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19490)

### [Trent Meacham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17059)

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  66  
Illinois - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go with our same format. Coach, if you'd open us up.  
COACH WEBER: Credit to Purdue. They came out very ready to play. Obviously
we've had some pretty good games against them. The overtime win here last year
in the tournament and the last two times beating them this year.  
So I think they probably had something to prove. They played like it. They
played very aggressive, very strong, very just took the game to us, I think.  
And then when they shoot the ball from 3 that well, it really puts you in a
bind. So we had an emotional game yesterday. I've been proud of our guys all
year. I was very proud of them yesterday. Probably didn't have the emotion to
get through today.  
But we at least in the second half we didn't quit and it gave an opportunity
for some guys off the bench without Chester to get some minutes and a little
bit of confidence, and hopefully in the long haul it's going to help us as we
get into the tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Jeff, Calvin or Trent.  
  
Q. Trent, you guys had a big win yesterday and a loss today was kind of
hard. How do you regroup now to head into the post-season do you think after
coming off of this?  
TRENT MEACHAM: We've got no choice but to regroup. Here we are, going to the
NCAA Tournament, and it will be a great opportunity for this team. And
wherever we're at, we're excited and we've got to have a good week of practice
and this is the biggest time of the year. So there's no question we're going
to regroup fine and be ready to go.  
  
Q. Calvin, how different was this Purdue team from the team that you beat
twice during the regular season?  
CALVIN BROCK: I mean, they came out with a chip on their shoulder because we
beat them twice both times early this year. But they just had more motivation
because there was a lot more on the line. It was a hard-fought game. I don't
think there was a difference. They played tough all the games we played them
and they made shots and made plays down the stretch when they needed it.  
  
Q. Trent, you came out and hit two early 3-pointers first couple of shots
and then really didn't get any good looks after that. Was it something they
did defensively, were they not looking for you? What happened there?  
TRENT MEACHAM: I think they may have picked up their defense a little bit. But
the team we didn't get many good looks. Especially for the stretch there in
the first half, it was one shot and done. Just couldn't get a whole lot after
that. And we just didn't -- they pushed us out to half court on defense, for
our offense, and really we had a hard time doing anything offensively for a
good portion of that game.  
  
Q. Calvin, these last two games you've gotten your feet wet a little more
than you have in a long time. How do you feel going into the post-season with
what looks like your new role?  
CALVIN BROCK: I'm pretty confident. I think I've been confident all year. I
know my role bringing energy off the bench, do the small things and just do
whatever it takes to help my team win, so that's what I'm going to do from
here on out.  
JEFF JORDAN: I think it's a confidence builder, just coming in to the
tournament. We knew Chester wasn't going to be here. We knew we had to pick it
up along with the other bench players and just give a little spark. So
hopefully we can carry that into the tournament and get some more wins.  
  
Q. Calvin, to follow that up, how is it different starting?  
CALVIN BROCK: It's not really that much different. I probably have to say it's
a little more pressure on you if you start, but for the most part it's all the
same basketball game. You have to do whatever it takes to help your team win,
as we have to do from here on out.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach Weber.  
  
Q. Bruce, when you play against Matt, is it like playing a mirror image, as
far as the team goes and the coaching?  
COACH WEBER: I think Matt talked yesterday a lot that the first two times we
out-toughed them. Today they probably out-toughed us. And when you play
somebody, timing, I said we caught them -- I think we maybe caught them off
guard probably the first time. Maybe they didn't respect us enough at their
place. We gutted out a game in overtime. They came to our place, we caught
them without Hummel and we win a game by a good margin.  
So now we catch them when they had a tough week last week, as we did, but I
think Matt -- they had the scoring drought last week at Michigan State. So I
think he got after them this week at practice. They rose up. Played like I
thought they would all year. But it is similar. And they take away a lot of
the stuff you do, and if they're playing good on defense like they were in the
first half, it makes it tough for any team in the country.  
  
Q. Bruce, Demetri didn't play that much after he didn't do too much. Can you
talk about him heading into the post-season? Was his leg all right from
yesterday?  
COACH WEBER: He wasn't very aggressive. And Jeffrey was playing good, gave us
minutes. Trent, Calvin. So you play the guys that are playing well, playing
with emotion and energy. And it is just one of those games. I didn't do it on
purpose or whatever.  
Demetri has been a key for our success. Probably didn't get going today like
we needed to. So, again, you give credit to Purdue's defense. They get up on
them. He has to learn to do things without the ball, because now Lewis is
getting after him or Kramer or whoever it is. And now he's got to learn to
move without the ball. And that's his next step, to be able to deal with
different defenses and still stay involved with the game, even though he can't
do anything just with the ball.  
  
Q. I was wondering, how big of an impact did you think this last impression
against Purdue is going to play on the tournament committee and what kinds of
things do you want the committee to look at besides this loss, what kinds of
things do you think they should take into account when recording your seed for
the tournament?  
COACH WEBER: Well, again, I think we've had a pretty good season. They talk
about the total package. We had good wins in non-conference, on the road,
neutral sites, played a lot of deep people from different leagues. We've won
games in the league on the road. And beat Purdue, as we said, twice. One at
Ohio State. So we've played good basketball all year.  
And there's a lot of people in the country that lost, that some of them didn't
even, Kansas didn't win their first game. You go on, Washington, UCLA go on
down the line every league. North Carolina lost today. So we didn't play well.
But that's not -- we're not the only team in the country that got beat today
or yesterday.  
And, again, I would think they're well educated. They keep talking about the
whole season. I think we've given them a pretty good resume. Whatever happens
happens. I don't know if we're four, five, six, seven, eight, whatever, I have
no idea, doesn't matter where we go, just have to be ready to play with a
desire to make, to make the NCAA Tournament go a while for us, and your mental
approach is I think so important.  
  
Q. In the first half when Purdue went on the run and really broke the game
open, you seemed to have a hard time getting shots inside. Everything you took
was a jump shot from perimeter. Is that a guard or big man issue?  
COACH WEBER: I think it's both. Tis has to get stronger where he can seal. But
that's where Chester would get his stability in. If you remember back, both
games he was the one that got into the paint, dished it to people. The first
time at their place I think we were 24 assists, 25 assists to six turnovers
for the whole game. And tonight we have six turnovers in the first 10 minutes.
So that's where he's a stabilizing factor. And we needed to get some touches
inside. I thought we panicked a little bit. I'd say make a play, they'd jack
up a 3. Not a good 3 either.  
So you have to learn from it. Hopefully we won't have this situation again,
but I think in the long haul going through this we haven't had a game really
to get kicked, butts kicked in the first half like this really all year.  
I hope maybe it gives us a little mental edge going into the tournament. And
also, as I said, it allows us to play the bench and give me a little more
confidence in them and they hopefully will have confidence.  
  
Q. Bruce, I know you're disappointed, but at the same time how proud are you
of Matt leading his team to the Big Ten Tournament championship game as well
as turning the Purdue program around?  
COACH WEBER: Well, Matt's done a great job. He's got a great group of kids.
They're young. That's the scary thing. I said before, I've thought maybe they
were the best team all year. They've had some setbacks, maybe some chemistry
issues, I don't know. A lot of different things. Now they seem to be playing
good at the right time. Yesterday was pretty impressive.  
Think about it a week ago they were really -- but that's basketball. That's
life. You know, your mental approach. They played with a sense of urgency
today and yesterday. Hopefully they can continue that into tomorrow and then
into the NCAA Tournament.  
They have the ability to make some noise and to dance. I don't think there's
any doubt. Especially if guys like Hummel and that shoot the ball so well.  
  
Q. Coach, you've played now 20 games, similar styles for 20 games, the same
teams that know you so well. How much have you looked forward to playing a
different style, a different league?  
COACH WEBER: I hope it gives us an advantage. One, we've got to keep guarding
like we always do. And I hope that's -- we take a lot of pride in that. Our
whole league takes pride in it, preparation, defending, playing hard.  
We probably didn't play as hard as we needed to in the first half. Our play-
hard chart was way down, especially picked up in the second half, but too
late, too little too late.  
But I hope it's different. We'll have to see. And NCAA success a lot of times
is matchups, how you match up with people. And but we just have to see what
happens and go in with a good framework. I'm very proud of our guys and what
they've done. 24 wins, I gave them that goal. They reached it. Now hopefully
they got a little bit of greed inside and a positive way to keep making this
season go for a while, maybe get 26, 27, whatever.  
  
Q. What do you think has got more Gene Keady with him, you or Matt?  
COACH WEBER: I was with him longer, so probably me. I'm more mean and grumpy.
Matt is still young. I think probably Matt in practice, he's pretty tough.
Obviously he was with me and he's pretty tough. He's a little more calm on the
bench. I'm a little more emotional probably on the bench. In practice I sit
back, but when I do go crazy I do go a little too crazy. So a little of the
family history in both of us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2009

  

### [Tubby Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13960)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  64  
Minnesota - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: Opening comment then questions for the players.  
COACH SMITH: I want to commend and congratulate Michigan State. That shows why
they're the top team in this league. They really took it to us in that second
half. I thought our kids gave an excellent account of themselves and played
extremely hard. Had some breakdowns there in the second half but I thought
overall we had a good game plan and our kids stuck to it for the most part.
Again, it was a good college game and we fought pretty hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Damian or Devron? Okay, guys. I guess you're free
to go back.  
Anything for Coach Smith?  
  
Q. Was the pace of the game about what you wanted?  
COACH SMITH: Yeah, we were doing a good job and pushing the ball. I thought
press early in the game was very -- was effective even though we weren't able
to, no one was able to get any rhythm, any consistency. But we were forcing
some turnovers and doing some things. We just didn't capitalize a few times,
but pace in the game was what we want. We like to play up-tempo and we just
didn't score, weren't as efficient as we'd like to be offensively.  
  
Q. Coach, normally at this point a team that's out of the tournament looking
at the NCAA would try and lobby for its place in the NCAA tournament. Do you
feel like you need to do that? Tom made a pretty good case for you just a
minute ago. Do you feel like you needed to do that?  
COACH SMITH: I appreciate Tom lobbying for us, and I hope he doesn't send me a
bill as a lobbyist. But I think we've had a pretty good resume. We've had a
pretty good year. Not a great year but a good enough year. I think looking at
the competition and the way we played, obviously we had a tough month,
February, but those five games we lost that month were all on the road. So
hopefully that accounts for something.  
I think we were a team that could play well in NCAA tournament. But if we
don't we'll be happy to go wherever we're up get into the post-season play.
Any time you get to this point you just want your kids to have had a good
experience. You want them to keep believing in the program and believing that
they have a chance. And we have a chance to, I think, be a pick to go to the
NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Two years now your style of play is pretty good fit for the Big Ten with
the defensive emphasis and were you surprised at all that defense seems to
pervade the league the way it does, just the physical play?  
COACH SMITH: Well, it kind of evolves to that, because what you do is just
like anything else, you look at the top teams and you say, okay, how do we
beat them? How can we compete with them? And obviously in any conference
that's the case. And different styles, I think the Big Ten gets that
reputation because there is that physicality, but also, as you mentioned,
there's a lot of coaches in the league that emphasize defense as well.  
I'm more on the side of more of a finesse game. But I think we have to
continue to look at ways to improve the game. There are things that we can do
as far as widening the lane that I think can help out putting that half moon
in front of the basket, that kind of stuff will take away some of the
physicality, I think, and would help not just the Big Ten but college
basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2009

  

### [Joe Krabbenhoft](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18168)

### [Marcus Landry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17068)

### [Bo Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17045)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  61  
Wisconsin - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Ryan to make a quick opening comment about the
game and then we'll take questions for Joe Krabbenhoft and Marcus Landry. And
then we'll finish with questions for Coach Ryan.  
COACH RYAN: We knew it would be pretty much a possession-by-possession game.
And it was. It was typical of the one we had at our place.  
But in the last five minutes you gotta knock some shots down. And
unfortunately we didn't. And Turner made a lot of good plays. He's that good.
And he also helped create some things for the other guys. But he proved why
he's I would easily say the best player in the league. Because he gets things
done. And he makes his team successful.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Joe or Marcus.  
  
Q. Since you were both involved in guarding Turner, could you talk about
guarding Turner, especially down the stretch and what you were trying to do
and what happened?  
MARCUS LANDRY: Well, Joe guarded him a lot more than I did. But it's a team
game. Like Coach said, he's a great player. And he proved today why he's I
think the leading scorer in the league and why they won today. The thing we
were trying to do is kind of force him into other guys on the court like we
did the first game.  
But he made plays. And he scored. And he also found other guys when he needed
to.  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: Marcus said it right. Evan's a great player. He did it down
the stretch. He stepped up and led his team. They were down a couple, I
remember, and he just took control of the game. Took control of the ball every
time we were on defense it seemed like he had the ball and he was in control
and you just gotta try to make it tough for him. And he made it look easy.  
  
Q. Joe, the scoring problems going in long droughts like you have had
problems with all season reared its ugly head here again. No field goals in
the final 5:58. Could you talk about what you guys weren't doing or what Ohio
State was doing that made scoring such a problem?  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: We've got to step up and knock down shots. I thought we had a
few good looks and they just didn't go down for us. That's on the players. And
Ohio State, we've been going against their zone the whole game. The game
before, they ran that zone.  
So we knew where to get the looks, and we tried to get the ball to those
places, and we've just got to step up and knock them down and we just didn't
execute as far as shots going in.  
  
Q. Joe, do you feel you need to sweat it out for an NCAA bid at this point,
or do you think this team has done enough to impress the committee?  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: That's not anything that we can talk about. We're not in
control of that anymore.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Bo, I would ask you the same thing about the NCAA and your resume and
what this loss in the first round or the quarterfinals does to that?  
COACH RYAN: That's just it. It's the quarterfinals. We earned our way to the
quarterfinals by finishing seven of our last nine on the plus side. So I look
at the other teams out there and everything else. For that question to even be
asked, that's fine. But if you look at the teams we played, we played a tough
schedule.  
There's nothing I can say that would do anything. But you get 50 shots in a
game like this and the other team gets 38 -- and the guys are right. They know
they hit some shots. But Ohio State's a good team. We didn't play some 70th
RPI team. I think Ohio State was somewhere around us. Neutral court. Hard-
fought battle. Our guys accept the results because they can't change them. But
it will be what it will be.  
  
Q. Seemed like Ohio State when they started extending the pressure, started
pressuring you more in the back court sort of made your guys a little bit
uncomfortable?  
COACH RYAN: They were doing it early, too, they did that in stages, but still
down at the other end I really liked some of the looks. They were taking away
pretty much anything inside. But some of those looks from 3, boy, you'd like
to have them back. If you're in a shooting drill and you have that shot and
the person throws the ball back out to you if you could take two in a row, two
for a dollar, three for a dollar, you'd probably hit the next two. And the
problem is from that time to the next time to get a good one like that, a lot
of things have happened.  
But I really thought our ball movement wasn't bad. We didn't turn it over. We
didn't give them stuff. I thought our guys, other than the pass that Trevon
made to Jason Bohannon there at half court, I thought we did a pretty good job
of getting to a look and then not enough -- we needed to get one or two more
offensive rebounds.  
The last field goal we hit or one of the last ones was an offensive rebound
kick out to Trevon Hughes and he hit the three. And that's more like touching
the post, getting it out, only the post pass came off of an offensive rebound.
We had a couple others like that, too. If you can stick 'em, it sure makes a
difference.  
  
Q. No field goals the final 5:58, any thought of going to Jordan? He had
three assists and no turnovers in the first half. He started to facilitate
things --  
COACH RYAN: He had a drive to the basket and flipped up an AAU wild shot. He
didn't handle that real well. So maybe first time in the Big Ten Tournament,
that type thing. But the other guys were very capable that we had on the floor
of knocking shots down. Jordan had his opportunities.  
I don't ever go, oh, I should have put this guy or should have did that guy.
No. The guys I have on the floor I believe in. Always have. Nobody asked if
you're on the plus side of 5 beating an Ohio State, did you ever think of
putting this other guy in?  
You feel the same way with the guys no matter what the score comes out. You
have them out there for a reason. Just so you know, I've never been asked that
question before with a win, why didn't you go with this guys.  
  
Q. Talk about Jon's work facilitating the offense against the zone out of
the high post.  
COACH RYAN: Jon's stretch, we did some things to give their zone that look,
and sometimes we used a big, sometimes we used a small, sometimes we used an
in-between.  
But that's the whole idea of giving the good looks, to see how they're
matching up with it and what they do. And Jon did a good job. He had some good
wide-open shots up there. I think he hit one of them. Couple other jump shots
he had, too.  
Shooting percentage, when you look at the guards again, it's very troubling
for the rest of the team to be able to think that J-Bo, Pop and Jordan can
shoot, what was it, 20 for 27. Sometimes you've just got to stay as a player
I've got to make some shots.  
Taking care of the ball, I liked the hustle. We were on the floor and getting
after it. And if you're in that situation again, you've got to have people
step up and knock 'em down.  
  
Q. You looked a bit mystified by the technical foul. What happened?  
COACH RYAN: I have no idea. Then I'm asked by ESPN at halftime what about the
flagrant elbow or forearm, or not flagrant, but I'm asked about what was said
from the bench, I guess, was the only thing the assistants can say is they all
yelled Marcus just got knocked down.  
So then I'm asked by the media why didn't they call that forearm to the neck
of -- to Marcus Landry. I'm like how can I answer that? I can't answer that.
What kind of answer can I give to it?  
So, anyhow, I guess the guys on our bench and a bunch of fans behind us yelled
at the official about Marcus getting forearmed or something. I don't know.
Maybe she had somebody in earphones saying there was a foul into Landry.  
But you're not allowed to sit with a computer that has the running game on it
and a coach is not allowed to look at that computer during the game. That's
illegal. So I couldn't see it or go have somebody look at it and tell me and
we're not allowed to get signals down from upstairs from the box. So was she
talking about? Does anybody know?  
  
Q. Lauderdale appeared to knock Marcus down.  
COACH RYAN: That's what the assistants saw, because they yelled, hey, he
knocked 'em down, is the only thing they can think of that they said. But they
weren't the only ones. There were people -- I think even the policeman that
was sitting there behind the bench, there was somebody else yelled. I could
hear everybody yelling.  
But I can't criticize officials. I can't say anything. But that halftime
interview I was led to say something but I didn't bite. I said I have no idea.
By the way, we shot the ball, you probably know that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2009

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Goran Suton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18424)

### [Travis Walton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16992)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  64  
Minnesota - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening comment from Coach Izzo. We'll take
questions for just the players and finish with Coach Izzo.  
COACH IZZO: It wasn't pretty. I think you have to give a lot of credit, we
played a team that played their heart out and unfortunately for us beat us at
our own game the first half. They outrebounded us. Got every hustle point,
every loose ball.  
That team is a good team and I didn't think we played as well. And yet having
Goran and Raymar in foul trouble and playing so few minutes I think it hurt us
a little bit.  
And thank God for Travis and this guy next to me, Chris Allen, who I thought
had his best week of practice and one of his better games if you looked at it
offensively and defensively the couple of rebounds he got.  
My hat's off to Minnesota. They did play well in the second half. I thought we
executed better. I thought we rebounded a lot better. I thought we good some
loose balls and played more our style. So they took us out the first half,
credit to them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Did you have a feeling this week, Chris, that you were due for a game
like this the way you were playing?  
CHRIS ALLEN: All week I was trying to listen to Coach, take all his advice and
just talk and try to be more aggressive. So it worked out all right.  
  
Q. Goran, the difference in the second half compared to the first half, and
going to the boards. You got outrebounded the second half, I think was the one
difference in the first half.  
GORAN SUTON: I think like Coach said, having me and Raymar out in the foul
trouble in the first half really hurt us in the boards and I think we are two
busy rebounders on the team. I think it made a lot of difference in the second
half.  
  
Q. Was there some surprise with Minnesota coming out with the zone early
there and just how did you all respond to that?  
TRAVIS WALTON: We knew Minnesota played different type of defenses. We know
they played man yesterday, primary man on Northwestern, but we know they can
play zone. They played zone against us in the first and second game. They are
a great team. They're young and they are scrappy, and today they kind of
brought it to us in the first half. In the second half we kind of picked it
up. But they did a great job of changing defenses on us.  
  
Q. Travis, you've always been known as a defensive guy, but what has it
meant to you to contribute to this team offensively even when you're not
scoring like you went 35 minutes today without scoring?  
TRAVIS WALTON: It's big. Basketball is not just about scoring. It's about
making assists for somebody else to have the opportunity to score. And it's
about setting people up. Running off plays hard so you can be a decoy to help
somebody else score.  
So if I'm not scoring on the ball I try to be a decoy or try to make a good
pass and not turn the ball over where I'm going to hurt the offense.  
  
Q. Chris or Travis, was the pace in the game about what you wanted and was
the zone a factor in that, in getting you guys going, the pace you might have
wanted?  
CHRIS ALLEN: First, it was just a slow game. It was like a 2-2-1 press. It
wasn't really a press, they were just trying to do it to slow us down. At
first we were kind of timid, scared to attack and then as the game kept going
we started to pick it up.  
  
Q. Chris, last season despite a sour ending against Memphis, you had a big
game. Is there anything about the post-season that you feed off of?  
CHRIS ALLEN: I wouldn't say that. I'm just trying to play hard and do
everything I can to help us win and get to the championship.  
  
Q. Westbrook yesterday had a good second half against Northwestern. You guys
pretty well shut him down there this afternoon. Was that a goal of you guys?  
TRAVIS WALTON: We knew Westbrook. He's a big-time player. Every time in the
end of a game he always step up and make big plays. You just seen it all year.
So we put a big focus on him in practice and scout team, containing him and
not letting him have the opportunities to score on us. We just did a great job
helping each other on defense and whoever was guarding him, we was giving him
the star treatment as far as what we do and we kind of contained him today in
the second half.  
  
Q. Given the injuries and illnesses you've been through, do you feel like
you're just now kind of coalescing and putting yourselves together and if so
was it frustrating having to wait this long to get everybody together?  
GORAN SUTON: Well, I think this is the healthiest we've been the whole year,
and I think it's frustrating in the beginning, in the middle. Having Raymar
out, having me out. Some other guys injuries and I think our best battle was
still to come and hopefully we can keep moving on in this tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Tom, with the foul trouble, you got a lot out of Gray and Green today. Is
there any extra benefit getting more time for them and getting their feet wet
a little bit more?  
COACH IZZO: Marquise probably deserves a little bit more time. He did a great
job and played well in that stretch. And it all comes down to mistakes, and I
thought early we didn't play as disciplined as I like to play. We were
reaching.  
They are a very good penetrating team. Travis said it best. We put a lot of
stock into Westbrook because he's a good player. I love Johnson, he plays so
hard.  
And he did a great job, and he really scored well. So I think we have depth
and they have depth, and yet our depth, with foul trouble, really worked to
our advantage. Especially I thought Draymond Green did a great job and I
thought Marquise did a great job and Chris coming off the bench.  
So these three guys, when you get three guys coming off the bench to do some
things, that really helps your team.  
  
Q. Tom, just out of curiosity, do you keep a plus/minus stat with your
players like hockey? It seemed like Travis' numbers would be off the chart if
you did.  
COACH IZZO: We've been taking more minuses lately as far as on things we were
supposed to do. Travis is the glue guy and did a great job bringing this group
together. Like Pat asked, for the most part we're still a little -- we're
getting better, and then we get Ray in foul trouble and G, and the good news
is we got guys to bring in. The bad news is we've got to get our main group
playing together if we're going to grow as a team.  
So we've got some depth. We utilized it today to help us win a game. But
Minnesota's got some depth, too, and they're going to be a dangerous team, I
think, in this tournament coming up, and I say that because they've got a lot
of different weapons and they've got a team that can play big and a team that
can play small and they're very well coached.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the alley-oop to Morgan coming out of the halftime
locker room? Was that a set play? Really seemed to help with the momentum
going into that half.  
COACH IZZO: Yeah, we tried to go with something to get him going a little bit.
He only played six or seven minutes. And so we have a play that we run and it
just happened to work, which half of them don't work three-quarters, nine-
tenths or whatever. But it was and I think it got Raymar going a little bit.  
Any time you get those kind of plays, I think it elevates your team's energy a
bit. It was a good play for us, good way to start out the second half.  
  
Q. Those that cover Michigan State know you well enough if this was a
regular season game I think you'd be up there, being a little more upset with
how this game went, but you've seen what has happened in all these other
league tournaments and stuff. Was it a matter of just survival and moving on,
do you have to just say we're satisfied?  
COACH IZZO: No. I'm not that cool. I thought Travis Walton said it best at
halftime. I try to tell our players, I've been in a lot of games and won a lot
of games in my career, and winning games is kind of anti-climatic. In the NCAA
time or Big Ten Tournament time when you're one and done it's critical.  
But if you have lures of grandeur of being something bigger than this, we have
to get better as a team. And he said we're not getting better this first half.  
I thought in the second half we got better, but I am trying to keep the
balance between realizing that first-day game for us, second-day game for them
is definitely an advantage for the other team. Now, after that it goes back
the other way.  
So it was a day when I said I knew Tubby well, I knew how hard his team was
going to play. I said if we can survive this. And they did a great job
yesterday and did a great job today.  
We just got that little run in the second half and that was the difference in
the game. So I am satisfied that we're moving on. I'm not as satisfied with
some of the things we did late and we made some mistakes that maybe we'll
discuss when we get back.  
  
Q. Could you please talk a bit about your coaching counterpart today and the
job he's done at Minnesota since he's arrived?  
COACH IZZO: You know, Tubby's been a good friend for a long time. We've played
him at Kentucky a lot, and every game was a one- and two-point game. I went to
Kuwait with him so I saw him on another side. If there's a better human being,
and I don't say that because he's a friend, I'm on the board with him, but the
job he's done up there, the problem is he's doing it too fast. When you do it
that fast then everybody expects, expects. And if you ask me, he's way in
front of the curve. And if you look at how young this team is, how many good
young players they've got, this is going to be a team to recon with.  
And they slide a little bit the second half. I don't think they slid a little
bit. It's just that other people with more experience, players, maybe rose up
a notch. But if you watch the passion he has for the game, he's a hard guy to
dislike. He does it the right way. His kids play hard.  
We're supposed to be a team that plays hard rebounds, gets loose balls, they
kicked our tail in the first half. They really did. And I think that's a
tribute to him getting his players right back up. I'm glad he's in the Big
Ten. He's a wonderful addition to our league.  
  
Q. Did you know that he would embrace the Big Ten, the defensive presence
and defensive style of play? What's the factor that seems to have really
pervaded the entire league the last few years?  
COACH IZZO: I don't know if he embraces it. I think he's a leader in it. If
you watched his teams at Kentucky, they played the same way. And he coaches it
to be tough. I had a couple of his guys when I coached in one of those World
U.S.A. teams, and I loved coaching his guys, because he embraces guys that go
hard, that do it the right way. That's all. That's what he does, if he's got
real talented players, if he's got not as talented players. But he's got some
good young players on the team and some good older players.  
I'm not counting him out. In tournament time he's a special coach and I've
gone against him many times and won some and lost some.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Robbie Hummel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18227)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  79  
Penn State - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start off with an opening statement from Coach Painter
and then questions for the players, and then we'll finish up with questions
for yourself.  
COACH PAINTER: First of all, I thought we were playing a very good team today.
Penn State is a very physical team. They have a lot of quickness. Talor Battle
and Pringle are a tough matchup in their quickness and ability to shoot from
25 feet, and Cornley is very difficult to keep off the glass, very difficult
matchup with his strength and his ability to shoot and drive.  
But I thought our guys did a good job, just jumping on them from the opening
tip and just staying with it and really never letting them get started in
terms of getting a lead or putting a stretch together where it had us
backpedalling or getting behind.  
We got that early lead and just stayed with it. And we did a good job on the
glass in the first half; didn't do as good a good job in the second half. But
the whole game we took care of the basketball. It's a good sign for our
offense because when we give ourselves a chance, I feel we're a good offensive
team.  
  
Q. You had said the other day that it was frustrating to sit and watch the
first two Penn State games, and I think the phrase you used to me was maybe I
can get in there and help. Obviously this was more like what you had imagined
and what was it about tonight that got it going for you?  
ROBBIE HUMMEL: I mean, I think it was a total team effort. I think everybody
played well, from Bob to Nemanja to Green, to the guys who started the game. I
thought everybody was really focused in and ready to play. I think the team
was sick of losing. We lost two in a row, it had been a while since we won,
and it felt good to be back in the win column.  
  
Q. Robbie, how big was this game for you guys? Lost three of four coming
into this. Was this kind of a must-win, or in that regard to kind of get your
confidence back and get back rolling to where you guys were earlier in the
year?  
ROBBIE HUMMEL: I think we took the approach that every game is a must-win from
here. It's single elimination. Obviously we have the NCAA Tournament but our
goal was to win the Big Ten Tournament. It would have been a major
disappointment if we didn't come out ready to play today.  
  
Q. Any of you, how good was it to see your offense flowing this well since
it hadn't flowed this well in a little while?  
E'TWAUN MOORE: We did a good job spacing out our whole team. Every time we
drove and they committed to us, kicked, got open shots. That's how Keaton and
Rob got a lot of open shots.  
We just did a good job of not turning the ball over also. I mean, didn't have
many turnovers in the game gave us a chance to win.  
  
Q. Guys, I think it was the last time you played here in Conseco, you guys
had the great 3-point shooting half against Davidson and this was almost the
same thing. Do you guys just like it here?  
KEATON GRANT: I think I definitely like the rim. I like shooting here. It
feels like you're more loose and I think the offense flows a lot better when
we're in this building.  
  
Q. Any of you guys, the beginning of the game you guys always play tough
defense but you really jumped on and pressed a little bit. Did Matt say
anything about them having played last night, you had four days' rest, that
your legs were probably going to be a little fresher than theirs were, and was
that true or not?  
KEATON GRANT: I think definitely that has something to play into it. I know we
wanted to jump on them the first five minutes. Coach said in the pregame
speech, he said make sure we go out there and play defense. We didn't want
Battle and Pringle to get loose on us. We just wanted to follow the scouting
report like Coach said.  
  
Q. Robbie, just talk about playing Illinois for a third time and what you
guys have to do to be successful tomorrow against the Illini?  
ROBBIE HUMMEL: I think we have to stop dribble penetration, because really
once you help Davis and Tisdale it's like it's almost an automatic two points.
We have to be able to contain their guards and not let Davis and Tisdale get
off. If we can do that, we'll be in good shape.  
  
Q. How concerned were you with the way you've been playing the last two
weeks?  
E'TWAUN MOORE: I mean, we definitely have some ups and downs the last few
weeks. We lost a few games. That was the end of the regular season. So now
it's the start of a new season since the Big Ten Tournament. We've just got to
be ready to come out and play. Our guys did a good job tonight getting the
win, and we've definitely got to be ready for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Robbie, can you talk about the matchup with Cornley? One of the most
intense players in the league, and down the stretch he was obviously battling
pretty hard when they got behind. Can you talk about that matchup?  
ROBBIE HUMMEL: He's obviously a very big, strong, physical guy. He really
wanted to win, and, I mean, obviously they're still playing in the tournament.
I think they should be in. But you never know, I guess. So I'll have to wait
until Sunday to see that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Matt, can you talk about what your thoughts were with your offense, how
well you thought you guys played offensively?  
COACH PAINTER: Any time you make shots, everything's going to look better.
Then it gets contagious, obviously when Keaton Grant makes those 3s and
Calasan makes those 3s, you're getting the production from your bench, you're
going to have success on the offensive.  
I thought our guys took better shots today, our shot selection was better. We
moved the basketball. Got the ball off the rims a couple times where we
couldn't finish, but for the most part we didn't change anything we were
doing. We just tried to be more efficient and play a little smarter.  
  
Q. Coach, going back a little ways, last time we saw you was quite a ways
back, Davidson, you started this game out it seemed like a mirror image of how
you played. It's really predicated on that. You guys start moving the ball
like that, that's really your flow. Have you been concerned that when that
flow doesn't happen that you're in a bit of a mess?  
COACH PAINTER: Yeah, I think a lot depends on who you're playing, whether it's
somebody zoning or somebody who is pressing or playing man-to-man. We've had
success against all of that. We've also had some failure against all of that.  
And when we force things and we don't take good shots, and we press a little
bit, that's when we have struggles. But when we're patient and I like to call
it aggressively patient, you've got to be able to probe the defense. Sometimes
it's there after a pass. Sometimes it's not there after seven or eight passes.  
It is a concern the past couple of weeks because we've been pressing. You want
your guys to be confident, because we have some good offensive players, but
they also have to understand what's a good shot and what's not a good shot,
time and score, how many you've made, how many you've missed. There's a lot of
factors that go into it. It's not an easy thing to do.  
But I think when you see us play together and be unselfish and share the
basketball, we can score the ball like we did today, especially in the first
half.  
  
Q. Matt, how impressive was this victory especially considering you did get
little to nothing from JaJaun?  
COACH PAINTER: I think it's a good sign any time one of your primary guys gets
in foul trouble and you're still able to have success. And that goes right
down the line with any of our guys that have been in foul trouble throughout
the year. If we can have success with one of them on the bench or one of them
injured, I think it's a plus.  
And you have to learn to play without your guys, whether that's injuries or
foul trouble. And tonight he got into foul trouble and got a couple quick ones
and got a couple obviously in the second half, and I thought Nemanja did a
good job in playing more minutes and helping us.  
But I think all our guys did a good job staying smart out there. Hopefully he
can stay out of foul trouble and play more in tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. Is there any real significant injury to Kramer?  
COACH PAINTER: I don't even know what happened. He said he got kneed by
Cornley. So I don't know if it's just a charley horse or what it was. I
thought at first it was a cramp. But he said Cornley got him with a knee.  
  
Q. Talk about how important this start was for you guys, I think it was 12-2
in the first couple of minutes of this game especially considering how the
guys have been playing and they've been shooting coming into the tournament.
How big was that start given the way the team ended the tournament?  
COACH PAINTER: I think any time you can start off that way it gives you
confidence. It just gave us confidence. Also you can jump out to leads like
that and you can think it's going to be easy. And you've got to try to keep
your guys on edge knowing that it's going to be very difficult.  
And it was difficult but we still had to have patience, and we didn't try to
hit home runs and try to knock them out right there. Just keep playing
possession basketball. Keep pushing it when it's there. When it's not there,
have patience and move it and try to break the defense down.  
  
Q. The struggles the last two weeks, were you curious how your team would
respond tonight? And have you been losing any sleep with the way the team has
been playing?  
COACH PAINTER: I thought they would respond in a positive fashion. And I knew
they would play hard. I was just hoping we could make a shot. And we have good
shooters. We have guys that are capable. I think that's obvious. But sometimes
in a season you get into slumps. Just like hitters in baseball. You get into
those slumps and it was good to see our guys kind of have a bounce-back game
and be able to go out and score the 51 points in the first half to give them
that confidence. I think that was important.  
But as a coach, you know, you lose sleep whether you're winning or losing,
it's just kind of the way it is.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your strong start offensively? How much of a part of
you that was you guys seemed to really push the tempo. Were you doing that
more than usual or were you just doing what you do?  
COACH PAINTER: We've been trying to push the tempo the whole year. At times we
get into ruts where you go back and you watch film and you're asking yourself
why aren't we pushing the basketball. Why are we walking the ball up the
court.  
And I think we play some people in our league that dictate tempo and the
possessions just mean so much, and you just have fewer possessions against
certain teams in our league. And I think it kind of grinds you into that mode,
and we really wanted to take those long rebounds, and we wanted to take the
turnovers and really push the basketball, and then our guys did a good job
tonight.  
Kramer did a good job couple times attacking after makes. We got the ball out
quick. Keaton pushed it, passed ahead to Kramer, we're able to attack one
time, we got a layup the other time, we got to the free throw line.  
That's what we want to do. We have athletic guys. We want to push the
basketball and try to get the defense on their heels.  
  
Q. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but did Penn State run into you
guys at a particularly bad time coming off two or three losses? You're not
used to losing. And you had rest also.  
COACH PAINTER: We played well and sometimes it's just like you said, it's the
timing of everything. You don't know how it's going to balance and everybody
said do you like your seed, do you like who you're playing. No, I don't want
to play anybody in the Big Ten, to be honest with you. I think we have a lot
of good teams in our league, but I just said we lost three out of four, if the
silver lining to it is it puts us on edge and we play better in the NCAA
Tournament or the Big Ten Tournament, not necessarily in that order, maybe
it's a good thing.  
  
Q. That does happen.  
COACH PAINTER: There's no doubt that happens. There's no doubt that it can be
a wake-up call and you can play better. But time will tell. We'll see how we
play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Just what you love to do: face Bruce's team for a third time this season.
Just your thoughts on that matchup and the Illini really have had your number
recently.  
COACH PAINTER: It's one thing to have somebody's number and to outplay them.
But Illinois has just really out-toughed us. More than anything Illinois has
just been tougher than us, been quicker to the basketball, they've been
stronger. They've got more rebounds, and I think that's been a staple for
Coach Keady's program and we've tried to get it to that point. I don't know if
we're at that point yet.  
But we've just got to play harder and we've got to play tougher than Illinois.
Obviously the last three times we've played them they've been able to do that
and that's why they've won.  
  
Q. You've talked about playing harder since the Northwestern game. I mean,
against Michigan State you got outrebounded, maybe took away from it a little
bit. Did you feel the energy was there and the guys gave the effort for the
whole way?  
COACH PAINTER: I thought the other night at Michigan State we did some good
things defensively. If you look at our body of work on the defensive end, we
do a pretty good job of guarding them. We just couldn't get the second-chance
points. And that's part of the game also. That's part of defense. You had to
finish your defensive position with a rebound, I understand that. But we did
some good things against them, and I think sometimes at a loss you've got to
take that positively.  
I thought we had a good effort. I thought we worked pretty hard. I don't know
if we played real smart, and I don't think we were real patient, and any time
you're against a great team like Michigan State, they're going to take some
things away, and when they do you have to be patient, and you have to put them
on defense for long periods of time when they take things away.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  61  
Wisconsin - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have Coach Matta make a couple of opening comments and
then we'll take questions for Evan or Jon and then we'll finish up with
questions for Coach.  
COACH MATTA: Just I think two great teams going at it. We felt like going in
this game it was going to come down to the wire.  
I think the difference for us, we did a better job from Game 1 taking care of
the basketball, and I thought our execution was much better. And that was the
big thing we sold our guys on.  
And then rebounding. We did a pretty good job rebounding the basketball. It
appeared, I don't know, about the 12-minute mark in the second half, and I
told these guys Wisconsin right now has all the juice. They've got all the
energy. And the last eight minutes somehow someway we've got to get that back,
and both of these guys made a couple of big plays.  
And we were fortunate to come out on the top side today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Evan, could you talk about what it's like playing with fouls down the
stretch there and still taking the ball to the basket and fighting for the
rebounds? Did you put the fouls out of your mind or did you have to just
forget about them at that point?  
EVAN TURNER: I just forgot about them. I saw the game was a winnable game,
and, you know, just kind of played with risk. If I was going to go out, I was
going to go out fighting, and just trying to help the team get the rebounds
needed. I wasn't too really worried about getting fouls, I was worried about
attacking and trying to win the game.  
  
Q. Evan, it appeared in the second half that you guys went almost
exclusively to taking the ball to the basket and taking it inside. And when
you do that, obviously you're going to get to the free throw line a lot, and
was there talk about that at halftime that you may have to win this game at
the free throw line, and especially the way you guys shot it from the line in
the first half, was there talk about making a few more in the second?  
EVAN TURNER: I think our mentality is just being aggressive, giving what the
defense gave us.  
And we were just attacking. The lanes were open. And we were all fortunate
enough to get to the basket, get a couple of fouls here and there. And just
executing and making free throws. And I think we just took advantage of what
they gave us.  
  
Q. Jon, you didn't have a whole lot of looks in the game, but take us
through the possession where you hit the 3 that I think put you guys ahead
during the game-closing run and what you saw and how it felt.  
JON DIEBLER: It was just a great read by Evan. I think what set it up was how
aggressive he was the last like five or six possessions going to the basket.  
And when he's being aggressive, you know, it gives the defense a choice. And
he made the right read and I was just thankful for knocking it down.  
  
Q. Evan, with a minute or whatever to go there when you guys called the
timeout and you came out, could you talk about what you were doing? Were you
just going to wait until you run the clock down and then take it to the basket
or what?  
EVAN TURNER: The plan was just for me to come off the screen and just make a
play like I've been doing.  
I don't know what I was really thinking, I was thinking of winning. However
they were going to give it to me I was going to take it. I was thinking about
taking a basket or making a play.  
  
Q. Regarding what Thad said about when he mentioned that Wisconsin had all
the juice and all the energy and somehow you were going to have to find a way
to win the game, what did you think about -- what came to mind as far as how
you were going to find a way to win that game?  
JON DIEBLER: Just getting stops. I think the start of the second half they
scored three, four times in a row, I think.  
And, again, Coach was right, we didn't come out with the intensity we needed
to. There's been times like that throughout the season where we've done -- I
think tonight we took a step in the right direction. We came together as a
group on the floor and said we need to pick up our intensity because we were
getting good looks on offense, and we knew defense was going to win the game.  
EVAN TURNER: And also we just knew the tougher team's going to win. We knew we
had to pick up our toughness and come together and get the stops we needed to
get and we knew we could score any time we wanted to. So it's just to get
defensive stops was really a plus.  
  
Q. You guys closed the game on a 14-3 run. Did the game feel similar to the
one in Madison because it was kind of touch and go in that one, too, and what
was the difference for you guys down the stretch this time to be able to close
like you did as opposed to up there?  
JON DIEBLER: I think today I think we finished possessions a lot better than
what we did when we played at Wisconsin. I'm not sure how many offensive
rebounds we had. But I think we did a lot better job this game than the last
game. We knew Wisconsin was going to go to the glass, and they send four guys
to the glass, and they're big.  
So I think the first half especially we did a really good job. I think that's
kind of why we had the lead going into halftime because we rebounded a lot
better than we did over in Madison.  
EVAN TURNER: I think also just like in Madison it's for us to take. Up in
Madison we didn't take the plays or do the easy things we needed to do in the
last couple of minutes to win the game, and Wisconsin pretty much just sat
there in Madison and, wow, they gave us the game. Here we just drew the lines.
Just got rebounds and made the plays we needed to. So pretty much this is in
our hands win or lose it, we felt like.  
  
Q. I'm curious, you looked like you were in pretty good shape as far as the
NCAA goes coming in here, but does this make you breathe a little easier?
Looks like now you almost certainly should be in.  
EVAN TURNER: Makes us breathe a little easier, simple fact that we want to
keep playing. First game is over and we want to get ready to get focused for
tomorrow. Not really worry about the tournament. There's some good teams here.
This is a prestigious tournament. We want to represent well and get to the
title game and play some good tomorrow hopefully and do what we came to do.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Finish up with questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Thad, the question I asked Evan about the strategy in the second half,
just seemed like you went to the basket a lot even when the ball wasn't in his
hands. Somebody was taking it to the basket. What was your thought there
playing that way in the second half?  
COACH MATTA: You know, it wasn't like a conservative, like this is, boom, what
we're going to do. I think a lot of things presented itself well. Our spacing
allowed those. Evan, I think he missed two layups to start the second half.
Had the ball right at the rim and then to convert them.  
Really seemed to lead off of that, and William was stretching the defense and
when Wisconsin plays us, one thing they've done it two times now, they don't
let us shoot 3s. I think they kind of do that to everybody.  
And they really lock on Jon as much as they possibly can, and I thought we
were just much more patient in letting things happen for us.  
  
Q. You talked about trying to take back the energy later in the second half.
Was part of that picking up the pressure defensively and pressure them more?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, felt like when we started the second half, we were just
kind of out there. And Wisconsin had the ability to do really whatever they
wanted to do. And our pressure points weren't what they needed to be, and
they're so well disciplined to kind of pick you apart.  
And we were kind of at their mercy, I felt like. And they did a couple of
things that Coach Ryan obviously saw and we had to adjust on the fly there.  
But I think that was probably the biggest thing for us, just extending and
getting our hands up and trying to tip and deflect the balls.  
  
Q. You've talked all year about the development of this team. I'm just
wondering, to close a game that was close 14-3 down the stretch, which, you
know, similar game to the one in Madison, if you feel like this was a sign of
where these guys have come over the last month or whatever?  
COACH MATTA: We've had enough practice throughout the course of the Big Ten
season, that's for sure. No, I think that hopefully this team is continuing to
grow. I mean, the one thing I've said all along about this season is in my
mind I think we've gotten a lot better.  
The problem is this league, you don't get to see it, because every game -- I
mean, you don't ever see the light at the end of the tunnel. Congratulations,
we beat a great team in Wisconsin. You've got Michigan State tomorrow. It's
sort of been that way.  
But for us to come from behind and make the plays that we had to make,
couldn't be prouder of these guys. And, like I said, I think we've gotten a
lot, lot better. In my mind I think we have. But you don't get to see it when
you go out and play the games because the competition is so good.  
  
Q. Along those same lines, last year your team got really good at the end,
you ended up in the NIT and winning the NIT, which is obviously not where you
want to be, but do you see that here? As I was asking the players, you
obviously want to get in the NCAA tournament. You've got young players who are
getting better. Is this a plus that way? Nothing's ever certain, I guess.  
COACH MATTA: It's funny, because it's like I've said, I told somebody before
the game with this basketball team, every day with the youthfulness of it has
been kind of like a new adventure. And from explaining to a couple of guys and
we laughed about it yesterday, how the Big Ten Tournament works and where it
is, they didn't know where it was, and all that stuff, and you try to keep in
your mind, hey, we could have this team back next year, and a lot of the guys
the following year.  
I think all the lessons, as they continue to play better, is very exciting for
our staff and hopefully our program. And as we keep moving through this, you
know, I just hope we keep getting better.  
And I think they have. I love this team from the standpoint -- somebody asked
me the other day, a media person, they said this appears to be the most
challenging year you've ever had. And I said it's been challenging because the
stretch through the Big Ten.  
But this has been -- I love this team. These guys come in. They go to work
every single day. They don't know any different. We've probably practiced this
team harder than any team we've ever practiced. And they just keep coming at
us.  
  
Q. Somebody came up to me in the closing minutes and said does every game
end the same way for Ohio State, and they were talking about Evan running the
point. And I said I guess the strategy is until somebody stops it, keep on
running. Is that your attitude towards what you're doing with him at the close
of games?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, a lot of it is really predicated on what the defense is
going to do and he had -- the biggest thing, he set himself up in the first
half to be successful in the second half by what he was doing. And I think
that's one of the big lessons Evan's got to continue to learn. He had a couple
of assists there and was moving better without the basketball, some things
we've been asking him to do.  
And he saw the rewards of it today.  
  
Q. The contributions you got from Jeremie, P.J. and Dallas, there was a
stretch where Evan was on the bench a lot at the end of the first half. And
you guys hung in there, actually took the lead. How big was that stretch in
the contributions of everybody up and down the roster?  
COACH MATTA: Very important. We had Jon and Evan sitting; those are our
40-minute guys. And both guys had two fouls in the first half. We ran the
risk, put Jon back in, and fortunately I think he got a bucket, if I'm not
mistaken.  
But, no, those three guys did a great job. Kyle Madsen did a great job on the
defensive end. He wishes he had that pass back. But they sparked us in and
Will's shot there at the end of the half gave us a little jolt of energy
because I didn't think we had played particularly well and we had to weather a
lot of storms, and I think that excited the locker room there at halftime.  
  
Q. Do you view this in any way as an NCAA elimination game or do you think
one or maybe both teams have done enough?  
COACH MATTA: Honestly, I viewed this game coming into this game both teams
were in. Maybe you can help yourself with a seed. We're probably right around
there. But I mean, Wisconsin, obviously with what they've done all year and
what we've done, the biggest thing is for us and Wisconsin, who finished
fourth and fifth, are tied, whatever it was, and the discrepancy to second and
third is one game in the No. 2 league in the country.  
For us, this shouldn't have come down to a one-game season. Both teams did
enough from November all the way through in finishing 10 and 8 in this league,
both teams are in great shape.  
  
Q. Is that what you told the players, though?  
COACH MATTA: No, no. No, I told them we've got a lot of work still to do.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Illinois  60  
Michigan - 50

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening statement from Coach Weber. We'll then
take questions just for the players and then we'll finish with questions for
Coach Weber.  
COACH WEBER: I guess, first, as far as Chester goes, he sustained a hand
injury on Wednesday in practice. Very sad for him. Obviously sad for our team.  
Our doctors and trainers, after meeting with the hand specialist, we felt the
only way we could get him back next week was a minor surgery which he went
through yesterday. He did come out fine from the surgery. He came with us on
the trip. He's been with us. He even asked to play tonight. But obviously we
weren't going to let him do that.  
We fully anticipate that he'll be back with us next week, wherever we are, and
so that's it for that.  
As far as the game, I challenged them about expectations from the beginning of
the season. I don't think anybody thought we would be second in the Big Ten,
24 wins. And I think tonight after Chester went down, it's human nature to
think we're not going to play well.  
So I challenged them to step up and take a major step and be special. We
needed people to be special. I think that's how it happened, some guys off the
bench took the opportunity and made the most of it.  
Calvin's very good defense on Harris really frustrated him. Jeffrey Jordan
came in and gave us good minutes. Dominique, Alex came in, made a couple
plays.  
I think the bench took advantage of the opportunity and our second half, the
defensive intensity, either they got tired or frustrated or both, we got on
the run. Trent made great shots, Mike Tisdale, Mike Davis made the big basket
when they were on the run.  
You knew they wouldn't quit. They knew this was it for them. I would hope --
they've had huge wins. Yesterday was important for them, and I would hope that
Michigan is in the NCAA with seven other teams from the Big Ten.  
  
Q. How much did Chester's presence and positive attitude impact you guys to
get ready to play this game tonight against Michigan?  
TRENT MEACHAM: I went to his apartment Wednesday night, and he was already
talking about what do we need to do? These guys gotta step up. Everyone's got
to step up. He's been a coach for us all season. And that's just continued.  
  
Q. Mike Davis, could you talk about that as well, just sort of the impact of
not having Chester, a guy who's really been an anchor on this team and what
that did to kind of get you pumped up?  
MIKE DAVIS: Before the game Chester came to my room, told me go out there and
play hard. If you play hard, everything will take care of itself. That's what
I did. He told me just play hard defense and your offense will take care of
itself and don't worry about missing shots.  
That's what I did tonight. I played a good game and my teammates came through
and we came out with a victory.  
  
Q. Mike, the crowd was really into this one. How much did it feel like it
was at Assembly Hall tonight.  
MIKE DAVIS: Felt great. Felt like we were at home. Michigan didn't have as
many fans as us. The one half of the whole side was all orange. That's big for
Big Ten Tournament game to have a home court feeling and the crowd was great.
They were loud the whole game. And we won the game.  
  
Q. Mike, the traffic you usually get was pretty much there tonight, but you
got hit from the outside. Did you just get it going and made it easier to
shoot from the outside too?  
MIKE DAVIS: Coach told me post up, there will be a little guard on you. Novak,
he's about 6-5, and I just shot over the top of him all night. But my shot was
falling like you said. My teammates did a good job finding me and my shots
fell.  
  
Q. First half it was mostly Mike and Demetri and you got in there in the
second half. Was there something at halftime that you guys talked about to get
you guys open?  
TRENT MEACHAM: We said let's pick it up, defense and offense, I was able to
hit a couple. Mike Tisdale got going, and I just think we stepped it up a
little bit. Defense pushed the ball on offense, and we were able to make some
shots, some plays.  
  
Q. Calvin, the first two times you played Michigan, how much did you guard
Manny Harris in those two games and how much did you attack him and block him
today?  
CALVIN BROCK: The two games I didn't guard him too much, got caught in
transition a couple times. Coach and Chester told me to get into him, try to
make him put the ball on the floor, not let him square me up and shoot 3s on
me. That's what I tried to do, and I had great help in defense from my
teammates.  
  
Q. You know Chester as well as anyone here, how is he handling this whole
situation, how is he feeling about it? Did he remain upbeat or did he get down
after the injury?  
CALVIN BROCK: He was positive about the situation. He was one of the loudest
cheerleaders on the bench tonight. He makes everybody play hard and we feed
off his energy.  
  
Q. Trent, did you guys kind of prove something to yourselves about being
able to play without Chester tonight?  
TRENT MEACHAM: He's been a huge part of our team. But we got a lot of guys
that can step up. Jeff came in and played great, defensive pressure. He can do
a lot of things. Calvin stepped in in the starting lineup, was great all
night. We have a lot of guys, all season it's been different people stepping
up on different nights. Now with him out for this tournament, everyone else
has just got to step up their games a little bit.  
  
Q. Trent, Calvin, as the seniors on the floor tonight, did you guys feel
like you had to pick up a different role, a leadership role more than you
usually had to take without Chester there?  
TRENT MEACHAM: I definitely think so. Because he's such a leader but he's
still leading us from the bench. But on the floor just trying to be a little
bit more vocal and bring that intensity that plays with and that passion, and
hopefully be a leader out there on the court. We need that not only from
myself and Calvin but everybody.  
  
Q. Calvin, talk about being the defensive stopper tonight. What's that role
like for you?  
CALVIN BROCK: I mean, I think I played decent defense on Manny, but I'd like
to thank my teammates because the help defense was there. He got by me a
couple times and my teammates were there to stop him, so it was great defense
by the whole team altogether.  
  
Q. Calvin, just talk about getting a win tonight after the two losses to
kind of give yourselves a positive note as you go to the NCAA tournament, even
regardless of what happens the rest of this tournament?  
CALVIN BROCK: I think it was a great confidence boost. Like you say, we lost
the two previous games, we came out with a chip on our shoulder and we played
hard. We did it the whole season, couldn't get two wins in a row. The two
losses made us want to get a W tonight and hopefully continue.  
  
Q. Trent, can you talk about how strong you guys came out in the second half
and, I guess, what changed?  
TRENT MEACHAM: We played I think okay in the first half. We were up 1 and
Coach said when we went up to Michigan we were up 1 at halftime. They took it
to us in the second half, it was reversed in Champaign.  
We wanted to step it up, got started on defense, got some steals, pressured
them and took them out of their stuff and we were able to make some shots. We
can just do that, keep that pressure on defense. That's what we've got to hang
our hats on.  
  
Q. This is the eleventh time Illinois's made it to the semifinals of the Big
Ten Tournament. Last year nobody expected you to get there. What are your
thoughts of the opportunity you have moving on to Saturday to play?  
CALVIN BROCK: I think it's a great opportunity. I mean, you get a chance to
get more wins, to hopefully help us out with our NCAA tournament bid. But it's
also a step closer to getting a Big Ten Tournament championship, which that's
our goal right now.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Bruce, what is Chester's injury? Is it a broken bone? And what was the
surgery?  
COACH WEBER: It's just a hand injury. And the doctor wanted -- he just felt
that to keep it stable, they had to do the surgery and make sure it stayed in
place. And he thought that was the best way to get him back. And the thing is
with Chester, two years ago he tore his MCL in the Big Ten Tournament. We
didn't tell anybody. He ended up playing with a torn MCL when our doctor said
it's probably physically impossible to do it. He's torn his quad. Doctor said
he actually played a game with a torn quad. You could actually stick your hand
in the muscle in the groove.  
And he played, finally he told us about it. And he ended up -- they said it
would be six to eight weeks. He played three weeks later.  
So if anybody can play next week, Chester can play, and we anticipate that
happening. But right now this gives some other guys opportunities and they did
a great job. I thought our defense, somebody asked about the second half. I
think our defense picked up. We got shutouts. We really got transition. And
the kids kept coming, huddled, they're tired, Coach. And we were able to beat
them down the courts. Good kick aheads, Mike Davis ran and Calvin ran and
Trent hit those couple back-to-backs and gave us the big lead and got the
crowd into it.  
  
Q. Coach, you just mentioned transition. Did you anticipate that going into
the game, that that would be there? And the follow-up to that is did you like
what you saw? Did it make you nervous?  
COACH WEBER: No, I want to run -- I've been asking to run all year. A couple
of our guys don't always do it. About the last three weeks we started drilling
practice, we do 15-second shot clock. And to make you run, you have no choice
but to run and we play little games, three-, four-minute games with 15-second
shot clock to get some transition, get some easy baskets when we have
struggled scoring because we walk it up, get in the half court set and don't
make shots.  
We've got pretty good athletes. Mike Davis, Calvin, Demetri, that's one thing
that Jeff did was push the basketball which put them on their heels.  
And Demetri talked to me. He said, Coach, their legs will be tired. I went
through it last year. And it's hard. It's hard each game to play the next game
without the extra day rest. So I think that we probably took advantage of it a
little bit. Now we'll see if we can react tomorrow.  
  
Q. Same thing I asked Calvin. Just how important to get a win so that you're
not going into NCAAs with three -- especially with Chester not there?  
COACH WEBER: You know, I gave him a goal way back at Christmastime at 24 wins.
And we've had a good season. But we were a little bit short of the 24 wins. We
had our chance last week. We didn't take care of it. It's kind of one of the
goals we set, and I challenged them today.  
And that I did the Matto, our play-hard chart, I did the T-shirt with 24 plus
41 on the Matto. If get 41 on the Matto, usually we win games. We're playing
hard enough and it will get us into 65. I said we've got to finish the
equation, and tonight we finished the equation. Now I gotta get him to be a
little greedy and see if we can keep going.  
  
Q. Bruce, the injury to Chester, is this optimism talking or reality that
he's going to be ready?  
COACH WEBER: I think if it was any other kid I would say we probably have no
chance at somebody playing. But I'm telling you, Chester asked us if he could
do warm-ups and try to play today. And he's a little off of it. He's a little
out of the box sometimes. And you guys have no idea what he's played through.  
And those are just two examples I gave you, because those were the most
extreme. But he's played when no one else will play many, many times and he's
practiced when many people wouldn't practice. If he can do it, he'll be out
there. I don't have any doubt. But maybe this will help us with some other
guys getting some minutes.  
And I've probably said it to our media many times, if I have one shortcoming
probably not as confident with the bench, and now I have no choice. They rose
up tonight and took advantage of the opportunity.  
  
Q. Early in the season most of Mike Davis's shots were face-up jumpers and
run-outs. Now he's getting back to posting up, getting the ball down low and
scoring more like a conventional big guy. Can you talk about his development
as a player?  
COACH WEBER: He doesn't like the physical contact. He doesn't have the body
yet. But the one thing we kept -- whether it was Iowa or Michigan, all week
we've talked about getting in the post. Because they usually put a smaller guy
or they switch. They switch on defense, and we actually put a couple little
sets in to get it in there, and then Tisdale flashing to the high post which
they did.  
Mike made a great high-low entry to him one time. I'm happy he's finding --
just don't have to hit those 17-footers, 15-footers. You can get other ways of
scoring. He got run-outs today, a put-back, a face-up, the hooks. He's
diversified his game a little bit and he hadn't played real well against
Michigan the first two times.  
So double-double today and the one big shot when they had the run and that
wasn't an easy one. That was huge for us to kind of quiet their run and allow
us to finish off the game.  
  
Q. Is there a fracture in the hand?  
COACH WEBER: It's a hand injury, that's all I'm going to say about it. That's
Chester's wishes and we're just going to move forward from there and hope we
can get it back. He's a tough critter, and I hope he's in there somehow. It's
his senior year. If he can get in there, he would. He wanted to start tonight
and me call timeout just to mess with some people. But I didn't want to take a
chance.  
  
Q. Bruce, do you think winning tonight like you did, does that signify to
the NCAA committee to maintain your seed?  
COACH WEBER: It was one of our challenges and goals tonight. I didn't bring it
up too much to the players, but mentally I'm thinking this is a chance. We can
show, hey, Michigan's a good team. They've beaten Duke. They've beaten UCLA.
They've beaten some pretty good folks. If we can do it on a neutral court
without -- I think people would think he's our MVP or the heart of our team. I
think it shows a lot for our kids.  
And then we have another challenge tomorrow. Get to hang around a little bit
and play another game and see how we keep making progress.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2009

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [David Merritt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19491)

### [Zack Novak](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19492)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Illinois  60  
Michigan - 50

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, you're free to go ahead and we'll take an opening
comment from you and then we'll take questions for the players and then finish
up with questions for Coach Beilein.  
COACH BEILEIN: Illinois just really played a great defensive -- both offense
and defense. Davis was terrific and Bruce's game plan was terrific. But their
defense, in just a couple spans in the second half, were just too much for us
to handle.  
We just really had trouble with a couple of -- the pressure they were putting
on us and we didn't respond. A bit uncharacteristic for how we've responded
over the last month. But we'll learn a lot from it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for David or Zack Novak.  
  
Q. This is going to be for David or Zack, do you guys think you guys did
enough to get the NCAA tournament bid?  
DAVID MERRITT: Hopefully. I think we've made a case. We've played everybody
this year, haven't strayed away from playing anybody. We've competed in a
tough conference. It's one of the best in the country. Went 9-9 in that
conference and was able to get a win yesterday. So hopefully we've done enough
to make our case.  
  
Q. Coach Weber said he made it a point to push the ball and said you guys
looked a little fatigued, would you say you guys were tired out there,
especially when you guys were getting attacked constantly, pushing the ball
down the court?  
ZACK NOVAK: I think there was a little period there. There was a media timeout
for like eight minutes it seemed like in the first half towards down to like
the five-minute mark.  
That was the only time I really remember, just it seemed like there was a lot
of fatigue. But it felt like it was going both ways. Other than that, no, we
just -- I didn't feel like that was a huge issue.  
  
Q. Zack, what do you think happened during the big run when they kind of put
it to you guys in the second half? What do you think was the difference
there?  
ZACK NOVAK: We lost our poise a little bit on offense, and then that led to --
that led to them getting some open shots on their offensive end and they
knocked them down. I think they started 7-for-10 in the second half. And
that's tough to overcome.  
  
Q. David, you guys have talked all year about playing better when you guys
are backed into a corner a little bit. Did it feel like that when you were
down 18, 19 points when you made the run?  
DAVID MERRITT: Backed into a corner? Yeah, I mean, we felt that this was a
must-win game as well. That's how we tried to approach it. Being down 18, you
don't want to lose or have that kind of score. So we buckled down and tried to
give as much effort as we can and hopefully pull the game out. We weren't able
to do that, though.  
  
Q. Zack, a question I asked of David, what do you think about your NCAA
profile?  
ZACK NOVAK: I think we've done as much as we can this year. We've played the
10th -- the Top 10 strength of schedule. I mean, we've got the big wins. I
mean, we've done as much as we can up to this point. We're just -- I mean, the
committee knows what they're doing and we're just hopeful and we think we've
got a pretty strong case.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. John, Harris and Sims had terrific games yesterday. Did that take
something out of them or was this more --  
COACH BEILEIN: You really can't measure that. But the Illinois defense was
terrific. It usually is. It was very difficult. They really did a great job of
keeping Manny from getting into the comfortable, in the comfortable positions
and then really DeShawn got some really good looks. Got 19 shots off and
really got some good looks and the ball didn't quite bounce his way. So we'll
be ready to bounce back at our next game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the will and the heart of your team coming back and
making it a game with about two minutes to go when you were seemingly left for
dead at that point?  
COACH BEILEIN: By the 10-foot or 12-foot jump hook that made it go back to 9
when we had it down to 7. So that's the way we always want our teams to play.
And I told them that this is a situation that if we're fortunate enough to
have a great day on Sunday, that this would be the same game. We'll be playing
the same type of game.  
Illinois is good enough to have a great seed and we're going to be one of
those ones in the upper part of the seeding bracket and this is going to be
the same game and we're going to have to respond better than we did tonight.
So it was a great teaching tool for us.  
I was really proud of the way we came back into the game and made it a game in
the last five minutes.  
  
Q. Coach, because you can use the term as kind of a focal point in that kind
of a learning lesson, does it sink in more, do you think, because they've got
something immediately to work on?  
COACH BEILEIN: Yeah, you mean as far as -- like I said, I think we played well
enough in the first half to be up by seven or eight at halftime, if we just
had some tough breaks with the ball, just getting in the basket. But the
second half now we understand that where any issues we have we'll address from
the film.  
And like always they'll sit there and they'll say, yeah, I could do this or I
could do that. We have a very receptive team to being coached and very
cohesive team as far as assisting each other through it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  79  
Penn State - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you'd start us off with an opening statement.  
COACH DECHELLIS: I just thought Purdue played very, very well tonight. They
shot the ball extremely well from 3, and, you know, they just had it going
offensively. We just didn't have any answers for them defensively, and I
thought they just played well. I don't know if we just -- we didn't play bad.
I just thought they played really, really well. So credit to them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Talor or Jamelle.  
  
Q. You guys played obviously last night and they came in fresh. How much of
a challenge did that present to your guys and how much of an advantage was it
for them coming in fresh?  
JAMELLE CORNLEY: To be completely honest, we thought we had the advantage with
shooting in the arena last night, coming off of a win. We understood they had
lost three out of their last four conference games. So we really thought we
had the advantage. We're a momentum team. So regardless if we played last
night or not we really thought we could come out and put on a great showing
tonight.  
  
Q. Jamelle, talk about whether or not you believe that you guys have enough
in your resume to make the tournament?  
JAMELLE CORNLEY: We were just outside talking about it. And it's a situation
where it is absolutely out of our hands. And that's the bad part from a
player's standpoint, is that we want something else. We wish there was
something else that we can do. But honestly I think we do. I think that
everybody looks at the strength of schedule issue and, again, that's out of
our control. But we got a great record against the Top 50.  
And we just hope that that's enough. I think we've had a fairly successful
year, a pretty good year, and we'll see come Sunday.  
  
Q. Talor, how tough is it when they're playing the type of defense that they
do for the whole game, pressing, trapping, how demoralizing is that?  
TALOR BATTLE: It was just tiring. I feel like really playing -- I played 40
minutes but really like 80 because they pressured me full court and then I
have to turn around and guard at the same time.  
They do a great job at that, just wearing you down and it's hard to go 40
minutes trying to bring the ball up, and that slow pace, that's tough because
they try to speed you up. Credit to them. They do a great job at that.  
  
Q. Jamelle, what was going through your mind in the last -- in the middle of
the second half? You were pacing back and forth like a lion. I was back there
talking to some of these guys and they really admire your fight. What was
going through your head, if you can describe it?  
JAMELLE CORNLEY: As a senior you want to leave everything out on the court.
And this was my last game here in the Big Ten Tournament. And I just want to
go out with respect. I wanted to make it respectable, and I wanted to leave
everything I had out on the court and I expect the same thing out of my
teammates.  
But I think they understand -- I think they understand why I do the things I
do and why I try to leave everything on the court. I hope once they become
seniors they'll understand why you have to leave everything out on the court.  
But that's just the way you should play the game because you only have 40
minutes. You're not guaranteed to play all 40 minutes. So while you're out
there you might as well play as hard as you can.  
  
Q. Talor, you talked about their defensive pressure obviously. You still put
up 65 points against a very good team. Were you satisfied with your offensive
output or do you think you could have done more defensively maybe to shut them
down?  
TALOR BATTLE: Offensively, we could have executed a little better. But we
scored -- like you said, we scored 65 points. But, I mean, defensively, you
know, we definitely -- Coach mentioned they played a really good game.  
But we could have done a little more. We gave them a lot of open shots. They
did hit some tough ones, but still the open ones, transition baskets we gave
up. We could have did a better job at that. But Coach was saying in the locker
room, 35 points at the half, you think we'll be right there with them. But
they got 51, that's the most we gave up all season and the most they scored.  
So we did a poor job at that.  
  
Q. Talor, they have five days' rest, you guys have 26 hours. What do your
legs feel like and what do you think their legs felt like?  
TALOR BATTLE: Man, I'm young. My legs felt good going into the game. I was
excited. I mean, there's no excuse. The fatigue thing, there's no excuse. You
can ask all the guys. We were ready to play. They just came out.  
They had a lot of fans behind them and they just shot the ball great. Credit
to them. Not taking anything away from Purdue. They played a heck of a game.  
  
Q. Either of you guys, will you be watching what's going on around the
country for the next 24, 48 hours?  
TALOR BATTLE: I won't.  
JAMELLE CORNLEY: I'll be completely honest, I probably won't. I'll make myself
sick if I do something like that.  
But I'm going try my hardest to keep an open mind and try to be as optimistic
as much as possible. And it's in someone else's hands now, and we'll see what
happens.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Obviously those guys said that they thought they had an advantage coming
into this game. What did you think as far as the rest issue was concerned?  
COACH DECHELLIS: I thought we talked about -- we tried to sell our guys on the
advantage that we shot, we played in here, we had momentum.  
I thought that was all positive. I give Purdue credit. They just played well.
They just shot the heck out of the ball. I think Keaton Grant didn't miss a 3
the first half. They had it going offensively from the perimeter. Then we
pushed out and they got the ball inside. I think they had 20 points in the
paint in the first half. I think their offense -- defensively we were trying
to guard. Were we a step slow? Yeah, we were a step slow on some stuff. But
I'm going to give the credit to them.  
  
Q. Have you ever seen Jamelle like that in the second half, like he was? He
looked like he was possessed, like he wanted to start a street fight or
something.  
COACH DECHELLIS: I've seen him in practice that way. We try to get him out at
the 12-minute mark just to give him a quick blow. But he didn't want to come
out. We thought we could give him a quick blow to make a run at the last 12
minutes.  
But he's a competitive kid and he has a heart of a lion. I love him dearly. He
wanted to leave it all out there on the floor and I think he did, he just
willed some of the balls into the basket. And I thought he played well and a
lot of heart and toughness.  
  
Q. First of all, they jumped out with a big lead. Obviously their shooting
got them out there. What were you thinking about in terms of trying to get
caught up?  
COACH DECHELLIS: What were we thinking to do to get caught up? We didn't just
guard them. I thought we didn't score early. And that put us in a little bit
of a bind. But at the defensive end we were trying to guard them and we just
didn't do a very good job guarding them. And they just made some open 3s and
some tough shots, some hands in the face.  
But we had no answers for that.  
  
Q. And your thoughts about your team's opportunity to be in the NCAA?  
COACH DECHELLIS: Well, I think we have a great opportunity to be in the
tournament. I think we've got 22 wins. We're 10-8 in the league. Got a lot of
wins versus the top 50 RPI teams. We have some wins versus the Top 25. I think
we're one of the best 65 teams now. We'll wait to see what happens on Sunday
night.  
  
Q. When you're down by 20 plus, is it difficult to keep this team sort of
motivated, to keep playing through it?  
COACH DECHELLIS: I don't know if it's motivation. I think it's pride. It's
your character. It's your toughness. It's all the things that we talk about in
athletics. It's easy to go the other way, but they haven't done that all year.
And I told them to play hard and play the way we wanted to play, and the kids
did that.  
And that's what all this stuff is supposed to teach people, how to pick
themselves up off the ground when things aren't going well, continue to fight,
continue to work hard. And that's what this team has done all year. They've
been resilient all year. They've had big comebacks, made big plays to win
games, and I wouldn't expect anything less out of them.  
  
Q. Why didn't you play the freshmen earlier being down so much with their
3-point shooting?  
COACH DECHELLIS: The freshmen earlier, because we felt like with the guys we
could go with in terms of defense. And it just didn't work.  
  
Q. What do you tell your guys in the next 48 hours to do, basically, with
everything outside of their control?  
COACH DECHELLIS: Well, I talk to the guys after the game about all the
positive things that we've accomplished this year. We were 10-8 in the league,
second time in the school's history we've had a winning record in the Big Ten.
We have 21 regular-season wins. The most in the school's regular season
history.  
We had wins at East Lansing, wins at Champaign. We had a lot of great things
happen this year to this team. And those were all the positives I pointed out
to this team. What happens over the next 48 hours, we can't control it now.  
I think we've made our case. We've won big games. We've beaten good people.
And now the chips have to fall where they fall.  
  
Q. Coach, this was the first time you played Purdue with Hummel. Are they
just so much better with him in the lineup? Is it almost night and day?  
COACH DECHELLIS: I don't know if it's night and day. I think he adds a
dimension, perimeter jump shooting, that's important for them. And I thought
you look at our bench points.  
Our bench, they really outscored us at the bench. It was 24 to 5 I think. And
Keaton Grant was the guy who hurt us tonight. Robbie Hummel is a good player
and I understand where you're coming from, but I thought their bench was
really key for them tonight. Especially Keaton Grant coming off and knocking
down all the shots that he did and kind of give him the cushion that they
needed to play a little loose and a little free.  
But Rob's a great player. And he certainly adds a different dimension in terms
of guarding him and a guy who can knock down shots from the perimeter, and has
very good pass-through as well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Ralph Sampson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19443)

### [Tubby Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13960)

### [Lawrence Westbrook](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18149)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Minnesota  66  
Northwestern - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: As the Minnesota players make their way up, we'll ask Coach
Smith to make a couple of opening comments, then we'll take questions for
Ralph and Lawrence and we'll finish up with Coach Smith.  
Coach, you're free to make some opening comments, please.  
COACH SMITH: I certainly want to commend and compliment Northwestern. Bill
Carmody has done an outstanding job this year and his team's always played
tough.  
They beat us at their place this year, and they didn't have their full
complement of players at all in Minneapolis. But today was a good all-around
team effort on our guys' part.  
I thought we kept our composure and made some big plays down the stretch to
get a good win today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please, for either of the players.  
  
Q. For Tubby and players, you've had your backs against the wall in other
games, against Penn State and Ohio State late. What was the difference today?
How were you able to pull out that late run and pull off the win?  
LAWRENCE WESTBROOK: I think that today we stuck together as a team. We had
everybody contribute. We had big deflections, big blocks by Ralph and Damian.
I thought Damian threw Ralph nice alley oop passes. Just a collective effort.
And we came up with big plays sometimes in a couple games we lost, one or two
bounces went the other way. But today we got them and Colton was diving on the
floor. Made all the hustle plays, and I think that helped us win.  
RALPH SAMPSON III: For me, it's that time of year. It's March. Coming in as a
freshman, this is my first time being in playoffs, and so for me -- and I'm
sure most of the new guys here, they're coming in giving it their all.  
And the veterans being here before, taking us under their wing, and showing us
the ropes of how the Big Ten tournament works, it really helped the team come
together more as one unit.  
And we all worked for the common win today. And that was the deciding factor
today.  
  
Q. Lawrence, what was the difference for you between the two halves, didn't
have any points at halftime then obviously the big second half?  
LAWRENCE WESTBROOK: Just really no difference. I didn't want to come out and
force anything. I just wanted to let the game come to me. Maybe just playing a
little tentative in the first half. But I just relaxed and a couple shots went
for me in the second half, and I think that just sparked me a little bit.  
  
Q. Ralph, kind of wondered if you could talk about your freshman year and
how you think you've progressed and what things you've improved at the most?  
RALPH SAMPSON III: I think I improved 100 percent in my overall game. Under
the leadership of Coach Smith and all the veteran players, they helped me
evolve my game 100 percent since the first day I walked in the door.  
We're working on post moves and perimeter moves, all-around game. So become
more complete and more efficient player.  
  
Q. Does winning this game today make you feel more secure about your NCAA
tournament status, this may be the one that gets you in?  
LAWRENCE WESTBROOK: Well, we never looked at it that way. Obviously it was a
big win. I'm not going to lie. We watched TV. We hear what people are saying.
But the only for sure way that we're going to be in the tournament is if we
just win.  
And it was a big game for us to win today, and hopefully we can try to win
again tomorrow. But if we just keep doing that, I think our fate's in our own
hands.  
  
Q. You touched on it earlier about the first half and the second half, their
press caused you guys some problems. How did you adjust to that and get
through that stretch when they took the lead from you?  
LAWRENCE WESTBROOK: Yeah, their press, they have a good 1-3-1 press. I think
the problem is with teams, you float the passes over them, and we were sharper
with the ball, had more crisp passes in the second half, and we fought our
cutters cutting to the basket. We made a lot of skip passes. The key was
quickly moving the ball and be sharp with your passes, and that helped us see
the open lanes and get open shots.  
  
Q. Ralph, after the 19-5 run by Northwestern and, Ralph, you were involved
with the 3-point play and had the dunk also, your thoughts as a freshman at
that period of the game?  
RALPH SAMPSON III: Really for me I know that the game was close, and I know
that we couldn't let this one slip away. So during those two plays, I knew we
had to score and it was a great entry pass, and I just had to get it up on the
back board and try to score it and it went in, and had to knock a free throw
down. And then after the lob from Damian, it helped bring a lot of energy to
the team and we were able to play and had great defense and offense from
there.  
  
Q. Lawrence, on your defense, from the team perspective, Coble didn't hurt
you in the second half like he almost killed you in the first half, and Craig
Moore you guys kept under control all day. What were you doing against those
two guys?  
LAWRENCE WESTBROOK: They're really good players and you're not going to
totally shut them down. You're just hoping to contain them. We just wanted to
make them dribble and contest every shot, and we could live with that.  
I think we did a pretty good job of trying to make Kevin dribble a lot and
Damian is a really good defender and he changed his shots. With Craig we just
wanted to make him play defense as well, get him tired.  
And he had some open looks. He wasn't shooting his best today. I mean, I'm
glad that he had an off-day today.  
  
Q. Your bench outscored Northwestern 27-0 first half. If your bench is
playing like that, how well can you guys do against Michigan State? What do
you think?  
LAWRENCE WESTBROOK: I think that we can do well against Michigan State. That's
one of the staples of this team. Coach Smith plays a lot people around the
same amount of minutes. Like with any team, if you get contributions from off
the bench, you are just going to be that more powerful and effective.  
So if we get a team effort like that and everybody is scoring, I think we'll
be tough to guard.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll finish up with Coach Smith.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the last five minutes, Northwestern comes
back after you had the lead for most of the game, and just sort of the heart
your team showed down the stretch?  
COACH SMITH: Well, we've had those periods of droughts where we haven't been
able to score. They made some -- they threw the ball off guys and got them
back.  
It seemed like everything was going against us during that stretch. We'd maybe
get a stop or block it out of bounds. They score, we block it and they get it
and throw it back out.  
But our kids -- I never saw that panic in them, and that was something -- we
haven't seen it all year long. But as Lawrence said earlier, we were able to
make some key stops, key plays, the 3-point play by Ralph was huge at that
time. It was a nice entry pass like he said, went to the baseline side, and he
took it up strong and was able to finish. I think that was a big key.  
But I just thought our kids were focused and were not going to be denied
during that stretch.  
  
Q. Can you talk about defending Coble and just the halftime adjustments of
trying to shut him down after he had that big first half?  
COACH SMITH: We were disappointed the way we ended the half. We shoot a free
throw and everybody knows whose man they had, they should, but obviously they
didn't. And he runs down and gets the 3. So you can imagine that was the topic
of halftime, mostly and I think our kids took that to heart and they decided
to do a better job defensively.  
And I think we really did a better job of really trying to run them off the
3-point line, chase them more, and we held them to just three 3s after having
five, and I thought that was a big part of it.  
  
Q. Tubby, virtually every expert thinks that if you got the win today it
would put you in the NCAA tournament. Your thoughts?  
COACH SMITH: I hope they're right. I hope all those experts are right.  
But we've had a good year. We've had a solid year. We had a tough February.
Five out of seven games on the road we lost. But those are no excuses, but
this is a young team that's getting better.  
We played well against Michigan, but it was a very emotional night, with
seniors, but I think we've done our work early in the season and hopefully we
can continue to play in this tournament well.  
  
Q. Tubby, I know you substitute a ton as it is, but you had 10 guys in by
six minutes or whatever, was that to wear down Northwestern, was that looking
ahead realizing you may have to go four in four days?  
COACH SMITH: No, we've got guys that I guess have been programmed to sort of
play a certain amount. And then I didn't think we were really getting the
energy at the time. And certainly Devron came off the bench and gave us
positive minutes. Devoe gave us positive minutes Blake. That group really
defended well. Colton is bench starting. We knew we needed Ralph. Their team,
they really make you use a lot of energy trying to attack their zone.  
It doesn't look but it taxes you mentally and psychologically. And they do --
and they're very effective at it. I thought we needed more shooting, more
outside shooting. Al was struggling early in the game shooting the ball. So I
thought we'd get Blake, Devron, Blake, maybe I would get -- and it did, it
opened it up in a way to not only get some open looks but get the ball to the
basket on slices and cuts to the basket.  
  
Q. Coach, the last couple of games Devron hadn't played and then comes in
here and has a great first half. What does it say about just his ability to
stay in the flow of the game?  
COACH SMITH: Well, I sort of told him it was my mistake in the game in
Minneapolis. I was watching the tape of Michigan, and had gotten beaten back
door, previous games. And those kind of things will stick in your mind
sometimes and that's all I saw. So I said, I got the games confused, son.  
But he is a good player. He's a guy that feeds off of his offense. And I need
him to be more defensive-minded. And he's starting to understand that.  
  
Q. Tubby, has Ralph Sampson exceeded your expectations of what you thought
he could do this year?  
COACH SMITH: I don't know exceeding, and my expectations are pretty high. But
he's certainly developed and grown into being a pretty good player for us. And
really has come on. He's gotten stronger. He's as hard a worker as we have in
our program. He's always willing to stay late, come early. And that's why he's
improved.  
  
Q. What does this team have to do to compete against Michigan State,
especially after the last outing against the team?  
COACH SMITH: That was a pretty miserable day, night up in Michigan State. But
we feel like we've improved. Certainly Michigan State has improved as well.
They're very talented, very deep. They play with a lot of confidence, as hot
as any team in the country.  
So we have to play a better game than we played today. Take care of the ball
like we did today. If we do that, I think we'll give ourselves a chance.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan  73  
Iowa - 45

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you could just make a couple opening comments. We'll
take questions for the two Iowa players and finish with Coach Lickliter.  
COACH LICKLITER: This is a team that has competed throughout the season at a
good level. Seldom have they been in a situation like this. I think West
Virginia was like this, maybe one other.  
But today was -- we ran into a team that -- we just couldn't challenge them.
It started off early. And just it was one of those things where we didn't have
an answer for them defensively.  
It's a team that Jake Kelly shifted over to the point and had done a great
job, but we still had limited time. So we've got less options offensively than
what we need.  
But he's done a terrific job at that position. Cyrus has come back and played
42 minutes last game. Played quite a few this game, after missing most of the
Big Ten. So these two guys have done a really good job.  
And it's hard when you're competing to gauge progress if you're not winning.
But they've set a foundation, I think, that we can build upon and it's not the
year we wanted, but the way that they played and the way they approached it
I'm proud of this team. It's a tough way to end.  
But I'm proud of the way this team has responded throughout the year.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Jake or Cyrus?  
  
Q. Jake, can you talk a little bit about what they were doing defensively
that kind of neutralized you and Matt and what were they doing differently?  
JAKE KELLY: I don't think they were really doing that much things different
than the last time we played them at home. We just weren't executing well. And
I think we weren't getting good enough screens and I wasn't doing a good job
of maybe pushing the screen and using my teammates to do some more things for
me. I think I was forcing some stuff.  
But I think we just fought really hard and it's just one of those games where
it got out of hand early and we couldn't corral it back together in our hands.  
  
Q. Both players, if you could reflect maybe back to the start of the game
and just your thoughts over that first five minutes or so. Cyrus first,
Jake?  
CYRUS TATE: I think we let Michigan get comfortable early in the beginning of
the game. And they kind of got a roll going and comfortable. At a point the
game got out of hand and we tried to fight back throughout the end of the
first half and tried to in the second half make adjustments to cut the lead
down.  
JAKE KELLY: Yeah, just to add on what Cy said, I think DeShawn got them off to
an early start and they just got rolling from there. He gave all his teammates
confidence, and from there on out everybody's comfortable and knocking down
60, 70 percent of their shots. So it's tough to defeat a team like that who is
capable of shooting the ball like they did.  
  
Q. Cy, obviously not where you want to end your career at Iowa, but is there
anything you'd like to say to the fans, to the university as a whole, as how
your time at Iowa was?  
CYRUS TATE: I just wanted to thank the university for giving me an
opportunity. It was a long ride getting here to this point. And it's been
great. And I wish things could have been different. But for the most part, I'm
just thankful just for having the opportunity to be here and play for Iowa.  
  
Q. Cy, what specifically was Sims doing to be able to get so open and do so
much in the first half especially?  
CYRUS TATE: I don't know. It's not much from what he's doing in the past, but
he's got a real good rhythm, and he got real comfortable and he's hard to
guard. He's hard to guard throughout the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
COACH LICKLITER: I'll say this, these guys are real classy guys. They wouldn't
make any excuses. I probably didn't help them near as much offensively as I
would have liked to. But you can see neither one of them are going to make any
excuses.  
  
Q. Coach, when a player like Sims gets off on a start like he did, what goes
through your mind and is there anything that you can do to just stop that?  
COACH LICKLITER: It's a lot harder to stop it than it is to try to prevent it.
I thought that his floor positioning was to their advantage. He caught the
ball where he wanted to catch it, and then was able to basically -- as these
two guys said, he was very comfortable.  
And that's a big problem. I think the last couple of games -- and I can't
remember, I thought up there, especially, we were able to challenge him for
spots on the floor. We couldn't do that today. And we did some switching and
to their credit they rolled him right into their post on our guards and we
weren't able to counter that.  
And that's a coaching decision. But I did think that he got awfully
comfortable, and like I say, we weren't preventing his touches.  
  
Q. Todd, how do you feel --  
COACH LICKLITER: Sick. Excuse me.  
  
Q. I have a follow-up question.  
COACH LICKLITER: Okay. I thought I'd tell you just so you'd know. I'm sorry.  
  
Q. That's all right. How do you feel your program is as opposed to where it
was a year ago today and how do you get it to a higher level a year from
now?  
COACH LICKLITER: Well, I mean, I think, I've said this a couple of times,
we've made progress. And you're never satisfied until you've reached your
goals. And there's a lot of contributing factors to getting a program to a
championship level. And we're working diligently within the program to make
those things happen.  
I told the guys today, afterwards, that they had fought hard almost all year.
And that's a big step. I think they've laid a foundation, and if you're not
winning, then you sure better be getting ready to win. So much of that is
approach. So much of that is competitive spirit, as wanting to be coached.
Personnel. Things of that nature.  
And these guys, I think, have established a real good approach, a competitive
approach. Are we where we need to be? No. We need to improve on that. But
we've got an off season to work on it and a recruiter or two coming in and
some growth.  
If you look at the guys who returned, Jake Kelly, Jarryd Cole when he was
healthy, Jeff Peterson, Cyrus Tate, those guys that returned that were
contributing, you know, too me they were better within our system. They were
better players. And so we think that it will continue to evolve that way and
not because we want it to or hope it does but because they make it happen.  
So all we can do is control the things that we can control: the way we
approach the game, the way we teach it, the personnel we recruit.  
  
Q. Are you interested in going to the tournaments that are not the NIT?  
COACH LICKLITER: I think that the criteria is a winning record for most of
those. And that would probably eliminate us. We're set to go on our trip
overseas in the end of May. And so that will be our focus now, as far as we'll
get 10 practice days. We'll have our individual instruction, and we'll play,
it looks like, in Italy and Greece.  
That should be our post-season at this point is what I'm looking at.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Penn State  66  
Indiana - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'd like you to make an opening comment, and then we'll
take questions for the two Indiana players. And then we'll finish up with
questions for Coach Crean.  
COACH CREAN: First off, I want to thank every fan that supported us from
close, far, in assembly hall, through e-mail, through letters, on the road,
you name it. It has been, as I said to the team after the game, we may not
understand how great that is right now, but there will be a time, a day when
we'll look at it and know that our fan support was just beyond anything that
anybody could have ever imagined for.  
And early on we tried to make it as clear as possible while we were going
through all the disaster that was known as Indiana basketball in April and May
and part of June to understand that we had to go through it together.  
Whether it was all of our players that were coming in, the two returners, in
Kyle and Brett, our coaches, you name it. And our administration. We had to go
through it together.  
Well, we had to go through it together with the fans and every one of them has
bought in. And I can't say enough about that, and I can't show enough respect
to possibly put it into context what that means.  
As far as the game, as far as our team, I think we've improved a great deal.
Everybody on this team has improved a lot. And these two right here might lead
the way with that. One, because he had 34 points in his career, and he was
asked to do things that he could have never ever dreamed of inside the program
and help us in so many ways. And certainly with the way Verdell has progressed
throughout the season, throughout the conference season, especially, to see
how much better he's gotten.  
And I think that's what we're going to really build towards in our program.
We're going to build the future built on improvement and improvement will lead
to winning.  
But we played a very good team today. We played a team that got their
confidence early. Cornley was the one guy we were more fearful of than anybody
else and we didn't answer the bell on getting stops on him right away.  
But we continued to play in it, and it's just the way it is. They're a good
team. Very well coached, as is the rest of this league. And I hope they get in
the NCAA. I don't even know why it would be close. But there's very few teams
here that don't belong in that tournament. And the two that probably don't are
the ones that are going home, in the sense of the teams that weren't on the
bubble. There shouldn't be a bubble for the rest of this league.  
I spent three years in the Big East. It's a tremendous league, but this league
doesn't take a back seat to anybody's league.  
And there's no question that Michigan State should be a No. 1 seed no matter
what happens here, and there's no question that nobody should be shocked if
it's nine. Okay. Maybe we get happy with eight. But there ought to be a major
revolt if it's seven, because it wouldn't make any sense.  
It's a great league, and it's been an honor to coach in it this first year.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Verdell or Kyle.  
  
Q. Verdell, what do you think you've learned? What have you taken out of
this season and all the stuff that you guys have gone through?  
VERDELL JONES III: This season is definitely a learning experience. But I
think the most we got out of this season is if you work hard and listen to
what the coaches say you can improve by leaps and bounds. That's definitely
what we did this year.  
  
Q. Kyle, you've had one of the strangest careers in Indiana history. And
right in the aftermath of it ending, what are your feelings right now?  
KYLE TABER: I'm sad to see it end. I mean, it was so much fun playing here at
Indiana, and I was just glad to be a part of it for five years.  
  
Q. Verdell, you look like a leader on the court right now, especially in the
last three, four games. Do you feel like you've sort of taken on that role as
the leader on the court directing everything, being able to score the most
points, just being able to direct your team?  
VERDELL JONES III: I mean, any point guard on any team is a leader. He's a
direct connection from the coach on the floor. I think I've developed a lot
more over the season as it progressed to be a better leader.  
I think players look up to me, but I also look up to different guys like Taber
and Williams, too. They're great leaders. It's a team thing.  
  
Q. Kyle, Coach talked about what they asked you to do from the beginning of
the season until now. What's your reaction to that?  
KYLE TABER: I appreciate them pushing me from the beginning. I mean, trying to
make me a better player every day. I mean, that's all you can ask for out of
your coaches, someone who cares about you and do everything they can to make
you a better person and player.  
  
Q. Starting your career as a walk-on, what advice do you have to the other
guys, those walk-ons that are sitting on the bench right now?  
KYLE TABER: Just to keep battling. You never know what's going to happen.
Things might play out your way. They might not. You never know. But if you
keep fighting every day, usually good things happen for you.  
  
Q. When you guys made it back to the locker room, what was -- I'm sure
there's something that the coach said or the guys may have said, what was the
sense? Was it sense of relief? Was it extreme disappointment that this is all
said and done this year? What was it?  
KYLE TABER: I mean, there's a lot of disappointment. This team got along
really well together. And we had a lot of fun. We came in and competed every
day. Especially for me I'm sad to see it end.  
VERDELL JONES III: Definitely disappointment. I can say we're all competitors.
And losing like this, it's very disappointing and it hurt a lot.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach Crean.  
  
Q. Coach, it's obviously been a tough year for you guys. What do you think
you learned most from this season going forward on to next year?  
COACH CREAN: I think it's hard to put -- we haven't coached this season with
perspective. I don't think they played it with perspective. I think we played
it every day to try to get better, to improve them, to give them an
opportunity to have a game plan to win in games.  
So I don't look at it like that. But I have great respect. I think what I've
learned the most is when people -- there really is no substitute for
improvement. I mean, it doesn't matter what your talent level is.  
There's so many things you can get better at if you're willing to do that. If
you have the desire to improve, really nothing can stop you. Maybe you'll get
to a certain level, because maybe your talent can't overcome this or that.
Maybe your height can't overcome this or that, but there's no limit on how
hard you can work to improve.  
When you have a passion for that, which I think so many of these guys do, I
respect them a lot for that. I mean, an awful lot. I respect them. I respect
how our administration -- our president is here today. I respect working for
Rick Greenspan at the beginning of the year; it's now Fred Glass. I respect
the way everyone has treated us and it's beyond belief what the fan support
has been like.  
That would have to be right near the equation for me what the year has been
when it comes to the way we've been supported.  
  
Q. Coach, do you think this experience or this season has made you a better
coach, or what have you learned from it?  
COACH CREAN: It's too early. Again, I'm not into perspective. So I haven't had
a chance to think about that. I take a lot of notes during the season on
things that we can do better, things we want to do better at a different time.
I think it all comes down to the willingness of the players to buy in to what
you're trying to get accomplished.  
And I've been fortunate everywhere I've been. As an assistant I got to see
that from the coaches I worked for. I certainly saw that in nine years at
Marquette, and I'm seeing that now at Indiana.  
But I couldn't have -- we fully plan to win the game and be leaving here to go
playing for Purdue. I haven't got a lot of reflection time right now.  
  
Q. Coach, you're optimistic about the future, but do you think that this
team will end up holding a special place in your heart because of all the
things you guys have been through together?  
COACH CREAN: No question. Every team does. But I don't think there's any
question. This team over time, the memories begin with how people supported
it.  
I mean, when there wasn't winning streaks to bring them to the gym, there
wasn't 30-point scores. I mean, there wasn't high wire dunks. We didn't run an
alley-oop play all year. We had many dunks but we didn't run an alley-oop play
all year. But yet everybody supported it. And to me that's where the memories
will be.  
We had a lot of great speakers. Tony Dungy, probably a month ago now, when he
came in and talked to guys he was up for his book signing in Bloomington, and
he said you will always be remembered for building the foundation if you
continue to do it the right way day in, day out. And I think that makes a lot
of sense. I know they've talked about that at times. And I think it makes a
lot of sense.  
  
Q. When you came into this season, you came into a situation, as you said,
out of control. Was it --  
COACH CREAN: Came into the program, into the program.  
  
Q. Did you feel the way that you handled it, when you first walked in, made
a connection with the fans that that led to maybe the support you got? You
seem to be pretty much just flat-out honest with them. You didn't just go with
the corporate rally. Seemed like you were pretty genuine with people telling
them we're going to struggle this year. Did they respond that way, or is it
bigger --  
COACH CREAN: I think they did. I don't think there's any question. Believe me,
we didn't make any moves or people didn't leave, I don't think, with thinking
about what was best for the fans at that time. It was what do we have to have
in this program.  
And what don't we want in the program, in the sense of the way things are.
Now, that was hard. But at the same time we're going out -- I'm going out to a
lot of different places to speak and appearances and things like that, and
you're going through it, and it was probably -- this sounds corny, but it was
probably very therapeutic to be going through that and be able to -- I didn't
give all the details. I couldn't. First off, most of the people wouldn't
believe them.  
And I mean, it was -- I'm so sick of talking about it. I know you're sick of
hearing about it. But bottom line is when we went out and spoke and went out
and met people, they made it easy. I mean, they made it easy.  
I look back, and the only thing I compare it to when I went to Marquette, I
met Al McGuire in the summer. In the summer of my first year. We ended up
spending some time together. He did like six or seven of our TV games that
year. Passed away a year and a half later. I never forget going home telling
my wife saying he's made it okay for us to ask for advice, to do things our
way.  
I mean, he flat out came out and said it. He said you don't need permission.
I've been here a long time, but I've been done coaching for a long time. We
didn't have the Big East when I was coaching. We didn't have the NBA where it
is now when I was coaching. He made it okay to go out there and be the coach.  
Well, our fans to me have made it okay for us to run this program, and I think
for the most part, hopefully they're seeing it the way they would run it. But
we made the decisions on what was best for the present and for the future of
it.  
So with that being said, I think the fans gave us incredible confidence early
on, as did our administration, as did Rick Greenspan and the people that we
were working with back there.  
And I don't want to reflect on that a whole lot anymore. But the fans did an
incredible job for us early on.  
  
Q. You've talked so much about building that foundation. What are the next
few days, weeks, what are the next steps for you?  
COACH CREAN: We haven't thought that far. Certainly recruiting, because that's
paramount. And spring break starts. So I think give it a little time. But
we're not going to take much time off.  
We've got to continue to build our athleticism, we've certainly got to build
our strength, and I've never liked the eight hours where only two of them are
oriented for basketball. I still think that's one of the most ridiculous rules
put out there. If you're on campus, you should be able to work with your
players as close to year-round as possible. Somebody's going to. It should be
the coaches they signed up to play for.  
But we'll maximize our eight hours. We'll maximize everything we can to help
them have a great spring and at the same time keep them on the great track
that they're on academically right now.  
  
Q. Coach, at the beginning of the game the two most experienced guys out
there, Cornley and Pringle, took over right from the start. How far are you
from having guys with that mind-set to make plays like that?  
COACH CREAN: That's a good question. I haven't really thought about that. You
just get your players better, and you continue to recruit good players, and as
long as it's done in the team concept, which certainly a team like Penn State
has done, it has a chance to happen.  
I mean, I haven't given that a lot of thought. I want the guys that come in
here to become a part of the foundation building of this program, not have
anybody look at it like, well, now these guys are here, now we can go. No, we
have to come together. We've had a lot of guys get better this year. And
hopefully we'll get ourselves to a point we have that consistent depth. I
think that's a big part of winning. And there's so much improvement to be
made. And I'm looking forward to doing it. I think our coaching staff is as
well.  
And in answer to that question, I don't think there was anybody that looked at
it as a relief. I really don't. I know I didn't. It's an extreme
disappointment, it really is.  
And if you guys saw where Kyle Taber was, on the last day we worked him out in
May before we had no more workout time, where he's ended up being as of now,
that might be the thing that would blow you away the most, because that guy
bought into what he needed to do to get better.  
And he took every bit of coaching and criticism and anything you want to call
it to not allow him to stay in a box, and he played his way right out of that
box and he made himself better.  
In answer to your question, again, we just gotta have a spring that's like
that with everybody.  
  
Q. Was there at any point in the last 48 hours when you thought Devan might
have a chance to play and when was the final decision made?  
COACH CREAN: It's all been based on how he responds to the treatment and he
hasn't practiced all week. And we talked about it yesterday.  
He just had a lot of trouble to try to do anything laterally. So, again, he
wasn't ruled out when they did all the tests and things again on Monday, he
wasn't ruled out. But it certainly at that point didn't look probable. And I
didn't -- I was as honest as I could be on that.  
We just didn't know. But I didn't feel yesterday when he didn't practice that
he was going to have a chance to play today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2009

  

### [Jamelle Cornley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19464)

### [Ed DeChellis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17001)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Penn State  66  
Indiana - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Just a reminder, we'll take opening comments from Coach
DeChellis and then we'll just take questions from just the players and then
finish with Coach.  
COACH DECHELLIS: I thought these two guys played great tonight. I thought
Jamelle came out with a lot of energy, a lot of emotion and really set the
tone early. We wanted to try to be aggressive early with our press and try to
speed up the game.  
We wanted to try to be in attack mode offensively and defensively, and I
thought these two seniors did a great job tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Did you think that the loss to Iowa refocused you guys?  
JAMELLE CORNLEY: I really do think that the loss to Iowa really refocused us
because we were anxious to get back to the court. We know we left one out
there.  
As much effort as we exerted out there, we really wanted to rest up and come
to the Big Ten Tournament and put on a great showing. Our objective in this
tournament is to win the tournament, and I think we packed enough clothes to
make sure that we stayed in until Sunday.  
  
Q. Jamelle, was there a moment in the game where you guys sort of felt
comfortable with the lead that you had?  
JAMELLE CORNLEY: I don't think it's ever really safe to say that we were
comfortable. We just wanted to continue to put pressure and continue to be
aggressive.  
Teams like Indiana are pretty scary because you can get them down early but
they'll continue to fight back. That's a credit to Coach Tom Crean. We wanted
to be aggressive but towards the end of the game we understood the clock was
our biggest opponent. So by making sure we took care of the ball, being strong
with the ball, we wanted to attack but at the same time make sure we made the
proper plays to be successful. And hopefully next time we can knock down some
free throws to give us a bigger cushion.  
  
Q. Given the loss to Iowa, have you spent any time either this week or today
watching other scores, how it may affect your tournament status either in this
tournament or other ones?  
JAMELLE CORNLEY: To be completely honest with you, I haven't watched anything
regarding the NCAA tournament. This is my biggest focus right here. I've never
gotten past -- me personally, I've never gotten past the second round.  
So making sure that we take care of business and staying until Sunday has been
my prime objective from a leadership standpoint, from a senior standpoint. So
I'm not worried about the NCAA tournament. I know that as long as we get to
Sunday and we win on Sunday, then I really won't have anything to worry about.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, you like to talk about sort of throwing the first punch. Did you
feel like you did that tonight?  
COACH DECHELLIS: Well, I don't know. We just tried to be aggressive. We talked
about it for a couple days of trying to come out of the gate and play with
energy and enthusiasm, and we were going to press to do that.  
And I thought we got off to a pretty good start. So we're very, very happy
about that.  
  
Q. Of your three games against Indiana this season, this one was probably
the easiest win of the three, what was the difference?  
COACH DECHELLIS: Your easy and my easy are two different easies. I don't know.
They didn't have one of their players. That's a big difference, too, because
the kid can spread things out and he can get 20, 25 and I was really concerned
about that after watching the Texas Tech kid last night score 29 in a row or
whatever he had.  
You come in these tournaments, you're always worried about one guy getting
hot. And to be honest with you, I thought that was the guy, 33 for them was
the guy that could get hot and really do some damage.  
But credit Indiana. They continue to play hard. They continue to execute down
to the end. And there was no quitting in that team, and that's a credit to him
and the staff and the players.  
  
Q. I think you were able to get Jamelle out with about eight minutes to
play, and Talor with about six minutes. Could you talk about the importance of
sort of resting those guys?  
COACH DECHELLIS: Talor banged, he's had a foot that's been banged up about a
week, 10 days now. We tried in practice to give him as many reps off as we
possibly could. The guys talked about it's going to be a tough game tomorrow
night and we gotta have energy. I wish I could have got some more guys in
there a little earlier as well if we weren't fooling around with the ball and
throwing it away. We could have got some other guys in there as well.  
We rested those guys, and I thought our bench did a pretty good job tonight.
Jeff did well. I thought Andrew Ott did well and Danny made his shots. So I
thought our bench did a pretty nice job tonight that let us do that.  
  
Q. Ed, I was curious what your approach has been with the team regarding the
NCAA tournament. Have you talked to them about it at all or not?  
COACH DECHELLIS: No, we have not. My approach with our team in the last month,
and really all year my whole approach has been that we're trying to go into
each practice every day, try to become a better basketball team. If we play
better defense, if we rebound better. If we take care of the ball, if we get
good shots. Then I think the wins and losses will take care of themselves, and
obviously the other thing will take care of itself.  
Never said to them this is a must game. Never said to them we've got to have
this one. You know, as a staff you know what you have to do. But I never
wanted to put that pressure on them. All I wanted to do was us try to get
better in practice the last couple days leading into this game.  
  
Q. D.J. Jackson had 10-and-5 today. What's it mean to get a performance like
that out of him?  
COACH DECHELLIS: He was a little early. Had a shot on the free throw line he
didn't take. I was upset with him and said if you don't shoot it you're going
to come out. You have to shoot. You're a good player.  
I thought he had some rebounds to get himself going too. That was a focus at
halftime. We said the first five minutes we've got to get on the glass and you
guys have got to rebound it like crazy. And I thought they did, and D.J. got
himself going by rebounding the basketball.  
  
Q. Were you concerned at all about Jamelle coming into the game, his injury
status?  
COACH DECHELLIS: He's had a couple of good days of practice. He was not close
to 100 percent at Iowa, couldn't get his left arm over his head to rebound. I
don't think he had one rebound in the whole game.  
But tonight I think he's got his confidence back in that shoulder now that he
can go up with two hands and rebound the thing and help us in rebounding the
ball.  
But he had two good days of practice as well. So we were hoping that he could
come in and rebound, rebound. I've been after him the last two or three days
about rebounding the basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2009

  

### [Bill Carmody](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16994)

### [Kevin Coble](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16996)

### [Michael Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18147)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Minnesota  66  
Northwestern - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Carmody, Michael Thompson, and Kevin
Coble from Northwestern. If you could make a couple of opening comments and
then we'll take questions from the Northwestern players and then we'll finish
up with Coach Carmody.  
COACH CARMODY: We gave ourselves a chance to win after a tough start and took
the lead. I just thought they defended well at the end.  
We had opportunities, I think we were up 2, missed a couple foul shots. If I'm
right about that, it could have been 4. And then they scored on a few
possessions and we had some drives. We were trying to go to the basket to get
to the foul line, and Sampson, it seemed like he blocked like three in a row
on us, big plays just sort of took over.  
So you credit their defense, and whatever that time frame was, you know when
it was, I think we were up 49-47. They missed or they turned it over, came
down. Missed our foul shots and then after that it seemed like everything went
their way, and we couldn't score.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Kevin, what did you see from them defensively, specifically in those last
few minutes? Did they change anything up on you?  
KEVIN COBLE: No, it just seemed like they were doing some of the same stuff
and we were handling it better earlier in that half. Then a couple times we
drove down there and we got all the way to the basket and we just couldn't
finish. We were getting good looks, but like Coach said, Sampson was down
there and altering shots, blocked the shots that he wasn't altering.  
So it was frustrating for us. We felt we were getting to the basket and we
were doing the right things, and it just didn't work out for us.  
  
Q. Kevin, did this game feel like some of those other games where you guys
were right there and it was there for the taking and couldn't quite get it?  
KEVIN COBLE: Yeah, this one was especially reminiscent of Ohio State just a
couple of days ago. Came out with a big jump and then took us out of our
offense and defense and really out of our entire game.  
We settled down, though, and did a good job of coming back. And this game felt
even more out of control than the Ohio State one did. And we were still able
to do a good job of fighting in there and hanging in.  
In the first half, things were frantic but we were only down 6 at half time
and came back to take the lead, just seemed like we needed to eliminate that
beginning of the game, because I think if you cut those five, 10 minutes of
clock time that we were struggling, we win that game by 10 points since we
made that big run. I think it was like 18-4, 19-4 run, that can be the
difference in a game?  
  
Q. Kevin, did Minnesota do anything specifically to slow you down in the
second half a little bit?  
KEVIN COBLE: I think we just settled down into our stuff. And first half with
me it just felt like things weren't going, and they were guarding everybody
really hard. And I just felt I could get to the basket on my guy or find
opportunities to score and they got me the ball and it was really good effort
for us to hang around like that.  
Then in the second half, I think we calmed down a little bit and found our
rhythm, and it seemed like it was more of that than anything they did. We
started playing a lot better together.  
  
Q. Michael, can you talk about your second half, you picked up that fourth
foul but it seemed like despite that you started picking up the game a little
bit?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: I remember going back into that game right before I subbed
and Coach Carmody told me he'd take me out if I didn't play aggressive, if I
was playing soft. So I found a couple of openings offensively, so I took those
and I was just trying to be out there and not pick up my fifth foul so
hopefully we could get back into the game. We took the lead. We just couldn't
finish out today.  
  
Q. Either of the players, what would an NIT berth mean to this team
concerning the progress you made this year?  
KEVIN COBLE: I think it would be good for us in terms that we haven't been
traditional post-season team, and we certainly feel like we're capable of
that. You can see glimpses of that whether it's the NCAA tournament, NIT, and
I think we just have done a good job this year of everybody buying into what
the coaches are telling us.  
And we're seeing the results on the court and it's not so much of a behind-
the-scenes success. We see it in practice, this and that, but we've never
carried it over to the court, and this year we certainly did that.  
We feel we're in a good position. We've let some games get away from us that
could have us in a really good spot and it's just a matter of making sure that
the season doesn't end any time soon. So just gotta keep doing what we've been
doing.  
  
Q. Michael, do you feel confident about the NIT thing, or are you nervous
about it? What's the feeling?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: I feel as though we're a team that deserves to be in there,
but obviously it's not our decision. We did our part winning the games that we
won. We let a couple games slip away. But we're waiting until Sunday to find
out. We feel as though we have a good chance to make, though.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll finish up with Coach Carmody.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit more about Juice, him getting in foul trouble?
It seemed like you tried to sort of sub in and out offensive/defense as much
as possible, but talk about his performance despite all the fouls.  
COACH CARMODY: Yeah, I thought he played better once he went back in there,
after I put him out, because he was -- his fouls, I mean, I'm going to go
through this, but most of his fouls were just like little cheap things, a hand
on there, no real hard fouls. And he was going through that through the year
and he sort of eliminated that in the last few weeks, but that hurt us
tonight.  
Although, I will say when he was out we came back a little bit. I mean, the
guys that went in there did a pretty nice job. But he's got to be on the
court. I don't know, how many minutes did he play? Probably didn't play 10
minutes or something like that, and that guy's got to be out there for us game
in/game out all the time.  
  
Q. How about his shot that gave you the 49-47 lead, kind of off-balance
runner in the lane, I guess, what did you see on that?  
COACH CARMODY: What was that off of? Yeah, he went back to the guy who was
over playing him at the top, I think Kevin or Jeremy. I can't remember,
bouncing pass to him.  
It's actually part of our offense there, you know, exactly what you do, but
not that circus shot. But he stayed with it and it was nice. Like I said, he
came in and hit his shot off the out of bounds play, he came in and banged one
off our bench. He's got to be more aggressive offensively, especially when
Craig is struggling, he's got to be another guy out there.  
He can't be getting six, seven shots in games. He's got to be getting 11, 12
all the time, because he's a very good shooter.  
  
Q. Would the NIT be a good reward for this team? Do you look forward to that
and do you have a sense of -- it seems like you guys have been real close
there, at least once before, and didn't get it. Do you have a sense whether
it's going to happen this time?  
COACH CARMODY: I think we had some real good wins, and both guys mentioned
that we let some games slip away. But we had some really good wins and not
that many bad losses. I don't think any bad losses. People have cited Iowa at
Iowa and Stanford at Stanford. But Iowa was beating a lot of good teams at
their place.  
So I don't think we really have any bad losses against bad teams. And we have
some real nice wins against some good teams. So I feel pretty good.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the opening minutes of the game? You guys came
out a little slowly. Did they throw anything at you that you didn't expect, or
what do you think the problem was?  
COACH CARMODY: You know, we expected them to press and we spent a few days on
that. And we really didn't turn the ball over in the full court. We had some
carelessness. And it wasn't really the young guys. It was Mike and Craig and
then Jeff Ryan went in there and threw a couple.  
We averaged 11 turnovers a game and we had 11 in the first half. But they were
the bad turnovers. It wasn't like a walk and they take the ball out of bounds
and you set up your defense. Iverson stole one up at the top, maybe two at the
top, they converted off of them. And those are real -- they just wipe you out.
It's different kinds of violations and turnovers and these hurt us badly.  
  
Q. What was the defensive approach today? It seemed like you went back and
forth from the 2-3 to 1-3-1. What did you --  
COACH CARMODY: We've been doing that pretty much most of the year and try to
keep teams off balance a little bit. And I thought Nash actually played real
well tonight at the top. But for a few games I've been on him a little bit
that he's sort of just out there and I think he went back to being a pain in
the neck up there and harassing guys and getting a couple steals and causing
some problems up there, because he hadn't been doing that for a few weeks.  
So we worked pretty hard on it the last couple days. But the different
defenses, it was just sort of pretty much what we've been doing.  
  
Q. Why do you think Moore couldn't get going tonight?  
COACH CARMODY: I don't know. I'm not sure, to tell you the truth. It's always
that thing with the shooter. Do you let the game come to you or are you
aggressive? And I don't know. You know, they play him hard but he's been
played hard all year. I thought he got some pretty decent looks, you know,
ones that he makes often.  
And I really don't know, to tell you the truth. But if we do get an
invitation, you know, he'll be in the gym tomorrow shooting and I'm sure he'll
break out of it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan  73  
Iowa - 45

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening comment from Coach Beilein and then do
questions for the players.  
COACH BEILEIN: I've sensed that the last month we've been trying to find a
rhythm and get to a rhythm where people really felt comfortable with each
other and timing and things like that.  
And even though it resulted in a couple of losses, I felt that we've been
playing pretty well. But I didn't expect us to play this well. First game we
got three freshmen out there and we just played a tremendous game. Manny got
his one thousandth point. We went to him a lot early. And he delivered and
then he became a passer and found others, but it was a team effort all the
way.  
  
Q. DeShawn, your body language during pregame introductions should have told
us that you were determined to play this game and play it hard and get this
team into the NCAA tournament and the next round. What was your mind-set
coming in?  
DESHAWN SIMS: It was definitely just the last four or five games, I've been in
the mind-set where my teammates, my coaches, even my family, has been keeping
me confident and telling me things that I need to do just for the team to be
successful, and I'm just trying to execute that and play to the best of my
ability. And whatever it took as far as me amping myself up, I've done it.  
  
Q. Coming in, was your guys' main motivation that a win today would secure
an at-large bid for the NCAA tournament?  
MANNY HARRIS: That was definitely a goal. We didn't want to put too much
stress on it and stress it too much to where we felt like we had pressure on
us. But it was definitely a goal. We thought about it.  
  
Q. Manny, you guys -- you were trying to get the ball to DeShawn a bit
there. When you see a guy that's on fire like that, is that your mind-set to
feed them the ball down low in the post?  
MANNY HARRIS: Definitely. He's been playing great the whole year. He can score
almost he feel like when you give it to him he's going to score. You sometimes
don't even go rebound, which we gotta do. But that's how our team build off
him scoring and him getting into it, that's how our team -- we build off that.  
  
Q. DeShawn, what was Iowa trying to do against you and how were you able to
exploit it to the level you did?  
DESHAWN SIMS: They got two physical bigs and they definitely tried to get into
my body and be very strong with me.  
I have a great feel for when someone's pressuring me as far as putting their
body on me, how to spin off and find open seams. And I was able to do it today
because of the big guys.  
  
Q. Manny, can you sense when DeShawn's ready to have a game like that? You
spend a lot of time around him but can you sense by his body language that
he's ready to go?  
MANNY HARRIS: Yeah, you can tell from the start, even from the hotel room or
something, you know when you're ready to go. He talks about it, he says
something about it. His whole body language is different.  
  
Q. DeShawn, could you just talk a little bit about Illinois and what you
think they're going to try and do to stop you, just sort of set that up,
thoughts there?  
DESHAWN SIMS: I'm not sure. We split two -- we split one with Illinois and
they're a great team. They pressure the ball well. I think our coaches do a
great job of not letting us think about that, but just giving us a game plan
for we can go out and execute it. So really I haven't thought about it. And I
probably won't be thinking about it.  
COACH BEILEIN: Until tonight. (Laughter).  
  
Q. DeShawn, in the second half when you had that foul and you yelled out
"no" at center court really loud, was that at all out of character for I guess
what was going through your mind at that point?  
DESHAWN SIMS: Just a mental block. And I forgot that refs were calling the
game and I could get a tech or something like that. I just spazzed out for a
second, but everybody knows what to do to get me back into the game. And Coach
calmed me down and I forgot about it after that.  
He took me out of the game. He didn't want me to get a tech, because sometimes
I'm a little crazy. (Laughter).  
  
Q. I guess the shot after a win like this, what do you feel is possible for
the rest of this tournament? You've got a potential for playing three more
games here?  
DESHAWN SIMS: I think if we were sitting and we had upper seed and seeing a
team compete like we competed against Iowa, it would bother me and I would
want to have played a game first. It's hard to play in tournaments when a team
has already played and they already lose.  
And we've been conditioning all year, we didn't have any games where we showed
we were fatigue. So it definitely means we're going to carry a lot more
momentum into the next game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll finish up with Coach Beilein here.  
  
Q. DeShawn is going to get a lot of attention for this game, obviously. But
could you talk about Manny's game overall and what he contributed to this?  
COACH BEILEIN: Especially when we were up ahead, a good lead, but then down
the stretch there -- his ability to shoot a 3 is -- the stats don't really
always tell you how effective a 3-point shooter he can be. We're just trying
to get him to understand when he's open, when he can shoot it.  
And he really made a big difference, obviously, when they were collapsing more
in their round to DeShawn. But when he trusts what we're doing there, he says
his 18 points right there, they were just textbook of how you want to execute
your offense in order to get a player like him open.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you want DeShawn to play loose, but are there times you
have to kind of reel him back in when you sense him kind of getting crazy like
he likes to say?  
COACH BEILEIN: He's just got a great personality. He's great to be around. And
I want our guys to have fun out there. But he can quickly -- you know, when
you yell "no" at an official, a poor official might even call it a T right
there at that time.  
So you have to be very careful that he knows now that the good official is
going to look at him and say, no, we don't put that here. So you just gotta be
careful of that a little bit. Because we're still talking about college-aged
kids, talking about young kids. And I think that's where he's been the most
consistent -- the best thing about it is his consistency with his attitude
over the last month of not just being up or down, just staying consistent.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the job that C.J. did on Kelly early and the energy he
played with?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think there were two really big defensive stands out there. I
thought Manny Harris did a great job on Gatens as well and then C.J. on Kelly.
Kelly had 11 assists in a game recently. Maybe it was our game he had 11
assists and two today and five turnovers. C.J. has done a great job
defensively for this team, and David as well.  
But Manny's job on Gatens was pretty good. Gatens can play. He's not just a
shooter, he can take it to the basket. Did a wonderful job on him.  
  
Q. Eight players scored for you guys. Can you talk about the importance of
having more than two primary scorers in a tournament setting?  
COACH BEILEIN: Over these next couple days, if we're fortunate enough to stay
here, if we can beat Illinois, it's important that we have a well-rounded
group. I think when you talk about Laval's two 3s and Zack's, it's hard to say
they're key moments of the game, but knowing teams, knowing how we've had a
couple times where we've come back from big deficits, you're up 15 or you're
up 16 and you get hit by a 3 and another 3, it takes a lot of life out of the
other team. And we had those type of shots tonight that those guys had. So I
think we still need more and we try to give our guys as much rest.  
But at this time you can't play like this tomorrow. You gotta play to win that
game first before you worry about giving people rest.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys had 22 assists. Would you say that's the stat you may be
most pleased with knowing that it wasn't just DeShawn created shots?  
COACH BEILEIN: 22 assists on 29 baskets is a great percentage. It gets the
defense gap, defense like Iowa, it's not a team that you're going to score a
lot just off the dribble drive. You're not going to get openings to go to the
basket. They're going to close it in, so you have to drive and kick, drive and
kick, find people.  
And if you don't have a good passing team, you can't do that.  
  
Q. Remember when you first met DeShawn, two Aprils ago, until now, what
differences have you noticed in his personality and his playing style and how
has that helped you?  
COACH BEILEIN: He was one of the first people I called when I ended up getting
the job. I talked with him over the phone. I had a delightful 10-minute
conversation with him, and what I was most impressed of here was this new
coach, and here he was, like I said, listen, we gotta address this issue. Are
you in with this thing as you get a new coach?  
And there was never any doubt in his mind or my mind, showed no wavering at
all. Coach, I came to Michigan to help turn the program around. And it was
great chemistry from the beginning.  
Now, we've had our ups and downs, but now that I'm seeing his consistency and
natural things, just like you -- when you're a freshman and you're a junior,
your growth is tremendous both mentally and physically. You just change. And
he just continues to change in a very positive direction.  
  
Q. With 4:26 in game well in hand rather than pull all five kids off the
court at the same time you brought Gibson in for DeShawn. Was part of that to
show respect and letting him get the applause of the crowd?  
COACH BEILEIN: No. I just wanted to get him out of there before he got hurt.
And the same thing with Manny a few minutes later. I wanted to sub -- I don't
do a lot of the five at a time unless the game's -- I just wanted to get him
out as quickly as I could.  
I forget what happened but I also wanted -- actually wanted to get Zack Gibson
five minutes because in these tournaments get in foul trouble and we'd need
him a lot more. It would have been a good thought if I had that in mind, but
I'm not smart enough to do so.  
  
Q. Your team shot very well from 3 but you're also very successful working
the ball down low. How does that make you feel moving forward from here?  
COACH BEILEIN: Well, it's good, and Iowa is a very good defense. Illinois has
an even better defense. They really guard you. They really guard you.  
So we've strived for balance on the team all year long. And throughout my
coaching career. Sometimes you just can't do it. And this year we've been able
to have a good balance as the season went on. I think it's been a key to our
success right now, in February and March.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

OFF)

  

## November 27, 2009

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach will make an opening statement and then he'll take
questions.  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: It's a big-time game. Shots were so hard to come by.
Open shots. Both teams are very, very good defensively. And you know, you get
by one guy and you can't -- it's hard to get to the bucket. You know? And
we've not experienced a team like that this year.  
But we rebounded very well. We played outstanding defense. And I thought
Thomas and Zoubek were the difference-makers for us. Because I mean they both
had 11 rebounds. And Zoubek I thought had the biggest play in the first half
where he got the offensive rebound and kicked it out to Singler for a 3
because points were tough to come by. And in the second half he got one, and I
don't know how he got it out to Scheyer in the corner. He got it through about
four guys and Scheyer hit that 3. And so on two of his offensive rebounds we
got 6 points.  
We didn't give up a 3 today. So when you get two possessions in this game,
where you get 6 points, that's a lot. We missed 53 shots and we had 56
rebounds. You know, that's a very unusual game.  
But it's a game where both teams played with a lot of heart and we feel very
privileged to have won this game and the NIT Championship with the Carlesimo
name on it. The Carlesimo family is like family to me and my family. The
trophy is named after one of the great, great men in college basketball
history. So it was nice to see Lucy. We call her "Lucia" from the Barcelona
Olympics. That's a good thing.  
Any questions.  
  
Q. Doug Gottlieb called your team alarmingly unathletic. Did you think today
answered that question pretty emphatically?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: He should be an expert on alarmingly non-athletic. So
I'll have to take a look at that a little bit closer because it comes from an
expert who actually knows what it feels like to be alarmingly non-athletic.  
Actually, we're pretty athletic; we're just not as athletic as Connecticut.
Singler is a really good athlete. Lance, Miles. Jon is not leaping tall
buildings with a single bound but he's a real good athlete. But I wouldn't
call us like this athletic team, but we're not amazingly non-athletic. And I
would rather not get into a discussion with Doug because I have respect of his
stature and he should have his arguments with people of similar stature. That
would be a good thing.  
  
Q. Stopping the transition was obviously a key. How did you do that in the
first half?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, we didn't for a while. Walker, he's a jet. We had
Wojo scout for this team and I said, "You said he was quick, you didn't say
that he was that quick." And we adjusted our defense. What we normally do with
a point guard like that is try to corral him at half court with the second
big, you know, just to hold him back. And we couldn't get back in time to do
that. So after the first TV time-out, instead of 21 which is our half-court
defense, we went top of the key 11 and just said, "Get back. Don't worry about
corral." Everybody is responsible for corralling him, and I thought the rest
of the game we did a fairly good job of it.  
  
Q. 25 offensive rebounds on a team like UCONN with their size and
athleticism; what do you chalk that up to?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, we're big too. Non-athletic but very big. And so
-- Zoubek and Thomas were huge. We do run sets where our perimeter guys take
shots. They took a lot of shots and they should take lot of shots. Our big
guys are accustomed to know when those guys take their shots. So we've been
working a lot on trying to position ourselves in places where we might get
that reshot.  
  
Q. Did you notice anything as far as UCONN leaking out early?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: They did.  
  
Q. Was that something you could take advantage of?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I didn't think we could take advantage of -- I just
didn't want -- they beat us a couple of times early. They blew by us for about
six minutes. And then we knew -- we knew we shouldn't fast break, try to fast
break with them the whole game unless we got a turnover.  
  
Q. Meaning that if they're going --  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: No, no, we have an extra guy on the boards to crash. We
discussed that. But I don't think that was -- the guys who got the most
offensive rebounds were the guys that had on their bigs. They almost made some
big plays. We couldn't put the ball back in the basket. A lot of it has to do
with their shot-blocking ability.  
  
Q. In the second half, especially in the second half, even when their guards
would get into the lane, can you talk about your help defense?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: That's again the big guys were coming over. And at
least if they didn't take charges, they were trying to take charges, they got
a few blocks. But they distracted the shooter. Kind of like how they did to
us.  
I thought shooters in the lane today was not a good place to shoot the ball.
You know, there was a lot of distractions defensively being made by both teams
for those shooters.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Jon Scheyer's game? 19-5-5.  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Jon is a terrific player. He's a terrific basketball
player. He has a great feel for the game. And because he's almost an automatic
free-throw shooter, he's dangerous especially at the end of the game. He
values the ball. And although he's not making a lot of great passes, he's not
making hardly any turnovers. And he makes simple passes and I think -- now he
has four turnovers for the year. He's the most important player we have, Jon
is. Just because he has to have the ball so much.  
  
Q. Kyle, 2-of-12, 6 points, he shoots 29 percent. I told you those numbers
coming into the game.  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I would have been very worried or mad at you. I would
have told you to go talk to Doug Gottlieb. You don't have to do that by the
way. I won't punish you like that.  
Kyle made two bad fouls. I think the nature of the game he slapped down twice
and he just can't do that. From then on, we're massaging the game and then he
gets three. And so you talk -- I hate to talk with words like "flow" \-- he
never got in the rhythm of the game. He never got in the rhythm of the game.
But still, defensively he was on Robinson. I mean, they kind of negated one
another. Robinson -- their perimeter is very, very athletic. Robinson is a
big-time athlete.  
  
Q. When you win a game like this, do you leave here feeling pretty good?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Oh, yeah, we feel great. We played against two
different types of teams and two teams that I think are going to be in
contention in their conference coverages.  
We're still missing one of our kids. Mason Plumlee who I think will be a big
addition to our team.  
The other kid I want to mention is Andre Dawkins. Both of these games he
didn't play like a freshman. He was very, very good, very good in both games.
And that gives us a little bit more depth on the perimeter.  
THE MODERATOR: Last question?  
  
Q. What kind of role do you foresee for him as this develops and he gets
more experience?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: He got good time today. He's playing behind our three
best players. So the fact he's going to be the first guy off the bench. He can
play off those guys because he's as good a shooter as we have. And then if we
ever did want to go small and put Kyle at the four, he could be -- we did have
that lineup in for a little bit.  
But then the fouls -- actually, we got a big bucket when we had Kyle at the
four. And then we got in foul trouble and we had to get away from it. Andre
has been really good for us.  
Thank you.

## November 27, 2009

  

### [Trent Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18247)

### [Tasmin Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16443)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
Q. Tasmin your impressions of the second half? What happened to you guys in
the second half there?  
TASMIN MITCHELL: Like Coach said, we played a heck of a 20 minutes first 20
minutes. And I think we got it -- we got lackadaisical and got nonchalant with
the ball and Arizona State wanted it bad better than us the last 10 minutes of
the game.  
  
Q. I think you guys went 10 minutes without scoring a field goal. Was it not
getting the bounce on the rim or the choice of shots? What was it?  
TASMIN MITCHELL: You know, we stayed within our offense. I felt like we got
good shots towards the goal. Just didn't fall. It happens to the best of us.
But you know we got to convert baskets during that particular time. And we
didn't. But I felt like they were real good shots. The ball just didn't go in
the hole.  
  
Q. Where do you guys go from here? Obviously you go home. I think you have
five games at home. Can you kind of get on the winning streak back at home?  
TASMIN MITCHELL: Yeah, without a doubt. Our leading point guard Bo Spencer had
just told us, you know, we have to stop with the lackadaisical stuff that we
do at practice. We have to come out with a sense of urgency that Coach always
emphasizes throughout the year. Sense of urgency and practice, practice,
practice, and let's get better. Put these two games behind us.  
It hurts to lose two games. We're going to bounce back real hard with our
confidence and our integrity and our heart.  
  
Q. How much did it hurt not having Bo out there for you guys?  
TASMIN MITCHELL: You know, I think it took a little scoring drought from the
point guard perspective. But I'm not going to say Chris Bass didn't do a bad
job either, you know, but Bo Spencer, you can't replace him. He's a great
shooter. He finds the goal. He finds players. But you know, we got to hurry up
and get him back because we need him as a team.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Questions for the coach?  
  
Q. Coach, was not having Bo out there a big factor for you guys?  
COACH TRENT JOHNSON: First of all, I mean, we're not going to make excuses for
injuries or lack of experience from the point of basketball. Let's get that
clear right now. There's no sympathy for us in this situation. Obviously
against a team like this, if you don't have Bo Spencer who is our leading
scorer coming into the game who runs our team, not to mention Alex Farrer who
is guy who can shoot the ball, that's a big loss. But it wasn't like I don't
constantly talk to our team to players about being ready to step up. Chris was
a different player. We had some breakdowns defensively. Glasser got going
late. That's where the game was in terms of these guys working hard and
understanding what we need to do to be good. For the most part, we did that.
We just ran out of gas and maybe we ran out of bodies. But again, we're not
going to make excuses for our lack of experience so to speak or our injuries
for playing bad basketball. And we played pretty good basketball for 30
minutes and the last ten minutes we didn't play very well.  
  
Q. Who was the other person you said was injured besides Bo?  
COACH TRENT JOHNSON: Alex Farrer. He's done for the year. Dislocated a
kneecap. Him and Bo would have been our starting guards coming into this year.
The reason I'm responding to that is because I'm trying to get away from
somebody asking that question. I've been answering that question for the last
three weeks. Alex is not coming back.  
  
Q. What was it with your defense today?  
COACH TRENT JOHNSON: You know, I just thought the kids were embarrassed in
terms of the way they competed versus a very, very good UCONN team. We didn't
do a very good job transition D. We didn't do a very good job of rebounding
the ball. Like most good kids, most teams that are young, the next time out
there is going to be better. I thought for the most part we were better.  
  
Q. How do you think such an offensive struggle in the second half compared
to the first half?  
COACH TRENT JOHNSON: Well, you know, from where I'm sitting I don't think it
was a struggle. You got guys that can shoot. You got guys that can't shoot.
You have guys that have roles and guys that don't have roles. Tasmin is a guy
we expect to score partly 8-out-of-13. Storm was 8-out-of-10. He's a walk-on.
It is what it is. You know? You lose your leading scorer. It's not going to be
a struggle. From what I saw, I thought we had some open shots that didn't go
down. But again, you have to take into consideration who was shooting.  
The kids aren't trying to miss them. I'm not going to sit up and say we
struggled because I have a guy who is not a good perimeter shooter who is
missing an open jump shot. They are sagging three guys on one might of the
best players. When you say, "struggle," I think I want to tip the hat to
Arizona State, they exploited some of our weakness and sagged off to guys that
hadn't been shooting the ball very well and our role players and go from
there.  
  
Q. Did Bo try to give it a shot during warmup and it didn't go?  
COACH TRENT JOHNSON: He tried to give it a shot. We have a long season. Last
year he strained the same ankle out on the road versus Mississippi State. As
opposed to three-day or four-day deal, it ended up being a two-week deal. He
wasn't very happy with the coach's decision. I'm more concerned about the team
and his future. I'm not going to play -- I'm not going to put a kid in
jeopardy by injuries by playing him.  
Thanks, fellows.

## November 27, 2009

  

### [Derek Glasser](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19592)

### [Herb Sendek](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19594)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach is going to start with an opening statement and we'll
take questions.  
HERB SENDEK: Questions, anybody?  
  
Q. Your impressions on that second half? They seemed to go stone cold for
ten minutes. Was that your defense doing all that?  
HERB SENDEK: I think any time there's a run like that in basketball, it's
usually a combination of factors. Most certainly our defense got better. Then
it was the first half.  
We had a very good defensive effort in the second half. And at the same time,
you know, for that kind of run to occur, they missed some shots that in the
first half they were knocking down. But from our perspective, you know,
Arizona State's side of the ball, we were much better in the second half, and
our defense allowed us to get back in the game and eventually win.  
  
Q. What did you guys gain as a team coming here, playing Duke, playing LSU
and how does it help you going forward?  
HERB SENDEK: We try to participate in an event like this every year. It's
always extra special coming to New York and playing in the Garden. It's a
wonderful experience for our team. And I think anytime you play against
outstanding competition like we did this week, there's always a lot there to
learn. And so we'll continue to watch the tape and take all these experiences
and try to build on them.  
  
Q. At 5-1, what are you happy with now and what needs to improve as you go
forward?  
HERB SENDEK: It's early in the season for everybody. Traditionally this was
the first weekend of basketball. Teams were playing their first game either
today or tomorrow for years. And now we've already played six games. But it's
still early. And we have to get better across the board on a broad-based front
right now.  
  
Q. Talk about Eric and just what he was able to do. This is what you kind of
envisioned for him, wasn't it?  
HERB SENDEK: Yes. I think it says a lot about him as a person. Because let's
face it, he didn't have the best of games on Wednesday night. You can only
imagine there was probably some extra burden for him to play in that game.
That wouldn't be easy for anybody. It wasn't the best of nights. And then the
first half kind of was a continuation. And so in midstream to kind of check
that and all of a sudden play a terrific 20 minutes helped put us on -- he put
us on his back in the post and rebounded and finished with 17 and 8, three
assists. Had some nice passes to cutters. I think when you're able to turn it
around midstream like that on a stage like this, it says a lot about you as a
person as much as it does about you as a player.  
  
Q. What happened Abbott?  
HERB SENDEK: I don't know the extent or the details, other than he got a cut I
think near or on his eye socket. He was having a hard time seeing and he was
in quite a bit of pain. But I think he's going to be okay. But I don't know
categorically yet the extent or the details.  
  
Q. Did they take him to a hospital?  
HERB SENDEK: I don't think so. We have a team physician here who is attending
to him along with our athletics trainer. But needless to say it was really
scary because, you know, we had just welcomed him back. He just now working
his way back into the lineup. And when he went down, you know, sprawling in
pain, I had no idea what happened. I didn't know if it was his knee, his
ankle, what happened. When I got out there, it still wasn't clear right away.
He wasn't saying much. He was kind of more just in anguish.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else?  
HERB SENDEK: You made Derek walk all the way down here and didn't even ask him
a question?  
  
Q. We're doing you first. We knew how portable you were.  
HERB SENDEK: Was I pretty good today?  
  
Q. You were good.  
HERB SENDEK: Did you get some good stuff?  
  
Q. I wrote some things down.  
HERB SENDEK: You can probably win the Pulitzer with some of those quotes.  
  
Q. You were better than Belichick today.  
HERB SENDEK: I was?  
  
Q. No doubt.  
HERB SENDEK: That's always been my goal.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Derek.  
  
Q. Derek, talk about the PAC-10 a little bit and the fact that certainly
kind of taking its hit so far. I know you are worried more about yourself than
anything. Look at what's happening around the PAC-10 right now and say to
yourself, you know what, maybe we have a shot here to do a little better than
we even thought before the season started.  
DEREK GLASSER: Well, before the season started, our goal was always to win the
PAC-10. A lot of people doubted us because we lost James (Harden) and Jeff
(Pendergraph). But I still think we have a lot of talent on the team and we're
a very competitive team. Our thing is we play defense. As long as we play
defense like we did in the second half of this game and the first half of the
Duke game, we're going to be able to compete with anybody.  
  
Q. What was Coach's reaction at halftime when they shot 60 percent on you
guys?  
DEREK GLASSER: I'm not sure if I can say some of those things. But, you know,
none of the coaches were happy. They came in the locker room and let us have
it. They gave us a little spark and we answered in the second half with really
keeping them off the offensive glass and trying to double down on Tasmin and
Storm, because they were really hurting us on the glass and in the post in the
first half.  
  
Q. Can you just assess the team's mind-set coming in flying across the
country, playing in the most famous arena and all that jazz, what you set out
to do, what you did do and maybe what you left on the table?  
DEREK GLASSER: Our conference tournament is in the Staples Center. I think
playing in that arena and normally we play games in U.S. Airways where the
Suns play. So I guess it is the most famous arena. But, you know, I think
Staples Center is a little nicer than Madison. That's for sure.  
  
Q. It's newer.  
DEREK GLASSER: Yeah.  
We came here to beat Duke. I don't know if we had them, but we kind of felt we
let that game get out of our hands. They're a very good team and they made the
shots down the stretch. But not winning the first game, we had to get out of
here winning one. We couldn't lose two games. So right when the game was over,
we turned the page to LSU and we knew we had to beat LSU and go 1-1 back home.  
I think overall it was a good experience for us, especially to play a team
like Duke. Just to see where we're at as a team. And I think it was overall a
good experience.  
  
Q. Talk about Eric and his importance to this offense, especially with Jeff
gone, he seemed like the most likely to give you post offense and the post
presence. It looks like he's done that in the first six games.  
DEREK GLASSER: I'm going to hit on what Coach said. It's hard to rebound after
a game like he had against Duke. I don't know what he had, eight turnovers or
whatever it was. Especially playing against his old team, he came back and had
a great, great second half. And he was one of the reasons why we were able to
turn it around, his defensive presence and rebounding and able to put the ball
in the hole in the other end.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Thanks, Derek.

## November 27, 2009

  

### [Jim Calhoun](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13682)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach will make an opening statement and then he'll take
questions.  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: Well, Duke physically handled us, which I thought
alleviated that problem a little bit. The physical presence, obviously the
rebounding was, in my opinion, the major problem with the game. The last time
we gave up 25 offensive rebounds against Georgetown with Alonzo and Mutombo
who are bigger than Duke was. But Duke played with a great deal of heart and
toughness.  
Last time that we at Connecticut lost a game, hold a team to eight field goals
in the half and 28 percent shooting, I can't remember. But I think that we
couldn't have hit the court if we were up in the second deck with the ball
ourself, certainly from the foul line and certainly from the floor we were an
awful passing team tonight. I think we ran at times a little offensive team
but didn't get open. Just quite frankly, they outwilled us and did all the
things you need to do to win a game. And yet there were chances even with six
or seven minutes to go for to us come back in the game and we were unable to
take advantage of it.  
During the season, discouraging a little bit, certainly, but disheartening
more than anything else. I think we're better than what we played. I think we
have to respond to when we get knocked around inside a little bit. We have to
do a better job. I can't complain about Alex Oriakhi, the freshman. We had
some guys that 87 missed shots. The guy gets three or four rebounds playing 35
minutes, the best jumper from the floor, you might have a problem. I have a
game player on the court who didn't get three or four rebounds from the guard
spot. We had 87 missed shots, discounting foul shots and we missed a lot of
those too. We didn't have much of an excuse in this one.  
  
Q. Coach, being down double digits in the second half and then coming back
and having a chance to get back into it again, how frustrating was it having
Jerome miss a couple of lay-ups?  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: Jerome was one of the guys I thought at times we shut out
because we didn't get him the ball when he was open. Secondly I thought he
just was exhausted by the end of the game. Jerome Dyson was not a problem
tonight certainly. But it was frustrating missing the foul shots. He worked
very hard at it. When you're down, making that type of effort to come back, I
think we fouled three or four of their guys out of the game, bottom line is we
didn't finish plays. There was a lot of lay-ups. We weren't pulling a lot of
second shots by them. That frustrated me a great deal more. They went nine out
of ten trips without scoring and we couldn't take advantage of that. That
wasn't just foul shots. That was almost everything.  
Mainly quite frankly, guys that were open never got the ball. And that's
usually been something that we do pretty well.  
  
Q. 25 offensive rebounds you talked about, hasn't happened in a while. From
watching from where you were, what do you think was the cause of it?  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: They banged us inside and you got a choice. You bang back
and get the ball or get banged. That was the cause of it. They're a physical
team. They go after the loose ball. A few times when they were up 18 they went
down to the floor to get the ball and we didn't. They weren't rotating a lot
of people through nor were we. We tried to but we couldn't find anybody on the
bench to really help us except Gavin.  
So it's been a problem four out of our five games, for whatever reason. I
don't know with a the reason is. You can't leave an 18-year-old freshman to be
the only guy rebounding. That's a major problem. They rebounded well as a
team. Mike is obviously a great, great coach. I think we all know that. He got
his team to rebound much better than what Connecticut did. That's normally
been something that we've held our -- going into most games knowing we're
going to play our defense, which we did. We're going to hold -- they have a
guy who is going be a big pro. Singler certainly, he's a smaller version of a
Larry Bird-type player. And Sticks (Stanley Robinson) didn't play well but he
did a great job defensively on him.  
I'm so appalled by the lack of rebounding by us as a team. You can't beat
anybody if they get 25 offensive rebounds. If you hold somebody to 28 percent,
you can't lose, but if you give them 25 offensive rebounds and they can't make
a shot or a foul shot, you can get some problems.  
  
Q. How much of a concern overall is your perimeter shooting?  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: That's the least of us. We got to the rim all night. That
was -- how much -- they are one of the best perimeter-shooting teams in the
country. If you talked to Mike, ask Mike how he liked shooting 28 percent. We
shot 37. He has more problems than we do. You know what I'm saying? Shooting
50 percent as a team for five games. So I don't think perimeter shooting was
our problem. I think our problem was when we caught the ball in the post and
shooting fade-away jumpshots. Until we made the comeback, we weren't going to
the hoop because we had a quick disadvantage going to the rim. That was much
more my concern. It wasn't a problem the other night; 5-for-10 the other
night. I didn't want them taking 3s. I thought we had quickness to go by them.  
  
Q. There was a minute you pulled Robinson, talked to him, talked to him and
sent him back out.  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: I told him to get his ass going and play some basketball.
He didn't. He did defend. He played a very good player flat up and wouldn't
give him any open shots. But Robinson, once again, for him to play 35 minutes
and get four rebounds in a game of 87 misses, just can't happen. He's a
terrific rebounder.  
And Alex desperately needed somebody else. Charles couldn't do it. The game
was either too sophisticated for him. He hasn't yet been into that kind of
thing. Gavin should have rebounded more. I can't fault Gavin coming off the
bench; he only played 24 minutes. I can fault Sticks because I have to rely on
him. He's supposed to be one of the premiere players in the league, certainly
in the country. He didn't play well on the offensive end.  
  
Q. The deliberate offense Duke was running where they would run the shot
clock down at the end, you are playing defense so long and to give up that
offensive rebound, do you think that also got into something for your guys
--  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: I questioned it at times. They had us on the ropes. Then
what I was reminded of was the fact that they had three guys with three fouls
and another guy with four fouls. And they were trying to play a little clock
and plus they had a nice cushion, 18, whatever it was; 20 -- whatever it was
-- 19, 16, they are running like that, and execute some offense. If we had
gotten those rebounds, hold them to 9 out of 10 stops, if five of those times
we score, we scored one of those, by the way. One time we scored. All we had
to score was five of those nine times and all of a sudden you have yourself a
5 or 6 or 7-point ballgame. We were unable to do that.  
The other thing was long rebounds. We outquicked them, it seems. But they
outquicked us to the ball when they needed to get it to the offensive end
which is something that can't happen to us.  
THE MODERATOR: Last question? Okay.

OFF](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=DICK%27S+SPORTING+GOODS+NIT+SEASON+TIP-
OFF)

  

## November 25, 2009

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach is going to start with an opening statement and then will
take questions.  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I felt we won. It was a hard-fought game. We knew it
would be that way. You know, you play four games at home, and you're running
and shooting and things are going easy. And then all of a sudden, you know,
you're going to be in a possession-by-possession game against a defense that
you haven't played against before. And against an offense that's going to
control tempo. And with our team, we're not a team that can force them by
pressing and stuff like that. So pretty much, I mean, I thought after the
first five minutes our kids really played well defensively. You know, the last
35 minutes of the game we gave up I think 38 points. We do that, we're going
to be put in a position to win. And they played good defense too.  
So, you know, shots, open shots were hard to come by. One of our objectives to
start out the game was to limit their threes. So they made two. So I thought
defensively after the first five minutes was the key to the ballgame. And
Singler, who was not having good shooting night, after that time-out in the
second half, he came out and for him to hit those two buckets right away, you
see, I think that's better -- it's nicer if you go 9-for-12. But when you can
hit two in a row when you're 1-for-11 or whatever he was, when the score is
tied, that's very, very good.  
So, I'm pleased with obviously the outcome but also our efforts against a very
good team. I mean, they're going to cause a lot of people trouble because they
can control the ball. They have four guards out there. Any questions?  
  
Q. As far as defending against Arizona State, it seems like they were
generating a lot of points in their previous games on the perimeter where you
were trying to focus things?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yes. So put a lot of pressure on the ball screen. Like
they were exclusively ball screen, just until they ran a couple of specials
late after a time-out. But most of the time it was ball screen. And what
they're trying to do is have you leave the perimeter guy. So it puts a lot of
pressure on your two guys defending the ball screen.  
And early on, we tried three different ways of defending their ball screen.
And finally we just showed -- contact showed on it, and the guy got over. At
first we trapped it once; that didn't work. We hard-stepped in and that got us
strung out. And the contact show turned out to be the way to do it.  
  
Q. Just your thoughts on playing Connecticut and did you get a chance to
watch them?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I did not watch them at all. Wojo (Steve Wojciechowski)
and Chris (Collins) did. For us it's a -- these two games are big-time games
for us. So to play Connecticut -- I do know their personnel. I have not
watched them at all yet. And I know how good their guards are. And Robinson is
probably as good an athlete as we'll play against. And they've got a lot of
big guys who can really rebound. So if Jim -- I'm sure he hasn't changed that
much. He has won a lot of games doing it the way he's doing it. I would be
shocked if we didn't see a three-quarter press, a 2-2-1, and letting their
guards with some ball screens and then hammering the boards. I think
rebounding will be a big thing on Friday afternoon.  
  
Q. How big were the shots that Dawkins made, especially the timing of
them?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, they were -- we were in kind of like a funk as
far as scoring. It was big for a freshman to come in and do that. We were not
playing well from our big guy's position in the first half until about the
last four minutes when Zoubek gave us a lift. And then in the second half, I
thought all of our bigs did very, very well, especially on that ball screen.  
  
Q. What was it like to match up with Coach Sendek again? Did you have
flashbacks?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: You know, I know we're coaching against Coach Calhoun.
I never look at the other bench or whatever. They are very well coached. And
so really the five games we've played, we've played against outstanding
coaches who have different systems. And we overpowered the first four. And
this one you weren't going to overpower Arizona State. Herb just really --
he's very good. And he has his system, which is unlike most other people. So
when you play against him, even though we had a lot of preparation, it's a lot
different playing against your blue team than playing against -- all the stuff
we tried against our blue team worked. At the start of the game it didn't work
against them.  
  
Q. As you said, that first game was fairly easy. What does this tell you
about this team?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah. I don't think so much survive; I thought we won.
Survive would be if this was like some huge underdog. I think Arizona State is
going to contend for their conference championship with the kids they have.
Glasser is just a veteran college guard, college point guard who doesn't turn
it over. And if you don't guard Kuksiks, he's capable of getting 20 to 30
points in a ballgame. I thought Nate's (McMillan) son, Jamelle, really played
well. We couldn't keep him in front of us. I know him obviously really well.
He played a hell of a game for them.  
Have a happy Thanksgiving. Thank you very much.

## November 25, 2009

  

### [Trent Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18247)

### [Storm Warren](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20252)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Storm Warren, please?  
STORM WARREN: This is Storm Warren.  
  
Q. Were they tougher than you thought, Storm, or were they more aggressive
on the boards because they hadn't rebounded so well going into the game?  
STORM WARREN: We just got to come out ready to play from the jump. We just we
have to come out ready.  
  
Q. Was size a big issue, Storm? It seemed like they started a pretty big
front line, 6'9 ", 6'9". Was that difficult?   
STORM WARREN: It was a challenge. We have to step up and accept the challenge
and be ready to play, regardless what they have or who they have.  
  
Q. When you were effective, what did you do well to score inside against the
big guys?  
STORM WARREN: I started off kind of anxious, just coming up and playing. But
had to calm myself down and just slow down and just play my game.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the player?  
  
Q. You have Thanksgiving tomorrow. Will you try to just kind of regroup and
enjoy Thanksgiving before you come back out Friday?  
STORM WARREN: Well, basically, the game is over. So only thing we can do is
just take this as an experience and just learn from it and build off of it,
come back ready to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? The coach is going to make an opening statement
and then take questions.  
COACH TRENT JOHNSON: Obviously that was a pretty good basketball team and they
were very well prepared and ready to go. For me personally I was very
disturbed by the transition baskets that we gave up early. It has nothing to
do with speed on the court; mental and physical toughness and their effort.
You're going into this year, we knew that there were some concerns in that
regard. And it's good it got exposed early on in the year. So we can move
forward from there.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. What was tough about their press? What was difficult about your player's
response to it?  
COACH TRENT JOHNSON: Again, I'm not taking anything away from them. The press
we made some ill-advised bad passes and it basically came from two of our
veterans, Tasmin and Bo. The key to the game was transition made us miss and
our inability to put a body on them and be physical and respond and step up to
their physicality.  
And for me, I look at Eddie Ludwig, the redhead kid freshman from Country Day,
he takes two charges. He just got here and he got in the post and they have
two good situations where the guy had an angle to the basket and he did a good
job. You look at the veterans who have been around, a guy like Garrett Green,
three-year guy, so on and so forth. It was just from my standpoint, we got
exposed early and often, and those things are all correctable.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Calhoun has put the pressure on Kemba Walker a lot. A lot is
expected from him. Kind of a slow start. What was your overall impression of
him?  
COACH TRENT JOHNSON: My overall impression of him and Dyson were like what I
saw in videotape and what I said earlier in the press conference that Coach
probably wasn't happy with the way his team has played the previous three
games. You knew they were going to be ready.  
Walker is very good with the basketball. He's quick. It's an extension of his
hand. He does a good job of running the team. The thing again, he's playing
for a guy that holds him accountable every step of the way. And getting beat
like this is -- I don't like winning when you don't play well. Getting beat
like this against a team like that really, really exposes you and some of the
things that I talked to this group about, our group, they were exposed.  
So now we move forward and see how good a team we're going to be. That's a
good thing about being in New York. You get exposed and everybody is watching.
So I like it. I'm not necessarily talking about my players; I'm talking about
me also.  
  
Q. Did you expect to rebound a little better?  
COACH TRENT JOHNSON: I did.  
  
Q. They had some trouble in that department.  
COACH TRENT JOHNSON: I did. I expected to have a little better transition
defense too. I did. And that has to do with effort, constant effort.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach?  
COACH TRENT JOHNSON: Thank you.

### [Derek Glasser](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19592)

### [Herb Sendek](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19594)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Derek first.  
  
Q. It seems like a lot of the offense your team generated in the first four
wins was along the perimeter. Was it frustrating that you guys couldn't get
anything going outside?  
DEREK GLASSER: Our game plan was to attack off the dribble and use ball
screens to get them to rotate and kick back outside.  
I thought we had a great game plan for the game. I think we executed early and
we played with a lot of energy. We just couldn't make that shot that we needed
down the stretch.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, what was it like playing against Coach Krzyzewski; any flashbacks?
You used to play him two or three times a year.  
COACH HERB SENDEK: I certainly didn't forget any of those games. Our focus was
on tonight's game.  
  
Q. Herb, that stretch they had when they took control 19-3, how much of that
had to do -- did they do anything differently defensively or was it something
that you guys just couldn't change?  
COACH HERB SENDEK: I thought their defensive effort especially in the second
half was terrific. Nothing came easy for us. Everything was challenged. And I
think the difference in the game was their defensive effort in the second
half.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach?  
COACH HERB SENDEK: Thank you, everybody.

## November 25, 2009

  

### [Jim Calhoun](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13682)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach will make an opening statement and then take questions.  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: We've been waiting since the exhibition season for us to
have a breakout a little bit. And quite frankly it was a different kind of
breakout. The breakout for us was playing with energy, going back to
rebounding which is something we really did well. We have blocked shots all
season so we kind of expected to do that against most teams. But it was a
breakout game for us.  
It was the first time that I saw Connecticut play this year in a regular
season game. We were aggressive. We did a terrific job defensively. Most of
the game we obviously let up a little bit at the end but quite frankly, I
really, really praise the kids for their aggression. All I asked them tonight,
when you come in here, we have to be on the plus side, the rebounding and most
importantly on the work-ethic meter. If we're not leading in that work-ethic
meter -- loose balls, hustling, blocked shots, double teeming, stripping the
ball, running the fast break -- then we have a problem. We will not be playing
the championship game on Friday. Now we have the opportunity to play in the
championship game and obviously we are thrilled. We are thrilled because quite
frankly it's been a funny kind of two weeks for us where it hasn't been
playing the same kind of basketball I know we're capable of.  
I couldn't be happier. I thought Jerome showed incredible patience; two, three
points the first half and coming back with 16, 17 points in the second half. I
thought fortunately for Gavin he has done well coming off the bench. You can
guess the rest. He responded exceptionally well coming off the bench. He gave
us a terrific lift.  
Alex is growing into his role, now seems to want to score. Those are great.
Once again we're facing an entirely different kind of team, spread team, both
teams high 2-3 with Herb's team, with Mike's team a perimeter-dominating team.
Tonight they answered them with flying colors.  
  
Q. Did you want Stanley to attack right off the way he did?  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: Exactly. He's just too good a basketball player to sit out
on the outside and be a jump shooter. He's got to be more than that. He was
all over the place defensively. He blocked some shots. He got some rebounds.
He got some points. He's just a pretty exciting player, and I think in a more
open court games, because I think that Trent made a decision in the second
half that if we keep this running game up, it's not going to work out real
well. Just because we were running exceptionally well and rebounding really
well, and when they went to the half court set, we didn't get a chance to
really get out except for a few occasions. I think you saw more from Stanley
because obviously he's an incredible open field player.  
You have to get Charles Okwandu. They haven't been able to get quality minutes
the first semester last year. He gave us a good game. Physical presence at 7
feet, 260 pounds. A physical presence. Nice rebounds for us and set some very
good screens and was a physical presence we'll need over the next four or five
games and for the season.  
Hasheem Thabeet, another 6'11" guy who changed our team a little bit.  
I like the team tonight. I like that they played with so much energy.  
Two years on the bench, comes off, and he's our most poised player sometimes.
Plays great defense and only 6'5", over 200 pounds, he's big, nice arm Span.
He was kind of an unsung hero tonight.  
  
Q. How far has Stanley Robinson come on and off the court from this time
from last year.  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: Just because it's hard for me to due to the privacy as I
should have about my players, it's a medical reason of Stanley off the court.
Don't -- please, I would hope you don't have any misconceptions with Stanley.
It was a medical situation he needed medication for. It had nothing with him
being a wild kid or not going to class. I've read those things and it's
completely so far from the truth. He's a great kid who had incredible focus
problems. Just problems. Bottom line is he's -- his happiness, he's always
been a happy kid in certain ways. Sometimes the guys who cover us will tell
you he's a sad kid. He's a great kid. I think each one would attest to that.
He finds joy playing again. That's really nice to see. I think your point is
right on. He plays with some joy, as Kemba does sometimes. That's nice to see.  
  
Q. Coach, did you see more out of Kemba; where was he at?  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: I thought he was okay. Terrific in the second half. I
thought he really ignited our fast break well. He still has to be a better
half court player. You play for point guards for me, I'm probably like Larry
Brown. I can wear them out in half a year because I expect every pass to be
perfect.  
He's still pretty damn good. We love him. He has to work on making plays in
the half court set. He has to identify open people. We're not going to trade
him. He was really good on defense. He started putting pressure on that kid
who was penetrating so much in the first half, did a great job of adjusting to
him.  
  
Q. Just to clarify, are you saying you asked Stanley to take that time off
because of --  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: I told him. There was no asking.  
  
Q. Because of the medical situation?  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: Correct. The situation where he was not being able to do a
lot of things focus-wise, otherwise, and everything was going to pot to be
quite honest with you. Everything was turning up in his life. Anything you
name wasn't happening in front of him. We told him to take the time off. Told
him he had to work. If he came back he would have to pay for his semester with
a Pell Grant and he did. He played last year in the tournament getting 28
points and was paying for his own education.  
It was something we felt he had to do for Stanley to truly understanding to
follow A, the medical advice he was getting, and B, that he eventually can do
something with his basketball game, and I think both things are starting to
happen for him have been happening for him.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach?  
  
Q. What was difference in the rebounding? Just effort?  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: I think it was effort. I think Gavin, as much as anything
else -- I'll blame myself for this -- when I went through some box-out drills
early there was nothing as you know who was the toughest guy? But we went back
to a lot more technique and who was the toughest guy. So we tried to get you
to really go after it but then use some more technique.  
We aren't a particularly big team at times. I know you look at both Charles
and the freshman, Alex, and say, "they're big strong kids." They are. But when
they are out -- one is out of the game, we're not a particularly big team.
Gavin is a small 6'8". He's a thin 6'8". I don't care what his stats are. I
know what he is. Technique becomes more important. Hasheem Thabeet probably
never blocks anybody out in his life. At 7'3", 270, you don't need to block
people out. You get the ball because he's at the highest altitude. But bottom
line is I think we work very hard on technique every single day, two or three
drills a day and just pure unadulterated aggressiveness. We ran down a ton of
loose balls. I was really happy with the way we played. If we play like that
the rest of the season we're going to be just fine. Thank you very much.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.
