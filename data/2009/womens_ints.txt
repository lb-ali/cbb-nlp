_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We are joined by the bears from Baylor. Coach, your thoughts on
this afternoon's games.  
COACH MULKEY: I'm just ready for questions.  
  
Q. Jhas, Jessica, yesterday Jhas said you hit shots that seniors are
supposed to hit. Is that what she did today?  
JESSICA MORROW: I think y'all saw for yourselves she did, you know. Everybody
on our team came tonight with a winning mentality and everybody was just
thinking score. We hit some great shots tonight. I'm so proud of everybody.  
  
Q. Jhasmin, after what you went through last year with you being hurt, would
you talk about what it has been like for you to lead this team to a
championship considering what you guys lost with Danielle.  
JHASMIN PLAYER: It has been extremely easy because I haven't had to lead this
team by myself. We have two seniors and they do a great job of taking over
leadership. I do know that I had some sleepless nights when we lost here last
year, and I packed for three days and I wanted to be here three days.  
  
Q. Morghan, talk about what was going through your mind. You pretty much
were in the zone at some point in the second half, especially in the first
half you got things done and got the team going.  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: Well, the biggest thing I told myself is that I wanted to
send my seniors out on top. They told me prior to the game that they had never
won a Big 12 championship, so I just thought, well, we'll win this for them.  
As for myself, coming from USC I had never been in this situation, so I was
just hungry to win as well as my team.  
  
Q. Y'all's bench outscores A &M by, what was it, 24-2 and that was obviously
a really huge factor in this game. Talk about the play of some of the guys
that gave you a break every now and then.   
JHASMIN PLAYER: We know what our bench brings. Melissa Jones has been playing
well all season, Jessica as well as Morghan. Morghan has been playing well in
this tournament. M.J. will bring us rebounding and getting extra shots and
making free throws down the stretch.  
Like I told you guys yesterday, Melissa Jones does all the things nobody else
wants to do and all the things that don't show up on the stat sheet, and she
did that today.  
  
Q. Jhas, two-part question. How does it feel? And, secondly, can you please
explain that dancing at the end of the game.  
JHASMIN PLAYER: I can't even put in words how I feel. The last time -- we had
to think about it yesterday. The last time Jess and myself have been here is
freshman year with Sophia Young and Jordan Davis and Chameka Scott. That's the
last time we played in the championship. We also talked about how we never won
anything. Jessica, Morghan, we never won anything, high school, anything. It
feels good, but it is not over. We have six more games and we want to continue
to work hard and continue to well. Jessica and Melissa taught me those dances.  
  
Q. Jessica and Jhasmin, you guys played a lot of zone and that's unusual for
you guys. Can you tell me what kind of impact and how much of that seemed to
frustrate A &M? And did it give you a little bit of a break as far as not
having to play man?   
JESSICA MORROW: I think it did have a big impact because they were probably
expecting us to play a man-to-man the whole time. We were having trouble
defending their quick guards and keeping them from penetrating. So we had to
switch it up a little bit. I think that helped and it rattled them and made
them shoot outside shots which they are not that comfortable with.  
I think it was effective.  
  
Q. Morghan, can you even begin to describe how you feel right now after
everything that's happened to you?  
COACH MULKEY: Hang in there, girl.  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: Not at all. The main thing is I have my teammates. If I
didn't have anybody else, my dad couldn't get to games and my little brother
couldn't be here, I had my teammates. And they have -- I don't even know how
to say -- kept me up this entire way. Thanks to them and along with the great
support staff and my coaching staff all the way down to the managers. I think
everybody at Baylor, fans have just rallied around me and makes it hard to be
sad or anything of that nature.  
But, no, I can't -- I can't even explain the feeling.  
PETER IRWIN: Ladies, congratulations on a great season and good luck in the
NCAA.  
COACH MULKEY: I wish Rachel Allison was up here. Let me say this before you
leave. Jessica used the word "perseverence" yesterday. With Rachel Allison
struggling like she has all year and to play as well as she is playing now,
that's why you coach.  
Jessica Morrow starts the year shooting very poorly. Look where she is today.
Jhasmin Player is so the player I was not. Look where she is. Morghan Medlock
goes through the terrible tragedy in her family and look where she is today.
That's why you coach. That's why you hang with kids, and that's why you
persevere and that's a story that needs to be written. Thanks, guys.  
  
Q. Kim Mulkey and zone defense are two words I didn't figure you use in the
same sentence.  
COACH MULKEY: You didn't see that today. That was a man-to-man. What game were
you watching? (Smiling).  
  
Q. Can you just talk about that adjustment.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, we were about to be behind by double figures. I think they
had gone up ten. And I thought both teams are fatigued. You have played three
games in three days, and the style of play that both teams play, something has
got to give. We are not doing very good guarding them.  
And so you just make gut decisions. It was not something planned. It was not
something I discussed with any coach on that bench. It was something I called
as I watched the game.  
It worked. It worked.  
  
Q. Coach, just touch on what you just said about Morghan and what she went
through. It just seems amazing that she has come through it like this.  
COACH MULKEY: We have tried to help Morghan move on and not keep talking about
it, and I understand it is a story to be talked about. But I said this when it
happened to Morghan, Morghan is at the right place. She is at a school and a
university around people in a community that can help her, not that there
aren't other places that wouldn't.  
But we gave Morghan as much help as we could. We continue to give her as much
help as we can through NCAA rules. I'm sure the biggest hurt for her is she
doesn't have her mother to call. I'm a mother, and I feel for her.  
But the thing I told her is we can't dwell on it. We have to move on and each
day find something positive to talk about her, have your teammates talk about
her. Don't drag them into your grief. Have them lift your spirits into "We can
move on and we are going to be okay."  
That's about all I'm qualified to help her with. Counselors can help her on a
professional level and the kid is a player. The kid is a player and she came
to Baylor for a lot of reasons, and I firmly believe she's where she's meant
to be at this time in her life.  
  
Q. Kim, you just heard the players up here say they hadn't won anything, you
have. You have won. What were you feeling for this group knowing that they
really tasted winning a conference championship for the first time?  
COACH MULKEY: Let me say this about the seniors that hasn't been said. I was
reading a story on the Parises and the seniors at OU. Their seniors are like
120-something -- somebody help me. I don't know, 120 -- I don't know, it was a
great record. And I thought, let me check the record of our seniors.  
And I think I'm right in this. Before you write it, ask Julie Bennett. These
seniors are 103-27 in their four years at Baylor. They just missed out a
little bit on those championships. They finished second and second and third.
They've had a great four years.  
What better way to go out than to have a tourney championship if you couldn't
have a regular season championship and to have all three of them playing as
good as they are playing right now.  
  
Q. Following up on Vince's question, last time you did this, you got
together that led to a Final Four. Have you got another Final Four team?  
COACH MULKEY: Man, you never know what this business brings, Chris. You just
play and you work hard. I know what we've had -- now two tourney championships
in four years. We're proud of that. Whatever happens in the play-offs happens.
It is just like with the selection. I had one of my administrators say it best
about the selection committee. Jody Conrad a while back, they asked her about
what she thought the seed would be. And she said a camel is a horse designed
by a committee. I don't know what's going to happen. All I know is what more
can we do? If we're the No. 1 RPI conference in America -- and y'all have
written that. Everybody in this room has read it. Then why can't we have two
No. 1 seeds? I don't understand why you can't. I have said that from day one.  
I certainly will be disappointed if another conference has two No. 1 seeds.  
  
Q. I think you said after the game on television that your team isn't like
some teams that might lose their top player.  
COACH MULKEY: That's correct.  
  
Q. You have got scorers at all positions. Can you talk a little bit more
about that.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, losing Danielle Wilson, you lost your 6' 4" center who is
having a great year, leading scorer, leading rebounder.  
But if you have followed our team, Danielle Wilson, guys, was a sub in a lot
of games last year. She wasn't in the rotation every time we played. Danielle
Wilson developed into the player she is now this year.  
Always look at the team that we've had. There is not a dominant player like a
Courtney Paris. If you lose a Courtney Paris, you see what happens. It is very
difficult to adjust because she is that good.  
Danielle Wilson is good, a big loss for us, but our scoring, our rebounding,
it is distributed throughout the lineup. We had Morghan, McDonald's All-
American coming in off the bench. You have Melissa Jones, sixth player in the
league that started some games for us.  
I know if you don't follow my team, you think I'm being partial, but I think
you now see we're not going away. What we lost the most when Danielle went
down, we lost a kid that had the ability to alter shots, to block shots, and
we lost a post-player that I believe in this league runs the floor from foul
line to foul line better than any post in our league. That's what we lost.  
How did she become the leading scorer and rebounder? As she developed and you
watched your team grow, you go "This kid is ready for this" and so you run
things for Danielle. But you still have that balance on our team. That's why I
kept saying over and over, we're not going away.  
  
Q. Would you talk about Jhasmin, obviously this time last year she was
watching you guys stroll without her and tonight had to be probably one of her
best games of the season.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, Jhasmin went down in early February, and we were in first
place at that time in the Big 12. And I think we were 20-1. After that game we
were 21-1 because it was at the Kansas State game that she went down.  
Just like all athletes that had never been injured before, you're hurt, you're
angry, you're mad, you're sad, you cry, do all of those things. But then
reality slaps you in the face when the season is over that I can sit here and
feel sorry for myself or I can get myself ready to play my senior year.  
Jhasmin just has the work ethic to get it done. It wasn't by herself. We have
a tremendous staff and our trainer, Alex Olson and Shaun McPherson worked
tirelessly to get her back on the floor.  
When you deal with any kind of injury that requires surgery, the physical part
sometimes comes before the mental part. And Jhasmin has just done a tremendous
job to become the senior leader you want her to be and to play with a lot of
confidence.  
  
Q. You weren't like Jim Valvano, you didn't have to find somebody to hug.
Rachel came right over there. Can you talk about that? Is this emotional for
you to win this conference title this way and to beat a team like A &M?   
COACH MULKEY: Well, you always hug somebody and seniors -- Rachel and I just
happened to be the first ones to hug. And I made sure I hugged all those
seniors.  
The second part of your question, I don't know if I understand it.  
  
Q. Does it mean more because of the way A &M plays? It was a tough game.   
COACH MULKEY: It probably -- I keep it in perspective. I said before the game,
win or lose, the Big 12 tournament, we are still a pretty good team. It is
hard to beat a team three times in one season, particularly since we played
each other a week ago to close out the regular season.  
I don't want to overdo it. It is a championship, and I'm happy about it. Yet,
at the same time, if we had lost the game, I would come in here and still be
fighting for a No. 1 seed. That's just the competitor that I am.  
I don't know that it means any more now, next year, two years from now or
five. It is a championship.  
  
Q. Kim, you talked about it a little bit there, but you made your opinions
vocal about the Big 12 tournament. Has that changed any here? And then also
can you talk about M.J. and what she gave you the whole game.  
COACH MULKEY: Rick Barnes feels the same way I do, you know? I guess because
there is not an exact science to seeding, teams that know they're going to get
good seeds feel like sometimes when they go to conference tournaments, that if
they should be upset or lose out they can only hurt themselves.  
Teams that don't feel like they have good seeds need it to better themselves.
And I just -- again, I'm a competitor. If I feel like my team has a good seed,
sometimes going to conference tournaments, winning it, did it help our seed
today? Can anybody stand up and tell me if winning it helped our seed today?
That's what I was trying to say. Don't know. Don't know.  
Now, if we weren't in the tournament, we were the eighth team in this league,
I would have had been praising, yep, let's go to those tournaments, we need
them.  
I feel our program is at a level now where sometimes you got to protect your
kids. And I just feel like that's a way of protecting them.  
  
Q. And M.J.  
COACH MULKEY: Melissa Jones, good grief, I hugged her neck and I just told
her, what a joy to coach. She's low maintenance. She does whatever she's asked
to do. She is just "Okay, Coach, you want me to guard a four player, I'll
guard. You want me to rebound, I will rebound. You want me to block out and
dribble up the floor, you want me to play the three, I will do that." She is
just a young lady that takes to heart the game.  
As we say in the locker room, she is just a baller. Thanks, guys.  
PETER IRWIN: Best of luck in the NCAA.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Baylor  72  
Texas A&M - 63

  
PETER IRWIN: We are now joined by Texas A&M and the Aggies.  
Coach, you've had a great season. Tell us about today's game.  
COACH BLAIR: It was a great game for T.V. We had things going our way early,
when they were in man-to-man and they couldn't guard us man-to-man and in
transition and the game was getting fast.  
Kim did a good job of adjusting to the zone, also to rest her players that
were playing as many minutes as they've had to. They were spreading us wide on
the zone with the 2-3, taking things away. We were not coming off of the
screens.  
But at the end of the possession, we had great shots in the first half. When
you have great shots in the first half, you have got to trust your kids. But
when you're not on and you have got four out and only one under, you have got
to at least make a better percentage of the shots than we did.  
Second half, we attacked the zone pretty good but we couldn't get them. There
is not too many times we've gone into a ball game and said they're just going
to execute us to death and they did. Everything was on the pick-and-roll and
drive and pitch and kick. Give them a lot of credit. They made some plays.  
The key play of the ball game, I thought, when it was a three- or four-point
ball game and we started our rally, shot clock is going on, and we fouled over
there in the corner on a three-point attempt. I thought that was a momentum,
and then we came right back down and fouled another shooter and came back down
and fouled another shooter.  
But give them credit. We're supposed to contest shooters, not try to block
jump shooters. We learned our lesson. Give them credit. Kudos to Baylor. They
are a very, very deserving Big 12 champion that deserves the high seed that
this league can possibly give them.  
If it is a one, give it to them for heart. Give us the high seed, we'll take
whatever you give us, whether it is a two seed or a three seed because this
team is going to dance a long way in the NCAA tournament.  
Right now, let Baylor enjoy the nets. They've earned everything that they
deserve. They play together as a team but so does this team right here.  
Questions?  
PETER IRWIN: That was a little longer than a minute.  
COACH BLAIR: What else do I have to do today? I am not cutting down nets right
now. (Smiling).  
  
Q. After a tough game yesterday, one of nine bouncing back, moving forward,
what kind of confidence does this game give you the way you had individually
in the finals?  
TAKIA STARKS: It is a feat for us making it back to the championship game
second year in a row. We are going to use this as going back to film and use
it as a learning experience. Like we said, we still got NCAA. Whatever seed we
get, we are going to be happy with. We want to move forward from there.  
  
Q. Baylor is known for man-to-man defense, they played y'all man-to-man the
other two games. Were you surprised when they switched to a zone?  
DANIELLE GANT: No, not really. Coach knew it was coming. He had plays before
the game drawn up, a play that they were going to run against the zone. I
wasn't surprised at all.  
  
Q. Danielle, disappointing for you to lose this championship game in your
hometown and then can you comment on the possibility of a regional back here,
you guys could be back here?  
DANIELLE GANT: Yeah, it is a little disappointing losing here in my hometown
knowing that this may be my last game here. But I think my team and I, we put
a good effort in this whole tournament so I'm not too disappointed. I'm just
happy we got the opportunity to get to play and make it to the final two.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Jhasmin Player and what she was able to do with
penetration in the second half especially.  
TAKIA STARKS: Actually, I would say her game plan was I'm going to drive to
the basket. I'm either going to get fouled or I'm going to get the score. She
stuck to that.  
Sometimes we were able to keep her from the point. Most of the time we
weren't, and she got that foul called. That was a very smart move on her part.
I'm happy for Baylor. They played great. They deserve it today.  
  
Q. Takia, if you guys could talk to the selection committee, what would the
message be? Where should this team be seeded?  
TAKIA STARKS: That's probably a question for Coach Blair. He really worries
about the seeding. We just show up to play and we want to win.  
Like I said earlier, whatever seed we get, we are going to be happy with that.
We are going to embrace it and we are going to be ready to play.  
  
Q. Danielle, is it a little bit frustrating that Baylor, they just kind of
seemed to have your number. That's three times. They have all been close down
to the wire.  
DANIELLE GANT: It is actually knowing that we are capable of beating them, I
guess they wanted a little more down the stretch.  
But the question about -- I mean, it's been three times, like you said, so it
is heartbreaking losing to a team three times in a row. All we have to do is
go back, get better and hopefully the team next we will go out and beat them.  
  
Q. You pulled it 60 to 58, two points with about four minutes remaining. Was
that a situation of exuding so much energy to get back into that game and not
having a whole lot down the stretch?  
COACH BLAIR: I think the whole second half carried over. You look at the
percentage, how many teams are going to shoot 62 percent, 50 percent from the
three and lose in the second half? You are going to do it when you put them at
the line 31 times. We would bail them out late in a situation that they
constantly moved or waited for the pick-and-roll.  
That does a great job of taking your pressure defense away sometimes and you
cannot cause turnovers.  
Similar to what K-State used to do when they would play us, run with the ball
for 22 seconds and then penetrate and make a play. It worked again. Give them
credit.  
You didn't ask this question but here's a very telling sign. 24-2 their bench
outscored me. My bench has been our savior all year long. I couldn't pull the
right numbers at the time. What Medlock did in the first half was big time,
and she was making -- she did the same thing, if y'all want to pull up the
story at our first game at our place, 17 points, coming in with her variety of
spin moves.  
Then when we stopped the spin, she kept going. Look what the Energizer Bunny
did, Jones, she just finds a way. One time she came down, just knocked Carter
out of the way, picked up the ball and we stood around and said, "Wow. Look at
that" and she just puts it in after she knocked Carter down. But Carter has
got to be strong enough to not get knocked down.  
I want somebody that's got that Energizer mentality on my bench to come off
and do the same thing. We'll find that person.  
But, again, give those two kids off the bench a lot of credit.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about Medlock a little bit. I'm sure you know
everything she has been through in the last year. How much can this mean to a
player when you have had such a rough year personally and then win a
championship?  
COACH BLAIR: I think it is sometimes -- you know, a lot of times stories are
not written about our student-athletes on just a feel-good situation.  
Would we be talking about her today if she hadn't scored X amount of points?
We should be because of what she's done to come back and to play at this level
and particularly right after it happened. I think it was just a couple of
days. Give credit for Kim for being able to handle the situation and letting
the kid have her time.  
You got to find out what's going to make that kid come back and want to play.
Could I have dealt with it as a student-athlete? No way. She dealt with it
pretty good. But she's accepted her role and she has come in and playing
behind some pretty dog-gone good seniors in there.  
Sometimes your best players don't need to start. Your best players need to
come off the bench like we did with Danielle Gant her first two years. But
Medlock was a force that we couldn't stop.  
I had a freshman on her when she got hot in there, and my freshmen really
couldn't guard her and we had to put Micheaux back in there.  
But yesterday it worked by me playing the young kids. Today it didn't.  
  
Q. Coach, could you just talk about the effort of Takia today and then also
on the flip side Jhasmin Player for Baylor.  
COACH BLAIR: Well, Takia, there is nobody that felt worse than what she's done
in the first two ball games because her shot wasn't going. It wasn't going in
the first half. 2-8 and about six of those were opens.  
Second half she came back in and stepped in. She's been a second-half player
her whole year. That hasn't changed. And Starks is just a winner. She never
wants to come out. This is a kid that will do whatever it takes. I just love
the kid to death. She's got so much passion and heart.  
But you are talking about Medlock, how would you like to have your dad have
cancer for three years and have to live with that every day and going through
chemo and her mother just get shipped to Afghanistan last week, the day after
senior day. There are stories all over the page. It doesn't always have to be
about wins and losses and points and rebounds. This is what women's basketball
needs is sometimes to talk about the positive things that we're adding to this
sport. There are some special kids out there.  
I'm sorry, the second kid on Baylor, you wanted me to talk about?  
  
Q. Player.  
COACH BLAIR: I just call her a basketball player. I think that's the best term
for her. She knows what to do. I recruited the kid hard. Sat in her living
room, too. I got some on my team that Kim sat in their living room. We're
carbon copy of each other.  
I told my kids in there as we were leaving, one, to stay positive, to realize
the other team just outplayed us this time, more so than the other two games.
This time they just flat out out played us and out executed us.  
The other two times it could have gone either way, a call here, a call there,
a shot there, a free-throw there. But Player -- isn't it unbelievable that
Morrow and Player are not even on the second team all-conference? And DANIELLE
GANT not on the second team? And Kathleen Nash not even on the second team?
And Alison Lacey not even on the second team? That's how good this league is.
You got to produce every night because you can't live off of what you have
done in years past.  
But she's the glue to that team, period. Allison does her thing. The Energizer
Bunny comes in. Morrow can hit the threes. But I think the glue is Player.  
  
Q. You have played them three times. How were they different now without
Danielle Wilson in terms of what they are trying to do on offense and defense
as opposed to previously? How are they different now?  
COACH BLAIR: I think you can get better shots on them now on your offense
because Wilson controlled the paint. She along with, I'd say, Sade Morris of
Kansas might be the two improved players. Danielle Wilson before she got hurt
and Sade Morris because they play both ends of the court. Defensively,
offensively and she could block shots, change rhythms and the whole nine
yards.  
Now what you got to do is put it down. And as a coach, if you write every day
or you talk every day about who's not playing for you, you are not going for
give credit to the ones that are playing for you.  
Too many times as coaches, we tend to do that. Every story, there is a little
blip or something. Trust the kids. They give us 15 scholarships. And those
kids are playing their heart out out there. Danielle will be back next year
with you know who, and they will be fine.  
They're a different team because they did not have as much scoring power, so
they have to do things like drive the ball, pick it. Morrow has to really --
what Morrow has done really in the last five games is probably what Kim wanted
her to do all season. The stats that Allison and Morrow didn't have going into
it, now they are stepping up and becoming the senior leaders and the good
players. I'm talking too much about Baylor. Let's talk about my team, okay?  
I'm serious, okay? Is there anybody in this damn league -- ma'am, you don't
put damn in that over there. I see you. Take damn out. You are doing it.  
Also, did you ever play basketball? Clean up my quotes. I'm serious as can be.
I trust you like my English teacher. When I read my stuff, I know I'm not very
good with words like some of these other coaches. But clean them up. You put
down how you want but make them sound like I know what I'm doing and you know
what you're doing. That's a true statement.  
PETER IRWIN: That's may be almost impossible.  
COACH BLAIR: I want her to try.  
But let's talk about my team and my kids, if you will. Yes, sir?  
PETER IRWIN: This will be the final question.  
COACH BLAIR: I want to talk about my kids.  
Does anybody else come in here and talk about my kids? But I'm always asked to
talk about everybody else's kids, and I do it.  
PETER IRWIN: You do a good job, Gary.  
  
Q. I will lob a big softball up there for you then. Talk about your senior
leadership, what they have done for you through this tournament, how you think
that part of your team helps you in the NCAA tournament.  
COACH BLAIR: I think it helps me. Look at Micheaux what she does. Wasn't that
a shame she got fouled out on that wonderful call at the end? She just went
through and she says, "I'm going to get that rebound. I'm going to get that
rebound. "  
That's leadership. And by then we were finally playing with the energy that we
had to play with at the end. But that was just special. Gant and Starks, they
wear it on their sleeves. Those kids are leaders and they are quiet leaders,
okay? They are not the rah-rah types. We have to leave that to Colson and some
of the others.  
But those are kids that were not all-Americans and neither were Baylors. And
you got two teams that are in the top ten doing it with kids that aren't the
who's whose list. Basketball players win. Coaches coach them up.  
I think both of our programs are doing a pretty damn good job of that.  
Folks, I appreciate all the attention. Oklahoma City has done a great job,
again, of hosting this thing. I would love to have it back here, but I want it
back in Dallas, period, period. It needs to rotate back. It needs to be there,
and I hope the ADs and the other basketball coaches need to realize that if
we're going to grow our conference, it needs to be in Texas one out of three
years, okay?  
This is kind of a home-court advantage. You know what I mean? But in Texas, we
need it there. In the north -- it is going to recruit in Texas. Then they need
to come down and also bring their teams down as well. We need three different.
Kansas City, Oklahoma City, and Dallas somehow, some way.  
Thank you y'all.  
PETER IRWIN: Coach Blair, thank you. Good luck in the NCAA.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2009

  

### [Heather Ezell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16373)

### [Bill Fennelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13850)

### [Amanda Nisleit](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16912)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Baylor  63  
Iowa State - 57

  
PETER IRWIN: We are now joined by Iowa State, the Cyclones and Coach Bill
Fennelly.  
Coach, your comments about this afternoon's game.  
COACH FENNELLY: First of all, I want to congratulate Baylor. It is an
outstanding team. Certainly a team worthy of their ranking and certainly I
think they will be a great representative of the Big 12 in the NCAA
tournament.  
Also want to thank everyone from the Big 12 and Oklahoma City for everything
they did. It was a great event. It was fun to be part of. We got treated
great. It is fun to be a part of the best conference in the country. Certainly
appreciate the work everyone did to make this possible. So thank you.  
  
Q. Heather, how does the hand feel now? What did you have to do to convince
the coaches to let you play today?  
HEATHER EZELL: I went around the shoot-around this morning and was able to do
some things without any pain. Got the nod, and right now it is feeling fine.
It didn't give me any problems during the game.  
  
Q. Amanda, talk about the three-pointer that put you guys up four with five
minutes to go. It seemed to have all the momentum in the world and then Morrow
came down and hit a three right away on you. Did you feel a shift of momentum
maybe right there?  
AMANDA NISLEIT: I think consistently throughout the second half there was a
lot of momentum changes. So, yes, I think that was definitely -- that was a
good shot.  
  
Q. Amanda, talk about the second half. You were able to knock down some
threes to get a momentum going. Just talk about that.  
AMANDA NISLEIT: My teammates set some really good screens and put me in really
good positions. I think that was very helpful.  
  
Q. Heather, talk about being out on the floor today.  
HEATHER EZELL: It was just nice to get out there to do anything I could to
help my team. Just be in on the plays is always nice. It is always hard to sit
out. Just wanted to do some things for my team as much as I could.  
  
Q. Amanda, midway through the second half, Jocelyn came in and was a
presence on both ends of the court. What did she do to get you back in the
game?  
AMANDA NISLEIT: She had some big stops on defense and some big rebounds.
Whether it is the big rebound or the block or the held possession, she did
also well on the offensive end. It was a great -- it was great momentum for
us.  
  
Q. Heather, did you notice anything defensively that they sagged to after
shooting 50 percent from three-point range in the first half?  
HEATHER EZELL: You know, they just -- their defense -- you have to give them a
lot of credit. They did a great job. They knew what to do and they knew how to
guard and they definitely did everything they had to do on the defensive end
to stop us.  
  
Q. Bill, after Amanda hit that three to put you up four and Morrow came down
and hit that three right away, the look on your face was kind of like -- you
really sensed that was a huge possession in the game.  
COACH FENNELLY: I think that probably -- you know, in a game like that, you
can't pick one, but that certainly was probably the biggest one. We had some
momentum. We got up four. And for some reason, we had a hard time guarding
her. She is a great player.  
When we made a defensive mistake, she stuck a three on us. That's what great
players do. That's what great teams find a way to do. She hit the three. We
came down, missed a shot. We held them and then we missed the front end of a
one on one when it was 52-51 and seemed to struggle from that point on.  
That was certainly -- the shift was quick at that time. To her credit, 6-8 is
-- if you are out there by yourself, 6-8 is pretty dang good. We didn't guard
her the right way. When we didn't, she made them.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the coaching matchup you had against Coach Mulkey in
the game and back and forth during time-outs and things and if she expressed
any concern about Heather pregame.  
COACH FENNELLY: As far as Heather pregame, she asked me if Heather was going
to play. And as far as the matchup goes, she is in the Hall of Fame and I'm a
long way from that. So it was -- it wasn't mismatch.  
  
Q. Bill, you guys get a lot of contributions from a lot of players. Can you
talk about how everybody had help getting you back in the game?  
COACH FENNELLY: I thought Jocelyn and Ash did a great job. They were in the
game when the game shifted. I thought they contributed. The problem we had, I
debated a long time about leaving them in a little longer. They hadn't played
a lot of minutes, and they were getting tired.  
And certainly our seniors are the people that have gotten us here and we felt
like they have rested and we can get them back in and make a couple plays.
Didn't work out that way.  
I thought Jocelyn and Ash did a great job. I thought Whitney Williams, even
though she didn't score, defended really well, got the ball up the floor. Our
bench play was good, very good. We don't ask them to do a lot as far as
critical -- as far as scoring or whatever. But they took care of the ball.
They defended. They rebounded. Jocelyn steps up and makes two free throws,
gave our kids some enthusiasm with the things she does.  
I was very pleased with the kids that came off the bench and the contributions
they made in a very big game against a very good team.  
  
Q. They made nine threes and that's more than they usually make. Did you
roll the dice and cut off the passing lanes and hope they wouldn't beat you
from the perimeter?  
COACH FENNELLY: We were going to let -- believe it or not, Jessica Morrow was
the first name on the scouting report in big black letters "no threes." Didn't
work out that way.  
The other kids we were kind of gapping them a little bit, make them shoot the
three. We knew Jessica Morrow could shoot the three. She always seems to play
well against us.  
She hit her first one. So often a player -- we didn't guard her the right way
and she made her first shot. You get into the flow of the game right away. She
hit some big ones.  
Like I said, sometimes the other person is just better. And when we made a
defensive mistake and left her open, she made it. And that's why she has been
a very good player there for a long time. That's why their team is in the top
ten.  
  
Q. When this tournament was here two years ago, you loved Oklahoma City.
What's your opinion of it now?  
COACH FENNELLY: I wish the weather was better (smiling).  
No, I love it. They do a great job. The people here are amazing. It reminds me
of home. The people in Iowa are the nicest people there are. They care about
one another. They want to help people. It is the same thing here. Everyone
from the hotel, it is cool to have a police escort, that was cool, go through
traffic.  
No, it couldn't have been any better. Certainly the only thing that's better
we wanted to stay and keep playing. But we are going to go home tomorrow.  
But the people here and the effort they put into this event and the things
that they do here to allow the student-athletes to have the memories that they
have should be commended because that's what this tournament is about. It is
about creating an atmosphere for the fans, but certainly an atmosphere for the
student-athletes to enjoy this and our players have been treated great. They
have enjoyed every minute of it.  
I mean, it with all sincerity, the people of Oklahoma City, I thank them for
it. I love Kansas City. As far as I'm concerned if it is Kansas City and
Oklahoma City every time, I vote yes.  
  
Q. I know it is very hard to tell what the committee is going to do, but
you've got three Big 12 teams in the top ten in the RPI; Oklahoma which lot of
people thought would be the number one loss today. What do you think the odds
will be that whoever wins tomorrow could also conceivably get a No. 1 seed if
OU has kept its No. 1?  
COACH FENNELLY: I don't know, Michelle. It is hard to figure the committee
out. I don't know that we will have two No. 1 seeds in our league. I firmly
believe Oklahoma is the No. 1 seed for what they have done, the whole body of
work. That seems to be the phrase everybody loves.  
But Baylor and A&M are playing at a high level. They have proven it day in and
day out, game in and game out over an entire season, non-conference,
conference. Both playing really well.  
So I would be shocked if -- and disappointed, I guess, if Oklahoma isn't No. 1
and I think Baylor and A&M could easily be 2s. I don't know how all that
S-curve stuff works and where they have to go.  
They are three great teams that will represent our league in tremendous
fashion. I think all three teams have a legitimate chance to play a long time
in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. With Heather's return, how big of an impact did she have on the game and
the girls and the team today?  
COACH FENNELLY: I think obviously Heather is the emotional leader of our team.
I still literally -until I put her in the game, I didn't know if I should or
not. She was released by the medical staff, and she wanted to play. To be
honest with you, I didn't want to play her.  
In retrospect, I probably shouldn't have played her, to be honest. But she is
a senior and she has earned the right. I just -- we were on the elevator going
up just the two of us in the hotel after shoot-around, and I said, We have
been together for four years. Look me in the eye and tell me what you want to
do. She said, Coach, I want to play and I can play. I said, Okay, you're going
to play. She has earned that right to make that decision.  
The medical staff supported it literally right up until game time. And we made
the decision to let her go. But she wanted to play, and I think her teammates
wanted her to play, too, which is even more important.  
  
Q. Would you mind giving us your breakdown on these two tomorrow having
faced both of them? How do you think that will go? What will be the deciding
factors in that game?  
COACH FENNELLY: They just played recently, so I think the familiarity is there
in the last game of the season. Two teams that are dedicated to defending in a
very aggressive way. Taking away what you do best, I think like a lot of these
games, when it gets to the championship game format, it is who are the players
you don't expect to make some plays.  
Jessica Morrow got them into the championship game. I would be shocked if she
can do that again tomorrow against them. Sydney Colson looked today to get
excited and make some shots. A lot of times that's what happens in these
games. It is someone that you don't expect that can contribute.  
I think it will be a great game, a very physical game, certainly a game that I
would not want to officiate. I don't envy those three people that got that
call.  
But other than that, I think it is going to be a very, very entertaining game.
And the game will impact the NCAA seeding, as you mentioned, and will
certainly be a way for our league to showcase two great programs and a lot of
good individual players.  
PETER IRWIN: Coach, thank you very much.

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

### [Courtney Paris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13851)

### [Danielle Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18925)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Texas A&M - 74  
Oklahoma - 62

  
PETER IRWIN: We are joined by the Sooners from Oklahoma. Coach, would you like
to make any opening comments?  
COACH COALE: Congratulations to Texas A&M. I thought they were hungry. I
thought they competed at an incredibly high level. I thought they fought for
every possession for an entire 40 minutes and they deserve to play in the
championship.  
  
Q. Could you both talk about the shooting problems today at the free-throw
line and even on the floor because of A &M's defense.   
COURTNEY PARIS: A&M did a great job being scrappy and hustling. But we just --
we weren't as tough as we usually are. Normally -- we've had games where we
didn't shoot very well and we still find a way to fight through it. That's the
number one thing we didn't have tonight is any fight.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: The free throws, it was just focus. We would hit one and
miss the second one. We were 1-2, everybody in the first half. It is just the
idea of focus.  
The threes we hit we were 0-4 in the first half. It was our shooters resting.
They were closing out quick, kind of rushing them into their shots. I
definitely think that affected them.  
  
Q. Would you just talk about your night. Obviously the fouls just kept
coming for you and how frustrating was it for you to watch what was happening
from the bench?  
COURTNEY PARIS: It is my own fault. I wasn't ready to go. A lot of my fouls
came off situations I could have controlled.  
I don't know. I got to come out ready to play. A lot of that is my fault and
make sure my teammates are ready to play, too. So ...  
  
Q. D. Rob, you got to the lane but they weren't dropping. Was it something
defensively or was it one of those days for you?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: It was really just focusing on the target. I mean, I would
get there or I would be sped up a little bit and rush a shot. So that was just
needing to slow down or have a change of speed, really just focus on the
target and finish it.  
  
Q. Danielle, it seems like Sydney Colson has really picked up her game since
early in the season when you guys played them in Norman.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Yeah, she had a great game today. She wanted it and
especially when they had the momentum, she really sparked it. By hitting
threes, she got to the lane in transition, she led her team today. She got the
ball where it needed to be for them to score. Danielle Gant had a great game.  
  
Q. Danielle and Courtney, I suppose, one thing you're not getting both days
is really three-point shooting from your three-point shooters. Is that a
concern going forward, and how badly do you need somebody to come in other
than Jenny and make a few?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think our shooters will do just fine. It really comes down
to all the things that happen before that, if the post -- post starter, they
have to help down and their shooters are more open. We set better screens and
our plays flow more and the shooters get better shoots than having to rush. I
don't think it is necessarily the shooters have to make shots, it is more a
team effort and everybody getting those guys to have opportunities.  
  
Q. Would you just talk about what this does for you heading forward. Does
this make you more determined whenever you find out where you are going on
Monday?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: This is the final stretch. You know, we're really only
guaranteed going into the NCAA one game. And from here out, it will be a dog
fight wherever we play. We have to learn from this. We have, what, a week to
prepare and get ready for whoever is coming up.  
Like I said, we have to learn from it and take the loss, really.  
COURTNEY PARIS: I second what she said. You have to learn from it. I mean, the
tangible things, following the scout, blocking out, those things, knocking
down free throws.  
But, also, I think this game can remind us what makes us so special and I
think that's fight that we have and that togetherness and that urgency we get
in games, even when it is not going our way. I think that will remind us.
That's the X factor for Oklahoma and we have to get back to that.  
  
Q. Coach, is there any common thread in these couple of losses to Texas A
&M, maybe something particular they throw at you that makes them a tough out
for your team?  
COACH COALE: They speed us up. And Danielle at the point position has to learn
how to go at the pace she wants to go at.  
Everybody about her offensive execution was just a step too fast and that's
part of our finishing problem.  
They do a great job offensively, too, of attacking the glass. While we get a
lot of rebounds, we don't necessarily always block out real well. When they
crash really, really hard, they present some problems. That's really what got
us on our heels early, 13 first-half offensive rebounds.  
  
Q. The last maybe two weeks the offensive problems, how concerned are you
about the off -- I know Whitney has been out, but getting her assimilated back
in, how much of a problem is that right now?  
COACH COALE: I didn't feel like we had any offensive problems in the second
half last night. There were a couple games down the stretch I didn't feel like
we had any offensive problems in either.  
So we have to make open threes, but not making open threes was not really the
problem tonight. We took a bunch of threes right down the stretch trying to
close that deficit. But that wasn't the problem. We have to make free throws.
We have to make two-foot chippies. We have to execute our plays. We have to
attend to the scout. Those things are far greater concerns than missing or
making some threes.  
  
Q. How frustrated were you that -- as you kept trying to find personnel that
could work or was throwing, even putting in your second unit at one point
trying to get something going today, you never could find that right
combination.  
COACH COALE: It was frustrating because I didn't think we played as hard as we
needed to play. I didn't think we played with a sense of urgency that deserved
an opportunity to play in the championship game. I really didn't.  
That was the frustrating part. You know, you miss shots, you sometimes dribble
off your foot. You sometimes do crazy stuff. But not giving maximum effort
from start to finish in a semifinal game of a conference tournament is
baffling. That was the frustrating part. I thought Jenny Vining came in the
game and competed as hard as she could compete. I thought Abi's minutes were
as much as she could give us. We got it in places.  
We have to get it all the way across the board. If you want to go deep in the
NCAA tournament, everybody better come to play every second they're on the
floor.  
  
Q. Yesterday, Sherri, it seemed like everything was clicking and things were
going well. Today it is almost night and day opposite. Does it show you how
fragile it is when you are playing good teams this time of year? What do you
take away?  
COACH COALE: Absolutely. There is a breadth of difference between the guy that
gets to keep playing and the one whose season is over.  
It is little things. You know, we preach them all the time. It is blocking out
every time whether the shot goes in or not. It is making 100 free throws every
single day, whether you are shooting 95 percent from the line or 25 percent
from the line.  
You could go down the list, and a million different ways. When the NCAA
tournament rolls around, you are a breath away from going on or your season
being over and our guys understand that. They understand it.  
  
Q. Most people still projecting Lady Sooners No. 1 seed. Talk about that and
about the Big 12 heading to the NCAA as the conference.  
COACH COALE: I do think we are still a No. 1 seed. I think what we did in our
tournament schedule, our strength of schedule is No. 1, our RPI is No. 1.
Currently ranked two or three depending on the poll you look at. I think we
are still definitely a No. 1 seed.  
I think the Big 12 as a whole has a great deal of respect from the committee.
They understand how difficult our league is and the quality of basketball
that's played on a nightly basis. I think they certainly take that into
consideration as well as the fact that teams in our conference have done a
really good job of scheduling in the early season before conference play rolls
around.  
So strength of schedule is really high and quality top to bottom is as good as
it gets.  
  
Q. Sherri, Sydney Colson and Tanisha Smith have had great games the last two
times you have played them. Chance you could see them again in Oklahoma City.
Talk a little bit about what you guys need to do against those two players.  
COACH COALE: We need to follow the game plan. That would be number one.  
Colson made some big plays, she did. She had a little step-back three that was
nasty. You give her that. I thought she competed in a really high level. She
ran her team and played with a lot of confidence. I think Smith makes them a
lot better, even though her percentage wasn't great tonight. She stretches
them and makes you do some things that you might not otherwise like to do.  
But Gant -- in my opinion, Gant and Colson stole the show tonight. I thought
Danielle Gant just wanted to win worse than anybody else on the basketball
floor. The results speak for themselves.  
  
Q. Whitney seemed to really hustle, play well, some of that stuff, but she
has yet to make a shot since coming back from her injury. How concerned are
you about her on the offensive end?  
COACH COALE: We knew it would take her a little bit to get back into rhythm.
It is hard to try to get back into rhythm on such a grand stage as this. She's
just got to slow down a little bit.  
I am not worried about her shooting the basketball. She will make open shots.
The finger is not affecting that. She is just playing a little bit too fast
right now and that's pressing, trying too hard to get back where you were in
three steps. You can't do that. You got to take them one by one.  
  
Q. You put Courtney back in in the first half with three fouls. You kind of
did that in the Tennessee game when you guys were down. Was it a matter of
having her on the floor at that time?  
COACH COALE: I felt like maybe we could loosen up things with other guys with
her attention to her at the block. Instead, what we did is we tried to cram it
down to her at the block two or three consecutive possessions which resulted
in turnovers. It was her presence more than production that I was after at the
close of the half.  
That being said, we score on the last possession and have a chance to go in
the locker room just down six. In my opinion, the exclamation point of the
game was that one before halftime. That one showed. They really wanted to win
and they were going to play through every possession and we didn't. We stopped
short. Because of that, we do not deserve to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you dissect not playing hard a little bit because Danielle mentioned
lack of focus at the free-throw line. You have mentioned speeding up. Is that
-- is getting rattled part of not playing hard? Is that in addition to? What
was the problem there?  
COACH COALE: It could be the impetus for not playing hard, everything from
foul trouble to pressure defense, forcing you to go too fast to -- there are a
million things that can force you or that can send you in the direction of not
competing at the highest possible level.  
I thought that things distracted us, and that just means you are not very
tough. It means you are fragile. If getting pushed three times when you shoot
and it doesn't get called, if that makes you not play hard, you are not very
tough. If a defense putting pressure on you the length of the floor makes you
not focus on a free throw, you are not very mentally tough.  
(Cell phone ringing.)  
It doesn't really make me happy.  
  
Q. One of the bright spots was Jenny coming off the bench and giving you
some good minutes. It seems she is playing her best basketball as you go into
the tournament. What does she add to your team going forward?  
COACH COALE: Competitive spirit. She's not going to quit. She is not ever
going to quit. She is going to fight.  
I like the element that she gives us offensively in that she has a real high
basketball IQ. She moves without the ball well. She reads the defense well.
She wants the ball at all times. And I thought defensively tonight she did a
really good job of adhering to the scout. She is the one that really paid
attention and did the things that we talked about in terms of our strategy
before the game.  
So I think her confidence has grown and obviously we get that three ball from
her. That's big-time. But she does a lot of the little things extremely well,
too.  
PETER IRWIN: Coach, thank you very much and best of luck in the NCAA
tournament.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Texas A&M  74  
Oklahoma - 62

  
PETER IRWIN: Coach Blair, welcome and congratulations on a big win. You have
got one minute.  
COACH BLAIR: Defense, rebounding, percentage shots, great point guard play,
bench coming in, Micheaux, being able to rest her while Courtney was in foul
trouble where she could come in and play the whole second half basically. Give
Elonu and Buchanan a lot of credit because they held the fort until we could
get Micheaux into the second half.  
Proud of the effort and the stamina we had. We have to do it one more time.
Remember, folks, we haven't won anything yet. They don't give any consolation
prizes.  
The last time we beat Oklahoma at our place our fans thought we had won the
National Championship. We haven't won a thing yet. We'll keep it in
perspective and we'll go back to work and we'll start teaching again and go
over the film.  
My assistants had a great game plan for them. We mixed up zone and zone-to-man
and straight man and pressed a couple possessions.  
But my minute is up.  
  
Q. Danielle, coming home, how does it feel to beat Oklahoma practically in
their backyard?  
DANIELLE GANT: It feels good to beat Oklahoma. Not just Oklahoma, any team. It
would have been great to beat any team here at home knowing we have a chance
for the Big 12 title tomorrow.  
  
Q. Sydney, how different a team are they with Whitney Hand, seemingly still
a little bit injured. She hasn't scored this tournament -- didn't score this
tournament. How different are they with her injury?  
SYDNEY COLSON: I think whether she was injured or not, we were ready to come
out here and defend anybody that was coming at us. We knew if she was in the
game, she was going to be mostly trying to get the three-point shot off
because we did a pretty bad job guarding her at their place in Oklahoma a few
months ago. So we knew we had to buckle down on her.  
We were just mentally prepared this time to go out there and defend anybody
because we know that Texas A&M, our style of play is just to come after them
hard, get steals and get out in transition. We wanted just want to do the best
job we could whether she was in there or not.  
  
Q. Where does this one rank in terms of your great games north of the Red
River?  
DANIELLE GANT: One of the best, just knowing that it is almost our senior
year, me, Micheaux and Takia, our senior year is almost over. It ranks one of
the best for us knowing we have an opportunity as three seniors going out with
a Big 12 championship.  
  
Q. They got within one there, the second half, the crowd was getting into
it, you guys went on a 14-3 run. Sydney, had you a pull-up three off the
dribble. Can you talk about that stretch when you turned the game around back
to y'all's favor?  
SYDNEY COLSON: Like I was saying, we knew we were getting nervous. We were
like we got to pick this up and try to get this lead stretched out much more
so we can be a little bit more comfortable and back up and play a zone the
rest of the game and just do what we need to do to get a bigger lead.  
When I hit that three, I felt like we got a little bit of adrenalin going and
momentum and it took us down the stretch.  
  
Q. Sydney, it looked to me like during that run that OU made in the second
half, right as they made that run, you guys took it to them strong and took it
to them defensively as well. Did you feel like that was one of the key
stretches right there, doing what you kept going?  
SYDNEY COLSON: For sure in the first half, we knew that some of their players
were in foul trouble and the coach, she rested some of the starters and we
were like y'all, we got to buckle down and get the lead to something we can
gain on in the second half, try to get it bigger.  
Courtney wasn't in. Their point guard wasn't in. We knew we had to take
advantage of the situation. We went into halftime with an eight-point lead or
so and it helped us in the second half and getting Courtney in foul trouble. I
think Damitria Buchanan really did a great job, changed the game around and
great leader with getting our momentum going.  
Did a great job and pulled out a W.  
  
Q. Tanisha, the first time you played OU, you had 4 points I think you had
19 last time and then 13 today. Talk about your game against the Sooners.  
TANISHA SMITH: My first time playing against OU I did have four points. It was
a different atmosphere, came off the bench that game, got over my illnesses.
They came to our house. A lot of the leadership coming from D. Gant to me. She
talked to me before every game. We were roommates every time; so her
leadership and her ownership of the team is helping me overcome a lot of the
things that's going on.  
  
Q. Gary, can you talk a little bit about NCAA tournament seedings. Kim
talked yesterday how she feels like because of where this thing is RPI-wise.
It might not be too much far fetched to have a couple No. 1 seeds. How much
could this tournament play into how that plays out?  
COACH BLAIR: They are not going to let that happen. I think we have a chance
for No. 1 with Oklahoma and two No. 2s with us and Baylor. But there are some
other good teams who are up there as well.  
I think that's more realistic. I would say Kansas State and Iowa State, all of
us need to be in the top four.  
People across the country are getting to see how good we are. We're doing it
with some of the best officials in the country. They are all here because
there is not much else going on. We are getting the best officials. You are
getting the best games. I think it is good for our league, the exposure.
Sometimes it is great playing this second week because the spotlight is on us
and look at the media that's here today.  
  
Q. Talk about your defense, if you would, especially out front, really
getting the pressure there and forcing 17 turnovers today.  
COACH BLAIR: Basically, defense started about six years ago when we were not
very good in this league.  
And so for us to play with the halves of the league, we had to sit there and
try to win, try to recruit a different way. That's what we were able to do
because the Courtney Parises were not going to come to us four or five years
ago. But the Danielle Gants, the Takia Starks, the Micheauxs, the Renos,
Morenikes, a lot of names all of you hadn't heard. All of a sudden, they
bought in to what we were about and they said defense first, rebound the best
you can and great point guard play. But defense is going to win you
championships and that's our bread and butter. We don't apologize for it.  
A lot of people say our style is ugly. They hold, they foul, they do this and
they do that. There is a lot of ways to win ball games. If defense is the best
thing we do, I wish that our coaches would say, "That's a damn good team
sometime" instead of saying, "They play hard. They scrap. They lose balls."
Damn good is a pretty good adjective, too.  
  
Q. Gary, there has been a lot of blogs about late time-outs that you have
called in games. Anything you want to address about that with the two you
called?  
COACH BLAIR: You noticed we ran the press breakers correct the whole time. I
called one at the end because I had actually subbed Gant out and the whole
nine yards and they ran to the wrong plays. And I'm not going to turn it over
and let us screw something up.  
We executed well down the stretch and if that gives them a chance to sell
something else on T.V., sobeit. But we're not going to finish the game. It is
a teaching moment, and so people get over it.  
Do you think I'm trying to run up the score? Okay, I'm not trying to run up
the score. I'm trying to make sure that we don't have a turnover because when
we ran that sideline play, we turned the ball over.  
That was the only turnover during that whole time. We execute press breakers
and I'm going to teach. If other people get upset about it, then I can't help
that. It's teaching and it's coaching.  
  
Q. Kind of a rough shooting day for Starks. Talk about your other players
and how they kind of stepped up, especially Colson, it seems like the last
couple days she has hit big shots for you.  
COACH BLAIR: Two comments on that. I wrote them down so I can tell the people
back home.  
First, Starks has got to fill up the right side of the stat sheet. She did
great on the defensive end. She was 10-11 from the line, okay?  
She didn't have -- she had three turnovers, three assists. She had 12 points,
sobeit. It was 1 out of 11.  
But you see this at the upper levels all the time. I can leave you on the
floor if you play the game, okay? Your game is not necessarily the score
because if they have Thompson on you, a taller person, last time they had Hand
on her and they changed it up. Hand on Tanisha Smith is not a great matchup.
So we exploited Hand by using Tanisha as much as we could.  
Colson, I said before the ball game, Shalee Lehning and Danielle Robinson are
first team -- they are the two best point guards in the league by what they
have proven. Where do we put you? Where do we put you as a sophomore? Can you
play to that level? It is going to take the leadership. It is going to take
the voice commands because they are not going to be able to hear me all the
time.  
So I challenged her before the game. This is the most minutes she has played
in a long time. How many kids could be ready to go four months and two days
after ACL surgery? And people don't realize that. That's very, very important.  
  
Q. Oklahoma didn't have more field goals than turnovers until the last
minute. Is that damn good defense?  
COACH BLAIR: Yeah. Whatever you said, I'm not sure how we circled around
there, but I'm a little slow now.  
  
Q. They didn't have more field goals than turnovers until the last minute.  
COACH BLAIR: I think it is good. We were forcing them into things. They were
not able to run those pick and screens and isolate Courtney in there. They
were able to do that.  
You play Courtney by fronting her and ball pressure and praying for help.
That's the only way you can guard her. If you are going to stay behind, you
are going to see who's who in America like you did yesterday because she's too
good. So you got to take chances. Our style of defense, that's how we do it.  
If other people want to copy us, they need to come watch Coach Schaeffer teach
practice every day on the defensive end. It works.  
  
Q. Just talk about Danielle Gant's game.  
COACH BLAIR: There is not much to say. Y'all can write about it. Y'all can
throw the adjectives in there.  
She does it all. She has to guard. She has to do it all. I took her out for
one break for a minute and a half and I said, "I just want to get you" \-- she
said, "Coach, I am ready to go." I said, "You have got three fouls." I can't
take a chance knowing as explosive as Oklahoma is to come back.  
Danielle Gant just wants to win and isn't it a shame she's not on all those
all-American lists? Because all-American lists are about reputation and how
many points you score, and that's not how the game of basketball is played,
okay? It is about doing all the little things. It is about what's on your hat
there.  
The Detroit Pistons, when they used to be pretty good, they used to have a guy
named Dennis Rodman. They used to have a lot of players that could do a lot of
the little things in the game. Gant does the little things and she's hard to
guard. She's going to shoot free throws well. She wants the ball. She is going
to guard everybody's best player.  
The most important thing is probably what she's done off the court
academically by turning herself into a great academic student as well.  
PETER IRWIN: Coach, thank you very much for your comments.  
COACH BLAIR: Don't y'all leave town tomorrow, okay? I want to see all of the
Oklahoma people still back in here tomorrow because whoever wins this next
game, it's going to be a shoot-out.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We are now joined by the lady Bears from Baylor.  
Coach, congratulations to you and the players on a big win. Coach has decided
she doesn't want to make any opening comments.  
We will go straight to the student-athlete questions.  
  
Q. Jess, it looked like you were aggressively looking for your shot today. I
mean, was that by design or just kind of the flow of the offense?  
JESSICA MORROW: I think it was the flow of the offense. We ran a couple of set
plays, and my teammates did a good job of setting screens and getting me open
looks. So ...  
  
Q. Jhasmin, just your thoughts about being involved in a close game down the
stretch. You guys have made a habit down the stretch of winning those games.
It must feel good to do that and get into the championship.  
JHASMIN PLAYER: I think I will start by saying that Jessica Morrow has proven
the player she has been and she should have been recognized. This is her third
game in a row Jess stepped up big. She hit shots that seniors hit.  
She made plays at the end of the game. She made plays at the offensive end of
the floor.  
  
Q. Jess, you had a string there kind of early in the second half where the
shot wasn't falling and then you got hot again late. Was there ever any
hesitation in your mind shooting the ball?  
JESSICA MORROW: No. I just think other people were getting open looks. We have
a lot of people who can score. I think it opened up for me at the end because
they were worried about those people who were scoring in the beginning of the
second half.  
I mean, it was just -- we ran -- we executed a lot of good plays. We executed
a lot of good plays, so that was basically it.  
  
Q. Jhasmin and Jessica, first half, you all went through a spell there where
you basically had to defend -- rely on your defense to get things going. Just
talk about what you went through there going into halftime.  
JHASMIN PLAYER: We have a great coaching staff and Coach Barmore does a great
job with us defensively and sometimes our offense isn't going. So we have to
rely on our defense. We have been having to do that all year. Just chasing
around all day, just chasing those shooters around. We didn't even know if
Ezell was playing. That's what players do.  
We just had to come off all those screens and keep your hands up and keep
hands in their faces.  
  
Q. Jessica, talk about the -- Iowa State had gone up four with five minutes
to go and you hit a three in the next possession. How key was that moment-
wise?  
JESSICA MORROW: I was surprised I was that open. It was basically the flow of
the offense-type thing. They were all -- the momentum was on their side, and
we wanted to get that back on our side.  
I was just thankful it went in (smiling) because I had been missing a couple
few before that. So we needed a spark at that point.  
  
Q. Rachel, your thoughts on facing A &M for a third time this season.   
RACHEL ALLISON: Who else? Who else would we want to face? They're a great team
and athletic and I think that they're a good matchup for us and we've already
played them twice.  
So I think that the scouting report area of that is to our advantage.  
  
Q. Rachel, during a time-out, your mom went out there and won a shooting
contest. Did you see that?  
RACHEL ALLISON: No, I didn't see it. I just heard about it walking in here.  
  
Q. Is she buying dinner tonight?  
RACHEL ALLISON: I don't know. Was it 500 -- I thought it was in gas. I think
it is in gas.  
COACH MULKEY: It is against NCAA rules probably. Let that woman win her gas
money.  
  
Q. Jessica, yesterday Alison Lacey went off for a lot of points. What was
the key today to slowing her down and then getting your own basket?  
RACHEL ALLISON: Alison Lacey is a good three-point shooter. She is a good
player all around. We knew going into that game that we had to defend her and
contain her, and I thought my teammates did a really good job of helping me
when she drove. There was always somebody there.  
They have a lot of good set offenses. Like Jhas said, we had to chase them.
They used the shot clock and we had to be mentally strong and play through the
whole 30 seconds, and I think we did a good job of that tonight.  
  
Q. Jhasmin, it seemed like when you are most successful, you executed your
offense really well. You got some really great screens. Can you talk about
that? It seemed like Melissa set some very key screens for you at good
times.  
JHASMIN PLAYER: Melissa does all the things that outside of rebounding you
don't see on the stat sheets, helping everybody defensively, getting offensive
boards. She is shooting free throws if she doesn't get the put-back. If I am
coming off a screen, I want M.J. to set it.  
She sets a screen for the person who is hot right there and puts herself
aside. She was setting the stagger that was getting Jess wide open. That's
what M.J. does.  
  
Q. Jhasmin, can you talk about the big offensive rebounds you got down the
stretch, you in particular getting inside and getting a couple of those that
kept possessions alive or just getting big rebounds.  
JHASMIN PLAYER: Just trying to get in there and mix it up. We had a small
lineup at the end, and M.J. and I -- I tried to do whatever M.J. was doing.
Offense isn't going, you want -- at that point you want to get Jess another
shot.  
Going in there and just trying to be tough and being in the mix of things,
maybe if you can touch it and hit it off on somebody or something, and we were
able to do that.  
  
Q. Jhas, is Coach going to let you watch the men play?  
COACH MULKEY: Y'all stop asking questions, we are out of here.  
JHASMIN PLAYER: We want to see them just like you guys.  
COACH MULKEY: We got priorities. We got to get over there.  
  
Q. Just your thoughts on A &M -- playing A&M for the third time tomorrow.   
COACH MULKEY: A&M is playing very well, and you don't come here and beat
Oklahoma -- you don't beat Oklahoma twice in one year if you are not a very
good basketball team.  
I don't imagine it will be any different than all the Big 12 games. It will be
a battle. And whoever makes plays down the stretch will win. They are very
similar in what they do offensively.  
Defensively, they're a little bit different in they like to extend their
defense more than we do. But it will be a battle.  
Let me say this about Bill Fennelly. This guy is one of the best coaches I
have ever had to coach against. He can take talent and just work with it, and
he is just one of my favorite guys in this business. His kids really -- you
just love coaching against them because you know you are going to have to
work.  
I also want to say one other thing in defense of our men's basketball coaches
-- is John Rohde in here? Is he the guy that wrote the article in today's
"Oklahoman"? He stated in that article -- our men are on a great run here. It
is a great Cinderella story and he tainted it by what he wrote in that article
by saying our men's basketball coaching staff is highly regarded as the worst
coaching staff in this league.  
Now, guys, that's a cheap shot. What if we walked up to him and said, "that's
the worst article I have ever read in my life"?  
Now that I got that off my chest, next question.  
  
Q. Did you feel you played better tonight than last night? If so, what kind
of effort is it going to take tomorrow against A &M?   
COACH MULKEY: I thought we started the game better. I don't know if we played
better. I thought down the stretch we made plays like we did last night.  
I thought individual players played better last night. We had more of the
production on the offensive end. I just thought we just made plays and your
seniors led you. And those three, what a better three to have here than your
three seniors. They made plays, got big rebounds, made defensive stops. We're
playing for a championship, and we're still winning without Danielle.  
  
Q. It looked like in the first half you guys were really shooting the ball
from the perimeter a lot and doing it well. Was that part of the game plan?  
COACH MULKEY: No, no. That's Bill's game plan. Bill shoots the ball from out
there a lot. I think I was told, and correct me if I'm wrong, that may be the
most threes we have made all year. Those kids had the green light. Bill's -- I
don't know what his defensive game plan was, but from our perspective it
looked like he was sagging off so it was hard for us to get to driving lanes
and they gave us some open looks and our kids made those shots.  
  
Q. Did you know at all that Heather Ezell was going to play today?  
COACH MULKEY: When I hugged Bill before the game, I just -- you know, I just
wished him well. I actually asked about Heather and he said she probably will
play tonight, and we were talking about -- I was asking was she going to be
able to play in the play-offs and we were chitchatting about her and Danielle
and he thought she would play today.  
  
Q. How was her performance?  
COACH MULKEY: Just a warrior. All his kids play like that. They give you
everything they have and they never get rattled. You can have a 20-point lead
and not feel comfortable because of their ability to shoot the three-ball.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Morrow. I know she had a huge game against A &M
and had big shots down the stretch and again today. What is it about her? Does
she want the ball in that situation?   
COACH MULKEY: I can't speak for her, but I was a senior one time and played
this game and you don't want it to end. I think she understands the games are
dwindling down and you want to go out in a blaze of glory. I think Jessica
starting her senior year shooting poorly from the field, very unlike Jessica
to shoot the ball poorly. She has made up for it at the right time her senior
year.  
  
Q. Rachel Allison has had some ups and downs obviously this season, but it
seemed like today especially she was really battling for it.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, today, she's picked up her -- she's made -- she's become
the Rachel that we know. She did have a senior year that was not typical
Rachel.  
Some of that was probably that she drew a lot of attention that she didn't
draw in years past. She came in here as a freshman and Sophia Young got all
the attention and Rachel was able to quietly do her thing. And then as she got
better and drew a lot of attention, I just think that Rachel fought through it
and it is so good to see her come out of that and hit some big buckets and
battling rebounds in there for us.  
  
Q. Talk about the contrasting styles between Iowa State and Baylor and how
it worked in your favor today even with the teams somewhat doing what Iowa
State does best as far as shooting the three outside.  
COACH MULKEY: Iowa State, they execute so well, they make you defend them for
30 seconds. We like to push it and run. They execute the half-court offense as
good as anybody.  
They set screens. They use screens. We are an athletic team that runs the
floor, tries to get transition baskets, tries to do a lot of on-ball screens.  
Yeah, we hit some threes today, and that's not really like our style of play.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you very much.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Baylor  67  
Oklahoma State - 62

  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Lady Bears and Coach Mulkey and her
athletes. Coach, opening comments. Congratulations on the big win.  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I'll take the questions.  
THE MODERATOR: We will do the student-athletes first if you don't mind. If you
have questions for the student athletes, put your hand up, your name and
affiliation, please.  
  
Q. Melissa, when you guys are down 11 at the half, what are you saying to
each other?  
MELISSA JONES: I think it came from Coach Mulkey that we can come back, don't
give ever up. They show up and make big plays and keep it going.  
  
Q. This is for Melissa first and then Jessica. When did you kind of know
that you were not only going to get back into it, but when did you have the
feeling you were actually going to come back and take the game?  
MELISSA JONES: I mean it's hard to say. You never -- like whenever you're
down, like in the beginning I think there is always the fight inside of you
that you can come back and win no matter how much you are down. I think it is
-- especially at half time we realized we really needed to kick it into gear I
think we were able to hold and, you know.  
JESSICA MORROW: At half time we pretty much knew what we were doing wrong.
Oklahoma State did a real good job on the offensive boards. And they out-
rebounded us the first half and we knew that was a key in the game. And we
knew if we had any chance, we had to start off the second half, you know, with
spark and get back in somehow. And I think we kept chipping away and we got
momentum back and were able to make a run.  
  
Q. Jessica, can you talk about the play where Riley drove down and then did
you see it coming? Or just instinct to get in the way?  
JESSICA MORROW: We have been talking about that. She is a great player,
definitely one of the best drivers and the hardest-to-guard girls and not just
in the conference, but in the nation. And we were talking about trying to get
in front of her. She moves well to try to get away from taking a charge. But I
think when it came down to it, she was just trying to get the shot off, and
just kind of had the right place at the right time I guess.  
  
Q. Jes, you guys have had your ups and downs in the free-throw department.
You made 18-20 in the second half today. What does that say about this team?  
JESSICA MORROW: It says that we have been practicing a lot [laughter]. Early
in the year it was obvious that was a big, you know, problem. And we don't
want that to be the downfall of us in March in the Big 12 tournament and the
NCAA tournament. And we had to especially work hard on our free throws and
finishing games. Those are easy shots and you are supposed to hit those. And I
think we did a good job tonight.  
  
Q. I'll dominate the mic. Melissa, when you are all down 15, do you still
have the confidence to come back?  
MELISSA JONES: I mean sure, definitely. When you have some of the leaders that
we have out there that are always just pushing, no matter what, and believe
that we can come back from whatever adversity that we're dealing with, they
set a very good example for us to follow. And just playing on the court with
them just kind of gets that good vibe around to want to play better to help
the team out as a whole.  
  
Q. Jessica, can you expound upon what you just said? You are one of the
senior leaders and you said in the press conference the other way, hey, this
is kind of my last go-around. Talk about how you pumped everybody up.  
JESSICA MORROW: Like I said, we knew Oklahoma State were playing for
something, you know. They pretty much had to win to be able to -- they pretty
much have to win the Big 12 tournament to go to the NCAA tournament. And we
didn't want that -- their momentum, or their motivation to out weigh our
motivation to win and get a good seed, also. The and so we just persevered. I
think we did a great job. People off the bench, Morghan Medlock, Melissa
Jones, I think as a collective whole we fixed the things we messed up in the
first half, and also other people got more involved. And I think that played a
big role in the second half.  
  
Q. Jessica, talk about the play of Morghan Medlock tonight.  
JESSICA MORROW: She was good -- I mean, I expected it from her. I was waiting
for it to happy guess I can say. But Morghan, she is a great player and we
know she can play. Everybody else might not because we had to yell. We're
trying to give it to her because she is an unbelievable player. And sometimes
other kids don't get shots. And so, I think that opened a lot for Rachel and
Morghan and I think she stepped up big on that tonight.  
COACH KIM MULKEY: If I can elaborate on that, Morghan Medlock was a two-year
starter at Southern Cal. She was a McDonald's All American out of high school.
That tells you about the depth and talent that we have our team without
Danielle Wilson, and I won't get into all that. But Morghan is a team player.
Morghan came to Baylor to get to a final four and that's exactly what she told
me. And she just wants the opportunity. She will get her opportunity, and she
understands it's not about starting; it's about being in the rotation of
players. And she is good enough to be a starter. Has started some games for
us. And so that's, that's a kid that can play.  
  
Q. Jessica, can you just talk about the defense there at the end? I think
their last field goal was like with five-something left. The defense you guys
played to get back in the game.  
JESSICA MORROW: Riley, she's a very -- she is probably one of the hardest
people I have ever guarded in the Big 12. She is an amazing player and she is
very quick. And I felt like it wasn't just me on defense, it was my teammates
helping me, also. Because, she had screens set for her everywhere, and I felt
like people like, everybody stepped up and took the charge when I got screened
and Rachel who was there, Morghan who was there, Ashley Field who was there,
everybody was just there when I needed help, and I think that's what did it on
the defensive end for us. And we just kept rotating, so.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? One more last question.  
  
Q. I guess if you guys both want to address this. When you guys played at
Kansas last week, it was just kind like kind of a lifeless group. Obviously
still feeling the aspects of not having Danielle. What has changed in these
last two games? Was that just a matter of getting that out of your system? And
did you sort of flush that immediately?  
JESSICA MORROW: I don't think anything changed honestly. Kansas is playing
good basketball. It wasn't their night. Honestly, I think if any team went and
played there that night, a lot of them would have lost. I think with them
playing so well in general, and then that night, and then for us, we didn't
really bring it that night either. I just think we just did a good job of
coming back and getting ourselves together for the next two games in the Big
12 tournament, so.  
THE MODERATOR: Jessica, do you want to comment? I'm sorry, Melissa.  
MELISSA JONES: I have to agree with Jes. Kansas definitely playing some really
good basketball. And that night, I mean, it was, it was a good one.  
JESSICA MORROW: Every team has those kind of games.  
MELISSA JONES: Yeah, but . . .  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, thank you for your comments and we will let you
return to the locker room and Coach Mulkey will stay and answer your
questions. Congratulations, we'll see you tomorrow. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Hi. Coach, you said several times in press conferences this year the
seniors got to lead. Did the seniors do their part in that comeback tonight?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: They did, Vince. And they didn't shoot exactly well. You
look at Jes and Jhas's percentages from the field, they didn't shoot it well.
If you look at the game closely, I was isolating them every opportunity I
could because those are the guys that have to guide you and make plays late in
the year. And I thought Rachel Allison again was big for us on the boards. And
I think Jes said it best, we persevered. We never got rattled. We took their
best shot. And Baylor's not going away.  
  
Q. Coach, Morghan is now 2-4 on the season from three-point land. Are you
going to encourage her to step out there a little more?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: No. [Laughter]  
That's one of those where: What is she doing? Great shot. You know. We have
post players, even with Danielle, we have athletic post players. They run the
floor well, they like to face, they like to play with their back to the
basket. And, you know, Morghan is one of those who likes to play with her back
to the basket -- excuse me, facing the basket, and Rachel is. Even big Ashley
Field will catch it and face it. So I guess if you're productive, there is not
a lot you can say as a coach, but we don't go out there and practice it.  
  
Q. Coach, have you ever coached in too many games where the opposing team
has three made shots in a half? Was that your defense? Their lack of offense?
What was that about?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I hope it was our defense, but I'm not going to be here
bragging on that until I look at the film. Just know that -- correct me, was
Riley, 0-10 in the second half? Anybody have a halftime stat sheet? I may not
be real good right now with math. But tell me what she was from the field in
the second half. She was 0-10. I don't think it was an accident. I think it is
a lot of kids putting their hands in her face. I think she is so good and has
ability to get in there and take her body into them. And we really challenged
them in time-outs and half time. When she initiates a contact, you back off or
you take a charge. Don't go in there.  
And I thought we listened very well. I thought the charges were big for us. We
don't take a lot of charges normally as a team. And we probably had four or
five tonight that were at critical moments in the game.  
  
Q. Kim, right before Riley's charge, Byford drew a charge on your end of the
court. I can't remember.  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Morrow.  
  
Q. Okay. That kind of seemed that your players kind of seemed to rally
around her at that point. You could just kind of see it in your face.  
COACH KIM MULKEY: The shot clock was winding down on our end and Jes pretty
much had to do something to get her position to get an open look. So I thought
the young lady, it was a charge, but I was kind of hoping that they would call
all of that hand-checking out front before she drove and that's what I was
griping about, not the charge. Because I really thought the Oklahoma State kid
took it.  
  
Q. Whenever a key player goes down by Danielle does, there always seems to
be that period of adjustment. Are you guys through that now? Are you still
learning on the fly how to play without her?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I am so glad you asked that question and I'm going to give
you a great detailed answer and I want everybody to write it, okay.  
We're not going away. Danielle Wilson was hurt. We beat the 15th ranked team
in the country, Texas, on their home floor without her. They've got an
unbelievable RPI. We go to Kansas and, Michelle, I thought their answers --
you were at that game. Kansas could do no wrong. I believe this, when you get
your butt whipped you compliment the other team. And Kansas would have whipped
anybody that night. We came back and beat the number eight team in the country
on our home floor with a 5 RPI. We now played another team on a neutral court,
if you call this a neutral court. I tend to. I thought the fans were as big in
number as the Oklahoma State fans. We're not going away.  
I said it a minute ago, guys, we have depth. Morghan Medlock is a player. I
don't know what else we can do. Just keep winning, guys, just keep winning. If
we are the conference that everybody says we are in the country, and
supposedly we have the number one RPI and we have read that all year, then two
teams from this conference ought to be number one seeds and I want somebody to
tell me why not.  
You can talk about Stanford being out in their league and we beat them early
in the year. Okay. This league is brutal. Ask Gail Gustin for us to compare
this league to the ACC and see what she tells you. Ask Gary Blair to compare
it to the ACC and see what he tells you, on their best years.  
I am going to elaborate on that, because we're not going away. We're not going
away. They just keep winning.  
And I don't think we have to win this thing to get a number one seed. I don't
think that's fair. We finished second in this league, and if it's supposed to
be what it is, and everybody says that it is, then this team deserves a number
one seed.  
  
Q. Kim, there haven't been many games where you all have been down like
this. I mean, you all have been in pretty much every game. Is this maybe a
good thing, to just show the team hey, if we ever get down 15 points we can
come back?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I don't know if it's good or bad. I don't think any coach
likes to dig out of a hole. But I mean, it's the nature of the business. This
time of year, there are upsets. This time of year you have got teams that are
fighting for their lives really as far as the life of their season. We're not
fighting for our lives, and that's what makes this win special. Is that we
know where we're headed. We know what our next job is. We're just continuing
to do what we have done all year, and that's win basketball games.  
  
Q. Kim, first off, you call were getting out-rebounded I think by 11 in the
first half. Talk about what you all were able to do on the boards in the
second half and particularly what Morghan Medlock gave you this game.  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I felt the first 10 minutes of the game we were out-hustled,
the least ball long rebounds. I thought we were too deep. We were too deep and
they were getting all the long rebounds behind us. And if we'd lost the game,
that's where we would have lost it is the first part of the game. And I felt
that we made a conscious effort of talking to them about position yourself a
little bit further from the rim. And I thought we did that in the second half.
And again, if my math is right, I think those guys got one offensive board the
second half. And those are not adjustments that a coach draws up on a board.
Those are things that come within players. They're talked about in the locker
room. But it comes from within an athlete's body to go out there and make
change. And I thought that our kids did.  
The bench was tremendous for us. Melissa Jones and Morghan Medlock off the
bench. That's why they're there, because I like them coming in the rotation
and giving us something. And please acknowledge those two kids.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach, thank you very much for your comments. We'll see
you tomorrow and good luck.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Oklahoma Sooners- 76  
Kansas Jayhawks - 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Jayhawks from Kansas. Coach, your
thoughts about this afternoon's game and we'll then open questions for our
student-athletes.  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: We didn't have an answer. Not that -- I mean people
in the whole country don't have an answer for Courtney, I'm not saying that,
but we didn't have an inside presence at all, which MEANS you are not getting
to the free-throw line and not challenging the interior defense. And you look
at our shot chart, we have too much outside the paint. That's why we are not
getting to the free-throw line more. We got there, we would have knocked those
down. But the most difficult to defend is when the ball is in the paint,
whether that is off a drive and a drop or the low-post presence and we just
didn't have that.  
The post collectively didn't step up and produce as much as we need when you
are playing number two in the country, or whatever they are. And you know, we
just didn't have an answer for that. Didn't respond, you know, with some --
our production and giving up that many offensive rebounds, it is disappointing
as well.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for that. Questions now for the student
athletes.  
  
Q. Danielle, talk about fighting through the defense. Every time you looked
up, it was a different defender in your face and trying to overcome it. Not so
much in the first half, but in the second half and giving your team a chance
to win.  
DANIELLE McCRAY: I just realized how they were guarding me and the wings they
were trapping and I just tried to throw it to the open point guard or open
player. I don't know, the second half I tried to do something different, and
it was pressure in the face, but I just tried to slow down and make a basket.  
  
Q. Sade, just talk about the second half. You know, trying to help out and
contribute.  
SADE MORRIS: You know, I noticed that they were trapping Danielle on the wing.
I tried to get open gaps to help her, give outlets so she can release some of
the pressure. You know, I just tried to do what I could.  
  
Q. How much did you guys view this game as a chance to just absolutely make
your statement for the NCAA tournament, without any doubt, and then when
you're down six at half, how much did you feel like that was right there for
the taking?  
DANIELLE McCRAY: Oh, we were down six. We obviously knew that we could have
played better in the first half. But it was pretty good that we were only down
six by how bad we were playing in the first half.  
And then as far as the help for us, playing the number two team in the
country, it would be a help for us. But I think, I don't know, we viewed it as
something important for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Just as a reminder, we are supposed to give our names and
affiliation if you don't mind.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you talk about, defensively, in the second half, you guys
couldn't seem to get pieced together enough stops to kind of keep them from
making that run? Can you talk about what they did or what you guys weren't
able to do defensively?  
DANIELLE McCRAY: Just in the beginning they were packing it down, I guess. I
mean, if something -- there is nothing wrong with it, you can't fix it.  
SADE MORRIS: If it's not broke, don't fix it.  
DANIELLE McCRAY: Yeah. They kept going inside. When we tried to dig inside and
tie the ball up with Courtney, they just kicked it back out. But, I think they
just packed it inside for us. And offensive boards, they killed us on
offensive rebounds. And then our offense, we wasn't clicking on the offensive
end in the second half either, so.  
THE MODERATOR: Further questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Thanks. I'd like both of our players to talk just real briefly about the
fact that you had quite a slide in the middle of this season, starting with
that loss in Manhattan. And surely, at some point along the way through there,
it must have seemed a little preposterous that we would be in Oklahoma City
talking about you guys as maybe being an NCAA tournament team. Talk about what
you did to get this season turned around and get to the point where that is a
possibility and something that's being talked about.  
SADE MORRIS: I think we finally embraced how hard it was going to be and how
hard we had to work and how good this league is. And we started to make the
turn around by starting on the defensive end and then started offense from our
defense and I think that's where it got us to where we are now.  
DANIELLE McCRAY: To go along with that I think it was more of our practice
like. We came in every day, even after the loss, we came in with a positive
attitude.  
No one was negative. Like the whole team just embracing it. When you have
teammates that want to go that far and want to go to the NCAA tournament and
have no negative talk at all, and just that commitment, I think that has
changed it, too. There are teams where in the beginning of the season they
probably would have all split up, and I think we just stayed together as a
team. And that's one thing that's really great on our team, we just have that
great team chemistry that we just stay together. And through the good and the
bad, we never go away. And once you have that, your season can keep going
strong.  
  
Q. Both of you can address this if you want. You guys are juniors so you
have watched the Courtney Paris steamroller for three years. Do you have some
empathy for your bigs that are in there battling and battling her, and
especially a youngster, Sutherland, a freshman. What do you say to her during
a game when she's going against somebody like Courtney Paris maybe to help her
keep her spirits up?  
SADE MORRIS: Gain 80 pounds in a hurry.  
DANIELLE McCRAY: In the beginning of the game she was -- she was trying to
battle hard and I just told her -- and what is surprising to me when she
fouled her one time, she turned to me and said I'm trying, like, I need help.
And that was something, for her, that was huge. And I turned to her and said
just keep moving your feet, that's all you can do. The whole feeling when she
responded and she knew she was trying to do something and not just like, oh,
well. I can feel for her, Aishah, that she was trying and she knew that was a
big role for her. And playing Courtney Paris, she tried but had to try harder.  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: And how aggressive Krysten Boogaard -- produced that
offensive foul. Just how aggressive that was And she has been watching a lot
of NBA. Shaq did that, didn't he?  
THE MODERATOR: This is the final question for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about fouls for you guys as a team? Kind of in the first
half and it kind of wore into the second half. Did that affect how you played
defensively or did you have to be a little less aggressive with three or four
players with three or four fouls each?  
SADE MORRIS: Not really, yeah. We had fouls but we just had to be smarter. It
didn't keep us from being aggressive, because that wouldn't do us any good. We
just had to be smart about what we were doing and make sure we pull our hands
back and try not to foul.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, we'll let you return to the locker room and we'll
take questions for coach now.  
  
Q. Bonnie, can you talk about how the strength of the Big 12 plays into your
NCAA tournament hopes? And also, how it kind of built the competitiveness of
this team as you go into the postseason?  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: I think as far as building a resume for the
tournament, if you only take six, everybody above us is ranked nationally.
Every single team above us is ranked nationally. You look at Nebraska.
Nebraska beats Arizona State at home in non-conference. Out of the gate down
19-2 and come back and beat Arizona State. And I watched that game. I watched
Nebraska lose by one against Ohio State, who is now ranked in the top 10 in
the country. That's Nebraska. I wasn't talking about anybody that's ranked.
You know. The quality of the league is fantastic. We have been the number one
RPI league in the country since December. You know, we kick ourselves every
day for, you know, we got a couple in there. We lose three. Sade gets a
concussion against Texas Tech. We're a nine-point game at home and lose up in
Nebraska without Day and that matters. Playing Marquette without Krysten and
everybody has that. That's who we are, that's what we face. And we have some
losses in there that we have to kick ourselves in the pants and we don't play
with urgency that we do down the stretch. And that is those, talking to you
about why it is different. The sense of urgency was completely different.  
And I think the competitiveness in the league. The and what's hard to do in
this league is be consistent because it is so good. What is hard is to be
resilient and persevere. Especially two juniors. The freshman year they get
beat who do we play next. Who do we play next? That is hard to do the junior
year. Oh, my, are we going to do this again? It is this going to happen to us
again? And the resiliency and toughness. And in that stretch we are playing
well and defensively holding teams to 32%. And guarding and out rebounding and
our cut our turnovers, below the turnover goal, so we take care of the
basketball, do the things that you do have to to win in this league.  
And you know, and Danielle said it as far as chemistry. Even in that stretch
where we're talking about going from the tour to the tournament, people. It
wasn't that long ago we were 2-9 and just after the Colorado loss, the team
that is pretty desperate at that point. Like, what are we doing? And you know,
we go through that stretch where not only Shaw-day and Danielle step up, but
production from other players. We have to do it in this league. You can't win
with two people. And -- and you can't give them enough credit for the
toughness and resiliency to bounce back and to stay together as a group. Boy,
that's easy. If they start pointing fingers, it is not me; it's you. I wish
you would stop yelling at me. I kept asking for more and they kept trying to
give more. And that's how you bounce back in about this league and that's
tough. Really tough.  
  
Q. Sherri was talking about Whitney Hand and I know she didn't really have
many points today or whatever. But when you're trying to game plan against
them how does she factor into that and having her back held up?  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: We prepped as if she would play in a pretty short
turn around from yesterday. You know, shooter, deadly. But more than just
shoots the ball. She guards. She is a smart kid. And we started in the box in
one. And you know, just not having that long to prep for the tournament and
splitting with Nebraska. I mean I watched Oklahoma ahead of time and we didn't
prep for Oklahoma. And just to come out in the box and one, it is not who we
are.  
We did a decent job and still had possessions in the first half and they got
us on the baseline in the second half. We just said let's be who we are.
Guard, try to turn only people over and get some opportunities in transition
and that's where we make the run in the first half. So she does, because just
she is spaces you and is just beautiful giving Courtney and Ashley more room.
It helps.  
  
Q. Coach, looking for a bright spot in this game, is Aishah Sutherland's
performance one of those and how importance has her progression been for the
team?  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: They are athleticism, she is a skilled athletic kid.
When she competes every day, all the time, every play, she is going to be
very, very good. She is a work in progress like we are and it is a tough
situation for a freshman to have to battle probably the best post tandem in
the country, I think. And at times she did a good job and there are things she
can learn from. She is a talented kid. Her ceiling is really, really high.  
  
Q. Bonnie, talk about what they're running in the second half when they
pulled away from you guys.  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: They go inside, Courtney, and were trying to force
the middle pivot because baseline we can't bring any help. And first half,
Whitney Hand had high ball side so that you can't dig off her. And she keeps
going baseline. And we try to force the middle and not getting pressure on the
ball and she just goes one-on-one inside of us.  
And we turn it over, points off turnovers, and we start to get sloppy with the
ball. Now it is two on one, one on nobody, and we really don't ever do a great
job against the 1-3-1. I think maybe score one side of it but it is a
combination of, you know, if you get back in the game you have to be able to
get stops. We went through a stretch where we didn't get stops and we didn't
score. And the sense of urgency and then obviously roar' not to the free-throw
line because we are not playing in the paint.  
  
Q. Hey, coach. If I am a committee member you want in my tournament, tell me
the good things about Kansas and why the Jayhawks should be in this year's
tournament.  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: I think if you look at the RPI from yesterday it was
at 50. It jumped with some teams in the Big 10 that are under consideration.
And with this, I don't know where it will go to, Larry Keating is the RPI
expert so I need to talk to him on the bus ride home. But we should be
somewhere in the 40's. How we finish down the stretch, beating Baylor, beating
Iowa State, winning at Oklahoma State, beating Nebraska here. As I told the
kids at one point we have to try to cut the lead and make it respectful and
don't let it get away. They got frustrated and we made some bad decisions and
you hate to do that as a coach. And if we're not go to win this thing we have
to try to close the gap. And play the numbers there a little bit.  
But I think for us, in a league that is so strong, I think your conference
affiliation but what we have done down the stretch, too, I think gives us an
opportunity to be at the table.  
  
Q. Any further questions for coach?  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: I wish you were a committee member.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much and good luck.  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: Thank you.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Texas A&M  65  
Kansas State Wildcats - 63

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Coach Patterson and the wildcats from Kansas
State. Coach, your thoughts on this afternoon's game.  
COACH DEB PATTERSON: Well, we certainly saw, I think, three of the best post
players in the country today line up and just play tremendous basketball,
starting with Marlies Gipson and Danielle Gant. Just absolutely unbelievable.
Big-time plays during the course of that game by both of those two. And both
of them I thought were just absolutely huge in keeping their basketball teams
competitive. Every possession of the game on both ends.  
And Shalee Lehning, I thought just for us, did a tremendous job keeping us in
offense, distributing the ball, giving us opportunities on an inside and
outside, and unfortunately for us today, we weren't able to drop down the
3-ball and that intensified the game for us on the inside even more. So the
scores that we saw from Ashley Sweat and Marlies Gipson to me were even more
incredible because we really weren't getting that 3-ball to drop for us. And
so, they were scoring with one and two on them most of the night, as was Gant.
She draws a great deal of attention defensively. And really asserted herself
big-time on the boards late in the game.  
But just a great Big 12 basketball game. A tremendous effort by our basketball
team. And you know, again, very much deja vu, the last-second shot that I
think all of us felt was in, you know, popped out. So, you have to be glad you
got the look and great, great play by our basketball team in a scramble
situation to complete the position out and get a quality shot. And
unfortunately for us, it didn't drop.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Shalee, can you kind of compare the last see Wednesday consequence to the
sequence that coach Patterson mentioned last year against Iowa state? Did you
feel that karma owed you guys a good bounce on the last shot this time?  
SHALEE LEHNING: Yeah, I mean it was the exact same emotions, you know. Running
down thinking, you know, we have got to get a shot off. The and the ball got
knocked loose. It was running all over the floor. And when I saw that I had
the ball and Ashley was there open, I mean I wouldn't want anybody taking that
shot, the four-foot shot than her. She makes those continually on a normal
basis. So we got a great look, and I'm telling you, her shots always seem to
hit that back rim in practice and they always fall. In practice they always
hit the back rim and fall. And it was one of those, yeah, I thought it was
going in. The same emotions. It hits and you're like, oh, my gosh, this is
great. And it rolls out. At some point it will fall away, the ball will go in,
and we are just waiting for that day. We just have to keep fighting.  
  
Q. This is for both Shalee and Marlies. It seemed like to me -- it seemed
like for a while in the first half you were taking off, and Marlies it seemed
like you took over the second half. Did it feel like to you guys, that you
owned your irrespective halves?  
SHALEE LEHNING: I think you take what you are given. The first half, on balls
and everything, things were opening up for me. And the second half they
adjusted to stop that and things opened up for her. And that's what makes us a
dangerous duo. If we both play our game and play to our strengths you have to
try to stop one of us. It is unreal to play with her. She makes my job a lot
easier. If they try to stop her, things open up for me.  
MARLIES GIPSON: And Shalee, she is a great point guard and play maker out
there. I know when she has the ball, she will make something happen. And my
teammates did a great job of finding me and there was just a great team fight.  
  
Q. Marlies, what was A &M not doing I guess in guarding you in that second
half? I mean tell my the different things that you saw coming from them to
stop you.   
MARLIES GIPSON: I mean, we were all just fighting out there. And I mean I
don't know, I can't say what they weren't doing, but it was just a matter of
team play and we were just finding the open person. And I mean it just
happened to be me and I am just glad my teammates have enough confidence on me
to get the ball inside and they were falling for me, so.  
  
Q. I guess, Marlies and Shalee, if you can both talk about this. I have a
feeling that everybody in the building knew that Danielle Gant would have the
ball in her hands when they called that time-out. Having faced her so much,
can you just tell how tough it is, even though you know she will have the
ball, how tough it is to stop her? You played good defense and she still had
such --  
MARLIES GIPSON: Danielle Gant, is a great player, I mean a great competitor,
and I consider it a blessing to line up against her and play against her for
these four years. And yeah, we knew she was going to take the shot, and the
great player she is, she stepped up and knocked it down.  
SHALEE LEHNING: That's what good players do. Good players find ways to make it
in the crunch time, and that's exactly what she did. We knew it was going to
her, and she still managed to find a way to score. So, all credit go to her,
she made a tough shot.  
  
Q. For either player. Can you just talk about how the strength and
competitiveness of the Big 12 has prepared you now for the NCAA tournament?  
SHALEE LEHNING: You know, I think that the Big 12 has just provided so many
different match-ups for us. Top to bottom, any given night it was anybody's
game. So for us, to know we played a top 10 team like tonight, as well as we
did, I just don't know if there are a lot of teams in the nation that can
defend quite like A&M.  
So for us, we are going in with a lot of confidence because we had to play any
given tight. You have Iowa State that shoots the threes, and A&M that is
really physical. So for us, we are definitely very happy with the progress
that we've made, and at this point we seem to be getting better towards the
end of the season, and that's where we're going to carry confidence into the
NCAA.  
  
Q. Marlies, do you want to comment?  
MARLIES GIPSON: She got it.  
  
Q. Shalee, I know you haven't talked very much about this, but Danielle Gant
said the difference in this game was you were obviously still feeling the
effects of Mono the last time you played and how different it was. Can you
just tell us how do you feel now? How much different?  
SHALEE LEHNING: I do feel much better than -- you know, A&M was really the
first game back since I got diagnosed with mono, it was a really rough game
for me. I get better each day and I consider it a blessing to be able to
finish out my senior season and I am glad I will be able to step on the floor.
At this point it is do or die time and I will not let this illness slow me
down anymore. I made up my mind I will play and finish it out and it hasn't
been affecting me the way it did self weeks ago.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies. Congratulations on a great season. Questions for
Coach? Well, we got a question on the aisle and then we will move to the
outside.  
  
Q. Was there any thought after Gant made her basket of calling a time-out
instead of a play? Or did you just kind of want to keep going and go through
the flow of the offense?  
COACH DEB PATTERSON: We had a time-out prior, so we already had our play calls
set. And ran what we had intended to run. So, really we had that opportunity
before the possession in which they scored.  
And I think what's challenging is, you have a great player like Gant who is
stepping up late in the game and making great plays, but the reality is, Texas
A&M has matured into a team offensively that if you give them an opportunity
by throwing two at somebody at just the wrong time and the wrong place,
they're going to, you know, crush you with the three.  
So, the three that Colson hit, when we had the lead, you know, those are big
plays that they're making, that great teams make. And so, Gant is a great big-
time player who steps up big. But those other players put a lot of pressure on
your defense as well. Coming up the floor, we already had our play call set.  
  
Q. Coach, yesterday you said this was going to be a huge challenge. It
seemed to me that you met that challenge. Number one, do you agree? And number
two, what does that say about your team that two weeks ago it was night and
day to what we saw tonight?  
COACH DEB PATTERSON: Well, it is just a compliment to their toughness and
resiliency. It is a senior-led group that as you can see when you interview
these two, in Sweat -- excuse me, in Lehning and Gipson, that you have two
very, very mature players. And mature personalities. And they're great
competitors with a disposition about and a commitment to winning.  
And we have continued to get better. I am very proud of their fight. We went
through a little rough spot in late February and then they got themselves on
track. They're a team that had to make a lot of adjustments in losing their
point guard for a period of time, and everybody tried to step up and adjust.
And I just think it's just very typical of their character, it's typical of
the great leadership that we have for them to have bounced back and to be
playing great basketball. I'm proud of the effort and the fight that they
brought to this game and really the quality of game that they brought to the
floor today.  
I think the game was in question down to the final possession, and that's how
you want it to be when you're playing a top 10 team. And that's what our kids
brought to the floor. So, it's just a real credit to them, and especially to
those two, to Gibson and Lehning, that are just relentless competitors and
great, great people and leaders.  
  
Q. Deb, Gary Blair kind of brought out this theory, so don't kill the
messenger. But he said that if if you guys had gone on to play four games in
four days, it may have affected how you played in the NCAA tournament just
based on your depth. Is it in any way a blessing in disguise? Now that you can
go back and rest? I know that you wanted to win the title, but.  
COACH DEB PATTERSON: Well, you know, you have to take the good from whatever
situation you're faced with. And I think our players are really good at that.
I think, obviously, it's hard for us to accept that we don't get an
opportunity to play O.U. tomorrow, but it will certainly give us an
opportunity for rest. At this point in the season, I am not sure that any of
us really want to rest, you know, but it is probably prudent that we look at
it that way. And maybe that is the silver lining. But it remains to be seen,
you know. It definitely would have been a push for our kids.  
You could see how dependent we are on that core group of five. You could even
see it in this tournament. But, we would have liked to have had the chance to
test it out, I think. And if the silver lining is that we were able to spare
ourselves, you know, some extra rest and if it makes us better in the NCAA
tournament, then that's fantastic. But, we'll just see how that plays out.  
  
Q. On that question, you also start thinking about seeding now, where you
might like to go in the tournament. Where do you think you guys fall in the
realm of seeds in the tournament?  
COACH DEB PATTERSON: I honestly have no idea and I really haven't thought
about it much. I think I will say this in a general sense. That I think every
team in the Big 12 that is selected to the NCAA is a legitimate, you know, top
four or five seed, hands down. This league is unbelievably filled with power
and talent, and everybody's played tremendous schedules. So, I would think in
the big picture, in the big scope of this league, that we would all fall
somewhere between the first and fifth seeds, I would hope.  
THE MODERATOR: We have time for one further question for coach. Coach, they
let you off easy. Best of luck to you the rest of the season, Coach.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2009

  

### [Ashley Gayle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19498)

### [Gail Goestenkors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14259)

### [Brittainey Raven](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18078)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Iowa State Cyclones  59  
Texas Longhorns - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Longhorns from the University of Texas.
Coach, your thoughts about tonight's game.  
COACH GAIL GOESTENKORS: I don't know that you really want to know my thoughts.
[Laughter].  
It was rough. Congratulations to Iowa State. Have they played really
tremendous team basketball.  
You know, they really rose to the occasion. I know it was tough for them with
Ezell out, but I thought they just did a tremendous job. Alison Lacey
basically put them on her shoulders and said: We will not lose this game. And
that's what happened.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we start with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Brittainey, when you are in a game like that, 17 lead changes, and the
other team up by more than four points till right there at the end, do you
every get comfortable in a game like that?  
BRITTAINEY RAVEN: You have to take advantage of every position. You can't have
empty possessions, turning the ball over. Every defensive possession you have
to get a stop and you have to come down and execute on offense. And for us,
unfortunately, we had a turnover and a couple of quick shots towards the end
of game and it really hurt us.  
  
Q. Brittainey, talk about struggling in the first half, and then trying to
overcome in the second half of the game.  
BRITTAINEY RAVEN: That's been the story with us all year. The first half we
come out slow, and the second half we immediately pick it up. And in some
games it might be a little too late. You have to come out with the same fire
and intensity in every game.  
  
Q. Brittainey, can you talk about the play at the end where you had the
baseline and the shot got blocked. Did you see the girl? What were your
thoughts on that play?  
BRITTAINEY RAVEN: I was doing my best to focus on making the basket. There
were two people on me, so one of my teammates was open and I probably could
have kicked it out to somebody.  
  
Q. Ashley, you played a great game defensively, like 9 rebounds and 3
blocks. How frustrating it is it to know you brought that energy off the bench
and it still didn't happen tonight?  
ASHLEY GAYLE: It's frustrated, but I just know that I have to bring the energy
every game and not just for tonight.  
  
Q. Ashley, coming off the bench and all, stepping out, just talk about what
it was to balance down inside, especially in the second half going down the
stretch.  
ASHLEY GAYLE: Coach just told me to rebound, so I knew it was going to be a
battle. It was a battle last time we played them, so I just knew as a team we
had to go hard to the boards and box out and just play with a lot of heart.  
  
Q. Brittainey, can you talk about what losing Carla -- looked like she went
down with an injury and came back up again. What did it do to your offense?  
BRITTAINEY RAVEN: Carla runs our team, and when she is in, I think everybody
feels comfortable. To have her out we knew things would be different on the
floor, but that's no excuse. Other people need to step up. We all need to step
up and fill in for her. And unfortunately, we didn't do it the entire game.
There were some plays, but we needed to do it the whole game.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for our student-athletes.  
Okay, ladies, we are going to let you go. Best of luck to you in the NCAA.  
Coach, we'll let you take some questions now, if you don't mind. We will start
over on the left-hand side in the middle and then we'll move to the front.  
  
Q. Gail, two questions. How is Carla? And secondly, was Stuckey about the
last person in the world you expected to shoot a three?  
COACH GAIL GOESTENKORS: Yeah, Carla, she hurt her index finger in the last
game. She fractured it in three places. So, she didn't practice with us today,
and we weren't sure if she was going to play. But she wanted to try, and I
thought she gave a valiant effort. But then, she hit it during the game again,
and she was just in a lot of pain. So I didn't feel comfortable putting her
back in the game. And, you know, when Stuckey hit that shot, it's, you know, I
thought oh, no. [Laughter] It's their night. You know, that's just how it
felt. Because she doesn't shoot the three. She's not a great shooter, she is a
great competitor though. And sometimes when you are a great competitor, you
make those shots.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about losing a player that runs your offense and then having
to make the adjustment on the fly. As far as team, and as players.  
COACH GAIL GOESTENKORS: Yeah, I think, like Brittainey said, Carla, she runs
the show for us. So, when she's not out there, you know, we had two freshman.
Yvonne had a key turnover, you know, towards the end of the game at that point
position, and so did Ashleigh Fontenette had a traveling call. Those are
pressure situations. They both played great. I am very proud of the way they
played, especially on the defensive end. And they had the attack mindset, but
it was putting freshman in a tough situation, in a pressure situation, and at
times I thought they played like freshman. You just would prefer to have your
senior point guard out there.  
  
Q. Coach, your team didn't shoot real great in the first half. Did you think
that was something that would turn around? Or did you talk about that at
halftime at all?  
COACH GAIL GOESTENKORS: Yeah, we did. We talked about it. And once again we
were pressing, shooting too quick. The goal was to have two ball reversals
before we took a shoot, and that never happened. And again, we had one assist
at halftime and that's just not the kind of basketball that is very pretty.
It's not the kind of basketball I like to play. And we're just not very good
when we're not sharing the basketball.  
So the second half I thought you saw a different team, especially at the start
of the second half. We moved the ball, we went inside out, reversed it. And
then we got shooters in their rhythm and it was much better. So, I told the
team after the game, I said everything we need to work on are things we have
control over. Moving the basketball, sharing the basketball, setting better
screens. Little things that really make a big difference in big games.  
  
Q. Gail, how concerned are you about confidence at this point heading into
the tournament with the recent losses that you've had?  
COACH GAIL GOESTENKORS: Yeah, well, most of our losses have been to ranked
teams, so it's not like we've had bad losses. We haven't. But confidence
probably is an issue. I'm glad we had several days now to just really get back
to basics. And I think when you work hard and you work on the little things, I
think you can get your confidence back, even if it's during practice.  
  
Q. First of all, is Carla going to be back for the tournament? And second of
all, how do you regenerate the momentum going into the tournament after, you
know, you played a rough schedule the last two or three weeks?  
COACH GAIL GOESTENKORS: Right. I think -- yes, Carla will be back. Like I
said, I could have put her back in tonight, I just didn't feel comfortable
with it because of the pain she was in. She will definitely be ready for the
NCAA tournament.  
And then generating that momentum again, I think the thing we feel good about
and I will reiterate to the team is that we played one of the toughest
schedules in the nation. We are ready for anything that we may face, whether
it's a team like Iowa State that just can really spread you out and hit the
three, or a big, physical, very physical team like A&M or a team like Oklahoma
who's got the inside, the outside and the Paris twins. I don't think we'll see
anything that will surprise us or anything that we cannot be prepared for.  
  
Q. Hi, Gail. You know, you coached your own Aussie shooter, Jeff Foley, for
a few years back. Can you expand a little more on Lacey and especially for her
to come up on a night like this when she doesn't have Ezell out there?  
COACH GAIL GOESTENKORS: Yeah. I mean, like I said, she put this team on her
shoulders. She was so focused and motivated. And she made us pay for every
single mistake we made on the defensive end. And I think I need to go to
Australia and begin recruiting again.  
  
Q. Continuing on the positive note, you have to be excited, somewhat, with
the rebounding tonight. You talked about that all season. You finished with 15
offensive rebounds for this game.  
COACH GAIL GOESTENKORS: We're getting better with our rebounding. I think we
got out rebounded last night by one but the game before we rebounded Oklahoma,
which does not happen. People just don't out rebound them. Two of the last
three games I think we have done a good job on the boards. That's an area that
we have really been focused on. Now we will focus on our shooting and maybe
that will help.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your comments. Best of luck in the NCAA.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2009

  

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

### [Courtney Paris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13851)

### [Amanda Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19485)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We are now joined by the seniors from Oklahoma and Coach
Coale and her senior athletes. Coach, your comments about this afternoon's win
and Congratulations.  
COACH COALE: I thought we found off a really hungry and scrappy Kansas team. I
thought they really played with a purpose and played extremely well in the
first half, particular well in the second half. Our bench was a story. They
were just terrific. Everybody from Jasmine Hartman all the way through the
guards down to Abi Olajuwon at the post. Everybody who came in contributed,
and we talked all year about that becoming a strength of our team and it
certainly has paid off today in the first round.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Coach, thank you for your comments. A question on the
right-hand side.  
  
Q. Courtney, talk a little bit about your game today. I think you had a
block on the first attempted shot that really seemed to set a tone and you
just seemed to carry that out through the rest of the game.  
COURTNEY PARIS: I just am ready to play. It is postseason. Every game is that
much more important, because if you lose it you don't get to play again. So I
was just really feeling it today and I wanted to come out and make sure I did
the best I could.  
  
Q. Amanda, we've often talked about your shooting ability. That you are
probably so unselfish; a lot of times you pass up shots. But it looked like
today you decided you're going to take your shots and you had a great game.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: Well, I just found the ball and I was open a couple of
possessions and I took advantage of those opportunities. And the ball went in
today, so I kept going with it.  
  
Q. Ladies, would you address waiting all this time to finally play, watching
all the other men's games and the women's games and what's that's been like?  
COURTNEY PARIS: It's been a lot of fun, everybody loves watching baseball.
Especially the game last night with Syracuse and UConn.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: We were in bed by that time, the highlight. You know, I love
playing with these girls and for me personally it is my last year and I don't
get another shot. So I was just ready to get out there and go, and like you
said watching all the other teams play made us that much more pumped up.  
  
Q. Courtney, could you talk about how much better this feels right now than
a year ago? And how much better do you think you guys are playing than a year
ago in the first game of the Big 12?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think it is a complete turn-around. Last year, like you
said, we were -- didn't even make it to this tournament last year. But, you
know, with that said I feel like last year helped us get to it point and we
just learned from that season. I didn't want to be back in that situation, so
sometimes you get, you know, short-comings but you can make something out of
it.  
  
Q. Amanda, talk about that, too, what you think.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: It gave us an opportunity to build chemistry and come
together. And I think that's one of the key points of us coming this far in
the season, is just chemistry and sticking together. And just fighting the
whole time. We have a lot of fight in our team and it keeps us together.  
  
Q. Courtney or Amanda, either one of you. With the number one and two seeds
in the men's tournament across the street going down yesterday, was that on
your all minds at all?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: Nah, the guys are different than the girls. I don't want to
focus what is going on there, we are trying to stay in our bubble. As long as
we are focused we survive an event.  
  
Q. Amanda, for what a number of you did today, can you talk a little bit
about what it was like to have Courtney soaring 27 and grabbing a bunch of
boards and blocking six shots and what it meant for you as a team.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: It built our confidence unbelievably. I knew if I would pass
her the ball, she would get it in the basket or find me or find any another
shooter that was open. She was outstanding today, and I just hope it keeps
going.  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think the reason I am able to have a game like that, right
off the bat, Amanda comes out and knocks down some big shots. And they have to
single coverage us and I love that. So It all worked out.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies we will let you return to the locker room and then we'll
take questions for Coach. Congratulations and good luck tomorrow.  
  
Q. Sherri, Courtney seemed almost like possessed in the first half. Talk
about her game.  
COACH COALE: She is a driven individual, as we all know, and she understand
clearly what time of year it is. And I think great players sense that. I think
all seniors sense it to a certain degree. But I think the really great players
get that in a way maybe the rest of the world doesn't. She established herself
early and was just terrific the entire game from both ends of the floor. It
wasn't just scoring the points. Defensively affecting their ability to get to
the rim, limiting second shots. All kinds of stuff. Emphatic blocks. Blocks
that take momentum if it happens to be sitting anywhere other than your bench
and puts it firmly in the middle of your bench.  
  
Q. Sherri, if you can draw it up, was this game about what you would want to
get in the first game in the tournament when you win, you win fairly big. And
you get to rest your starters considering you know it's going to be a very
tough road to win the next two games?  
COACH COALE: I did love the way it played out. I loved the fact we got so much
juice from our guys off the guys on the bench that a lot of people
contributed. And at the end of the day everybody feels good going into the
second round. I know we look at this line and say Whitney played 20 minutes
and didn't score and only got two shots up. But understand that one of the
reasons Courtney Paris got 27 points and had single coverage is because
somebody was following Whitney everywhere she went on the floor. Even though
it is not reflected in the statistical category, she had a huge impact on the
game and the way that Kansas defended us today.  
I thought it was a complete effort. Good for us to really feel challenged in
the first half and to not have it out of hand at that point and to have to
play through it and create some good things for ourselves. So, all in all a
good morning. Is it lunchtime yet? I am starving.  
  
Q. Sherri, what is the biggest difference, the way you're playing now and
the way you were playing that first game last year?  
COACH COALE: I don't know. I can't even -- I can't even compare the two. Every
season is a lifetime in and of itself. And even if you have an entire team
that turns around and plays and it's your entire team the next year is
different, because the experiences are different. Kids grow and they change
and the relationships change.  
What I like about this team and where we are right now, Amanda mentioned it,
we have sight. We have tremendous chemistry. These guys play for each other,
and that's almost like getting to play with an extra guy on the floor.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that game before [Inaudible]?  
COACH COALE: No. That game, I have a lot of questions about that and I think
it's interesting. That game in the first round of the Big 12 tournament last
year fueled the way we played in the NCAA's and fueled the way we worked in it
the spring and the summer. It is so far gone now it is not even a topic of
thought or conversation.  
  
Q. Coach, just talk about how much better your ball club is when you get so
many good minutes from various different players off the bench and in your
starting line-up.  
COACH COALE: Well, obviously it makes us very difficult to defend. Any type of
junk or double teaming, whether it is on the post or a shooter, gets squelched
quickly like when A.T. comes out and makes the jumpers and Jenny Vining comes
in and does what she does.  
And you can't talk about the bench without talking about Jasmine Hartman. For
a true freshman in her first Big 12 tournament coming off the bench, she had
all kinds of swagger. This is a kid that had to play big minutes against
Oklahoma State when D. Robb went down to foul trouble and she's guarding
Andrea Riley and you think a freshman may be taken back by that. And she loved
it. She loved it. The greater the stage, the greater the challenge, the more
this kid likes it. She is full of courage and I love that and I like coaching
that.  
But I just think having those weapons, you know, it wears the other team down.
They keep going to a couple of guys over and over and over. But in the last 10
minutes of the game those guys are exhausted and we are able to keep fresh
guys in and different people contributing, it makes us really difficult to
defend.  
  
Q. Coach, you are on the tournament clock now. Would you describe what that
chronology is for your players. Do you let them watch the next game? Do you
rest them? Do you watch the next game? Who watches film? Do they goof off? Do
they watch any mens' games? What happens in the next 20 hours or so?  
COACH COALE: I go get a hamburger immediately if not sooner. We will watch a
little bit, and then not a lot of could having around, laying around at the
hotel. Shaking off the legs a little bit. We have an unbelievable training
staff. They will be in hot and cold contrast bath and taking care of the
bodies. They will be all over that. And already have an assistant coach
assigned to the scout depending on who wins. Each one has a different team in
the game that follows. And tonight we will go out and have some great food and
follow the scores and watch some games on TV and get to bed early and get up
at the crack of dawn and do this again.  
  
Q. Sherri, Danielle had her thumb taped up. What is up with that?  
COACH COALE: Just in the Texas game, just hurt it a little bit and just keeps
it taped, that's it.  
  
Q. I don't want to delay your lunch, but I do want to ask you about the
defensive effort of Thompson. And then, also, the boost that Stevenson gives.
It didn't seem that Danielle McCray got a peaceful look at the basket all
afternoon. A lot of it was those two.  
COACH COALE: Yes. McCray earned every point she got. I thought she was
fantastic and I told her so after the game. We didn't give her easy baskets
and still she scored what, 22.  
Amanda did a great job and so did [our Biggs]. We were trapping the ball
screen when McCray received one. And that's -- A.T. has to make her use it,
which in my opinion McCray's forte is setting you up to think she is using it
and then goes the other direction. So that was a big job in and of itself.
Whether it be Ashley or Courtney or whomever had the responsibility of jumping
out and trapping her, it was a team effort in trying to limit her looks. I
thought Jenny Vining likewise did a great job on Sade and trying to get
through all those screens. Just screens and screens and screens you, and you
have to be consistent in your effort to follow those. Also our help from the
point position, whether it is Danielle or Jasmine, did a great job of
recognizing, oh, we're a step behind or we slipped and would go over and give
both Sade and McCray some trouble and make them get off the ball.  
Really, while Amanda was fantastic and I don't want to take it away from her,
or Nye, it was really a team effort in guarding those two guys.  
  
Q. Coach, Courtney mentioned a couple of times the idea that if you lose a
game, it's all over, the world comes to an end. At this time of the season, do
you maybe worry a little bit about getting too much focus on that? Or just the
fact that you have been through this so much kind of make that pressure a good
thing?  
COACH COALE: I am going to answer your question, but my do you have a radio
voice. You don't even have to tell us that you are with National Radio. Hello,
right there.  
You know what? I always said this -- my guys are smart. They get it. I am not
going to go in and pretend anything or downplay anything. I would be foolish
to do that. They get it. They understand. Sometimes too well.  
I told somebody the other day, the problem with us is when we're not good, we
know how not good we are. And that's the problem. Some guys are not very good
and they think they are, and they can buffalo you for awhile. Not us. We know.  
These guys understand. These seniors know post-season and what it means and
that it's one-and-done and you have to win to advance. And in the locker room
after the Texas game the kids had written on the board "We've played to win,
and now we have to win to play." And that was before I even got in there. So
it doesn't really matter what I am talking about, they are already a step
ahead.  
  
Q. Sherri, you went through the mock selection draft with the NCAA
committee. With the team like Kansas that's won five of it's last six, but
maybe their other numbers don't add up, but knowing the quality of team they
are, how does that fit into the discussion about NCAA tournaments?  
COACH COALE: It won't be a big part of the discussion, I can promise you that.
How teams play down the stretch is important.  
Who they are playing, when they are playing well down the stretch, the
committee will look at this game even though Kansas lost. And they will have
the little eye test, you know. Well, this player is pretty good and this
player is pretty good. Now, to back all that up, it's going have to be a an
RPI number and the strength of schedule and there have to be some numerical
backing for that. But the way Kansas has played in the last three weeks of the
season, they have given themselves a shot. They are in the conversation.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay coach, Congratulations on the game, and we will see you
tomorrow. And good luck.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2009

  

### [Kurt Budke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14197)

### [Andrea Riley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16924)

### [Shaunte Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18174)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Baylor  67  
Oklahoma State - 62

  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Cowgirls from Oklahoma State. And
Coach Budke. Coach, your comments about the game.  
COACH KURT BUDKE: Well, I think you saw today kind of what we've done all year
long. I think we have the ability to play with anybody for 25, 30 minutes.
And, I think we can scare anybody out there, I really do.  
I was proud of the kids, proud how they came back. What you might have seen a
little bit of, is having to play yesterday, and fresh legs at the end of the
game versus a team that played yesterday. And but that's part of it. You are
in what you get. And if you are in the bye, we had the bye last year and it
paid off for us last year. But, I'm really proud of the kids. There is no quit
in them. And, you know, I am excited about any future play we might have this
year if we get to go to the NIT.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach, thank you. We'll take questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Andrea, tough shooting night obviously for your team in the second half.
Was that Baylor's defense? Or were you guys just not making shots?  
ANDREA RILEY: I think it was kind of both. I think that we had opportunities,
a lot of opportunities to, you know, run away with the game. But, sometimes
the ball just doesn't go in the basket. And even if you're like getting down
and playing defense, I mean sometimes the ball just doesn't go in. And it just
doesn't go your way. And I think that Baylor's defense is tough to face,
because they are very long and they are athletic.  
  
Q. Shaunte', after last year where you guys went -- there were such
expectations for this. How do you view this game? Where do you go from here
now?  
SHAUNTE' SMITH: We played really hard throughout the game. And you know, we
just took the number 17 in the country down to the wire. You know, we can't go
anywhere but up. I mean, we just have to build on this and take it into the
NIT and hopefully win a championship, so the players next year can build off
that and have a great season.  
  
Q. Shaunte', unleashed some qualities in some games in the WNIT, but the
push just came to do what you guys did last year, to come into the program,
knowing where it was and where it is as you're getting close to leaving. How
much satisfaction do you take out of that and knowing where this program is
now compared to when you first arrived?  
SHAUNTE' SMITH: I am very happy with where I am at now and what all I
accomplished with this team. And I couldn't have done it without my teammates
without these four years. And I always said this, that I have gone to the
Sweet 16, and went to a championship game last year, and now just playing in
front of my hometown for my senior year. And now going into the post-season
and to extend it, I am just, you know, excited and I am ready to play more.  
  
Q. Shaunte' this is probably inconsequential. But you know, you took first
place in career starts. What's that mean to you?  
COACH KURT BUDKE: She has been around a long time.  
SHAUNTE' SMITH: I have been around a long time [laughter]. It doesn't really
-- it just shows how hard I worked I guess throughout these four years. And I
had fun and I'm glad I could have did that here at Oklahoma State.  
  
Q. Andrea, how much difference did you notice this year as far as last year
when you guys come up out of nowhere? It seems like there is a little more
length to the lane. This year it looks like everybody geared to top you from
the get-go. How much difference do you notice on defense this year compared to
last year?  
ANDREA RILEY: Everybody worked hard on defensive pressure, so I mean, I don't
really see too many differences. Because I mean, like at the same time -- I
can't explain it. It's just not different to me. I think everybody is just
playing the same defense, it is just more effective at times.  
  
Q. Andrea, talk about the charge. It looked like you did a pretty good job
of pulling up to avoid contact, but she went down anyway. Talk a little bit
that.  
ANDREA RILEY: I think the referee made the correct call, you know, so. We
didn't really want a charge, but sometimes that just happens and you got have
to learn from it and try to do something different the next time.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for our student-athletes?  
Okay ladies, we will let you return to your locker room and we'll take our
first question for Coach Budke on the front row.  
  
Q. Coach, Megan had just taken a charge on the other end. Which, you know,
they kind of rallied around their player who got called for the charge. It
looked like hey, maybe you guys were even going to finish this thing off and
then Riley gets called for the charge on the other end. Talk about those two
plays.  
COACH KURT BUDKE: This call could have went either way. And obviously just a
judgment call. Andrea does a good job of avoiding contact. And you know, at
the time we, we shot what, 16% in the second half? I mean we were needing a
bucket. We were needing points. We were needing a bucket right then. And, it
just goes back to what we were doing all year long. I mean yesterday, look
what we did yesterday, the same thing. One bad half, one great half. Today,
the great half was the first half.  
And you know, go to Mike's question a little bit with Andrea, they are not
guarding her any different. She just has two less weapons than she had last
year. We graduated two very good weapons last year in a year. It wasn't a good
year to graduate people because no one else did. So, it's really, I think
they're guarded her really the same way. It's just, you know, we just come up
a little short.  
  
Q. You talked about being so close but yet so far. But you're up 15 with
about 15 minutes to go and then it turns into a free-throw contest and they
hit 15-16 down the stretch. I mean, how did you really do the way this played
out when were you in position to win?  
COACH KURT BUDKE: I think they did a good job of catching and driving and
putting more pressure on us and stopping us in penetration. And that goes to
where fresh legs, not fresh legs. We had to do a better job of not fouling.
And giving credit for hitting their free throws, but we hit ours tonight, too.
And they just changed. They went little. Went four guards and a post and
decided to start driving the ball and it got them back in the game.  
  
Q. Two-part question. Are you coaching too many games, three made shots in a
half, one. And B, given everything that happened, disappointed through 31
games, or have you gotten about all you thought you would get out of this team
through 31 games?  
COACH KURT BUDKE: The first part, I honestly can't remember in 25 years making
three shots and that doesn't happen very often. What happens is the defense
suffers or the rebound suffers. It is hard for these kids to maintain -- they
are not pros -- to maintain that focus. There are disappointments on the
offensive end. And you have to play again, defense, defense, defense. And you
need the reward down here every once in a while and we just didn't get that.  
And everybody talking about expectations, you know, we go back to 26 of the
top 30 scores are back and two of the four lost were ours. I really didn't
know where we fit into this thing. We can go back on five or six games where
we had a chance to win and one of the seniors took us over the top last year
and just didn't do it.  
We lost eight games to top 10 teams. Eight. And lost 11 or 12 games to top 20
teams. So we didn't play a bad schedule or anything. We just have a lot of
great teams in this conference. And you know, we just -- you got to just come
back and continue to try to build. We have six great freshman coming in next
year that we really like and four juniors committed behind that. We think
we're starting to build a base here for the future for the long run.  
  
Q. Coach, even when you don't have offense, you still have to fall back on
defense. During that stretch, they stayed in the game. Let's talk about what
Andrea and Shaunte' did to hold the team together.  
COACH KURT BUDKE: I just thought we had great leadership. I would love to
check the stats again. I can't believe Shaunte' Smith only got 10 rebounds.
And to me, I thought she had 15 or 20 out there. Her leadership and intensity,
she played 40 minutes the night before. I got her out for what, a minute
tonight? Shaunte' -- 38 minutes tonight.  
I think the leadership on the defensive end of one position at a time I
thought was pretty good. It's not that Baylor shot a great percentage. I mean,
I see a 3-16, a 5-18, so I thought defensively was pretty good. But give them
credit for attacking us on the dribble and getting to the free-throw line.  
  
Q. Coach, the time-out with two seconds left, did you find that odd at
all?  
COACH KURT BUDKE: [Laughter]. You know, it was a -- I was wondering about that
a little bit, but I have been known to draw up a five-point play with seconds
to go. It probably was a good time-out. I guess as coaches we take nothing for
granted, so you never know, maybe we could have done something.  
THE MODERATOR: Any follow-up questions for Coach? Okay, Coach, thanks for your
comments.  
COACH KURT BUDKE: Thank you all.

### [Bill Fennelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13850)

### [Alison Lacey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16959)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Iowa State Cyclones  59  
Texas Longhorns - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Fennelly, Congratulations on the big win. An opening
comment or two.  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: Certainly a very proud moment for our team, for our
program. We beat a really good team. And like we've done all year, it probably
wasn't the prettiest thing, but an effort that was very, very indicative of
what we have done all season and certainly one we're very proud of. And it's
great to be still playing, and the greatest thing for me is I get to coach
these guys tomorrow. And you know, we'll see what happens tomorrow. But, an
amazing effort. I thought Alison was tremendous, playing the type of game we
needed her to play from start to finish, and found a way to win in a tough
environment against a very, very talented team, a team that will be a great
NCAA representative in the Big 12.  
We're excited about it, and we're looking forward to tomorrow. But, this is a
moment for them to enjoy tonight. This is a moment for the players to enjoy
being in this tournament, being in a great environment and beating a great
team. So that will be their focus and will worry about Baylor when they get up
tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes first.  
  
Q. Alison, with Heather out of the line-up, did you feel you had to step up
offensively and kind of take control of things?  
ALISON LACEY: Yeah. You know, Heather scores 12 points a game, 35 minutes, and
she is emotional and drives our team. A leader out there. Definitely with her
out of the game, I knew I had to step up. But everyone did a good job I think
and we put out a good win against a really good Texas team.  
  
Q. Alison, also, on the play towards the end when you drove and kicked it
out to Stuckey, she's about the most likely candidate to be shooting a three I
understand. But, could you just talk about that play a little bit?  
ALISON LACEY: Yeah, I was driving in and I wasn't open and I saw Denae wide
open. And you know, she shot it and made it, and I didn't hear everybody being
that excited in the game. I was screaming, she was excited. I heard the
coaches were pretty excited on the bench as well. It is great for her to play
well. She is a big part of this win. And to hit that shot is awesome for her.  
  
Q. Kelsey, what did Coach talk to you about at half time? It seems like
things weren't working for you in the first half.  
KELSEY BOLTE: Pretty much the same thing he tells me every half time. He
didn't really come to me at every halftime -- at halftime and tell me that I
need to step up or anything, but I did. You know, I kind of looked around and
I noticed that -- I kind of let my teammates down in the first half and I
wanted to step up for them. And Oz was really carrying the load in the first
half and a lot of the second half, too. And I just wanted to help my teammates
out and step up a little bit.  
  
Q. Kelsey, you had the huge block from behind and then the pass in bounds.
Was that just something you saw? Or was it just a reaction to seeing the ball
right up in the air?  
KELSEY BOLTE: I got beat going to the line, so I think my first reaction was:
Don't let her make a lay-up. And I saved it going out of bounds and I didn't
know who to throw it to. I didn't want them to throw at the basket and have
them get a lay-up, but Oz was open, so I tossed it into her.  
  
Q. Kelsey, talk about the basket that you made in the lane that gave you
guys the lead for good, I think about 57 seconds to go. Kind of the spin move,
what you saw there.  
KELSEY BOLTE: We ran a play, I think, for me to get a three-point shot and I
wasn't open. And they were really hugging up tight on me on the three-point
line. No one else was open and the clock was running down. You know, Coach
really tries to tell us, you know, either pass it to someone who has a shot
and no one really was, so I just tried to make something happen.  
  
Q. Alison, when you're making three-pointers like that, what does the basket
look like?  
ALISON LACEY: I don't know, pretty good, I guess. I don't know, I. Have been
so good, I have been shooting great this year. And Heather has been shooting
well and I had to pick up on my three-point shooting. And luckily they were
going in. It is one of those nights you can't really explain it, it just
happens. I am happy that it happened tonight.  
  
Q. Oz, you played the last game of anybody else in this tournament. Did you
feel a little rust? Or were you tired of sitting and waiting? Or how was
that?  
ALISON LACEY: There has been a lot of sitting and waiting, sitting in our
hotels and watching the games here, and watching people, you know, with the
bye first round, lose in the first game, so we were determined it wasn't going
to be us. So we were ready to come out and play. And once again, we played a
great Texas team and we are happy to get this win.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we will let our student athletes go back to the locker
room. And Coach, we start with the question on the aisle on the left side.  
  
Q. Bill, can you talk about Stuckey's three. Was that one of those no-no-
yes-yes type of moments?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: I would say up until tonight it would have been. But with
Heather out of the game we told Denae if she was open, she had to shoot it.
Certainly, it is one of those plays in these kind of tournament it is keeps
you playing. You know, we're down three, and you know, it's one of those plays
that you don't design it and kids make certain plays. But tonight -- actually
we tried to run the very first play of the game for a three-point shot for
Denae because I wanted her to get it out of her system. They guarded it really
well. I was shocked that they guarded her to be honest with you. But, you
know, it's just one of those things that sometimes instinctively it happens
and she's a competitive kid. And certainly it's not a play that was designed
by the coaches. She made the play, Oz made the play. And a lot of these
tournaments, those kind of things happen. Certainly we were the beneficiary of
it tonight.  
  
Q. Bill, could Heather have played if this was maybe possibly the last game
of the season, first of all? And would she likely not play the rest of this
weekend?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: She could have played, Rick. Probably not very well. It
is her right hand. If this was the last game of the season or a game that we
absolutely felt we had to win to get into the NCAA tournament, she would have
tried to play. We made the decision collectively with the doctors, with
Heather, to not play her. She will not play tomorrow. You know, I'm not going
to try to hide anything from anyone. She's not going to play tomorrow.  
My thing was, and I told her this, she has done so much for our team, so much
for our program. She deserves the right to play as healthy as she can in the
NCAA tournament. So we're going to hole her out until then and I think she
will be fine by the NCAA tournament time.  
And it kills her to do it, but she did a great job on the bench. She looked
like a coach, acted like a coach, and did a great job. But, it's sad that she
couldn't play, but, you know, it's one of those things that she'll be ready to
go hopefully next weekend.  
  
Q. Coach, I think there are 17 lead changes, 8 ties. When you are coaching
in that situation, what do you tell the girls? Because obviously it's -- you
don't ever get a sense of comfort, I suppose.  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: Certainly when you play Texas and you watch what they did
last night, the way they came back, you remember what they did to us at our
place, the way they came back. You know, you have a hall of fame coach on the
other side, lot smarter than I am, so hopefully you are telling the players to
overcome the coaching that they are fighting against I guess.  
The biggest thing is control what you can control. Control your effort, make
plays, value the ball. And that's the number one thing. I just kept saying
shoot the dang thing before you throw it away. And maybe something good
happens. And certainly Denae's shot was something good that happened.  
Our effort was really, really the good last four minutes. I thought way
guarded really hard, really smart. And we missed a couple of rebounds that we
weren't getting. And a we'd got a lot of inbounds play because we kept tipping
it out of bounds.  
The four last minutes, the kids really did a great job of executing what we
wanted them to do and defended as hard as we could defend against a team that
we knew would keep coming at us in ways, and they did.  
  
Q. Coach, with Heather out, it makes minutes from your bench all that much
more important. Especially talk about maybe Whitney Williams who had 18
minutes tonight or maybe some of the other players that gave you great minutes
off the bench.  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: Certainly Denae playing 27 minutes in a starting role and
Whit got 18. And my son who coached Northwestern has been on me and told me
tonight if I play Whitney over 15 minutes, we would win. So I am sure I will
get a call when I get back to the hotel. And Whit did a great job, she made a
stop. Defended pretty well and had a couple of turnovers. Sometimes that
happens. You are getting thrust into a pretty tough situation as a freshman in
the tournament. We got some good minutes from other people on the bench. We
told them Heather placed 35 minutes, we have to make it up somewhere. And I
thought collectively they did that, and certainly did some things to allow us
to have a chance, and that's what you want.  
  
Q. Coach, when do you start thinking about playing Baylor? And how do you
feel you will match up with them?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: We're thinking about it right now. You know, Baylor is an
outstanding team. They beat us pretty good at their place early in the year.
But, the thing, like I said earlier, right now this moment is for our players
to enjoy tonight. We don't talk about Baylor as a team. We'll do that
tomorrow. They need to go back to the hotel and smile and just not -- so much
in sports is, you know, immediately you're thinking: What's next? And
sometimes the players don't get to enjoy this. They will enjoy this.  
But we understand. They're a top 10 team. Another team that's very well
coached, very competitive. A team that has overcome the loss of a great player
to injury. So -- and had a great run in the second half for the game tonight.
Way down and came back and played. Many and you know, it's the sale kind of
team that we saw tonight. Athletic, physical, talented, well coached much we
will have to do some things a little better, especially rebound the ball
better. Bear always kills us on the board but I am happy we have to worry
about it, to be honest with you.  
  
Q. Coach, talk -- I saw you just shaking your head earlier when this
question was asked about, asked to the players about being the last team to
play tonight. And you've had a chance to watch this week, what has happened to
others, the first game in the tournament.  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: No, it was, it was a long week, you know. It's great to
get a bye and play, but we watched a lot of teams play. And you watch a lot of
teams get beat. And you know, we all stayed up and watched the Syracuse-UConn
game and you know, you want to get to playing. The good news is, there's only
five teams left by the time we played, so at least that was the good news.  
But it was a hard week for our kids. We tried to be smart about practice. And
we actually brought them in here early this morning and shot wishing we
normally wouldn't have done at 8:20 this morning, but we had to get them out
of the hotel and let them shoot a little bit. And they handled it great all
day. And then we went back and did our study table and did everything normal
as we could. And luckily, you know, we played hard enough to do the right
things. But it was hard waiting, but certainly it was well worth it.  
  
Q. Bill, for Baylor with Danielle being out with the injury, how does that
change how you guys prepare and go to attack them?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: I don't know, Bobby, if it change as lot. I have been
someone that has been a card-carrying member of the Alison fan club for three
years. I love the way she plays. You saw tonight how physical and competitive
they are. They are going to find it from other places. I don't think there is
any question.  
Danielle is a phenomenal basketball player. And it's tragic what happened to
her. And it's sad for their team and sad for her. But, you don't get to the
point they are with their record with one player.  
So, you know, we'll look at it tonight and try to make some decisions.
Certainly the quick turnaround at 2:30 tomorrow. The good news is -- does
anybody know how the Syracuse men did tonight? The reason I'm asking, if our
players complain about being tired, we will bring that up. I told Oz before
the game: You're playing 40. Jonny from Syracuse went 67, you ought to be able
to play 40. I am sure that will be the scouting report tomorrow, if anybody
complains about being tired.  
We are excited about playing. How can you not be? It is the best conference
tournament in the country, in a great environment. And the Big 12, it is an
honor to be a part of it and we are so excited we get to stay and play another
game.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, see you tomorrow. And best of luck to you.  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: Thank you, everyone. Thanks for being here.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Texas A&M  65  
Kansas State Wildcats - 63

  
COACH GARY BLAIR: A great game for Big 12 basketball. People look and say why
do we play conference tournaments? That's why you play conference tournaments.
The same way what happened in the men's game with Syracuse and Connecticut.
You have championships to win. Okay, a lot of coaches think they're useless, I
think there's an opportunity to get better as a basketball team and improve
your seed. And improve our thinking process as we go.  
We had to use a lot of different parts today. Kansas State in the second half
shot 62% or something like that. Give them a lot of credit. Gipson, I voted
for her first team. I think she is one of the best in it the league. Colson
hitting that big three when we had to have it, and we missed a couple down the
stretch, but. I can't believe Sweat missed the last shot. We defended very
well on the play. The ball rolled loose and we should have sat on the ball.
But, that's all I have to say, Peter .  
Thank you, Gary. That was very nice.  
COACH GARY BLAIR: 48 seconds.  
THE MODERATOR: It was more than a minute and a half, but that's okay. What we
would like to do is confine the questions to the student-athletes first. If
you would, please, identify which student athletes you would like to ask a
question and give them a chance.  
  
Q. Just your thoughts about the thrill of getting the last shot to go in
your hometown. It must be another thrill to come home and do that.  
DANIELLE GANT: I know they were going to play good defense. Coach wanted the
ball in my hands and I could get to the hole. And he wanted Adaora to set the
screen at the I could get to the hole. The last couple of second I knew I had
to score unless we were going to go no overtime and they were going to win the
game.  
  
Q. Talk about being here and how you perform when you're here in your
hometown?  
DANIELLE GANT: I think I perform better. A lot of family and friends that seen
me growing up but never have seen me play at the college level. So just coming
home, playing for family and friends is a great feeling and making that
winning basket is also a great feeling.  
  
Q. You got them pretty good in their home gym a couple weeks ago. They are
national-ranked power. What is the biggest difference today, being back and
forth from the whole second half?  
ADAORA ELONU: The first time we played we were hitting every shot we put up.
And we were -- we had a lot of fast-break points. Today seemed to be more of a
defensive game and slow down a little bit. But we have to execute a little bit
more. And it was just different from the first two games where we did win by
26. We have to fight a little bit more this game.  
DANIELLE GANT: I think the point guard play, she was coming off some kind of
being sick a little bit. I think she came out today with a little fire knowing
the last game she wasn't very healthy, so I think that that was one of the big
keys in the game tonight.  
  
Q. Danielle, talk about the run that K-State made in the second half and
what you all did to get back to finish the game.  
DANIELLE GANT: Well, we have been in this situation before knowing that this
tournament is a great tournament. There are no bad teams in this tournament.
Knowing that every team is going to give it their all. So them pushing the run
a little bit, we know that we should have had a lot of time to come back and
win the game and locked down the defense and executed well on the offensive
end.  
  
Q. Can both you talk about Sooners up next. You've had some classic battles,
almost like you're rivals now. Talk about tomorrow's game.  
DANIELLE GANT: It will be a big game, it will go down to the wire like it did
tonight. I think it is a matter of playing good defense. Great teams from
great offense, both the O.U. and us. And I think the key thing is defense.  
ADAORA ELONU: Yeah, I agree. I think defense will play an important part and
wins the game. We're looking forward to it and will be pumped.  
  
Q. [Inaudible] Courtney?  
DANIELLE GANT: We are going to play team defense, not Courtney down low. We
are playing good team defense and have two in the lane every time she touches
the ball.  
  
Q. Danielle, about 15 minutes left you had a lay-up behind the back pass
from Sydney. Were you expecting it to get you the ball quite that way? Did it
take you a second to adjust?  
DANIELLE GANT: I knew it was coming. When there is a fast break I knew she
would throw the behind the back pass, I knew it was coming.  
  
Q. Adaora, talk about coming off the bench and helping out today when you
all were in trouble.  
ADAORA ELONU: I know when Coach pulled me off the bench, it is not just to
fill in a spot. It's to pretty much either score, play good defense. Like
bringing something else to the game and that's what I think I did when I came
in.  
  
Q. Danielle, it seems like every time you come back something crazy happens
with you. Just describe your feelings hitting a shot like that, playing in
your hometown.  
DANIELLE GANT: Like I mentioned earlier, I mean, I mean, it was a great just
hitting the game-winning shot. Coach wanted the ball in my hands and I had to
score or get to the foul line. And I took it upon myself to get to the bucket.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about when Takia went down and were you concerned at
that point? Or kind of what went through your heads?  
DANIELLE GANT: Yeah, we were concerned a lot, knowing that she is like our
leading scorer and best three-point shooter. Plus, she has great defense.
Knowing that she went out, but also we have great bench. Knowing we can sit
Takia down and bring Tanisha or Tyra off the bench, that was a great lift for
us.  
ADAORA ELONU: I agree, the bench is pretty awesome. Her going down, we were
concerned, but we have others to step up and play for her.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for the student-athletes before we let
them return to the locker room? Thank you very much. And good luck tomorrow.
And, Coach, we will let you answer the questions for as long as you like,
within reason.  
COACH GARY BLAIR: Oh, Peter. Are you on "60 Minutes," Peter or anything like
that?  
  
Q. Coach, talk about Gant's effort, the double-double and playing in
Oklahoma City.  
COACH GARY BLAIR: She just has that mentality that refuses to lose. She had to
guard everybody on that team. Because Micheaux had trouble guarding Gipson and
Adaora couldn't guard Gipson. Finally we had to put her over there. And
sometimes we put her over on Lehning and on everybody. We have to do a little
better job of the rest of our kids taking care of their business. We're better
than that. But Gant is Gant. There's not a 5'10" player in the country that
plays harder and better than her. And that's why the Danielle Gant show is not
going to stop. It's going to keep on going. I just hope they're on the same
team after this.  
  
Q. Gary, this is obviously not the first time that Danielle played in front
of her home folks. Can you talk a little bit about when you take players back
to play in their home towns, the different players react differently to
that.  
COACH GARY BLAIR: I think so. Sometimes they try to do too much, but not
Danielle. Nothing, nothing frustrates her, nothing gets her too excited. She
is just very low-keyed person. She doesn't want all the compliments. A lot of
times she doesn't want the basketball on certain situations. She says let's
get it over to her, let's get it over to her. But when you're going down to
NCAA time, I know where my bread and butter was. They were doing a pretty good
job of defending Starks out there. Smith was missing a lot of easy stuff, and
she played well early and didn't do much late. And so, I'm going to keep going
to the horse in there, and that play was supposed to be a flash. But my
freshman was getting so excited, she wasn't supposed to -- she was supposed to
flash from the low block up and set the screen. But she got a little bit, she
scored over a double-team. Gant could have threw it back to Adaora who was
wide open on the play as well.  
  
Q. Gary, you can first talk about what did you think was different with
K-State's defense in the second half. And also if you can talk a little more
about Gipson and the way she played.  
COACH GARY BLAIR: Obviously Lehning wasn't tiring out, she wanted the ball and
was making plays for other.  
And every time we come off to help, Gipson would free up and our kids were
pointing fingers, making excuses. We're supposed to help, we're supposed to
rotate, but not come off of their best shooter, the girl that kept them in the
ballgame.  
But there, Michelle, basically you look at the stat sheet. They had three in
double figures, we had four. That is probably a little bit of the difference.
The kids had to play a lot more minutes than ours besides Gant and Starks and
eventually you wear down that load. If you had to play four games in a row of
playing those kids that many minutes you are not going to have anything left
for the NCAA tournament. So in one way it might be a relieve for Kansas State
to get back and to rest their bodies there because their owe going to be able
to go pretty far in this thing. They have got a lot of different weapons. And
see, we shut down Kincaid and Zanotti today. 1 out of 9 from the three. That's
huge. K-State -- 1 out of nine, 9 that's not bad, but we had a hand in their
face and then sometimes they missed some open looks. But K-State is a legit
team that has a great chance to get to the Sweet 16 and I wish them well. A
very well-coached team.  
  
Q. Coach, it's late in the season. Two starters down in this game and the
bench comes up and helps you finish. Let's talk about the contribution of
Adaora and the bench help.  
COACH GARY BLAIR: Adaora came in. Coach Shaffer was wanting defense in; I was
wanting offense. Adaora is a lot better. He kept wanting another one of my
fives in. And we argue like brothers sometimes, and that's just the way it. I
said, hey, they can't catch us if we can outscore them. And Adaora came in and
hit the big shots that we had to have. And she is just a very good player. She
was all Big 12 freshman of the week three different times. Didn't make all-
conference freshman, but she's had a great year for us. And I'm not afraid to
use whichever 5-player I need. Now, probably couldn't use Adaora like in that
situation against Oklahoma, because of the Parises. She couldn't handle the
weight. But against Kansas State, which are smaller like us, we could use her
at the 5 a little more. Adaora will be a very good player, just like her
brother.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about Kansas State maybe being in a Sweet 16 team. Also
you guys, O.U., Baylor, go down the list. What does it say about this
conference when you play a Kansas State team in the quarter finals?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: This is very similar to when I was back in the SEC when the
SEC was at the top. And I think we're at the top now, along with maybe the Big
East and the ACC are playing very well right now. But the depth of this
league, the strength of this league is the continuity of the coaches much
that's what made us strong in the SEC back then. We let the coaches build
their programs and we stayed with them and we built them. And kids want to
come to places where they're going to be seen on TV, we have a great TV
package, we have our great media that is writing about them. And we're putting
butts in the seats. And that's something that people want to come to the big
12. And I just think that's very, very important. But I think K-State has a
great chance, but it depends on our seeding. It depends on who you play.  
Because they have a team that's more of a finesse team that has to he can cute
perfectly. They are not a team that needs to face Rutgers. Years past I
remember when I got beat by old Kansas State up at Kansas State, then they had
to go play OLD DOMINION. That was a very physical team, and that wasn't a good
match-up for them. The it just depends on where we go.  
Of course, we both want to go where we're going to be the higher seed. Where
the home team is not going to be in that region. So send me somewhere, send me
home to Lubbock. [Laughter].  
  
Q. Starks looked like she was still pretty hobbled there when she came back
in. How will be for tomorrow do you think? Did she ask to come back in? Was
she in your ear?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: No, I asked her to come back in. There was no thing about
it. Even if she is out there, she is a hell of a decoy out there because if
the ball came to her, she has the ability to make the play. And I had a time-
out to go if I needed I could have used it to put in a defensive sub for her.
But her one leg, with her heart, you are not going to take her out. You are
not going to take Lehning out. So you are not 100%, none of us coaches are
100% in March right now either. We're worn down.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything further for coach? Good job, Coach. Congratulations,
we'll see you tomorrow.  
COACH GARY BLAIR: Thank you. When you have 10 turnovers by one team and seven
turnovers by the other team, you have a got a well-played ballgame.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Kansas  61  
Nebraska - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Yori, your comments about the game?  
COACH YORI: I thought Kansas played really well offensively. I'm not sure what
more we could do on our defensive end. But I just thought they took and made a
lot of tough shots.  
I thought our players played really hard. I thought we tried to take 'em out
of what they wanted to do. I thought we tried to dictate and yet they still
made a lot of plays.  
They've got two big guards in McCray and Morris, who create lots of match-up
problems for us. We're small at the guard and they have bigger guards than we
do and they made -- you know, we knew in playing Kansas that they create a lot
of match-up problems for us, and they took advantage of those match-ups, and
they shot over us a lot and made shots.  
Credit to them for making those plays. I don't know what else we can do
defensively in terms of guarding them. But on the other hand, we had our
opportunities, too, and we started out, I think we missed our first seven 3's,
something like that. And late in the game we had drives to the basket and
missed a few, and missed some free-throws.  
So we had our opportunities and they made more plays than we did, and that's a
credit to them.  
  
Q. Cory, it seemed like it was more difficult to get you the ball later in
the game. Was that true?  
CORY MONTGOMERY: It's hard to switch it up and dig out some of the players who
aren't outside shooters. And like Coach said, we had open shots and we just
didn't knock 'em down in the second half.  
  
Q. Can you follow up, Voni, on what Connie said about their guards and the
match-up problems and how big they are? How difficult of a task is that for
you guys?  
YVONNE TURNER: It's hard for us. We've been experiencing a size advantage this
year. And when you play against bigger guards that's bigger than us, then it's
tougher for our little guards, including myself, to help off their guards.  
  
Q. What have you learned throughout this year? Your team has battled a lot
of adversity with the injuries starting the beginning of the season with
Kelsey, what have you learned? I know you have the WNIT to play for, but what
have you learned about this season?  
YVONNE TURNER: I think the big thing we learned is playing during adversity,
we had a lot of things this season to try and bring us down and we fought
through it and ended up finishing our season strong, and it's helped our team
come closer together.  
CORY MONTGOMERY: I think the more team chemistry we have, the better we play.
When we play as a team, we're a pretty good team and hard to stop. I think
that's one of the main things that we learned this year is sticking together
as a team, whether through illness and sickness, and things like that.  
  
Q. How do you feel about playing in the WNIT, which is what it looks like
will be the case.  
CORY MONTGOMERY: I'm very excited, our team is excited, our coaches are
excited. We're glad we have the opportunity to further our season. That just
let's us know how great our team is and that we're not going down without
fightin' hard.  
YVONNE TURNER: The way that we look at it is like our season isn't over yet,
and we can go into the WNIT and come out and be successful and win a few games
and try and win the whole entire thing.  
COACH YORI: Might want to get a bid, first.  
  
Q. Could you talk about that? Do you think your team has earned a bid?  
COACH YORI: We're in the 50s in the RPI. We're going into this game, I believe
we were 56 in the RPI and we're probably not going to drop a lot. We're a good
basketball team, we've played an extraordinarily difficult schedule.  
We've played a top -- depending which day you look at it, a top-15 schedule. I
think we deserve to be in and we're excited about being in and I just asked
the team in the locker room if they wanted to play in the NIT if we get a bid
and they said "yep."  
15 losses is a lot of losses but we've played a difficult schedule and a
nonconference, it would be easy to schedule a couple more wins in the
nonconference and everybody wants folks to play good teams. Well, we have.
We're playing in the No. 1 RPI league in the country.  
We're a good basketball team, we just -- doesn't necessarily show by our
record, but it does if you look at the scheme of things.  
  
Q. Connie, did their guards make it more difficult for you guys to get the
ball to Cory?  
COACH YORI: Yeah, they collapsed, they weren't guarding Tay at all, and
Catheryn doesn't get guarded. As the second half wore on, they went more and
more to helping on Cory. And when Tay is on the floor, she is a not a 3-point
shooter and I thought she created opportunities by going to the glass.  
And in terms of Catheryn, she has to score around the basket so Cory has --
and that's why I think Cory has had such a great year for us, because when you
consider how much she scored with the help that she's got at times around her,
she has had a pretty phenomenal year. And at times she had three people around
her, and they didn't necessarily hard double her but every time she had the
ball, they were sticking a hand in.  
  
Q. What have you learned about your team with the adversity in the season?  
COACH YORI: I love my team. We've got good kids in our program, high character
young women and we recruited to make sure that happened and recruited to get
kids in our program that we feel like are great people.  
Adversity reveals your character and we went through a lot of adverse times
this year, and we had high expectations coming into the season, as did a lot
of teams in the Big 12, but with the injuries that we've had and the things
that we've dealt with, I think it says a lot about our players and our
program, the kind of character they have to make a push late in the season and
stay positive and keep workin'.  
A lot of teams would have folded, at 1-8 a lot would have folded. And during
that stretch we were 5-2 at the end of the year. I like my players, I think
they're young women of character.  
  
Q. Was there anything, one or two or three things about your team's game
that changed down the stretch that enabled you to finish winning five of the
last seven going into today?  
COACH YORI: Well, we've talked a lot about just trying to fight through
adverse times and remembering who we are. We did a lot of talkin' and not
necessarily because we weren't working hard or playing hard, but just to keep
us positive.  
We looked at the latter part of our schedule and said, hey, there is a lot of
winnable games there and I think our players bought into that and saw we could
win some games. There is no easy game in the Big 12 in women's basketball, but
I thought our schedule softened up a little bit, which enabled us to stay
hopeful.  
I thought just, you know, we talked a lot about having hope. The Texas Tech
game we won at home got us going and things rolled from there. If you go 5-2
in this league, that's pretty good, as good as the league is and that's what
we did down the stretch.  
  
Q. I know there is a chance this one isn't over yet, tell us what you think
about the possibilities for next year. You lose one senior, admittedly a good
one, but it's one senior, I understand there is a good chance Kelsey could be
back next year. It looks like if you don't have the bad luck that you ran into
this year, that this could be a strong team next year.  
COACH YORI: We felt like going into this season like this could be my best
team since I've been at Nebraska. With all the players that we had returning
and coming off the year that we did last year, and unfortunately things didn't
go our way.  
But at the same time, we're going into next year and hopefully we can finish
in the NIT and do some good things and carry that over to positives for next
year. We're losing one senior, but we're gaining six players. We're making a
six-for-one swap. We signed kids and we have three kids now that had season-
ending injuries, so if we stay healthy, we have a chance to be a very good
basketball team. Health is something that you can't control and you can see
what happened to us this year when we weren't healthy.  
  
Q. No matter what led to it is the fact that you looked forward to this
season with so much optimism, and it didn't turn out as well as you hoped,
could have been disappointing. I thought it's been more along the lines of we
have a lot to overcome and we've done it and we're proud of what we've done.  
COACH YORI: I would agree. In this league every single win is so difficult to
come by, and the fact that we were able to come down the stretch and play
well, we should feel good about that.  
And, again, there is two ways to go when you're 1-8. You can hang up the you
can hang up the shoes or you can continue to try to compete. And I thought we
continued to try to compete and get better in practice and our players stuck
together. And, again, that's a credit to our players. I feel good about the
way we ended our season in the regular season, and I feel good about what we
did today.  
There is no shame in losing this game, we worked really hard. We tried -- I
thought we did a lot of the right things, Kansas played well. We'll strap 'em
back on and hopefully we'll get another chance and look forward to ending our
season on a strong note.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, have a great rest of the season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2009

  

### [Kari Kincaid](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19446)

### [Gary Patterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19444)

### [Ashley Sweat](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19445)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Kansas State - 68  
Colorado - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome, Coach?  
COACH PATTERSON: For an opening round, Big 12 tournament game, we're extremely
proud of this victory.  
Playing a third a -- playing a team a third time and coming in back-to-back is
challenging, and I thought our players were emotionally mature, and I think
their effort was strong tonight. It was tremendous for us to feel like we
could get that first-round win, we're pleased to be advancing.  
And we understand the magnitude of the challenge and appreciate the
unbelievable play that Kara has brought to the Big 12 conference for her
career. She has been a handful for everybody in the league, and goes out
shooting 80% from the floor and scoring over 20 points.  
Great final game effort by her in Big 12 play. A real high-quality young
person, we have a great deal of respect for her.  
  
Q. Both for Kari and Ashley, Kansas State always seems to play good,
fundamental, throw-back basketball. Is that something that you learn as a
small-town Kansas girl or is that something you're taught?  
ASHLEY SWEAT: I think it has to do with what we're taught growing up. I can
tell you from our high school experiences, here at Kansas State we pride
ourselves on staying fundamental and executing, working the small things. And
I think that's what has won us games this year and hopefully will win us more.  
KARI KINCAID: I agree with what Ashley said and I think our coaches take pride
in helping us get better. And we're the type of players that want to come in
and learn and get better.  
I feel like I wouldn't be playing basketball if I didn't learn those
fundamentals, because I have to use my strength. And part of that is what I
know about the game, because I'm not the athlete that a lot of these girls
are. I think our coaches take pride in making us better.  
  
Q. Ashley, especially inside the last couple of games, Marlies is scoring
again. What does that do for this team because there was a stretch where not
much was coming from her offensively.  
ASHLEY SWEAT: I think that's huge for us, anytime we can get a couple of
players to score, even just 10 points, especially on the inside, that opens
things up for the outside. You see Marlies establishing things from the
inside.  
And then Kari can step outside and get shots, and I think when we're firing on
all cylinders, it can be a dangerous combination.  
  
Q. Ashley, you guys just played Colorado, it seems like yesterday you just
played them in Boulder. And coaches talk about the third time around and it
can be tough, but it wasn't that way at all. Can you talk about how you guys
took control of this game from the tip?  
ASHLEY SWEAT: I definitely think anytime you're going to play a team three
times, it's going to be tough. We've done the same thing with Iowa State the
past two years, and I think today we came out and were focused on our
execution and focussing on our scout and staying true to how we've played 'em
the last couple of times.  
I think our coaches have us so well prepared, you can see that as our third
game, you know, that we've played them.  
  
Q. Brittany Spears only had 3 points in the first half, was she a point of
emphasis for your defense?  
KARI KINCAID: Definitely, Spears, we know, is an all-Big 12 player. She is
great inside and out, and we brought total respect to her game and, you know,
we know that she is looking to score and she did in the second half. We know
who she was going into this game, but we knew all the other players, too.  
  
Q. Do you think part of Colorado's problem was they only had two players who
were looking to score today?  
ASHLEY SWEAT: I think this is one of those games where they felt like all year
they've carried the team and done such a great job.  
Colorado is a great basketball team and having Spears and Richards on the
inside, they do a bulk of the playing, but their guards do a lot of other
things. They play great defense and Smith is a great shooter.  
They bring a lot to the game, and I think toward the end of the season you're
seeing more of a postgame on the inside.  
  
Q. Ashley, and Kari, you guys played March 1st Texas A &M, and that was a
pretty tough game for you guys. I know Shalin was under the weather then. What
do you guys have to do different tomorrow, maybe you two individually and what
you think you have to do as a team against them?   
ASHLEY SWEAT: I think the last time we played them, I don't know if we were
mentally ready for the challenge. That's a huge thing for our team, if we can
get ourselves fired up, we play on a lot of emotion. That's what drives this
team.  
I think if we can come out with the fire and intensity that we've had the past
three games, we can be successful. We need to play together and execute, and
obviously I think that hopefully there will be a better turn out than last
time.  
KARI KINCAID: I agree, but we're going to have to play our best game to beat a
team like Texas A&M, and we know that. They come in and play their hearts out
every single game, and that's something we have to match and exceed if we have
a chance to win.  
  
Q. Deb, same question I asked the girls. You take a lot of pride in that
you've built such a successful program at K-State, using mostly Kansas
girls.  
COACH PATTERSON: We've been unbelievably privileged to have hard-working,
Kansas talent over the years. And like every program in this league, your
program tends to have a signature style with which they play.  
Our Kansas talent has really given us the opportunity in our successful years,
I think, to shine and to be successful, and competitive in this league and
nationally. So all credit to them.  
Also just to the -- you know, the commitment that they have to making the very
most of their abilities and the foundation that they have coming out of AAU
ball and high school basketball.  
Obviously we're attracted to fundamental, hard-nosed, tough players, very much
like you might find at an Iowa State or Nebraska. So it's just a tribute to
them. And I think our style will continue to remain the same and our system,
as I think all of the Big 12 programs by and large are successful, remaining
true to who they are and how they want to play.  
  
Q. Talk about the rebounding, especially the offensive rebounding in the
second half and getting the chances.  
COACH PATTERSON: I thought coming off the floor with about 8 was significant
for us. It's an aspect in tournament play that you have to bring to the floor.  
We were active there, we didn't rely on one shot and out, which at times when
you're a team that tends to rely on offensive execution and the finish of a
play, you can get tempted to not put your nose to the grind stone offensively.
And offensive rebounds are so much at times about athletic instincts and
athletic skills.  
And we're not always so great in that area, and our kids worked hard to get
the opportunities to rebound. That was big in the first half, our rebounds and
opportunities and second and third possessions, whether we converted or not
was very, very big.  
  
Q. How much -- is it an advantage or disadvantage to have to play the first
day, go into the second day since you have momentum under your belt, Texas A
&M coming in cold. Is that an advantage or is it tougher having to play the
extra game?   
COACH PATTERSON: I don't look at it as any tougher for us than anybody. You
earn your way into this tournament, and we had this opportunity today to
compete hard. And I thought our kids competed well, and now the reality is
it's just all about the next opponent.  
And we know we're facing a great one with Texas A&M, and someone that took us
to school the first time we played 'em. So that's the unbelievable challenge
of Big 12 play. And I think it's just a testament to the quality of this
league to think that in your second-round game, you're playing the No. 8 team
in the country.  
Under the circumstances, unbelievable. And it speaks to the fact that this is
a league that's had maybe seven and eight easy in the NCAA tournament. It's
just that tough.  
So we have all the respect in the world for Colorado, we're thrilled to have
won this game and now we look ahead and go, wow! Texas A&M! I'm just proud of
what we brought to the floor and hope we can build on it.  
  
Q. Coach, Texas A &M has shown they're human a couple of times, but person-
for-person are they the most difficult match-up for you in this league of
anybody?   
COACH PATTERSON: Well, they certainly proved the first time through that they
could put a hurt on us, more so than anyone else in this league. They're
playing just phenomenal basketball.  
You look at their -- the fact that that's a program that tends to play very
well down the stretch, you know, in late February and March. They matured into
a program, and they have an offensive team to match the great defense they
bring to the floor.  
I think they're playing as well as anybody I've seen in this league. I know
they had a tough game against Baylor down the stretch, but when you're playing
at such a high level through the course of this league, and you lose a game
against another top-10 opponent, you can tend to think, what a hiccup, and
really it wasn't at all.  
It's just that you were playing a top-10 opponent in Baylor, I think top 10.
It's just that good of a league, great balance, Danielle Gant, Sydney Colson
stepped up in our game and was an amazing freshman, Takia Starks, Tyra White,
Tanisha Smith, you don't find a spot in their lineup that's weak, and that's
why they're a top-10 program in the country.  
It's amazing to think that, again, that's a team that didn't win our league
because there are teams that were even better. They're great, they've been a
tough match-up for us in our first game and we'll have to play significantly
different and better than we did the first time to give it a good shot.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Good luck tomorrow.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Texas  62  
Missouri - 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Missouri Tigers, Coach Cindy Stein is
here. Coach, if you would make comments about tonight's game.  
COACH STEIN: I think it came down -- I was proud of our team and the way we
fought and scrapped. And it came to the end where you gotta make plays, and
unfortunately we didn't, Texas did and that's the name of the game.  
I've talked to a lot of coaches in the last couple of weeks, and a lot of 'em
are struggling to get their teams to play hard. And I wasn't struggling to
have our team play hard, they were ready, they played hard and the key for us
is figuring out how to win.  
You know, it's unfortunate to lose like that but, you know, you've got to give
the credit to Texas. They did a great job and came up with some great plays.  
  
Q. Let's start by asking about the last couple of minutes, y'all had a
7-point lead, and it was one of several times in the second half where it
looked like you were taking control and over. But it seemed like a few seconds
it was just gone. Can you talk a little bit about how that happened, was there
something that Texas threw at you defensively or was it just mistakes getting
made?  
ALYSSA HOLLINS: They were on the nine very well. We were all up on the base
line, we weren't spaced out like we needed to be. They would finish the
layups.  
  
Q. Were you in disbelief that a 7-point lead could go away in 3 seconds?  
JESSRA JOHNSON: Personally, I felt like I had the ball in my hands literally,
and I take responsibility of not getting the ball to the right person. And we
didn't do well on inbounds. Yeah, disbelief, I guess.  
ALYSSA HOLLINS: I think everybody had a hand in it. I don't feel like we
panicked, but we didn't come -- we knew better, like we let them get in their
place. We should have spaced out and do what we knew how to do, and it was
happening so fast.  
But you have to give credit to Texas because they didn't die, they didn't give
up, and they kept the pressure on and sometimes that's just how the ball
bounces.  
  
Q. Jessra, how much of a motivating factor does this become going forward
for next season?  
JESSRA JOHNSON: As of right now, just it motivates you because I don't want to
be done playing, and my team doesn't want to be done playing. We want to be
playing tomorrow, but it's not a reality, so motivated to do better next year.  
  
Q. Alice, talk about your emotions at this point. It's been a great career
for you, and at the same time it's got to be a disappointing way for you to
finish it.  
ALYSSA HOLLINS: This isn't how I would write it in my book, you know? You
know, I'm proud of my team, the way we came out once again, everybody fought
hard. I don't think you could ask for much more out of a group of girls.  
It's one of the best experiences of my life, and even this, like I look back
on this and it's a blessing.  
  
Q. There must be so many conflicting emotions right now. What did you tell
your kids after the game?  
COACH STEIN: There is not a lot to say, it's tough. Honestly, it's tough. They
knew how many time-outs we had, they knew we needed spacing, they knew we
needed to get the ball in. It's tough and it happens.  
The plays happened quick, and just trying to keep your kids up and it's tough
because this team has fought so hard. You know, it's tough to go in, and you
talk about next year when you have Alice sitting there, because that's not
fair to her.  
There is so much we can learn this year, I felt like our kids deserved more
than what they got. But at the same time, we reflected a little bit on what
we've got to take from this game for next year.  
But the main thing that we wanted to say is, you know, Alice was a tremendous
player for us, and we need to prepare what she's going through and enjoy the
moment of this team being together, because every year your team is different.
We've got to embrace where we are right now and we've had a tough road, and
they need to be proud of the way they fought.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
COACH STEIN: This was a tough one, a winnable game. But, again, Texas got
themselves into a position to do it and we didn't.  
  
Q. Cindy, talk about the incredible evolution that this club has made over
the last couple of years. Last year y'all were going out and getting thumped
sometimes, and there were nights it seemed like where you really were almost
concerned about effort level. All year there have been games where you came in
with just disappointing losses and came in so proud of the team and the effort
that they were showing and that was very genuine, obviously.  
There has been a change in the program and the way the team has come along, at
the same time, "L"'s are still coming. Is that frustrating?  
COACH STEIN: It's frustrating coming off a couple of years ago where we had
the talent and couldn't get them to play hard all the time, and that was
frustrating. We knew we were going to be young these two years, last year and
this year, we knew we were going to be young.  
It was probably the worst two years to be young in the Big 12. It's probably
the two strongest years ever in the Big 12. It's one of those things that you
take a chance on in recruiting and all those things.  
We had seven seniors, if you remember, and we didn't want to have seven
seniors again, so we tried to space out our recruiting, even up our classes
and you take some hits. But I would agree, last year we were so young, trying
to teach them to work hard all the time.  
Obviously the lesson was learned. Go into this year and we fought and battled.
We've only probably not been in a couple of games. But we still have to find
that way to win with this young team. I felt like we were putting the ball in
the hands of the most experienced people, and it didn't work. It comes to the
point where you've got to make plays. Unfortunately, we were unable to come up
with them.  
  
Q. Talk about the play of your young'ins tonight, because it seemed like --
(Away from mic.)  
COACH STEIN: If you look at four in particular, Bekah and Christina is a
freshman playing well, and Shak and Rae as sophomores, and those four get a
lot of minutes. You know, I like the way we scrapped.  
We have to find a way to score, and that's the frustrating part, they shutdown
our offense in the last 10 minutes of the game, and we have to work better
together in those times and not panic.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
COACH STEIN: I would agree, Rae gives us a lot of energy, and I think she was
so relieved that I wasn't playing her at point guard this year, that she had a
lot of energy. But I'm real proud of all of 'em.  
They all lead in different ways and they all work hard. Even in the huddles,
when they tied the game up, they were very positive with each other, and we
haven't always had that. They were like, "we've got to figure out how to score
here" and we had the shot, you know? We scrapped for the ball.  
Again, it comes down to -- they talk about it in every sport, you've got to
have playmakers, we got the ball to our playmaker, it just didn't drop.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much and we appreciate your comments.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Kansas  61  
Nebraska - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Kansas Jay Hawks and Coach Henrickson and
her student athletes. Coach, if you would give an opening statement.  
COACH HENRICKSON: Great effort on behalf of Nebraska and great defensive
effort by these two, give them credit for being tough to continue to set up
screens, use screens, hit tough shots, take tough shots and make tough shots.  
And I thought Sade and Ivana were difference makers, got two steals and turned
'em into layups, Danielle to have toughness, after the time-out when I was
grouchy with them, when I called it in the beginning of the second half, but
Danielle comes out and gets an offensive rebound and in one, and that's what
you do.  
You find a way to score when you're a great player. And Chel throws over to
Ivana, scoring in transition. There is a lot of kids that stepped up and
played well, and particularly these two are the most obvious, whether it's a
great screen or a great pass. I thought it was a great team effort on our
part.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what this game means and how it might propel you for
the rest of the season?  
DANIELLE McCRAY: It feels great to play well this time in the season. I played
well, the rest of the girls played well, great feeling today.  
  
Q. How many people were here?  
DANIELLE McCRAY: I don't know.  
COACH HENRICKSON: There were a lot of people at her grandmother's house
Tuesday night, so a lot of people here.  
  
Q. It seemed like Bonnie was talking about things weren't clicking, you guys
didn't look like yourselves. What was it, a matter of becoming more aggressive
or what worked? That became a different game in the second half.  
DANIELLE McCRAY: I think in the beginning, the first part of the game both
teams were so antsy to play.  
Me personally, I think I was just going too fast. I needed to calm down, but
the whole game I think we both knew that this was an in or out situation for
us, and both teams were playing hard.  
SADE MORRIS: I think the turning point was our defense. We stepped it up on
defense to get our offense going, because it was struggling a little bit, and
that was game changing.  
  
Q. Danielle, seemed like they were all over you in the first half and trying
to keep you from catching the ball, especially in the second half, too, can
you talk about how tough that was for you?  
DANIELLE McCRAY: I thought they were there every play. Nebraska's coach,
Connie Yori, is a great coach, and she knows what we run and they were in my
face the whole time. And I was just trying to rush it and not letting the game
come to me.  
And after Coach Bonnie got us in the second time-out, I kind of calmed down
and knew it was going to come, and let the game come to me. Sade did a good
job of, if they're playing hard on "D", I'm going to step up, and she did a
good job of that.  
  
Q. Sade and Danielle, did you come here thinking you could play yourself
into the NCAA tournament? And what did you do to make that happen today?  
SADE MORRIS: We definitely thought we could get ourselves into the NCAA, but
we knew we had to come out and play hard. And now we have another one that we
have to fight for tomorrow, too.  
DANIELLE McCRAY: To go off of what Sade said, that was our No. 1 goal since
the beginning of the season, and we know that a lot of teams want to end up in
that position, where if you win one, you might get in. And we embraced that
and came out for a hard fight tonight.  
  
Q. I wonder if y'all can talk a bit, the last couple of minutes Nebraska was
getting relatively open shots and having just some layups and fairly close
shots that just didn't seem to be falling. Talk a bit about those defensive
sets in the minute, minute and a half or so.  
DANIELLE McCRAY: I think we dug down deep and decided to guard. Montgomery was
doing a good job of down lowing. And once we put Krysten on her and got some
of that size on her, it bothered her.  
In the beginning we were giving them easy looks. You're going to make those
shots. Toward the end, we had that pressure and not letting them get those
second-chance points that they were getting to stay in the game.  
  
Q. Danielle, Bonnie talked about the play where you got the edge and you
grabbed the loose ball, they were on a 7-0 run at that point at that time, can
you talk about the kick start?  
DANIELLE McCRAY: She gave me confidence that I could make a shot. In the
beginning, I couldn't make nothing, and I felt like I needed to get something
different done.  
And once my teammates saw how emotional I was, they fed off of it and we kept
going from there, because we didn't want to go home tonight.  
  
Q. In terms of effort, those two steels were kind of like a defensive back
taking an interpretation off. It was a high effort. Is there something there
that -- can you explain it any other way than, hey, we don't want to go home,
something seemed like it possessed you today.  
SADE MORRIS: I didn't want to go home, I wasn't ready to leave. We came here
to go to the NCAA tournament, and we came here to win. I was going for the
steal because we needed to win and we needed to get on a roll and that's what
I did.  
  
Q. Coach, we talked about those last couple of minutes, what was happening
with Nebraska missing shots. Your players are obviously doing some things very
well. We have known really all year the problems that Connie has had as far as
injuries with that team. Talk about your depth, how that made a difference for
you and do you think the fatigue was a factor in that last couple of
minutes?  
COACH HENRICKSON: I didn't -- maybe a little on the perimeter where 'De uses
her length and knocked some things down. And I think our defensive pressure
created some things in the first half, knocked some things down played and
played good rhythm and pretty good spacing and timing.  
I thought when they went to Montgomery so much one-on-one, I told the guards,
you've got to be the reason they can't go inside. And we went back to Krys to
give Montgomery some length inside, and then we put Nic on Redmon and we
stayed on her, and Yvonne has good pressure and I thought we really distorted
them offensively.  
  
Q. Bonnie, this league has got 108 teams in before, do you think you're in
after today? How do you feel about your resume?  
COACH HENRICKSON: I think we're in, but we'll keep playing and trying to
improve our resume. I think we've had a great rundown the stretch and had
quality wins. And I think it's important to be playing well, not just in the
tournament.  
We played well before we got to this point, obviously in the last three weeks,
but we want to make sure we try to take care of things on our own destiny
here. And coming into this, it was about beating Nebraska, it wasn't about
getting past that.  
We stole from Coach Mangino about keeping your head down, stay focused, don't
cut all them fingers off if you do that, and now it's about beating Oklahoma,
but I think we've earned our opportunity to be in the dance.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
COACH HENRICKSON: I listen to him, I have a lot of people in our building, we
can commiserate about it.  
  
Q. Bonnie, Danielle had a lot of big performances this season, but tonight
seemed like one of her toughest. On top of that, talk about Sade stepping up,
and tonight she did.  
COACH HENRICKSON: Good question. I think what makes her performance tough is
she struggled so much in the first half, and that's emotional growth because
she has this look on her face, which isn't good for us.  
She let Turner go to the rim. She is mad she can't get a shot and give them
credit. They chased her. It's one thing to play a box-and-one, they just face
guarded her and weren't going to let her get open.  
But I thought the kid showed perseverance, and her teammates were great with
her about "D". You're better than this and what her teammates did is played
around her a little bit.  
And by the time we came back to her, I think she calmed herself down, and you
heard her say "I wasn't reacting, wasn't responding." She kept running the
ball, set up the screen and the bigs have to do a better job of screening for
her, but she did a much better job of getting separation.  
And when the fatigue hit is when they got tired chasing her off of the
screens, and that's a big, strong performance. And then Sade, I subbed her out
two years ago at Baylor, and I told her we should have left her at her
grandmother's house. And I'm glad we didn't have to say that today.  
We call them Batman and Robin. Gary Blair calls them Pippen and Jordan,
they're great together. And when 'De stays aggressive, it makes 'em better.
Because who do you guard, make the extra pass. I was just proud of her and
happy for her that she stepped up and took tough shots and hit some tough
shots and guarded and creates the defensive intensity by turning the guys over
and getting the layup and everybody took a deep breath.  
We scored as much from transition and turnovers than we did in any set play
from the 10-minute markdown.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
COACH HENRICKSON: I said when we -- I said we stay together, did you want to
win 27-26 points, Danielle had 27 points, the rest of you are on scholarship,
play! You've got to step up and play. Probably a little bit more than that,
but --  
  
Q. Bonnie, with 'De, it seemed like there were a couple points in that game
where they could have pulled away because of the struggle, and not to single
her out, but in some ways to single her out.  
COACH HENRICKSON: She goes down to the rim in traffic and scores. She hits a
baseline jumper when they make the extra pass. She starts -- I yelled at her
one time and said you're giving the ball a headache, she's dribbling the ball
10 times and not going anywhere. We're taking 10 dribbles and not going
anywhere, be more aggressive off your on-ball screens.  
And I started to call things for her, I called it for 'De, and Danielle came
off, and I yelled at Danielle and said that was not for you, just to let 'De
calm down and give 'De confidence. And I said, we're going to play with
confidence here, and she did a great job.  
  
Q. Coach, can you discuss the challenges of a team playing well down the
stretch in a league that's so strong top to bottom?  
COACH HENRICKSON: What's difficult in this league, because it's so good, is to
be able to bounce back, because it's hard to be consistent in the league when
you get stretches of, Oklahoma State, Iowa State, Baylor, there is no night
off.  
Coming off Oklahoma at home, it is difficult to win in this league, and you
have to build some resiliency. And as a staff, you have to be careful about
never making a loss, okay, but allowing your kids to be okay with it and
bouncing back from it. To every assistant coach and your captains and leaders,
you have to stay in the huddle.  
Our bench is the best in the league, they're unbelievable as far as the energy
they provide, how positive they are, they fuss at each other and that's okay,
but it is a brutal, brutal league. And you've got to have some toughness about
you to be able to get knocked down and get right back up and think you could
go get the next one.  
  
Q. The No. 1 team got knocked off across the street, can you use that with
your girls to say that a No. 1 team can get knocked off?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Absolutely, and I think as much as we've got ESPN and all
that, they watch it all, they talk about, you see them hit that shot?  
They understand this time of year it can happen, and that's a great example
for us, and a team that we wished that wouldn't have happened to, but for us
it's about getting film work in of the game with them at our place, and we go
4 for 24 coming out of the locker room to start the game.  
We get good looks, we don't have very good rhythm, very good timing and great
respect for Oklahoma and what they do. And they would probably think that of
themselves. And what they watch on TV, it's that time of year, you've got to
play.  
We've got to do our job, got to have a game plan, make adjustments, but the
biggest anxiety about this is players play. Although I had a great catch on
the sideline, it wasn't in my range! You know? June told me "you still got it"
because June did my games in college.  
  
Q. What is your range?  
COACH HENRICKSON: In the paint. I can make a free-throw, Tom.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

THE MODERATOR: We're glad to have the University of Texas Longhorns, Coach
Goestenkors, if you would like to make an opening comment.  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Just thankful to come away with a win. I thought Coach
Stein had her team very well prepared from the last time we played, and I
thought they did a tremendous job.  
Last time we played zone almost the whole game, and when we went zone in this
game, she had her kids ready and they scored layups on us. I feel fortunate to
come away with a win because they certainly controlled a good portion, most of
the game, really.  
I am proud of my team because the shots weren't falling and we got good looks,
but couldn't get anything to go down. But I'm proud of my team because they
never gave up. Looked a little bleak there toward the end, and did a great job
with our press, got some key steals, continued to attack and came away with a
win. I told the players in the locker room, you know, I was proud of 'em.  
They stayed the course, and at this time of the year it's survive and advance.
You're going to have games like this when nothing seems to go your way, but
you have to find a way to win and I thought we did that.  
Particularly proud of Ernie Williams, I thought she willed us to win, her
effort. I've always called her my warrior, and she played like a warrior
tonight. And she willed us to win with all of her hustle plays, so I'm proud
of Ernie and proud of Britt, she wasn't hitting her shot, but she did so many
other things that helped us be successful.  
  
Q. Missouri has a 7-point lead with less than two minutes to go, y'all just
describe what happened from there.  
BRITTAINEY RAVEN: We've been in that position many times this season, and it
just comes down to fightin' it out and being really aggressive, more
aggressive than we had been the entire game.  
We all were on the same page, all of our rotations were correct, so once we
rotated, we had Ernie and Carla get a few quick steals, and before we knew it,
we were tied.  
  
Q. You guys scored 7 points in 10 seconds, what was going through your mind,
Coach?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Thank God! It took us, what, 20 minutes to score 24 points,
so for us to score 9 points in 30 seconds, you know, we'd been waiting to
score all game long. We needed every single one of them.  
Things worked out for us in the end with a couple of key turnovers, and we had
the ability to score.  
  
Q. Ernie, could you talk about your big game tonight? You seemed to -- you
were diving after balls, back in your home state. Obviously you wanted to win
this bad, talk about your night tonight.  
EARNESIA WILLIAMS: Of course I wanted to win, I was ready to play. Just to be
here with my team and be alive, I guess. I had a car accident yesterday,
yesterday morning, while doing my internship for kinesiology, and it was
raining in Austin and my car hydroplaned into the other lane and back into my
lane and I hit a rock wall with my car, and it flipped a couple of times.  
I walked out, two guys helped me out, they were behind me and saw the whole
thing. I walked out with only a scratch on my arm. So -- on my hand. I'm glad
to be here and alive. Just to play like that for my team. And help us advance
to another game is just a blessing.  
BRITTAINEY RAVEN: Good job, Ernie!  
EARNESIA WILLIAMS: Thank you.  
  
Q. Can you tell me a little more about what time of day and kinda what
happened?  
EARNESIA WILLIAMS: It was in the morning, 6:25, 7:00, early in the morning.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
EARNESIA WILLIAMS: Not really, I had a little neck stiffness when I woke up
today, but that's about it. Not many people make it out of something like
that, so I'm just glad to be here.  
  
Q. Earnesia, any accidents like that happen to you before? Did you know how
to handle something like that?  
EARNESIA WILLIAMS: None at all. That's probably the most dangerous thing and
life-threatening thing that has ever happened to me. I had two ACL tears and I
thought that was life-threatening, but I was in something way deeper than
that.  
  
Q. Brittainey, when did you guys all find out about that?  
BRITTAINEY RAVEN: I think when everybody arrived for practice, a couple of us
overheard Terry talking about it and we all wanted to know what happened, and
we talked to Ernie about it. She told us what happened and we all comforted
her and made sure she was okay. And we asked her how she felt.  
  
Q. How do you back to focussing on basketball after something like that?  
EARNESIA WILLIAMS: I don't know. I guess -- I don't know, I just played and,
you know, I guess God had different plans for me, so I'm still here, so I'm
just going to live my life and do what I was doing before the accident.  
  
Q. Gail, could you talk a little bit more about -- I mean, wow! Can you talk
a little bit more about that, how you found out? Was she on I-35?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: No, Ernie has an internship and she goes to it early in the
morning, so about 6:45 yesterday morning she was on her way and it was raining
and the roads were slick. And like she said, she hit a wet spot and swerved
and the car flipped several times and ended side down.  
So she was in the car upside down in a ditch, and the road she was on was 22,
and it's a windy road, it's a scary road, she called me right after it
happened. They couldn't get her out of the front door because it was bashed in
and the car is totaled, so they got her out the back.  
Two guys stopped and got her out the back. Fortunately she wasn't -- they
called an ambulance and they checked her out and she had bumps and bruises,
but overall she was okay. She called me from the site and just said, you know,
Coach I got in a car accident, I'm fine, I hit a rock.  
I thought she was okay, and -- at that time, then I realized later she was in
shock. She called her mom and basically told her the same thing. And then when
her mom got to the scene, she called me very upset, she said the car is upside
down, it's totaled, it's flipped, but Ernie was in shock at that time.  
They both came in and we met and that's when it started to hit her and she
really broke down. We had our team doctor look at her yesterday afternoon. She
didn't practice, and we didn't know if she would be able to play really until
today. And she said she was stiff, especially her neck, but she went to our
shootaround and she looked good.  
She is a spiritual young lady and she said it's put things in perspective for
her. And I think anytime something like this happens, you want to live each
moment to the fullest, and I think that's what you saw out there today.  
  
Q. You said two guys helped her out, were they just two strangers?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Yeah, they were behind her and they saw it happen, and they
both stopped. I don't know who they are, I don't know that Ernie knows. They
left after the ambulance came, so "thank you" to them. Good Samaritans.  
  
Q. Could you talk about that flurry there at the end? Your athleticism
seemed to throw them for a loop. Did you think about putting that press on
earlier and maybe trying to get what you got there at the end?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: We had pressed throughout the game, we pick and choose when
we press, because it's a long game, forty minutes is a long time to press.
This is a long tournament as well, hopefully. So we pressed after our free-
throws, and we were not successful at all.  
We were running a zone press, so the last press we ran was our man-to-man
press, so I knew we would use the man-to-man press and got aggressive. It was
desperation at that point, and we were going to press on makes and misses.  
Sometimes if you press the whole game, teams get comfortable with your
pressure. And because this was late in the game and it was a different press
than we had been running, it made them a little more unsure.  
  
Q. What did you tell 'em during the last media time-out when y'all were down
7?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I said we're going to win this game, there is plenty of
time, don't panic, don't throw up bad shots. We need to get stops with our
defense and you need to get shots with our offense. I said don't panic.
Overall, I thought they did a nice job of trying to still execute our sets.  
  
Q. Obviously this has been an emotional roller coaster the last 24 hours,
how do you go about preparing for Iowa State tomorrow?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Not going to sleep a whole lot tonight. Iowa State is an
incredible team, very well coached. They spread the floor out on you, they can
all shoot three's, so it's a different style.  
Missouri only has two kids that are what I would consider really good 3-point
shooters, Iowa State has so many weapons from outside the arc. We were
fortunate to come away with a win at Ames. They had an 11-point lead at the
time and let it slip away.  
I'm sure they'll remember that game and come ready to play. We have to show
the fire and desire that we showed at the end of the game, and in the second
half of the Oklahoma game, that's who we have to be at that point in time to
be successful for forty minutes.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, good luck tomorrow.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Kansas State  68  
Colorado - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your comments?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: Clearly not the outcome or the first half that we had
wanted. We felt like from a preparation standpoint, we had come in and made
good adjustments that were fairly effective for probably the first six or
eight minutes.  
From a defensive standpoint, we knew that Lehning was the one that needed the
ball in her hands for them to get going, and we made adjustments of going
under the ball screens, gapping a little bit more, which is what we felt hurt
us so much a couple days before, five days before.  
And with that -- players like Sweat and Kincaid, probably controlled them
better than we did the first time, and they stepped up and made shots. We knew
we needed touches for Kara to be effective.  
We didn't have good movement with or without the ball, and I credit K-State, I
think they're a talented team. They've got three players that are as dangerous
as any in the league and they got the ball in their hands and made plays.  
They're efficient with the basketball, and when the ball is -- which the shot
clock is running down, they know how to make plays. This is a team where three
years ago they were freshmen and sophomores, where we had handled and played
probably the best basketball, but now they're seniors and now they're very
experienced.  
And they're players that can make plays, do make plays, and at times make you
look like you don't know what you're doing out there. I think that was
probably the biggest part of tonight's game is mentally I think we shutdown in
the first half, but when we got in, we regrouped in the second half, I thought
with adjustments and a little coaching, a little encouragement, I thought we
responded.  
  
Q. Kara, it looked like you were ready to go from the opening tip. Were you
disappointed that you didn't get a lot of help until it was too late?  
KARA RICHARDS: I think offensively we did attack. Some of the shots weren't
falling, and when they started to fall, especially for Spears, then it took a
lot of pressure off the inside.  
I think defensively, though, we really hooked up, we knew our assignments and
we knew them very well.  
  
Q. Kara, can you talk about playing your last game as a Colorado Buffalo?  
KARA RICHARDS: Yes. I remember --  
THE MODERATOR: Did you want to take a second?  
KARA RICHARDS: Yes. The --  
  
Q. The guards had trouble scoring, and you were chasing them around the
wing. Was that because you were trying to play both ends?  
ALYSSA FRESSLE: I don't know if it was chasing them around, but like Coach
said, we knew we had to go into Kara to be successful, and that made us a
little bit stagnant on the offensive end.  
And I think I forced some things and -- early, and then probably played a
little timid the rest of the game. And I think -- I mean, Spears stepped up,
though. She did well in the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: You want to try again, Kara?  
KARA RICHARDS: Yes, sir. It was difficult going back into the locker room
after the end of the game, knowing that it's not going to be there again. I'm
surely grateful for all five years that I've been here, they've been really
great.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you.  
Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, what do you think players like Alyssa learned this year and what
do they need to do to be more like K-State players when they're older?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: I think her biggest strength and probably her biggest
weakness and that's her will, how strong she is. And I think in high school
she willed herself to be the best and to score and to get her team to where
they needed to be.  
And in saying that, I think it's sometimes her greatest weakness, and not
allowing change in her game and change in some of the things that have been
successful at the high school level.  
I think transitioning for her was greater than she had anticipated it would
be. I think she has learned a great deal from playing in the Big 12. She has
played a lot of minutes as a freshman. We're excited that she was recognized
as one of the top 5 freshmen in the conference, but we know that her best days
are ahead of her.  
And with a willing mind -- there is no doubt she is going to work, but at this
point, I think she knows what it is she needs to work on. As a result of that,
we are going to see a different player next year.  
When you're thrown into it, it's hard to sit back and evaluate. We've tried a
lot of different things with her from film to one-on-one meetings, to chalk
talk, board talk, and even watching edits of players in the WNBA or top
players in the country.  
I know that the desire to get better is there. I think the will to learn and
make some adjustments at this level, once she sits back, that will come with
her.  
  
Q. Kathy, that youthful exuberance from her and some of the others, is that
why the sloppy turnovers, they're ahead of the ball and the ball goes out of
bounds, trying to get back too much when you're falling behind?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: I think if we were deeper, and didn't lose what we
lose when we go to the bench, lack of experience, the ability to pull players
and have a tighter leash would help on things, but there is definitely -- all
I have to draw on is Shalee Lehning as a freshman and her now, the rigors of
night in and night out basketball.  
We are young and our backcourt is young, and we're handling that very well,
from Alyssa to Kelly Jo, we don't have somebody that can control the tempo and
that's a very difficult situation to be in.  
You know, we've tried to manage it and hide it at times and, you know, find
ways to take better care of the basketball. So I think with experience, with
the return of Whitney Houston, with the addition of Chuckie Jeffrey, our
backcourt gets very athletic.  
Whitney does have two years' of experience and the year off is going to be the
best thing for her. It wasn't the best thing for this team, but it will
definitely be the best thing individually for her.  
  
Q. You only got 41 shots tonight, and it looked like 28 of them were from
Spears or Richards. Does that go back to the offense being stagnant?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: I don't think you're going to be very good with only
two people scoring, and I think that evolved this year. If you look at our
season, Bianca averaged 21 points and today it was 5.  
We have needed more scorers all year long, we have not had a consistent third
scorer, and it's evolved into that. And teams have changed the way they played
us, you even have to watch film.  
Statistically you look at a sheet and you know where the shots are coming
from, so even though Kelly Jo Mullaney is probably one of our most consistent
shooters, they were 15 feet off of her to try and stop Kara Richards.  
And as much as we worked on this week, the skip pass, making sure that Kara is
on the opposite side, these players can and have the ability, but you get to
the point throughout the year when you know that Kara can do it and Brittany
has done it, and they get somewhere inside themselves and they don't allow
that to happen.  
We need more scoring. I thought with Jackie gone, we would become a more
balanced scoring team, and we were early on this year, and it's evolved into
another two players.  
I've got to look at myself and figure out how that's happening, and we've got
to look at each other, too, and make sure that we've got the right players in
there that are -- that have the ability and have the mental toughness to take
a shot, and you know, we don't have that right now.  
We were relying on two players. We knew early on that Spears and Kara, they
had scored 48 -- 40 of our 44 points at one point.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about losing a player like Kara Richards, last year
you lost Jackie and now Kara is done, can you talk about what she's meant to
the program?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: I'm proud of her development, there is no doubt about
that. She played quite a bit her freshman year, and her sophomore year she was
injured. And when she came back, she took a backseat to Jackie.  
Jackie had two years under her belt and her personality is "I want to take
care of people", and she would do everything within her power to make sure
Jackie got what she needed and she stepped aside.  
And I think it wasn't until Jackie left that she realized she had the skill
and the ability, and she continued to work on it, and once she had a little
success, you saw the mental toughness, the heart.  
And this is one thing I've said after every game, the one thing that we know
is Colorado has Kara Richards' heart. Every game, every practice, every time-
out she was the one that was pulling people together, she is a great leader.  
I think lesser teams, as far as chemistry and leadership, would fall apart in
seasons like this, when it's so up and down and inconsistent, but I think she,
from a leadership standpoint, kept them together on and off the floor. So
she'll be missed.  
And, you know, just as Jackie left and left a spot for her, I think she'll
hopefully have prepared Courtney and Julie and led the way for them, so it's a
tough, young woman to lose in your program.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach, thank you very much.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Oklahoma State  63  
Texas Tech - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we're joined by the Texas Tech Red Raiders. Coach Curry,
your thoughts and then we will take questions.  
COACH CURRY: Hats off to Oklahoma State. I thought their second half was very
good and they had some folks step up.  
I thought Spears played like a senior should, Hardeman played like a senior
should, and it's evident that we struggled and we don't have our inside game
or Murphree going. We obviously aren't successful and we missed way too many
looks.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what changed in that second half at the very
beginning, or were they getting better looks, setting better screens?  
KIERRA MALLARD: I think they came out with more energy, hats off to them. We
had a 15-point lead and they came back with more energy.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Shaunte', what were they doing inside that seemed to
give y'all trouble in the paint? Was it anything in particular?  
DOMINIC SEALS: Nothing really in the paint, she was shooting jump shots and
getting the rebound.  
  
Q. Dominic, how frustrating is it, that being your last game and the way
that the last half of your last game here went?  
DOMINIC SEALS: It was frustrating because I feel that I didn't do enough for
my team to win, and as a senior that's not the role to play. These
underclassmen look up to us and it wasn't the way to be. I thought this was my
last game, I wanted it to go differently, and I didn't play hard.  
  
Q. Did this mirror the beginning of the second half in Norman last week?  
COACH CURRY: You know, definitely, I think for whatever reason, you know, it
does fall -- I take it pretty hard, how do you juggle your lineup that got you
a 15-point lead, but it's inexcusable to come out the way we did to start the
second half.  
At some point, the will to win and be successful you can't give that to a
bunch of kids. I think that's the most disappointing about how we started the
second half. We seemed to flow throughout it. I thought Maria Moore had a lot
about her. She didn't the other night.  
Our inconsistency all year long is what's hurt us. She has a big night and
Seals and Murphree don't, and they have a big night and she doesn't.  
We aren't at the point where we are good enough where we have a bad night and
somebody doesn't show up and we can win. At some point in time you have to go,
it's one of those nights where it wasn't meant to be, and you stay positive
and continue to build.  
  
Q. Coach, anymore frustrating because of the way you guys had such a command
in the start?  
COACH CURRY: It's never more frustrating, anytime you aren't successful and
you lose it hurts. You always want to finish strong and feel a lot better.  
Basketball is a game of runs and we were able to make ours early, and they
were able to make theirs pretty much through the second half, and your run has
to be longer. I think you could ask the same question probably, you know, of
our men's game last night.  
It's the way the game goes, it's a 40-minute game and we talked about that at
half, and coming out the first few minutes and establishing ourselves. I've
not been around a group of kids -- at some point the best kind of motivation
is self-motivation. If I could figure it out, I could probably bottle it up
and make a little bit more than a Diet Coke, selling it.  
  
Q. Coach, how much -- with all the returners coming back, how much did they
learn? You said tournament experience is invaluable, how much did they learn
from tonight?  
COACH CURRY: Hopefully a lot. My concerns come back to Ashlee and Jordan
should have learned. So, you know, again, I'm concerned about our leadership a
year from now. They have to be your hardest workers, and Jordan and Ashlee's
work ethic needs to improve in the off-season.  
They've got to get themselves in great shape, we've got a bunch of babies
coming in, we were able to get the recruiting class and we're excited about
who we're about to sign here late and in the direction we're headed. Hop on
the plane earlier than we planned and we'll go to work.  
  
Q. If the WNIT calls, do you have any decision on that?  
COACH CURRY: We will not go to the WNIT.  
  
Q. Does a night like tonight kind of tell what this whole month and week is
like with college basketball?  
COACH CURRY: Say that again.  
  
Q. Tonight is a night where it looks like everything is going to be okay and
it ends up differently, does that tell what it's like for this week?  
COACH CURRY: I think it tells the inconsistency story of our whole year. The
most frustrating part is since these kids have gotten here, we've improved and
we wanted to take a bigger step this year, and we weren't able to find that
consistency.  
But we asked a group of kids to come in and try to be consistent real quick,
and they've had their heart in the right place and tried to do the right
things and that's what hurts for me tonight. My heart goes out to those five
seniors who have tried to stick it out and do the right thing every day. You
can't make 'em have consistency, and I didn't help them to do that enough,
game in and game out.  
  
Q. The way that the predetermined sites work out, the city has one, the team
doesn't make it in, what do you think is going to be important for the City of
Lubbock to come out and support that event, even though Tech won't be
playing?  
COACH CURRY: No question, I'll be the first one in the stands to support the
event. And we need the Red Raider Nation to rally as we build this back. And
regardless if we're playing or not, we need folks to come out and support the
event.  
I know folks will step up, they have been and will continue to, and all we can
do is stay positive, and to know the right thing to do on the 22nd and the
24th. And that's what I've tried to do from day one, and that's what I've
tried to do to make it back. And now we need everybody to come out and support
the event and hopefully they will.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your comments.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2009

  

### [Kurt Budke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14197)

### [Taylor Hardeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18118)

### [Shaunte Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18174)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Oklahoma State  63  
Texas Tech - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: We would like to welcome Coach Budke and his student athletes.
Coach, your thoughts about tonight's game and congratulations on the win.  
COACH BUDKE: I've got to say, it wasn't in the plan to fall behind 15 points
and come back, but it says something for the ladies sitting up here.  
The players weren't ready for their careers to be done. We could have stopped
and rode it out and not gave it our best shot once we fell behind, but really,
really proud of the girls tonight.  
Just happy for my seniors because these are two people that were very big
parts of getting this done tonight. There has never been any "quit" in any one
of these two, and we're still alive. We move on.  
  
Q. Taylor, can you talk about the beginning of the second half? I mean, it's
obvious you weren't ready for your last Big 12 tournament to be over.  
TAYLOR HARDEMAN: I give credit to my teammates for screening for me and Andrea
to distribute the ball, that's the only way shooters can get shots. I'm glad
she dribbled in and created and gave me an actual shot.  
I really wasn't thinking, I just knew that somebody had to step up and hit a
shot. I didn't want to go out this way and I won't, and that's what I was
thinking.  
  
Q. Shaunte', you made the statement yesterday, you talked about the last
week being one of the best weeks of practice. What was the expectation, and
when you had the start you had, did that diminish it or did that strengthen it
somewhat?  
SHAUNTE' SMITH: Our shots weren't falling, but like I said, we did have two or
three good days of practice and we never quit. I'm proud of my teammates for
going out there and hustling, and we came together as a team and we overcame
the adversity and this was a big win for us.  
TAYLOR HARDEMAN: You know, I would have to say that when you have a good week
of practice, it makes you feel good going into the games. We did tremendous,
we moved on defense, we worked our offense well, and we just didn't give up
and that's what's been our statement.  
We can't give up because, yeah, it's been rough, but I'm never going to quit,
and I know Shaunte' is not and the rest of our team is not. So like she said,
we did great tonight. I'm really proud of ourselves.  
  
Q. Shaunte', what was said at halftime?  
COACH BUDKE: Be careful!  
SHAUNTE' SMITH: We were playing hard, we held them to 28 points for them, we
were playing good defense, we had good shots and they weren't falling.  
And in the second half, Taylor gave us a good spark coming in with four
3-pointers in the three minutes, and we had to work through our shots and
adversity, that's about it.  
  
Q. Taylor, late in the first half you guys had made a run, but you could
tell you were double digits down, you come out in the second half and hit four
big 3-pointers. And when you're on the bench, you're giving everybody high
five's.  
Go through what this means as a senior and when you come back and going into
tomorrow.  
TAYLOR HARDEMAN: Our bench is good at keeping us alive, and I think our bench
did a great job of keeping us up.  
Emotionwise, I looked at her and I thought, we were not going to lose this
game. We were going to do whatever it took, no matter if I had to dive on the
floor, knock somebody out-of-bounds, whatever we needed to do, that's what we
were going to do and we weren't going to stop until it happened.  
  
Q. Y'all, with the 3-pointers, it wasn't there last time you faced Tech in
Stillwater, so talk about not giving up and controlling Murphree, who had 20
points against y'all last time.  
TAYLOR HARDEMAN: She's a great player. She is tough to guard, and guarding her
was part of my game plan, where I'm thinking, I'm going to shut her down and I
don't care if I score points.  
When I do that the offense comes more for me. Hitting three's is great, but I
have to give credit to my teammates because I wouldn't be able to make 'em
without them.  
  
Q. Same question, Seals had a big game last time, she got rebounds, but what
did she have, 6 points? Talk about what you did as a team to slow her down.  
SHAUNTE' SMITH: She is a great player. I just focused on playing great
defense, me and Megan and Shyvon, we did good on her and we blocked out and
rebounded.  
COACH BUDKE: She's going to try to give credit to other people, but it was her
that got it done right here.  
  
Q. What was going on across the street, seeds are dropping like flies. So
you're in that position. Is this strong enough, this league strong enough to
see the seeds drop tomorrow in the quarterfinals?  
TAYLOR HARDEMAN: Absolutely, absolutely.  
SHAUNTE' SMITH: Yes.  
TAYLOR HARDEMAN: So proud of the guys, we heard the crowd. We were like, our
guys won, we cannot go down without a loss, we have to win this game. Get all
the OSU fans fired up and ready for basketball. It gets you excited as a
player.  
  
Q. Coach, I wanted your thoughts on the first five minutes or so in the
second half that seemed to put the momentum in your favor.  
COACH BUDKE: There was a lot of things discussed at halftime, but one of the
things discussed was, you know what, we couldn't have shot any worse than we
did and we're only down 11. We were down 11 to Nebraska the other night and
came back without Andrea.  
We knew we couldn't possibly shoot 22% again, we hoped anyway. I didn't look,
what did we shoot in the second half.  
  
Q. 59%.  
COACH BUDKE: That's different, isn't it? You know, we said, hey, let's get a
good start, ease our way back into this like we did the other night at home.
Let's give ourselves a chance and we talked about, college players have to hit
shots. And they did.  
And Taylor, right before halftime I said, time for you to do something, "let's
go." I should have gave that speech earlier in the game.  
  
Q. Have you ever had a team start 0-13 and not score the first seven minutes
of the game?  
COACH BUDKE: Was it 15-0?  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
COACH BUDKE: I can't say that -- we were talking about that and they said,
Coach, we were down 18-2 at K.U. last year and we came back and won. I can't
remember that, no. We shot the ball so well all week long, Mike.  
But as we're watching Texas and Missouri play, we saw how many balls went in,
went out, came out, and I was thinking to myself, I hope that doesn't happen
to us, because you could see it in the game before us, and I don't know if
it's nerves or whatever. But, no, I gotta say, if you're in this game long
enough, you'll see everything, and we saw something tonight.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about how difficult it is to win four games in four
days, like you did on the junior college level, but a lot of times when a team
gets momentum it can carry over. What will this do for you tomorrow against a
good Baylor team?  
COACH BUDKE: You're exactly right, you can and sometimes it's a disadvantage
to have that bye. We're used to the rims and the feel of the court, and
hopefully we'll carry this 59% over against Baylor.  
They're a great team, there is no question about that. One thing we're all
ignoring here tonight is Andrea Riley played a great point guard in the second
half. I mean a great point guard in the second half.  
Taylor hit the shots, but there had to be someone penetrating and kickin' to
get them the shots. And I told Andrea, that's one of the better jobs she's
done runin' the team all year long.  
  
Q. Talk about the minutes that Mercardo and Clardy gave you.  
COACH BUDKE: She's always ready, and the 3 she hit, I didn't think the ball
was in her hands. She got it off so quick and drained it, but that's because
she puts in the extra time every day.  
If you're going to win four games in four days, we're going to have to have an
Ally or Melinda step up. And I thought Mercardo's defense was good at the end
of the game. She brings energy into the game whenever she comes in, and
everybody that played tonight contributed and that was fun for the team.  
  
Q. You said last night we would find out altogether, and obviously the first
half wasn't that, but maybe the second half, take away the discipline part of
the suspension for Andrea, but maybe it cleared the air a little bit, allowed
things to equalize or something for her to play the point guard position.  
COACH BUDKE: Robert, I can't answer that, I don't know. I don't know exactly
how they feel or how they felt about the suspension, and that's -- but I know
this: Andrea Riley worked hard to get the ball to her teammates tonight and
they responded, and rewarded her. We talk about that all the time.  
Now if she's going to work that hard to make people collapse and kick to ya,
you've got to hit your shots. You've got to reward your point guard by making
those shots. This was a great team win, it wasn't one person.  
  
Q. Hardeman was 6 for her last 30 something, what were your thoughts after
she made the second one, anything go through your head?  
COACH BUDKE: We ran a couple of things for her because when she gets hot, we
-- in fact the last set we ran for her, I think she shot it 4 feet behind the
line, and that is out of her range, but she was feelin' it at the time.  
This game is easier to coach when you have three or four that can be weapons
on the floor at the same time. We had that last year, and we came up a little
bit short this year, but I'm just so proud of these kids for not quitting. I
know they will be ready to play tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much and good luck tomorrow.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 29, 2009

  

### [Coquese Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18021)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: I'm excited about the start of the season. I think this is
going to be a really competitive year for Big Ten basketball.  
  
Q. How do you judge the Big Ten Conference in comparison to other
conferences such as the ACC?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Well, I think you look at a couple factors. One, you look
at what we did in the postseason last year. We had three teams play in the
Sweet 16. We actually have the highest winning percentage of any conference in
the country coming out of first- and second-round play. We had five teams in
and three teams make it to the Sweet 16 for a 60 percent average, which was
the best in the country. We had a team make it to the Elite 8. I think we have
really strong teams, strong coaches, and when you look at the players we have
in our conference, Jantel Lavender, Brittany Rayburn from Purdue, Tyra Grant
from Penn State, we've got a lot of quality players coming back. And I think
that's going to make our conference one of the best and most competitive in
the conference, including looking at the ACC and the Big East and even the Big
12.  
  
Q. What are your impressions of your freshmen since they arrived on campus
and are now into the first couple weeks of practice?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: I'm really, really excited about our freshmen class. I
think they're going to have a tremendous impact on our program, not just this
year but in the years to come. They are all really competitive. They're a fun
bunch. They like to have fun. And the talent that they bring makes practice a
lot more competitive than it has been, which I think will have an impact on us
in terms of our game day performance.  
  
Q. How do you think teams that rank in the bottom of the Big Ten Conference
play competitively in your season? In other words, how do you think programs
like Michigan, Northwestern and Indiana are going to affect your team?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Well, I think our conference, honestly, is the most
competitive conference in the country, top to bottom. There might be a
conference that might be a little more top-heavy, but from 1 to 11, I don't
know that there's another conference that has the quality of play in the
bottom half that we have.  
And so when you ask about the bottom half of the conference, I think we've got
a conference this year -- I think Ohio State and Michigan State are probably
the cream of the crop, but then 3 through 11, I think anybody can be in any
place. I don't know that that's true with any other conference in the country
where you can look at 9, 10, 11, and say, you know, they can be one of the top
three teams in the conference.  
So I think they are going to make the conference more competitive, and one of
the reasons we were successful last season in postseason play was because our
conference is competitive. There are no days off, even if you're playing the
last place team in the conference. If you don't bring your "A" game, you can
be upset. So I think the bottom half of our conference is extremely
competitive.  
  
Q. Being one of the top scorers in the Big Ten, how is Tyra Grant preparing
herself for being the focal point of opposing teams' defense?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: A couple things. She worked on her conditioning over the
summer, slimmed up a little bit so she can have a little bit more stamina to
be able to get through a 40-minute game. She's gotten a little bit stronger in
the weight room. And I think most of it is just mental, the mental approach to
the game, understanding that she is the focal point and being patient to take
good shots and not let the defense kind of ease her into taking shots that she
probably doesn't want to take.  
  
Q. You guys have a lot of experience in the backcourt and not so much in the
frontcourt. How much are you going to be leaning on your frontcourt players
this year and your guards?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Say that again.  
  
Q. How much are you going to be leaning on that experience and that quality
of play you have in the frontcourt with Tyra Grant and players like that?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Well, we do have some experience in the post game. We
return Julia Trogele and we return Janessa Wolff inside, but overall I think
we're really young. We've got out of our 12 players that are active, eight of
them are freshmen and sophomores, so we're going to be young across the board.
There are going to be times where we're going to have some really young
lineups on the floor.  
I expect our veterans to help us in practice and to be leaders by example, and
if they can do that and help our young players find some success early in the
season and take pressure off of our young players to perform early in the
season, then I think that will bode well for us once we get to conference
play.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 29, 2009

  

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
SHARON VERSYP: I'm very excited for our season to start. We've had the injury
bug, we've had the flu, we've had concussions, we've had everything possible.
About seven players on the court, and we've just got to now be very, very
patient and hopefully by November 1st we'll get quite a few players back.  
But we're very excited. We are a young team, but I think our three guards,
they say we have only two starting guards back, but I think Brittany Rayburn
could have started for us last year, and I think we did an exceptional job of
bringing her along. But I feel our three guards will really help us.  
And then our inside down low, Sam Woods will really step up for us. She's a
red shirt, and she's got some amazing skill, and when Chelsea Jones and Alex
Guyton joins us in December, I think our inside game will grow just as well,
and just looking for a good, exciting year.  
  
Q. FahKara is certainly kind of bringing K. K. Along. How do you think Sam O
and Chelsea is doing, and who's bringing them along?  
SHARON VERSYP: Well, I think Chelsea Jones learned a lot from our three
seniors last year. I think just understanding how to push -- Chelsea has
transformed her body, has transformed her mindset, is performing at a high
level for someone who didn't play a lot last year. We have a transfer in Drey
Mingo who is one of the top players in the country going into Maryland, and
she is going to make Chelsea better every day. Her job is to be the best
practice player in the post every day to elevate her game. But I think Sam
Woods also will help Chelsea and some Ostarello because Sam has now been able
to red shirt and learn a lot, she can play inside and outside. But I think the
biggest thing is just empowering their confidence because Chelsea Jones
definitely can score down low.  
  
Q. Could you just update us on Ashley Wilson and Alex Guyton as far as
timeline now? I think they've had a few doctors' appointments since the last
time we talked to you.  
SHARON VERSYP: Ashley Wilson just started doing some practice with us last
week. She's done nothing for five months basketball-wise per se. She can just
do half court. We're starting to do some full-court stuff with her today. Just
gradually bringing her back.  
So I think she's excited to be on the court. She's the body that we need.
She's extremely physical. She's extremely quick. She's going to be able to
bring that three-guard position to have five guards or four for us. So we'll
take baby steps with her because we want to make sure we have her the entire
year. But I feel that she'll be able to play in our first games. May not be a
long length of time, but ten minutes would be fantastic. That's my goal.  
As for Alex Guyton she will not be able to start doing basketball skills until
December 10th. So she'll be ready for the Big Ten, but within a month she has
to get in shape and get the skills and get the kinks out. But again, her
timeline is like a month behind Ashley's right now.  
  
Q. In your opening statement you mentioned seven players. Have you
encountered another injury recently?  
SHARON VERSYP: No, we had the flu, Antoinette had the flu, so she was out.
Drey had a concussion, so she was out for a while. So I mean, there for a
while we had seven players. But we have 11 right now, so it's exciting. For us
everyone gets more excited when the kids come back. Sometimes when you have
everybody there, other kids have to step up. So I think we've grown in a lot
of areas because a lot of people have gotten a lot of rest and can build their
confidence obviously a little bit more. But we'll be fine. I'd rather have it
now than later.  
  
Q. You guys had a pretty impressive away record last year, even better than
Michigan State and things, and a lot of teams have trouble away. I guess you
guys don't seem to have that trouble. Do you think there's any reason for
that?  
SHARON VERSYP: I think it's our preparation, but I also think the last three
years we've had experience. I think our first year we had two experienced
seniors and just have that mentality, us-against-the-world mentality, and our
back is always against the wall. No one has ever thought Purdue was ever going
to be good the last three years. We use it as an advantage, that reverse
psychology, and then it just kind of becomes contagious. You have to be
tougher, you're more focused on the road than you are at home. You have less
distractions. And we hope that continues for our young group. I mean, we have
seven sophomores, three freshmen and three seniors, so we're very young. About
four of those sophomores cannot play this year.  
I think it's just our coaching staff does a great job of getting their mind
exactly where it needs to be.  
  
Q. How do you assess teams at the bottom of the Big Ten Conference such as
Michigan, Wisconsin?  
SHARON VERSYP: I assess that the entire Big Ten, the parity is going to be
amazing. I think people don't give our coaches and our program enough credit.
I think that we have a very young conference in players and a very young
conference in coaches and a lot of coaching changes. So I think competitively
recruiting-wise, everybody has done an exceptional job. Every year it's going
to continue to get better. You're seeing a different style. So I don't think
the bottom of the Big Ten is going to be the bottom of the Big Ten. I think
they're going to have some wins and losses.  
But from top to bottom, I think we're going to be exceptionally good for the
next -- starting from here on in.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the challenges of playing a Big Ten game in early
December right in the middle of your non-conference season and how you go
about getting a team prepared for something like that.  
SHARON VERSYP: I think it's a difficult challenge for us because we play the
Big Ten-ACC Challenge right before then, so it's not like you're having an
opponent that you get to choose and pick. I think if you're on the road and
you're flying back and you have two days to try to prepare, I think it's going
to be difficult. I think it's going to be a pivotal game for everybody. I
don't think people realize how that one loss could cause you not to get to the
NCAA or maybe not get seeded the right way.  
I think for young teams like ourselves, it probably has more of a challenge
because you have to prepare young people's mindsets so different. I think if
you're an experienced team you do have an advantage. It is what it is, and we
have to prepare. But I guess for us how I'm going to prepare is that we're
playing an ACC to prepare for our Big Ten, so now that's how I'm going to be
coaching and changing the psychology of it.  
  
Q. With most of your team's experience out on the perimeter, how is the
development of some of the younger post players on your squad?  
SHARON VERSYP: I mean, for us we know that that's -- with Alex Guyton being
out, it hurts us. Alex had a lot of experience, and so now when she comes
back, it's like she starts all over a little bit. So I think that will hurt
us.  
We have talent. And sometimes when you have talent and kids that want to work
exceptionally hard, those two things are a good combination, and they're
always eager to learn.  
However, I think our guard experience is only going to elevate the post
players because we know how to pass the ball a little bit better. We know how
and when to get them the basketball in position where they can do and be
successful. So I think our guards will enhance that.  
But you will see this year that we will go four guards and one post a lot.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 29, 2009

  

### [Lisa Stone](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16858)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
LISA STONE: We're very excited about the return of our entire team. Over 80
percent of our scoring is back, tremendous leadership, great off-season for
us. We're very motivated to have hopefully what we're hoping to be our best
year yet.  
Defensively we made great strides last year and we're building on that.
Offensively we've changed a few things up and excited about the changes in
terms of our offensive ability and looking forward to a great non-conference
season in preparation for the Big Ten and postseason.  
  
Q. What's the learning curve been like for your players adjusting to this
new offense?  
LISA STONE: They're excited because I think sometimes anytime there's
something new, it's like new freshmen, they're all eager. When you walk them
through and know that you can see the lights going on in their head because as
an offense it's less pattern and more reads, and taking the chemistry off the
floor onto the floor and learning how to work with each other has been
rewarding for them.  
They're excited about it. They're excited about the ability to just play the
game instead of playing the play, and that excites the players. They've caught
on very quickly. There's days where it looks messy. But right now you're
building up fundamental passing and catching, taking care of the basketball,
and that's in any offense.  
But overall, our spacing and timing is pretty decent right now. We'll find out
in some early games where we're at and how to build from it. But every single
day there's something we grow and learn from it, we talk a lot about it. But
it's an offense that's really fun to play, and the players have really grasped
it well.  
  
Q. Talk about Teah Gant. I know she's one of two seniors, also Rae Lin
coming back. Talk about what you expect out of her this year and some things
she worked on in the off-season, leadership-wise, those types of things.  
LISA STONE: Teah Gant and Rae Lin really are two seniors. Rae Lin has been to
this event with me the previous two years, and she and Teah, they've been one
of the most successful classes in a long time in Badger history in terms of
postseason play. They're hungry for the next step.  
So their leadership and their dedication and their work ethic -- when your
veteran players are two of your hardest workers, that's a great step in the
right direction. Teah Gant is a very quiet leader. She leads by example. Her
classroom strength, her off-the-court, she's an engineering major, does very,
very well, and she's quiet, but when she speaks in practice and she steps up
to the plate, people listen. She's like E.F. Hutton, she steps right up and
people listen when she speaks. It's been a great transition for Teah taking
over a leadership role.  
Both she and Rae Lin will share time at the point guard, and that will allow
us to be versatile with some of our new players on the perimeter, as well.  
  
Q. You talked about your new offense. I guess what led to the changes? And
does your offense have a name?  
LISA STONE: It's four on one end. That's what it is. It's a four on one end
motion offense. What brought about the changes, our personnel. This offense
fits our personnel better. Really it's going to look a lot like the swing. The
swing is four around one, as well, but we're trying to stretch it out a little
bit more, a little more screen reads, a little more freedom to play, and
hopefully get to the foul line more, more post touches, screens that lead to
scores. But it's a four-around-one motion offense. That's the title.  
  
Q. Alyssa Karel made significant strides from her freshman to sophomore
seasons. What are your expectations of her during her junior year?  
LISA STONE: Alyssa is a fun player to watch. To our little friend down in
Monroe, she is a fan favorite. I think certainly because of who she is.
Getting to no Alyssa Karel as a nursing major, a very strong, one of our very
best nursing majors at the University of Wisconsin. She carries that
intelligence on the floor. Offensively the freedom that now Alyssa has room to
work, maybe a double gap for penetration fits Alyssa Karel very well.  
The other thing is Alyssa is not going to have to carry the entire scoring
load herself, like she had to last year. She's going to have a lot of help
because people have worked on their games. It's been quite evident early on
that they've worked on their offensive skills in the off-season, and we'll get
contributions from others besides Alyssa. But she's a fun player to watch, and
her junior year is going to be an exciting one for her.  
  
Q. During your tenure, your teams have generally struggled during conference
play, so what does this team need to do this season to get over that hump?  
LISA STONE: Well, we've talked about it. We talked about it to start the
season off. For instance, just use last year as an example. We go 10-1 in non-
conference and then conference play comes, and do we change into a different
team? No, we're still the same people. A, it has a lot to do with the strength
of our conference. B, when we reach that conference play, that's when we get
even tougher. We've talked about that. We as a staff, myself as a head coach,
to communicate with our players exactly where we're at and what we need to do,
and then to weather the storms. It's not a perfect year. You're going to run
into some adversity, you're going to run into some tough losses, hopefully not
an injury but maybe, off-court distractions. Whatever it may be, and to
overcome those things is key because the season is very long, and the Big Ten
season is right during that tough time.  
We talk about it as a team every single day right now because our chemistry is
at an all-time high. That's easy to say because everybody is happy, no playing
time has been handed out, everybody is in a good mood. But going into the
season I firmly believe in this basketball team, and I know that we can,
again, communicate day-by-day roles, understanding roles and defining those
roles so when we get to Big Ten play, people know exactly where they're at and
what has to be done.  
  
Q. How competitive do you think your team will be this year in the
conference? Are you more worried about or focused on beating the lower teams
like Michigan and Indiana, or do you think that you will totally turn it
around with the record?  
LISA STONE: Our focus is to compete to win every single game, whether it's
non-conference or conference game. We were in every game defensively last
year, and we're going to take that, and that's not going to soften us, we're
going to hopefully make our defense even stronger this year because we have a
veteran squad in terms of our defense. It's in our second year. Offensively
it's our first year with the new offense. My hope is that we don't throw the
ball away every five minutes. We've got to take care of the basketball and
reward our defense.  
We're focused on every team in the Big Ten. I think a coach is making a big
mistake if they don't prepare for every single game because this league is
very, very talented this year. It's going to be fun to watch, and it's my hope
to have one of the largest representations in the NCAA Tournament this year.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 29, 2009

  

### [Suzy Merchant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17249)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
Q. You guys are picked to finish second in the conference in both polls. How
do you keep these girls focused on that end prize that you've talked about
going to the Final Four? And does it worry you a bit about complacency setting
in after getting as far as you did last year?  
SUZY MERCHANT: No, I think a lot of our complacency issues that maybe came up
were answered in the last 64 seconds of the Iowa State game. I think losing
the way we did when we had control of that game, I think our kids kind of took
that negative experience and frustration and carried it over into the off-
season, had a little bit different swagger. I think if you can turn a negative
into a positive, this team did.  
Quite honestly, I think we're too much of a veteran group to really allow
ourselves to not keep our eye on the prize.  
  
Q. How has the team started playing Allyssa DeHaan differently as they've
seen her more often?  
SUZY MERCHANT: I think they're more difficult with her. They really try to
push her off the block, and really when she's down low, there's no question
that there's a stronger physical presence down there defensively. I mean, I
just think there's someone that -- she has the height and certainly has a lot
of talent, but she doesn't always match up with the strengths of some of the
other kids. So I think when you look at the Big Ten, I think people really do
try to -- they do a couple things to her. Offensively I think they try to beat
her up a little bit and try to get away with some things, and then defensively
they try to bring her away from the basket so she can't block shots. So I
would say on each side of the ball those are the answers.  
  
Q. Just kind of a follow-up to Allyssa, is that the next phase of her game,
that she needs to get better as far as strength, or is she maxed out at that,
or what's her next step, I guess?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Well, I think -- I don't know if she's ever going to be strong.
She's just not built that way. I think when you have a 6'9" frame, and she's
on the leaner side, we've really worked at it, but she's just someone who
isn't going to get a whole lot heftier and stronger. She works at it, but her
frame isn't built that way. For her it's just been a little more of the mental
side and kind of handling that kind of physical play.  
I think earlier in her career maybe it got to her a little bit. I think her
freshman year nobody really knew how to play her, and by her sophomore and
junior year figured it out, and I think over those two years she's figured out
mentally probably more importantly how to handle that.  
  
Q. Can you kind of sum up what you view the Big Ten as right now? The
conference itself takes a lot of hits sometimes, especially like Kevin had
said, teams beat up on each other, records get a little bit skewed compared to
where the talent level of the team is. Can you kind of assess where the
conference is as a whole. And then also kind of give an overview for this year
a little bit of what you see.  
SUZY MERCHANT: Sure. You know, I couldn't agree more with him. I think
nationally I'm not sure exactly what people think, but I know, for example,
the Northwestern coach, Joe McKeowon, came in here this year and it was his
first year in the league and he had spent 19 years at G Dub. His perception of
the league when he got in here was a lot different. It's so competitive top to
bottom. I think the coaching in the league and the recruiting in the league
from the first-place team all the way through is just high quality. And so
night in and night out, it's a true conference where anybody can beat anybody.  
I think we are excited about as a conference moving away from 18 games and
going to 16 games, because when you have the perception of people always
beating up on each other, it makes it look like the league isn't as strong.
But actually I feel like when that does happen, top to bottom your league is
probably as tough as other leagues, versus a league that has three or four
dominating teams and everybody else is kind of a drop-off.  
So I feel like this year is going to be a really good example to show on a
national scale that this is a league that's very challenging top to bottom,
and every night you have to bring your best game.  
  
Q. What teams are you particularly worried about?  
SUZY MERCHANT: All of them (laughing). We're coaches; we worry about
everything.  
Honestly, it is, just as I had mentioned the parity in the league and the
strength in the league, so I can't say that there's one team that we're not
going to be certainly respectful of and worried about. You know, every style
is different, and every coach has a different style, and sometimes the style
worries you, sometimes the personnel worries you.  
I mean, it just depends on what night and who you're playing.  
I mean, I think everyone poses their own challenges, so to name certain teams
is really hard for me to do sitting up here. I just think it's a little bit
difficult to do that as a coach up here. I think everyone is so talented in
different ways.  
  
Q. After reaching the Sweet 16 last season, what are the team's goals for
this year?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Probably the same that they've always been. I mean, we
certainly want to win a Big Ten title, and the goal of this team is to push as
far as we can and obviously get to an opportunity of a Final Four and a
national championship game. Will we get there? I don't know, time will tell.
But that's certainly the goals of our team.  
  
Q. Just kind of going back to the strength of the conference conversation,
did last year's postseason show a little bit more about what this league is
about, between you guys going deep and kind of maybe surprising a few people,
and Purdue going as deep as they did and some of the other teams?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Yeah, I think that's the part of your question I didn't answer,
so I apologize. Yeah, I definitely think you look at the five teams that went
to the postseason. I think four of us beat -- obviously three of us were Elite
8, Sweet 16 teams. But Minnesota ended up, upsetting Notre Dame in the first
round, we beat a No. 1 seed. So I think that hopefully last year's performance
gives us a little more credibility out there.  
I think there's a vision and a belief that other conferences are a little
stronger, but at the end of the day, we had three teams finish in the Sweet 16
and one in the Elite 8 and one with an opportunity to play for a Final Four. I
really hope that we can build on that, and I think nationally we can get our
message out that this is a good and strong conference.  
  
Q. I'm just trying to do some overview stuff here. On a national scale right
now, you've got UConn, and then it seems like there's a lot of teams, again,
that are right in the same mix, you could maybe say two, three, four, five all
in the same mix. Can you kind of survey what you see as the national scene
right now in terms of who would be -- outside of UConn obviously, who can be
strong contenders from what you see?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Well, it's so early right now to really pinpoint that, and
there's a lot of games to be played. I think that's a tough question to answer
right now until you can get a little bit into the season. But I think the one
thing that's really a positive is that it is starting to do this. You know,
there used to be just -- in the women's game, and to grow our sport, to really
have growth in our sport, we need to do what we're doing now, where a No. 9
seed does upset a No. 1 or Minnesota can go into Notre Dame and upset a Notre
Dame. That has to happen for the good of the game, honestly. People aren't
interested when it's just one or two teams. That's what it's been lately up
until I would say the last few years. You can see the shift starting to change
a little bit. The domination isn't always there every year, year in and year
out.  
I think that's a positive thing for our game, because I really believe that
when you look at where women's basketball is, it's kind of like in the '70s
when UCLA men were going, nobody really wanted to turn on the game because
UCLA is going to win it again, I'll wait for the national championship game.
I'm not sure it was good for college basketball. And now it's obviously not
like that. It can be anybody from anywhere throughout the country in the men's
game, and there's a lot of upsets, and I think our women's game is starting to
get there and has really made a shift in that direction.  
To answer your question, I think the parity thing is a good thing, but to name
some of those teams for me is probably a little difficult right now.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 29, 2009

  

### [Joe McKeown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19252)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
JOE McKEOWN: It's been an interesting transition from 20 years at one school,
at George Washington, to Northwestern, and then to the Big Ten. Last year was
really a year that I felt like our goal was to change the culture of
basketball there, lay a foundation, and try to build off that. And I felt like
for the most part we did that. We were very competitive, and most of the games
that we played, we won a few, and our goal this year is to win a few more and
be a little more competitive and go from there.  
We have five new freshmen which I think will really change our team this year,
even though some days you wish they were sophomores. But other than that, it's
really exciting for our players now. They feel like there's some continuity
this year and things are a little bit more stable. That's probably the best
word I can come up with. Yeah, really looking forward to the season.  
  
Q. First year in the league, just kind of your perception of the league now
that you've been in it a year and kind of your perception before you got
here.  
JOE McKEOWN: Well, I'll tell you, the year before that, I had a great team. We
were ranked 8th or 9th in the country, got to the Sweet 16 and felt like we
had a chance to make a run at the Final Four. In that two-year stretch a lot
of people nationwide and in our business, really the Big Ten was a little
down, and people didn't have great respect for it, and teams weren't moving,
weren't advancing in the NCAA Tournament. So when I came into that, that was
the thing that was on my mind, how I looked at the league.  
Once I got here, I must have hit the senior year, because we had a great
conference last year. We had five teams in the tournament. You could have made
a case for one more. But Purdue, Michigan State, Ohio State, those teams
separated themselves out in the NCAA Tournament, and I think that's what had
been missing from the Big Ten, because really, in our business, you're going
to be judged by what you do in March as much as anything else.  
So my perceptions are the league is a lot better than I thought. I was really
impressed with the coaching. And I felt like every team had quality players.
You know, some better than others, obviously, but it was a tough league. It
was a tough league to play on the road, some great home courts in our league.
Hopefully I can be one of those teams at some point soon.  
  
Q. How has your freshman class adjusted to the first couple weeks of
practice? And what are your impressions of them so far?  
JOE McKEOWN: Our freshman class, one of the things that's different at
Northwestern than I think probably most schools in our league, we're on a
quarter system, so we don't even start school until September 21st or 22nd. So
they come in a lot later than most schools.  
I know I talked to Tennessee, they had started August 20th, so they had a
whole month of school, conditioning before we even were handing out a pair of
socks. So I think that's been a little bit different for us.  
They've adjusted quickly, still some ups and downs, but I think they're going
to be fine. I have two freshmen, and I will elaborate on them: One from Las
Vegas, Nevada, Dannielle Diamant, 6'4", who has great basketball bloodlines.
Her grandfather Jerry Tarkanian won a couple national championships with UNLV,
is in the Hall of Fame. So I'm hoping that winning tradition carries over with
her.  
And then Kendall Hackney who was the Player of the Year at Ohio last year,
freshman, 6'3", can really play. So those two I think have stood out so far
and hopefully will make us better right away.  
  
Q. You've been around Amy Jaeschke now for a year. I guess what's the next
step in her development and what she needs to do to improve her game?  
JOE McKEOWN: I think Amy Jaeschke had a chance to see -- I've been coaching
women's basketball since 1979, so I've seen so many great players come through
over the years, and she is as skilled as any big player out there. She's 6'5",
can shoot threes, is a great passer, posts up, and I think she's just now
coming into her own. I really believe she's one of the premier post players in
the country. And we're in a league where you have some outstanding post
players, an abundance of them when you talk about especially last year the
Wisdom-Hyltons and Lavenders. It seemed like everybody had somebody 6'5" out
there.  
I just feel like maybe she might be one of the most underrated players in
college basketball right now. I think for that to change, we have to put her
out there a little bit, and I think she has to obviously play well. She's
finally gotten herself into the condition of a high-level athlete. She's
surrounded now with teammates who are somewhat her size. So we're not out
there -- we reinvented the 5'9" power forward last year in the Big Ten; that
was our team. So every time we raised our arms they just wouldn't go very far.  
I think that helps her a lot. She's now surrounded by 6'2", 6'3" people, and
it just makes her game a lot easier to play, and we can do a lot more with
her. That was a long answer, but I'll tell you, she's a terrific player.  
  
Q. You definitely have Amy Jaeschke and a lot of strong frontcourt players.
How do you evaluate your backcourt and how are they going to match up with the
rest of the Big Ten?  
JOE McKEOWN: Well, I think that's right now my biggest concern is that our
guard players have got to step up from last year. I felt like that was an
Achilles for us. Usually when you take over a program that struggled, you
usually have a couple of guards floating around that aren't very big. Our
strength was inside.  
We have a freshman guard from Kansas City Inesha Hill that I think is really
going to help, and then Jenny Eckhart and Meshia Reed, a lot of players,
Kristin Cartwright, they were all coming off injuries from the year before, a
really bad year, and they've all gotten a lot better.  
I think Kristin Cartwright had some great games in the league. She's a
potential All Big Ten Player in the league as a senior. Jenny Eckhart, those
guys have been around a while, they kind of just didn't have any confidence,
but they have talent to compete with the rest of the guards in the Big Ten.  
But that's something that we're going to have to really evaluate and get
better at.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you think the veteran teams like Minnesota, if they
think there's less of a threat like Michigan, Northwestern, with a lot of
younger players.  
JOE McKEOWN: Do they think? I'm sorry?  
Well, we beat Minnesota the last week of the season last year and probably
played our best game of the year and almost knocked them out of the NCAA
Tournament, which probably would have been a bad thing.  
But I think the one thing about the league right now, we have some teams at
the top that are coming off great teams, have great players back. Obviously
Ohio State and Michigan State, you look at their rosters, and Minnesota beat
Notre Dame in the NCAA Tournament. But I do feel like there's really -- I
think we're closing the gap. I guess that's what I mean. Not just talent-wise,
but I think teams are capable. It seems like this could be a year where
there's a lot of parity in our league. You're going to see any number of teams
can beat each other. I hope that's the case for us, if that makes sense.  
Schools that have traditionally struggled in this league have gone out and
made changes. Schools are not going to stand still when you look at all the
new coaches in the league and all us young coaches that got hired recently.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 29, 2009

  

### [Felisha Legette-Jack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16871)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: We're just excited to be a part, again. We're definitely
a very young team, and this will be our ultimate challenge, to go out there
and compete and represent Indiana University the best way we know how. But
it's exciting to know that Jori Davis and Jamie Braun are back and healthy and
ready to lead our team to hopefully newfound heights.  
  
Q. Great crowds at Assembly Hall last year. How much did that help your
team?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Well, we've been trying to grow our fan base every year,
and our young ladies get out in the community all the time. Just last night
our young ladies were over at the sorority and fraternity row handing out
candy for trick or treaters, early trick or treat they called it. So about
2,000 kids were there. We're getting out there in the school system and
letting you know we want to meet you where you are, and hopefully you'll find
it worthy enough to come and support our young ladies.  
Our Hoosier nation has responded. Our attendance has gotten better every year.
We are not where we want to be but we are certainly better than where we were.
So we're encouraged. We're going to keep playing, and hopefully they keep
coming.  
  
Q. Talk about some of the newcomers on this team that you hope to contribute
as freshmen.  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Well, that's the entire team. We're all very new, even
the people that are juniors and sophomores because they didn't play. We lost
three starters. But who's back is Sasha Chaplin. She blew her knee out in the
fifth game last year, and she's healthy and she's a half inch taller, so she's
about 6'4", 6'4" and a half. She's completely excited about returning. She's
going to be our force in the middle.  
Andujar, she's a young lady that played little minutes last year, but we went
to a trip to Italy, and she was unbelievable. So we're excited that she's
going to be with us.  
I think Little Whitney, we call her "Little Whitney" because we had Big
Whitney last year, but there's no Big Whitney anymore. She's decided
volleyball is her sport and graduation has occurred. We're going to miss that
chick for her. But we do have Little Whitney back, and Little Whitney is a lot
faster. She ran a 40 timed and she ran it in 4.64. Those who know football
times, that young lady is very quick. Sometimes she goes so fast she leaves
the ball behind her, but we're working on things. So she's back.  
We've got some young ladies that are going to be fun to watch. One of them is
Sasha Bernard. She's a point guard out of Florida. She's very quick. She's
flashy. We certainly like that ball to stay on the court. But the way she
passes the ball, it might end up in the third row every now and again. Wear
your helmets if you come to Bloomington, Indiana. You guys are so boring.
That's funny. That's my best joke you're going to hear today, so you'd better
take a moment.  
The other young lady that's going to be fun to watch is Hope Elam. She's our
junior college player at St. Vincent's last year. We certainly didn't know
she's going to play to a point where she was going to become an All American.
She averaged 21 points and 11 rebounds, she should be our starting 4,
hopefully replacing Whitney Thomas if that's at all possible.  
Those are the few people that we have. We're, again, a young team. We have
that ultimate challenge before us, but one thing about Indiana and our Hoosier
Nation is we understand what it means to roll our sleeves up and fight, and
every single game that's what you'll see from us is the ultimate fight.  
  
Q. You've gone to three consecutive post-seasons. You came in 2006 to
Bloomington. We've even see you at halftime at men's game going up with the
cheerleaders, having a good time. How have you embraced the IU culture?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: I just love it. I love Tom Crean. He's allowed me to be
as witty and crazy as I can be, and he's really accepting of what we're trying
to do. We're in the same boat. We're trying to rebuild a program. He's
rebuilding, we're trying to begin a program and change the culture of the
women's basketball mindset in Bloomington. But our fans are for real. They
love basketball. Obviously they love men's basketball an awful lot, but we're
allowing them to see another way to play the game underneath the net, and Tom
is helping me grow our women's basketball program.  
Our community is embracing us, and it's fun. It's fun to be able to have a
basketball hoop outside your house and come home with your son in the car and
have the neighborhood kids in your yard playing hoops because they know that
it's just a nice neighborhood. Coming from New York it's a little bit
different.  
So I love the community. I love the school system. And that's most important
for me being a mom and a wife. That has been fantastic. And then you go into
that Assembly Hall, and McCracken Court, it's just breath taking, and now
we're building a new practice facility. We're encouraged about our future,
we're excited about our Hoosier family, men's basketball and women's
basketball, and our prayers is that we continue to grow it so the nation can
see why we're so excited every single day.  
  
Q. What do you need to see from Jamie this season on the court and off the
court?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Well, what she's been doing on and off the court, she's
been an unbelievable student. Jamie is a 3.1 overall GPA, and she's really
been unbelievable as a student and as a community leader. I laugh at Jamie
because I said -- I asked her what her major was, and she said, African
American studies. If you know Jamie, she's from Wisconsin. I said, "Why would
you major in African American studies?" She said, "Coach, I don't understand
you. If you study history, maybe I'll get you. But I realize after about three
years here I'm just never going to understand you."  
So her personality is coming out. She's starting to have fun. She's a very
serious kid. For her to kind of make those statements says a lot about her
character and how we have grown her.  
On the court she's the first in the gym, she's the last one to leave. She's
now communicating with the younger kids and sharing with them how we do it.
She's a very quiet point guard for us for three years. We're moving her over
to the 2 so we can address that three-point shot that we believe she has.
She's really been a leader for us, and I'm hopeful that her best year is ahead
of her because she has really worked hard to grow our women's basketball
program.  
  
Q. With all the new players, what's your style of play? Will it be what
you've been doing or radical changes or something in the middle?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Well, I love your hair, first of all. It's longer, and I
think you made a change. I think if you're going to change a little bit, I
think I need to, as well.  
I think with the team that we have, we have to play a little bit more player-
to-player defense. I love the match-up for sure, but I think that was -- but
the speed that we have on our wings and the lack of experience we have on the
inside, I think that we can protect our middle a little bit more if we play a
little bit more man-to-man, player-to-player. But we want to run. We want to
run and we want to compete. And I think that although we have what we call
that ultimate challenge this year being so young, we might be one of the
youngest teams in the country, we're certainly not going to go away from the
fact that we compete.  
So I think that every game we're in, you're going to realize you played
Indiana. What the outcome is going to be, we certainly don't know that. But
our competitiveness will never change. But our defense may.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 29, 2009

  

### [Jolette Law](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18032)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
JOLETTE LAW: I'm just excited about this year. I finally have a team with more
than eight or nine players on the roster. I have a team of 14, and just
excited about getting this year started.  
I think our Big Ten Conference is going to be extremely competitive, and I'm
just happy that the University of Illinois will be in the hunt, try to make
this conference -- represent this conference in a first-class manner.  
  
Q. Just talk about your freshman class and what kind of impact you expect
from them and what kind of impact they need to have this season.  
JOLETTE LAW: I mean, my freshman class is extremely talented. Destiny
Williams, most people know a lot about her, she played for the USA team this
summer. She's extremely talented. But my other five kids, Karisma Penn is
playing extremely well right now. She's coming along. She's probably one of
the ones that's really surprising me the most right now.  
Adrienne Godbold from Illinois, she's playing extremely well right now,
getting better each and every day. Expect a lot of great players from her.  
Kersten Magrum, another young lady from Illinois. She's playing extremely
well. She'll probably play a lot of significant minutes. I'm trying to put her
in the inside and outside, get her started, moving her more to the guard spot.  
Brianna Jones, another 6'3", 6'2" lefty, playing extremely well on the inside,
challenging Jenna Smith day in and day out.  
And I have another young lady, a phenomenal shooter in Amber Moore, who has
been the most consistent shooter along with Macie Blinn, and that's what much
needed from our team last year, someone to open things up a little bit more,
and I know Amber Moore will do a great job for us this year.  
  
Q. How is Destiny Williams' experience on the national team helped her
develop coming in as a freshman?  
JOLETTE LAW: I just think that going overseas and playing with other top
players this summer, her experience has been a blessing in disguise this year
at practice. She's raised the bar a little bit, challenging everyone to go
harder. She had an opportunity to play with some young ladies that already had
college experience, so just being over there getting that experience this
summer really helped her transition going from high school to college. She had
a little bit more experience this summer to play with some more experienced
players.  
  
Q. It's one thing to recruit all these kids, but who do you lean on to sort
of help guide you to have this many young players, being a young coach
yourself?  
JOLETTE LAW: Definitely my staff. I have Lisa Cermignano, who's been an
assistant coach at Vanderbilt, came off an Elite 8. She's been phenomenal.
Patrick Klein has been with me for three years. He's been experienced. Also I
lean on my seniors, Jenna Smith, Lacey Simpson and Whitney Toone have been
extremely great leaders. And with any team if you have great senior
leadership, you probably have a great team. And I can say that Jenna Smith,
Lacey Simpson and Whitney Toone have been great role models and have set the
tone for these young people.  
Also the experience of my returning starters, Fabiola Josli played 40, Macie
Blinn played 40 minutes, Lydia McCully played 40 minutes. So they played the
fourth toughest schedule last year. Our record didn't indicate but they got
better. I can see that their growth from last year to this year has been
phenomenal. I really have eight leaders that are helping pull along those
young freshmen.  
  
Q. Can you just talk a little bit about the competitiveness that is going to
be brought about by the Big Ten Conference, especially when you have top three
teams, Purdue, Michigan State, Ohio State on the road this season?  
JOLETTE LAW: It's going to be extremely competitive. I mean, even down from --
look at Ohio State, you look at Purdue, you look at Minnesota, from top to
bottom, I just think that our conference is extremely competitive. I mean,
Penn State, they also had a great recruiting class and have some great players
returning. It's going to be very competitive this year. Each and every game
we've got to bring our "A" game for every game in conference. We're probably
one of the strongest conferences in the country and we're definitely going to
try to let that be known this year.  
  
Q. Do you think your freshman class will be able to make an impact right
away?  
JOLETTE LAW: Right now I'm sure they will make an impact right away. We're
going to play -- if I can play all 14 players, I will. That's the tempo that I
want to play, press 94 feet, be able to just get in the face and play the
style that I want to play. All 14 players will play. I'm constantly
challenging my freshmen, "You're not going to be freshmen. You've got to come
in, learn as much as you can and make your mistakes while you're on the
floor." Definitely I know that they will definitely make an impact this year.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 29, 2009

  

### [Jim Foster](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16894)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
Q. With Jantel, what's next for her as far as her development?  
JIM FOSTER: Continue to work on her left hand and her three-point shot, which
has improved, I think, a lot over the summer.  
  
Q. With the return of many of last year's key contributors, how do you
expect them to respond to all of the preseason hype surrounding the team?  
JIM FOSTER: I think it's a team that's used to having expectations. They've
had some success and have sort of been a target in the Big Ten for the last
five or six years, and I think you just get used to walking around with that
on your shoulders.  
  
Q. Most of the conference teams are going to play a conference game in early
December. What are the challenges trying to get ready for that right in the
middle of a non-conference season?  
JIM FOSTER: I think it's a very equitable way to do it. I think we start exams
December 7th, and I think the rest of the conference runs through and a couple
schools end like the 22nd, 23rd. So you really couldn't find any scenario that
worked unless you moved it up before exams started, and that was the consensus
of the coaches, and I just think it makes for a fair, competitive situation.  
  
Q. In the preseason coaches poll, Ohio State was ranked top and the Michigan
Wolverine program is ranked at the bottom. You guys take on the Michigan
Wolverines in Ann Arbor this year. Would you be able to assess their program
and what Borseth has done?  
JIM FOSTER: Well, I think this is when you'll start to see that. When you
inherit somebody else's players and they played in a much different style than
you had played, I think it's a very difficult thing to walk into and have to
deal with. I think what you'll see this year is a team that's more a
reflection of how Kevin wants to play basketball, and I think you'll start to
see a difference in their style.  
There was a significant difference in philosophy between the two coaches.  
  
Q. Similar question about your point guard Samantha: What's the next level
in her game? And what do you need to see out of her in her sophomore year?  
JIM FOSTER: Well, I think she's improved significantly. Her passing ability I
think established her as a freshman, but her foot work has really, really
improved through the course of some long spring workouts and then the amount
of time she put in over the summer, and as a result she's shooting the ball
much better than she did last year, at any time last year, on a consistent
basis day-to-day. I think being the point guard for a gold medal-winning USA
Basketball team is a great confidence builder.  
  
Q. What changes have you seen in Samantha and Jantel after their experience
with Team USA last summer?  
JIM FOSTER: Well, as I said, Sammy's shooting is much improved and is just
playing at a higher level than at any point last year. And Jantel, I can say
the same. In fact, I told them the other day, I thought that they were
probably the two most improved players in our gym. You know, when your better
players come back improved, that's a good sign.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about the parity of the league this year, and
do you think anything is changing with some of the incoming recruiting
classes?  
JIM FOSTER: I think the bottom of the league is much improved, and I think as
a result of that, there's a push upward, and it forces significant play
through the course of the year.  
And I think one of the things that was a problem for the Big Ten was that the
bottom wasn't very strong. When we went into conference play, you didn't have
to play as tough as you need to to be ready for the postseason.  
I think last year you started to see that swing in the direction of more
competitive situations. Northwestern, I think McKoewon is going to do a great
job. I think Borseth is doing a great job at Michigan. And you don't
necessarily see it in the wins, but you see it in the preparation and having
to play those teams.  
I really think that with the bottom of the league improving, the middle and
the top will be better prepared to play in the postseason.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 29, 2009

  

### [Pam Borton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14360)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
PAM BORTON: Well, it's great to be here, and it's an exciting time of the year
just getting started with the basketball season. But I'm very excited about
our team this year, our mindset and the way we were able to get a great first-
round win last year in the NCAA Tournament, and that's going to carry over
into the season this year.  
We've got a great veteran group, two fifth-year seniors, other seniors that
have logged a lot of minutes and played every single game since we started at
Minnesota. So we've got a veteran with the return of Kiara Buford, who made
the All Rookie Team last year. She's playing very well, also, as well as
Jackie Voigt, who was a freshman last year, a sophomore this year, and she
started every game as a freshman. We're excited about the veterans and the
returners that we have with the addition of our exciting freshman class.  
  
Q. Coaches picked you to finish third, media says fourth in the Big Ten
poll. Can you talk about that? Were you surprised by that at all?  
PAM BORTON: I don't think I was surprised at it. We're returning a veteran
team. I think the teams ahead of us are pretty obvious for preseason picks
with Michigan State returning five to seven seniors and Ohio State with the
Defensive, Rookie and Player of the Year all returning on their team, as well.
I think a lot of people have a lot of respect for our program, and the four
returners from our team and basically how we finished last year.  
I'm not surprised, but we'd like to be in that No. 1 slot by the end of the
season, but it's going to be a battle every single night. You can finish
anywhere in the Big Ten because it's such a very competitive conference.  
  
Q. You worked to put together a pretty competitive schedule in the non-
conference portion of the season. Can you just talk about the value of that,
and how do you think that's going to help your team once Big Ten play
begins.  
PAM BORTON: Well, I think we have a team this year that we were able to put
that schedule together. You know, I'd be interested to see if we've got the
toughest non-conference schedule in the Big Ten in looking at it with the trip
to the Bahamas with TCU, and we play the winner of Xavier and Kansas. We've
got Iowa State, which is always a very competitive game. Some of the teams
that we play, like Lamar had 20 wins last year, and this is a very, very --
we're at Maryland. I mean, the list goes on.  
I think we've got a team that we were able to put that together. It's probably
the toughest non-conference schedule in the eight years I've been here. So
hopefully it will prepare us and not wear us out before the Big Ten starts.  
  
Q. The roster is composed of about four sophomores and three freshmen, but
it also has five seniors and you mentioned it's a veteran team. Is that going
to impact the play of the lower classmen?  
PAM BORTON: I think it's impacted their play already in practice. Our younger
kids are learning at a faster rate. We've got more leaders on the floor. Just
a lot of great mentors and role models from our veterans.  
I think when you have a team full of a lot of younger kids, I think you learn
at a slower pace maybe than with a team with a veteran -- there's more
teachers on the court, and the younger players have to learn quicker. At some
point during your preseason here you've got to move on as a team, and your
younger kids have to catch up because we've got to get ready for games. I
think when you put younger kids in that type of situation, they either have to
figure it out quick or they don't figure it out, and usually you've got a
couple kids that figure it out and you can bring them along for the beginning
of the season.  
You know, it's an interesting dynamic. This is probably the first time since
I've been in coaching that I've had this many veterans and returners returning
to a team with this many young kids, as well, and so it's an interesting
dynamic, which is a lot of fun.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Jackie and Kiara and sort of what you're
expecting this year, especially with Emily Fox being gone.  
PAM BORTON: Well, I expect Jackie and Kiara to be way better than they were
last year. Jackie started every game for us and was -- and I felt like if we
didn't have Jackie last year, it would have been tough for us to win
basketball games, and the same with Kiara. Kiara came off the bench and I
think she averaged 20 to 22 minutes a game, helped us win big games as a
freshman on the road, really stepped up throughout the year, and I think it's
pretty unusual for a freshman to be able to do that in a league like this, to
come in and be an impact player.  
Kiara right now, I can see her in that starting position for Emily right now.
If we had a game today, Kiara would be starting. Jackie has picked up her
game, and she has gotten a lot stronger than last year, has really expanded
her game, and so has Kiara. Their confidence level is just so different their
second year just because they know what's going on, they've got it figured
out. They don't have to think about the plays and learning the system, they
can just get out there and play and just continue to grow as players.  
  
Q. What do you expect out of your incoming recruiting class? Is this a class
that can compete right away do you think, or is this something where maybe
one, two, three years down the road you'll expect more of an impact from
them?  
PAM BORTON: Well, I think it depends on their learning curve and how quickly
they pick things up. I think our guards in Leah Cotton and China Antoine,
China will back up Brittany at the point, I think it gives us a little depth.
Coming from junior college it's a little different. It's not this level and
it's not high school. So she's somewhere in between, and I think she'll be
able to give us some good backup minutes, especially at the beginning of the
year, and her growing into that position and growing into the league. She's a
very, very competitive -- very true point guard. It's been a long time since
we've had a true point guard on our team.  
And then Leah Cotton, she's probably the strongest player on our team. She's
extremely explosive, can get to the rim, finish with contact. So it's been a
long time since we've had a player like that on our team, as well. Again,
she's going to go through a learning curve learning the system and everything
that freshmen go through.  
And then Katie Loberg is probably the most athletic post player we've had. She
can run the floor like a guard, she's 6'4", she high jumped 5'10" in high
school, so she's very athletic, just brings a whole different dimension to our
team. We're hoping to play all three of those kids.  
I think Amber our 6'7" is a little further away and needs some time to
continue to develop, but she's got a bright future ahead of her.  
  
Q. I heard the decision now that you guys are going to play 16 regular
season games starting next year. Were you in favor of that, and what will that
do for the overall league?  
PAM BORTON: Well, I think we as women's basketball coaches wanted to get it
down to a more manageable conference schedule instead of us beating each other
up. I think I just saw the SEC just went to 16 games; they were at 14. So we
did add a Big 10-Big 12 Challenge in conjunction with that, so we will be
playing somebody else and not ourselves for another game, and I know they're
working on something else. We're still going to play two very competitive
games but somebody different, so we're not playing each other two or three
times during the season, so I think it's a very positive thing.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 29, 2009

  

### [Kevin Borseth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18022)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
KEVIN BORSETH: Good morning, everybody. Thank you for showing up at this crisp
hour of the morning. We're excited to be here, excited to get another year
going. Got a lot of new faces in our program, and we're looking forward to
some good things.  
With that I'll open it up to any questions you may have.  
  
Q. What kind of role do you expect red shirt senior Ashley Jones to play
this season?  
KEVIN BORSETH: Well, right now we've been practicing now for a couple weeks,
and don't know exactly who's going to play or where they're going to play at
this point right now, but A.J. has got a lot of experience, she's been there
before, she understands the urgency level of the game, very good athlete,
obviously, and is going to see some court time.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about being into your third year now. Obviously
last year wasn't exactly what you wanted, especially after such a positive
start in your first year. Have the kids bought into it now, and especially
with losing so many kids, do you feel like your style has really caught on
with the girls you've got?  
KEVIN BORSETH: We've been here -- really we've  
recruited two classes that came in, and Courtney and Carmen in the sophomore
class didn't really play a whole lot last year, and of course we've got six
freshmen coming in this year that we've recruited that haven't really seen the
system yet. We're building from the bottom up. I think the players right now
that we've got have all adjusted well. I feel this year's team, group harmony
is very good. For the most part the first two years went as predicted. First
year was better than expected and the second year was a little more difficult
because your expectations are higher.  
I think the kids have bought in for the most part. They seem to be excited
about the year, and the team harmony is really good, and the spirit is really
good, so that's important to us.  
  
Q. What will your freshman class bring to the team this season?  
KEVIN BORSETH: Well, that's a hard question because what about the upper
classmen? I think that's probably an equally important question at this point
right now. We need to find a balance someplace. I think last year our biggest
problems that we had lay in the latter part of the games, scoring baskets down
the stretch, and we've got to find kids that have the ability to do that. We
think we've got some younger kids that can do that, but any time you bring in
young kids they're wet behind the ears and it's a little more difficult.  
So there's going to be some growing pains that go with it but you're going to
see some kids with some court time. Not sure exactly who and in what capacity,
but we're sure we've got some kids that are going to be able to contribute to
our success.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about where you're at right now with recruiting
in terms -- you've got Jenny Ryan and Nya Jordan mostly in-state. Talk about
that and what the battles have been like on the recruiting trail with battling
Michigan State and some of the other regional powers.  
KEVIN BORSETH: Well, we really feel good with the kids that we brought in. We
feel very good. We think we had a very strong recruiting class. We represented
ourselves very well in the state. We think we've got a good, solid base of
kids that's going to help resurrect our program. We're being very selective of
the kids we're trying to recruit for the upcoming season. We're doing well.
We've got some verbal commitments obviously that we can't make comment on and
our 2011 class seems to be coming along very well.  
To be perfectly honest with you, I'm happy when the Michigan kids stay in
Michigan. I really am. I think for a long time, I think the state of Michigan
because they had basketball that was being played in the fall where everybody
else was playing in the wintertime, kind of made us an open state where a lot
of people came in and evaluated and took our talent out of state. So if we get
them, Michigan State gets them, I'm happy, because at least our kids are
staying at home.  
  
Q. What are your team's goals for the season?  
KEVIN BORSETH: Somebody asked me that yesterday, too. Team goals. I don't know
that we really sit down and talk about goals. You know, you've got to go
through and you've got to condition your kids for just about everything --
every imaginable scenario, from bench decorum to last-second heroic plays that
will develop a shot to win the game for you, and we're so busy doing those
kind of things that we don't necessarily sit down and say, okay, we want to
win 20 games, we want to finish first place in the conference, we want to get
to the NCAA Tournament. I just think there's goals inside of you every year
that tells you you want to get into the NCAA Tournament. I think that's really
what every program wants to do, get in there, represent their conference and
kind of go from there.  
I don't know that we really talk about it, but I think deep down inside, each
one of us wants to have a good year obviously, we want to have a harmonious
year, we want to get into the NCAA Tournament and see where we can go from
there. Without saying that, I believe the players feel that.  
  
Q. What kind of force do you expect Krista Phillips to be this year for
you?  
KEVIN BORSETH: Well, KP, I'll tell you what, defensively, she's solid, she
rebounds extremely well, she understands what we're doing on that end of the
floor, and that's a very important end of the floor for us.  
Offensively she's one of those bigger statured kids that likes to play with
her face to the basket, and I think that frustrates fans when they watch
because she's not one of those kids that gets down around the basket, and
plays a lot of straight up-and-down stuff. KP has to do well, she does. She's
been around for two years, we've been around each other. I think she's learned
a lot in the two years that we've been here. Obviously everything that she
sees is not going to be new to her. I think she has to do well if we're to do
well.  
  
Q. Can you survey the conference right now as it is, what you see in terms
of who's going to be strong and who might be surprising? And also, on top of
that, can you talk about the last year of the 18-game schedule, and do you
like going back to a 16-game conference schedule after this?  
KEVIN BORSETH: I'll try to address your first question. I think Jim has done a
great job at Ohio State of making a national recognizable team right now. Jim
I think is going to be able to compete. He's got a great squad. Of course with
the big kid in the middle and the Prahalis kid at the guard spot, he's got
just a great squad and he does a great job. Jim's program, Ohio State, is
probably going to be on the national forefront, and we're excited about that
for Jim and his program, for our conference, as well.  
I think Michigan State is going to do extremely well. When I first got here
and now, I'm seeing the same players. They've been here now for quite a few
years, and of course they've been very strong and they made a strong run last
year in the national tournament. Those two seem to jump out at me more so than
anybody else does.  
In terms of who's surprising and upcoming, I'm too busy mowing my own grass
and mending my own fence to worry about who's up and coming, but I think the
two schools that jump out at me are those two.  
With regard to the conference schedule, I really felt like our biggest concern
wasn't in terms of scheduling, was our inability to fit enough games in the
timeframe that we had from the start of the season to the conference
tournament. For those of you that don't know, our conference tournament is a
week earlier than the men's is, so we take away some scheduling date
opportunities. Our last two years we didn't play a full slate of games because
we couldn't fit all of our games in. So they were squeezed together.  
Going back to 16 games in our conference makes sense. I don't know that you
realize how strong the Big Ten is until you get in here and you have got to
compete night in and night out and you grind it out with these people. And
after listening to Jim and some of the veteran coaches here, you beat each
other up. I think when you beat each other up, it takes to take your records
and put them down, and maybe makes your conference not look as strong. I think
being able to go out and play against two extra non-conference games against
obviously non-conference opponents and being successful will help you on the
national stage hopefully when it comes time for getting picked for the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. I was wondering, what are your plans to improve records on away games?  
KEVIN BORSETH: I want to tell you, I think for the most part every school in
the country struggles when they go away from home. I think that's pretty much
the norm. I'll tell you, we work with our kids, one possession at a time.
That's what we do. I don't know that we look at game scenarios and try to
count ahead or try to get too much ahead of ourselves, trying to break that
down each halftime down into five-minute segments and playing. If you can get
through the first five, try to get to the next five. When you go on the road,
teams play better at home. I think it's true with us, it's true with Purdue,
it's true with Ohio State, it's true with everybody.  
I don't know that we're really looking at that as being a primary concern so
much as we are trying to get all of our kids into the mix because we've got so
many fresh kids right now coming in that don't have any game experience, and
I've felt the thorn of experiences worth a lot more than the wilderness of
warning, and we don't have a lot of experience at this point. We're looking to
just try to get that in. That's our first concern before we get to the away
games, but that will be a concern when we do play on the road.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 29, 2009

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
LISA BLUDER: Like I'm sure you've probably already heard this morning,
everybody is pretty excited to be here and ready to go this year, so a lot of
those same feelings here. I think this media day always kind of puts
everything into perspective as far as a timeline and when your first game is
coming up, and we're anxious for the year to start. We have a brand new team.
I was sitting here listening to Felicia talk, and she talked about having the
youngest team in America and I think we might have to challenge here. We have
nine freshmen and sophomores on our team, only one senior and two juniors. So
I'd say we have to be one of the younger teams, as well, especially competing
against this Big Ten Conference this year, which again, I think is going to be
extremely tough, and it's going to be a great competitive conference.  
We're excited about Kachine Alexander and what she can do for our team, moving
into her junior season and more of a leadership role. Kamille Wahlin, who had
a great freshman year for us last year, will be moving to our point guard row
lysing Kristi Smith, who obviously led our team for four years and had a very
successful Big Ten career. We're just excited to get things started.  
  
Q. You guys obviously relied heavily on your threesome last year that now
have left. Has the team kind of been able to establish new leadership patterns
since they've left, or are you still noticing a void of some sort?  
LISA BLUDER: I think that our upper classmen, we have the three juniors and
seniors that we have, have done a nice job of trying to establish how to
maintain the history of our program and the traditions of our program and how
hard people work when they come to practice and how you show up and what the
values of our program are. I think all those things are important for our
young people to learn, and you have to count on your juniors and seniors to
teach them those sort of things, and I think our three are doing a nice job
with that.  
  
Q. Now that you've had a couple weeks of practice, talk about Morgan
Johnson, any of the freshmen that really look like they've opened eyes even
beyond what you've anticipated?  
LISA BLUDER: Well, I think Theairra Taylor is probably somebody that we're
very excited about because really about three months ago, I didn't know that
she might not be able to play this year because she's coming off of an ACL six
months ago. But now after seeing her in practice, I'm pretty convinced that
she's going to be able to play this year. Now, we don't have to make that
decision for another couple of weeks, but it's looking very positive that she
will be able to play this year, so that's exciting for us to have an athlete
like her.  
Jaime Printy also is doing a great job for us with the three-point shooting
and that was a big void losing Kristi and Wendy, great three-point shooters
for the past four years in the Big Ten Conference. So I think Jaime is anxious
to try to fill that void, too. I think those two definitely. We'll be looking
at significant playing time.  
But I think Trisha Nesbitt, who's going to be backing up on point guard as a
freshman, she'll get playing time because the positional need. We have to have
somebody back up our point guard and she's the most logical candidate for
that. And then Morgan will be backing up JoAnn at the 5.  
  
Q. Just wondering, we all know what the identity of your program was the
last couple years, great three-point shooting, opens up the inside game, great
penetration from the point. What's the identity of Iowa women's basketball
this year?  
LISA BLUDER: It's actually pretty similar. Right now our three-point shooting
is unproven but it's there. It's not like it's nonexistent. We don't go to the
gym and shoot 20 percent from three-point range. They haven't done it in a
game. They haven't proven it yet. But I believe that we do have good three-
point shooters on our team, so I think that we'll still have that same type of
identity.  
I do think that we have the possibility of being a more up-tempo team than we
were and getting some of those threes out of transition, too, and we like to
shoot the three out of transition.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the race as a whole? Obviously the poll came out today
and Ohio State looks like they're going to be the team to beat again. You're
picked fifth. I don't know if you felt that was too high or if you felt
snubbed or what. How do you see the race and where you guys were picked?  
LISA BLUDER: Well, I think Ohio State is a logical choice. They've done a
tremendous job. They return their team. I mean, why wouldn't you pick them to
win it all? So I think that's a very logical choice. And I think Michigan
State, the same thing. Why wouldn't you pick them?  
We're sitting in the conference I think that's a real compliment to us
considering what we lost. When you look at how much scoring we did lose and
how much experience we lost, I think that that's pretty good.  
  
Q. JoAnn Hamlin, I'm assuming for once in her life she's finally healthy.
What can she do this year? Can you just talk about everything she's gone
through the last couple years and what can she do this year if she stays
healthy with this team?  
LISA BLUDER: I think she's the X factor for us. JoAnn has looked tremendous in
practice. People say we returned two starters, but in my mind we really
returned three starters. JoAnn started for us most of the season until she
went down with an injury, and she was having some very nice games in there.  
I think JoAnn could have a spectacular year for us. She has went through a lot
of adversity, first of all, being at Kansas State, making the transfer, having
shoulder surgery, going through a severe ankle sprain last year that took her
out for six games and lost her starting position after that.  
But I just think that JoAnn Hamlin, she's playing so strong and so confident,
and she's being a good leader for us, so I think that JoAnn could have a
remarkable year. I think she's under the radar for a lot of people. She won't
be for long.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2009

  

### [Lakisha Freeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18049)

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

### [Lindsay Wisdom-
Hylton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16907)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  67  
Purdue - 66

  
THE MODERATOR: The All-Tournament Team is Jenna Smith of Illinois, Jantel
Lavender of Ohio State, Star Allen of Ohio State, Brittany Rayburn of Purdue,
Lindsay Wisdom-Hylton of Purdue. And the Most Outstanding Player is Jantel
Lavender of Ohio State.  
We're joined by Purdue and we'll start off with opening comments from Coach
Sharon Versyp and then we'll go to the student-athletes for questions.  
COACH VERSYP: I just thought this was an amazing basketball game. I mean, the
runs, two top programs I feel in the country just really battled back and
forth, both teams played great basketball. And you look at the stat line, you
look at everything, you just didn't -- you just didn't wish anybody to lose a
game like this.  
But Ohio State, they've been ranked in the top 20 all year. We wish them
nothing but the best of luck, obviously, in the tournament. Get a high seed.
Hopefully people will look at us and get us a little higher seed because of
the competition we had and with our foul trouble in the first half.  
Lindsay Wisdom-Hylton only playing six minutes in the first half and our young
kids, our bench came in and did an unbelievable job. I've never been so proud
of a group of women. We didn't lose today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Lindsay, can you talk about being in a game like this in this kind of
atmosphere with both teams sort of going back and forth and star players
making big plays?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I mean, we've been in situations like this all year,
close games. We just had one with Michigan State. We fell short that game. And
we felt we were ready for situations like this.  
And we had a game plan. We didn't execute it to the fullest, and kind of some
crucial moments. So that's why I think we fell short today.  
  
Q. Lindsay, can you talk about the sort of maturation of Brittany Rayburn
that you've seen this weekend and how she sort of stepped up her game on a big
stage?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: She's done an unbelievable, phenomenal job, you know,
as a freshman coming here, and no nerves got to her. I felt she came out and
was aggressive all three games and she did a wonderful job.  
And she helped us come back in leads and runs during the game. So she did a
really good job, and I think she's going to be a really good player for the
rest of the three years here.  
  
Q. Even though you lost tonight, Lindsay, how much confidence knowing you
can play one of the better teams in the country straight up, how much
confidence does that go into the NCAA Tournament?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: It's huge confidence especially with our bench playing.
They did an unbelievable job carrying us, especially the first half. It just
shows the depth on our team, and everybody will have good confidence going
into the tournament. So I think this is just -- it's a good eye-opener for our
team and we'll be ready -- prepared for the next tournament.  
  
Q. Lakisha, coming in with the success that Purdue has had in this
tournament and this venue and this city, is that a little bit of a home court
advantage and did that help boost you guys to play the way you guys played?  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: I think the tradition here is just awesome. It gave us
motivation knowing we won in the past and we wanted to do the same here today.
I think it was unfortunate, but it's great having the fan base we had today.  
  
Q. Lindsay, on Ohio State's last possession there it looked like your intent
was to try and foul Jantel Lavender before she got that shot off since she had
one to get?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: That was the intent. I tried fouling her beforehand. I
guess she picked up the ball a little earlier. She was on the run. But they
called it on the shot. Knocked down the free throw.  
  
Q. Kiki, can you talk about the play of the bench in that first half and
being able to get you from point A to point B?  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: It's amazing. It showed the depth, as Lindsay and Coach
pointed out. We're a tough team. We have a lot of depth, not only the starters
but we have great players coming off the bench. I think that showed tonight.  
I think they did a great job, Brittany, the freshman, all the freshmen,
everybody that came off the bench did a great job offensively and defensively
and carried us.  
  
Q. Lindsay, they rattled Iowa and Illinois pretty well with their pressure,
but with FahKara back finally with a full game with those guys, were you
pretty sure you could handle their pressure and give it back to them?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: Definitely FahKara Malone's been doing a wonderful job
ever since she came back off her injury. I think that she's able to get the
ball up the court quick for us and to run the offense really well. She has
good floor vision and court vision and she did a good job running this team.  
And she did a good job tonight with executing and running plays and her
defensive presence is always there. And I think she did a really good job
today .  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you want to accomplish on that last offensive possession?
Where were you trying to go with that?  
COACH VERSYP: Well, when FahKara fell on the ground and got mugged -- got
hugged, sorry, we were just going to get it in her hands and she was going to
create. She was totally going to create a shot for herself or [Lakisha] or
Brittany Rayburn, we had plenty of time to be able to do that. But it is what
it is.  
  
Q. With 1.1 left, were you just looking for something, anything you can
get?  
COACH VERSYP: We were trying to look for a lob for Danielle but it's difficult
when you have a 6'6" kid guarding Kiki out of bounds. They were smart doing
that. They had a guard on Danielle, and told Kiki to lob it, but there's no
way she could get it over the top. So the only option right there was really a
desperation with Brittany, and they're not going to call a foul in the last
six seconds of the game.  
  
Q. Sharon, can you talk a little bit about Brittany Rayburn, how she's sort
of come of age in this tournament?  
COACH VERSYP: I mean, Brittany's a gamer, she loves the game. She grew up in
the state of Indiana loving Purdue. And she just has a lot of pride of the
players before her and the strong tradition, and she plays for her seniors
right now and she just wants to help this team and just carry that tradition.  
But she can run the one, two, or three, she can post up. She's very difficult
to defend. She's not afraid to take the shot. But she just played
exceptionally hard, just like the rest of our team.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk specifically about Natasha Bogdanova's contribution
in the first half when Lindsay was out?  
COACH VERSYP: Natasha played exceptionally well. Really played good defense.
Boxed out to allow others to get some rebounds. You know, just had a good
shooting touch. So Natasha's key minutes were huge with Lindsay sitting out
and then Danielle got her second foul and then Alex came in and we did an
exceptional job, only being down by four at that point. But Natasha played
exceptionally well.  
And this is our team. This is our bench. This is what you do playing three
games in three days, I think, again, you're seeing -- this is great basketball
tonight. Sometimes on that third game it's ugly basketball. This is great
basketball. It was a national exposure for our conference.  
  
Q. Coach, at the end of the first half I think both teams had three players,
three starters sitting on the bench with two fouls apiece. Do you think in the
second half both teams kind of managed to kind of adjust to that and because
it just seemed like the possessions, it just got better, I thought the game
got better in the second half, that they played through that stuff?  
COACH VERSYP: We're not in control of a lot of those things, and so both teams
were able to just go down low and start posting up and playing the game.  
And I think that really helped elevate the game today for both programs, to
let the players play when it came down to post play and being able to show the
talents, again, of our league.  
  
Q. Coach, as you look ahead to the NCAA tournament, realistically how far do
you think this team will go?  
COACH VERSYP: We're talking about tonight, and FahKara Malone said it best:
Usually I would cry in this scenario, but I have nothing to cry about. We
played our hearts out. We did everything possible. We'll go far in the
tournament. If we play like this, we'll make a loud noise. We we just have to
keep that going now.  
And with us we have to wait two weeks to play. I don't know if that's a good
thing or a bad thing. But if we play like this and have this type of depth, it
can be really, really beneficial for us. And we're just really proud of how we
played, and we have no reason to hang our heads.  
  
Q. Sounds like by your opening statement you talked about hopefully we get a
good seed or hopefully the committee or people who are watching, could you
speak to, if anybody's listening, sell Purdue?  
COACH VERSYP: You have your point guard you've had for two and a half years
that has run the show, who is your leader and your communicator, and she was
out for nine and a half games. And we went 7-2. We beat Texas and Minnesota at
home. We beat great teams without our leader.  
I think that sells the case right there. We're playing great basketball since
she's been back. Our team did a phenomenal job without her. She's become a
better player for that. And then being able to play three games in a row and
play against Ohio State, which, again, it's a one-point game, but I thought it
was phenomenal where I feel both programs -- obviously they've been in the top
20 or 25, but we're definitely a top 25 team.  
  
Q. You talk about the caliber of this game. What's it say about these two
programs that they can find it this late in a tournament like this and this
was a championship game in every sense of the word, wasn't it?  
COACH VERSYP: It really was. And, again, it shows that both programs have such
strong tradition and just want to perform for their universities, for each
other in every sense of the word and for the Big Ten. It's a battle.  
We want our Big Ten to be known in the country that we are a top, we're one of
the top conferences, and people don't see that. And I just think the parity
that we have in our conference shows how tough we are. And the best statement
is from Joe McKeown (Northwestern), who was in GW for years and he came to the
league and he never realized how great the Big Ten was. Now he's living it and
he gave the Big Ten so much credit because he didn't give credit before.  
So I think Ohio State and us hopefully have made a statement that Big Ten is
something special.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2009

  

### [Star Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16895)

### [Jim Foster](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16894)

### [Jantel Lavender](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18055)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  67  
Purdue - 66

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go straight to the student-athletes for their remarks.  
  
Q. Jantel, what was going through your mind shooting the free throws in that
last possession that they had; what were you guys trying to accomplish?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I was -- the first free throw I was letting my tiredness take
over, and the second free throw I was like I gotta take my time, take a deep
breath, and I focused more, I guess, and I knocked it down.  
  
Q. Star, how tough was that game inside and was it almost like you and
Jantel against Lindsay Wisdom-Hylton and Danielle Campbell and FahKara Malone
was almost back and forth that way? Did it feel that way for you?  
STAR ALLEN: At a point in time it did, but then I think once we started doing
everything we had to do, it turned out to be like everybody against everybody.  
  
Q. Jantel, what can you say was the difference in terms of the quality of
play for both teams? Seemed much more competitive game than the other two
games. What can you say was the biggest difference today than the previous
matchup?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I don't know. I think that both teams, Purdue and us, we came
out playing extremely well. I thought defense was really tough. I think the
game was really physical, especially in the post. And we both wanted to win
the tournament. And I think both teams played an excellent game. I think it
just came down to that free throw.  
So I don't know what the difference was, but just both teams played extremely
hard.  
  
Q. Jantel, on your last possession, did you get pretty much exactly what you
wanted? Did you get -- they were going to you all the way, were they not, and
were you supposed to take it up and did she foul you?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: You asked me did she foul me? The play was to go to me. And I
think that she thought that she was bodying up. I don't know. But it was a
foul. It was contact. And I think that's the way we wanted everything to go.  
  
Q. Star, their last possession, when Shavelle tipped the ball away from
FahKara there at the end and they got the tie-up, after that what did you guys
want to do when they had like 1.1 seconds to go?  
STAR ALLEN: To not let go of the ball, don't let them get any sets up.  
  
Q. Jantel, you were named as Most Outstanding Player of the Tournament. I
assume these awards aren't getting old.  
JANTEL LAVENDER: Are they getting old?  
  
Q. I assume they're not getting old, that you'll take all the awards that
you can get?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: Most definitely. I just come out and play extremely hard. I
don't come to the tournament looking to be the tournament MVP. I just come out
and I play for my teammates and we all come to play for each other.  
  
Q. Jantel, you also talked about before the team got here you talked about a
good post-season team. How big of a step is this, sort of becoming a good
post-season team this year?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I think this is a huge step. I think it shows us how it feels
to be a champion and how tough the tournament can be, because I think Purdue
is a great tournament team and they're going to give a lot of people a lot of
trouble.  
So I think us winning this tournament is a major step for us, because we know
what we have to do and how hard we have to play in the post-season to be
successful.  
  
Q. Star, did the foul trouble in the first half and second half, did that
bother you guys a whole lot, do you think?  
STAR ALLEN: I think in the second half, once they got to like their one-and-
one situation and it kind of made us a little timid about everything, but once
we figured out we can't foul and we just have to stay in front of the ball, we
was okay.  
  
Q. For both of you, how tough was it to play without Sammy for a good part
of that first half?  
STAR ALLEN: I don't think -- I mean, Maria came in, and she came in and pushed
the ball and did what she had to do. I don't think it was like a big
difference.  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I think our bench played extremely well today. They brought
so much energy to the game and Maria Moeller came off the bench with so much
energy and so did Sarah Schulze, so I think the foul trouble didn't affect us
as much because they brought as much energy as Star and Sammy brought.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, how high of a seed do you think your team is deserving of?  
COACH FOSTER: I'm not going to speculate. I think all of the criteria for end
of the season, I think we played a schedule. I think the league is tough. I
don't think you have to go any further than talking to Joe McKeown at
Northwestern or Kevin Borseth at Michigan, people that came in from this
league from outside, about the strength and quality of the Big Ten.  
I would like the committee, some folks on the committee to talk to those two
coaches. Because this league, it's a bear. And I think every team going into
the NCAA tournament will be happy to be playing somebody else.  
  
Q. Going into the NCAA Tournament, how much does a game like this, in this
kind of an atmosphere and possession-of-possession game, how much is that
going to help you?  
COACH FOSTER: I think it's huge. And I think Sammy getting four fouls, having
to sit. Maria Moeller who was a starting point guard as a freshman, coming in
and being poised and doing the things necessary, being able to substitute
offense/defense with Ashlee Trebilcock and Shavelle Little. And Sarah Schulze
coming up huge when we needed a player to step up.  
And I just think that our team did an absolute terrific job against a very
good basketball team. We know what Purdue is capable of, and I'm really
looking forward to seeing how the Big Ten teams do in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, we've seen Jantel dominate throughout this tournament. Just your
opinion on how good she is on a national scale. Is this an All-American; is
this somebody that should get strong consideration of that? Your thoughts on
that.  
COACH FOSTER: Well, depending on how we continue to do, I think she should be
in the conversation for Player of the Year. Again, this is a quality league.
This is a league that you go through an average 21, 22 points, you average
double figure rebounds, you score double figures every time you go out, now
that's where the air is rare.  
  
Q. Can you go over the last play to her, to Jantel, what you wanted to do
down there, and defensively what you hoped to accomplish against them in the
final 6.2 seconds?  
COACH FOSTER: Yes, we wanted to get the ball to her. At that point of the game
you've got to respect everything so that perimeter has got to come out and
guard. You don't want to give up an uncontested shot. And it obviously created
the opportunity to get the ball in to her.  
And we had, between Ashlee and Samantha Prahalis, Malone had four fouls, so
it's going to be tough for her to pressure Sammy on the wing. But Ashlee did a
great job of getting it in.  
And Jantel was poised, especially after she missed the first foul shot. I
think a lot of times players will tank the second one after missing the first.
And, defensively, I've seen Malone get the ball and get up the floor. In fact,
she did it the other day when I was watching the game, I believe it was
against Wisconsin. I looked up and she got up the floor in I believe 6.1
seconds and got a shot off.  
So the idea was for Shavelle to have a cushion to not let Malone go by her.
And I think she did an absolutely terrific job with that. And then the ball
was exposed and she poked. And at the end we just put a big on the ball and
knew that they had to come off a screen, catch, turn in 1.8. But I watched
Creighton win a game with a two-bounce, two-dribble pull-up jump shot in .8
seconds, and it started when the player caught it. So I know 1.8 can be an
eternity.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the growth of Brittany Rayburn just from the
games you've seen her play, from earlier when you played them the first time
to now?  
COACH FOSTER: Well, I don't know if I can comment too much, because I saw her
when she was a junior in high school. I thought she was really, really good
then. I just think she's a good player. I think she's been a good player. What
you're seeing is a good player get confident.  
When that happens, then how hard they work determines whether or not they
become a great player. She has a lot of attributes. She can go left, can go
right. She's got a 3. She can pull up, takes it to the basket. She's strong.
She's a good player.  
  
Q. Most of your games haven't been close in the waning moments of the game.
Can you talk about how you'll use what happened tonight as a learning
experience especially in the tournament?  
COACH FOSTER: We really emphasize and spend a lot of time on the defensive
side of the ball in practice with stops and how important it is to stop, to
make the first shot difficult, and to close out a possession by rebounding.  
And I thought down the stretch we did an absolute terrific job of that. And
there was a point where we were just exchanging baskets. And that's not how
you win a game. You have to come up with the stops. And we did that, and it
put us in position to win the game.  
  
Q. You talked about Sarah and Maria, but it seemed like Ashlee was kind of
there whenever you needed her?  
COACH FOSTER: Ashlee's always there. Maria did something that she hasn't had
to do this year for the length of time she had to do it, with Sammy in foul
trouble with four fouls, and maintain. And Sarah has given us great minutes,
quality minutes in X number of games, stepped up and took it to another level
tonight with the energy that she brought into the game.  
Ashlee was Ashlee. She knocked down shots. And she took her time. She played
with a great deal of composure, and she played very physical defense when she
had to against Lakisha Freeman, because Freeman is a big, strong kid.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Congratulations.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Fahkara Malone](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18050)

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

### [Lindsay Wisdom-
Hylton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16907)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  70  
Wisconsin - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We'll open up with general comments from Coach Sharon
Versyp then we'll go to the student-athletes for questions.  
COACH VERSYP: You know, whenever you come in and play that second game, for
us, I think we weren't as anxious as we were when you play that very first
game.  
I thought our kids were very focused. We knew that Wisconsin was going to give
us everything possible, a team like that that's playing great right now.
Alyssa Karel was just taking them on her back, was willing them to win. The
first half was a very tough half and the second half I thought we did a good
job defensively, locked them down. We put [Lakisha] Freeman on Alyssa Karel
and our post players and everybody just kind of fed off of one another and I
thought we played great team defense.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. FahKara, how important was the last three minutes of the first half to
get you into halftime with a lead, and did you feel like you had that
momentum?  
FAHKARA MALONE: It was very important for us. We needed that momentum. We just
needed to get some stops at the end of the half because our defense wasn't
doing anything for the first 17 minutes. And Coach just kept telling us to cut
the lead, cut the lead and try to get up as much as we could before the
halftime, and that's what we did.  
  
Q. Lindsay, talk about the first few minutes there. You had a couple of nice
plays that sort of sparked the offense and gave you that little bit of
cushion?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: Talking about the second half? Yeah, we came out of the
locker room, were going on a run. High energy. Wanted to keep feeding off of
that and we wanted to get the ball inside, get an inside-out game going. And
Danielle Campbelll and myself were trying to dominate inside and we were able
to get some good looks, and then we were able to kick it out to our guards and
they were able to knock down the shot later on.  
So it was a good job of getting the ball inside and out and moving the ball
around.  
  
Q. Lindsay, I think you had 10 points total in the first two games against
them. And then you had that in the first half tonight. Was that an
inspiration, or did they treat you differently?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: Yeah, I think this game they weren't as physical. They
weren't doubling as much as they did the last two games we played them. I felt
like the last two times they were a lot more physical. And I felt I was
double-teamed and triple-teamed, and I guess this time they were trying to
take a new approach going one-on-one then doubling later on in the game.  
I think that was sort of the difference, and it's tournament time. People step
up and it's a do-or-die type situation. So you want to come out and play hard
for your team.  
  
Q. FahKara, seemed like each of you had your own mini run within the run. In
the second half Lindsay came out and scored a couple of baskets. And Danielle
had 7 of 9 and then you scored three baskets in a row. Were you just going in
the flow of the offense and you all found something that would work?  
FAHKARA MALONE: I think the biggest thing was our transition. I know most of
my buckets were in transition.  
And then we were just able to push the ball and then isolate the post on one-
on-one down low, and once it's one-on-one with any of our posts, then they can
handle that. And that's what they did today.  
  
Q. FahKara, are you taller than Rae Lin D'Alie?  
FAHKARA MALONE: I think we're the same height. We're both listed as 5'3". I
think it's pretty much the same, we're both pretty close to the floor, that's
all I know.  
  
Q. Lindsay, did you feel like if you kept going to Danielle she could
eventually get something going inside? Because struggled through the first 25
minutes but seemed to really turn it on in the second half.  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I think Danielle, she's a great player. And once she's
able to get the ball deep inside and make a quick couple of moves -- and she
found her rhythm. I think she was doing good with that. We kept feeding her
the ball. She was hot and being aggressive and attacking. And that's what we
needed her to do. And she started doing that later on in the game, and I think
early on she needed to do that more.  
  
Q. Lindsay, just to be back in the championship game again?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: It's a great feeling. I can't be more proud of this
group right here and I'm so excited to go out my senior year and just get to
the championship game, and we're going to play our best and hopefully we can
get a three-peat.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach Versyp.  
  
Q. Coach, did you see something different out of your team tonight from the
ability to put points together in quick fashion?  
COACH VERSYP: I've been waiting for it. No. I mean, I feel our last eight
games, I just feel so confident with this group. I mean, they're just really
playing off of one another.  
And yesterday was a very tough battle. It was a great basketball game and then
be able to come out here and get that offense flowing and be able to lock down
and play some defense with that.  
I think that's been a big key for us. And it was great to -- they went one-on-
one and Danielle was really attacking the basket, doing some things, one-on-
one with Lindsay down low.  
We wanted to build that interior. Jodi Howell hits her first 3 and it takes
the stress off of everybody and we put that on her every game. And we just
have to make runs like that. We gotta have different players that can step up
and score in bunches.  
  
Q. Sharon, after just having several games earlier in the year without
FahKara, can you just talk about the impact she brings to the game, both on
offense and defense?  
COACH VERSYP: First of all, FahKara is our tremendous leader. She's our vocal
leader. She's our Energizer Bunny. She's the voice on the court. So her energy
level just intensifies and everybody plays off of her.  
So we did a great job during the time she was hurt. She got hurt in the
Michigan State game and that was in overtime. And we gathered ourselves, beat
Texas that next game back, and went on a 7-2 win/loss streak. And everybody
just stepped up. And it was good for FahKara. She sat down. It was humbling.
She saw how different people do different jobs, and I think she's really now
-- defensively she's the key.  
She gets us going and everybody else steps up. When you have a point guard
like that and offensively she's so quick and she understands, she knows
exactly what I want.  
And that's a big key. When you have a point guard that's plays for you for
three years, they pretty much know exactly what the coach wants.  
  
Q. Was there a particular message to Danielle, because she sort of went from
not being able to hold on to the ball to all of a sudden being dominant there
for that five-minute stretch?  
COACH VERSYP: No, I think with some players, you have to be very positive.
FahKara, I can really pare down, which I did tonight, the light switch went on
and she went on a terror. With Danielle it's empowering her and being really
positive with her. And when she gets that -- you can tell when she's going to
knock down a shot and take over a game. With Danielle, she wants to do the
best she can for her team. When she's out there smiling and being happy, then
good things happen.  
  
Q. I think you're undefeated in three years at Purdue in this tournament. Is
there some key to getting your team each year to be able to play its best at
this time of year?  
COACH VERSYP: You know, no one has the magic method. But I just really feel
you need to peak at the right time. Hopefully us coaches were doing the right
team; some people peak too soon, everybody wants to win every game. I think
some losses really help you.  
We really work on the mental side a lot. Everybody worries about Xs and Os,
and we definitely, I think, are a very good X and O coaching staff, there's no
question.  
But the mental side of empowering young kids, understanding their role,
accepting it and being able to perform in that. Right now it's all about being
positive with your teammates. And I think our journey that we have from the
beginning of the year, all the way with team building and what we do and how
we come together in March, hopefully we'll continue to do that always. But
it's not an easy job.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  72  
Iowa - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to go straight to the student-athletes for
questions, and I will repeat the player's name before they answer.  
  
Q. Jantel, watched you guys come out tonight for the game, the starting 5
especially, what were you talking about? Were you just talking about this
game?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: We came out and held it up and we were like all we have to do
is be ferocious and have a lot of energy and focus on running and rebounding,
as it was the key thing that we were talking about in our huddles. And we were
talking about coming out, being the first people to start out in the game and
with a lot of energy so that everyone on the bench could come out with that
same intensity, because we set the tempo for the game.  
  
Q. Ashlee, do you remember any games where you guys came out -- the last two
games, where you came out with a better first seven or eight minutes this
season?  
ASHLEE TREBILCOCK: I don't know whether there was a couple better couple
minutes, but we came out real hard against Michigan State and a couple of
those teams at the beginning of the Big Ten. And we just brought that back.
It's all about like our first defense, we weren't letting them get anything
off.  
And I think that's why we got that early lead.  
  
Q. Jantel, was there any talk about the fact that they had scored 85 points
against you the last time you saw them that you did not want that to happen
again?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: Yeah, that was a major emphasis. And we knew if we give up 85
points it's kind of hard for us to beat a team like that. We know if we play
defense and we hold them to a certain amount of points that our team is
capable of it, and we come out with a great defensive effort we'll do good. 85
points is just too much to give up. We knew that.  
  
Q. Jantel, you and Star Allen you did whatever you wanted, could you talk
about that?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I think we saw it early we could be dominant in the post, it
was opening up and we reversed the ball. And we play a high-low game good
together and we noticed it early in the game, and we took advantage of it.  
  
Q. Ashlee, one of the things you guys did in this game that was different at
Iowa Star was on Kachine Alexander. Can you talk about the reason that that
happened and the job that Star had to do to keep her off the boards?  
ASHLEE TREBILCOCK: It's just a smart matchup because Ausdemore is more of a
guard, and we realized that. And Wendy Ausdemore is more of a driver. And it's
hard for someone like that to go against Star. That's kind of a hard matchup
for her.  
So Coach made that call before the game, and it was a good move.  
  
Q. Both of you, could you talk about how many times -- how many turnovers
you froze in that first half on Iowa and overall for the game?  
ASHLEE TREBILCOCK: I wasn't in in the very beginning, but we just had a lot of
pressure. We weren't letting them getting any easy entry passes. You could
tell they started getting frustrated when Smith threw up kind of an ugly-
looking 15-footer, and they started rushing shots and just trying to get shots
off.  
And that was just -- they couldn't get the ball into their guards.  
JANTEL LAVENDER: That was a good response.  
ASHLEE TREBILCOCK: Thanks (laughter).  
  
Q. At what point did you really know that you had this game under your
control and you were going to win this game?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I think we came out and we set the tempo in the first half,
and we knew we had to come out with that same energy in the second half and we
knew if we didn't let up it was kind of hard for them to keep up with us,
especially with the way we were running and the way that we were rebounding.  
So we knew we had to come out with the same intensity we played in the first
half and we were up like, what, I don't know by how much by the second half.
But we just came out and played the exact same we did in the first half
because it was effective.  
  
Q. Ashlee, you had I think eight straight points there when they started to
cut into it a bit. Did you feel good to hit those 3s to put down their little
rally in the first half?  
ASHLEE TREBILCOCK: It's nice to make shots. I didn't think about it, it was
eight in a row or anything. But the most important thing is our teammates, we
were reversing the ball really well and they were getting me open shots and
the layup just opened up.  
  
Q. You've already played Purdue twice. You get them tomorrow night. What do
you expect for them tomorrow night, Jantel?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I expect them to come out and play extremely hard. This is
sort of one their home courts. We have to be ferocious, like we played today.
Come out with the same intensity we played today and just play Ohio State
basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach Foster.  
  
Q. Talking about offense last night and this game, even though you got off
to a fast start, it was all about defense again, wasn't it?  
COACH FOSTER: It's always about defense.  
  
Q. How did you like the way you guys were doing it this time?  
COACH FOSTER: I thought we had the right energy and I thought we made the
right decisions, and we were very aggressive with our switches. We didn't --
we went to them. We challenged early and often.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about how well Jantel runs the floor? She always
gets down quick, a lot of easy baskets in transition.  
COACH FOSTER: I've said this -- actually got a letter from a fan after
Jantel's freshman year that told me she was slow and didn't have good hands.
And my biggest fear is that Jim Tressel realizes that the best tight end on
our campus plays for me. She can run like a deer and she's got great hands.  
  
Q. Coach, your team's gotten off to a great start two nights in a row, but
then it's leveled off. Is that any concern to you? Is it hard to keep an
edge?  
COACH FOSTER: No, it's basketball. I mean, they're 21-10. They're a good
basketball team. This isn't boxing. You can't knock an opponent out. The
game's going to last 40 minutes.  
And they have three seniors that have scored over a thousand points in their
career. They're hungry. They have first and second round at their place, play
preceding, all the motivation in the world.  
That's what this thing's about, and what collegiate sports are about. This
time of year playing with a purpose and with a lot of heart.  
  
Q. Again, you switched Star onto Alexander, who was pretty active and
remarkable on the boards, but she did -- what kind of job do you think she did
with that?  
COACH FOSTER: I think she did a great job. Alexander's home is the lane and
Ausdemore's is on the perimeter. That's where they're both in their comfort
zone. And last time we're running Star out to the perimeter, play a post
player really as a guard and we got a very active rebounding forward who is
making hay in the lane with her aggressiveness.  
  
Q. Allen was pretty tenacious on the boards. Could you talk about her? A lot
of rebounds, at least one or two off a missed free throw. Could you talk about
that?  
COACH FOSTER: She had a lot of practice with that tonight. We usually are a
very good foul-shooting team. In fact, we are a very good foul-shooting team.
So I'm not quite sure what the team decided to work on their offensive
rebounding off of foul shots today.  
She's quick. She's very quick and very deceptive and she has great hands. So
if you don't put a body on her, her feet are going to get her in a place where
she can do damage, and it's something that she's done for her whole career and
is doing more often down the stretch.  
  
Q. Again, you've seen Purdue twice. Are you guys going to surprise each
other tomorrow night with anything or are you just going to go after each
other?  
COACH FOSTER: I'm sure that people will have wrinkles. It's the nature of what
we do. We'll watch film tonight and tomorrow morning before we go on for our
shoot-around. And we'll have some thoughts, as will they.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  70  
Wisconsin - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: We will open up for general comments from Coach Lisa Stone, and
then we'll go to the student-athletes for questions.  
COACH STONE: I couldn't be prouder of the Wisconsin Badger women's basketball
team. For the second time in school history we reached the semifinals and we
left it on the court. We gave it everything we could. And Purdue is a very
good team. They're experienced. They have five seniors. They've won seven Big
Ten championships.  
Players, their senior class has been in the Elite 8. And the experience that
our team faced in this tournament and our representation, we did something
that nobody thought we could do, to even get this far. And we fought right to
the very end. And I couldn't be more proud of this team.  
We've done well, and we're going to play some more yet this year. And with one
senior, we'll be back and hopefully in this same position next year, to
advance to yet another game.  
But I'm very proud of our team. We played three games in three days, and we
battled, and we left it on the court. And I think our identity is the way we
play basketball at Wisconsin I think everybody knows. And, again, I'm very
proud of this team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Alyssa, what was different about Purdue's defense in the second half?  
ALYSSA KAREL: You know, it's hard to say. I think on the offensive side we
were kind of -- we weren't moving as much. They kind of got us kind of packed
in, so we weren't spread out as much. And I think that was ultimately what
kind of hurt us, was the fact we really couldn't get a lot of motion going on
offense.  
We couldn't get ball movement. We couldn't reverse the ball. They were
fortunate to take quick shots, which was hurting us.  
  
Q. Rae Lin, you got up 6 at the end of the first half. How much did the 7-0
spurt by them maybe take some momentum away from you?  
RAE LIN D'ALIE: Credit to them. They did a great job closing out the second
half. They just went on a run and took the lead going into halftime, and we
really stressed coming out strong the second half.  
And we got a stop right away. And Teah Gant went down and tried to go for the
layup and they came down and started scoring. I think they just knocked down
some really tough shots. We were contesting, and they were just hitting
buckets.  
  
Q. Tara, how much of a handful were Danielle Campbell and Lindsay Wisdom-
Hylton tonight inside?  
TARA STEINBAUER: Absolutely we give all the credit to Purdue. They fought a
very good match against us, but definitely they found some success down low as
far as their posts were concerned.  
It was a physical battle all game, and I think that myself, Lin Zastrow,
Ashley Thomas, Anya Covington, we all did a good job being physical with them.
And it fell where it did. But I think we did a very good job overall.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. Questions for Coach Stone.  
  
Q. This is your third game in three days. Did you feel like your team kind
of started to wear down a little bit in the second half?  
COACH STONE: There's three right outside that door figuring you were going to
ask me that question. She said, "Coach, we ran out of gas."  
You don't want to admit that. But it is our third game in three days. We went
through a physical battle with Michigan State yesterday. But we're a team that
doesn't make excuses. And we don't take anything away from Purdue.  
They're very, very good. And you mentioned the lead. Three minutes to go I
think in the first half and they got out in transition. We turned it over. And
they out transitioned and made some big plays to end the half. The pendulum
started switching their way.  
We come out in the second half to start the second half, only down 1. Feeling
pretty good about it. Made some adjustments. Tried to figure out how to keep
the ball out of Lindsay Wisdom-Hylton's hands. She's amazing.  
She's a first round draft pick in my opinion. She's a very good player. We
wanted to be more physical, keep the ball out of her hands.  
Then we made the adjustment to stay off 15 a little more and try to clog the
lane more. Ended up being transition basketball.  
We came out in the second half, got a stop right away. Teah mentioned, got out
on a break. She makes or gets a fouled, gets a free throw, breaks the ice
early; but instead it may have been a seven-minute somewhere in there, a field
goal. And we were struggling. And they were scoring. At one point the stat
sheet that came by the sideline, they were shooting 74% in the second half. It
was transition defense, one-on-one containment in that second half that we
pride ourselves in and we got back on our heels in that second half.  
But, again, we have nothing to hang our heads about, because we fought tooth
and nail right to the very end against a very good team.  
  
Q. Wisdom-Hylton and Campbell really didn't score a lot in the first two
games against you. Coming into tonight, were you more concentrated on maybe
the perimeter, because Howell did a lot of damage against you in the first two
games?  
COACH STONE: Howell, Rayburn and Malone, all three of them, and that was one
of our keys, was transition defense, to get into 25 and 00, make sure you're
on all three of them.  
For the most part in the first half we did. Actually at one time we had three
people on Rayburn. As soon as she came into the game, it came down to the
floor in the first half. Lindsay was wide open. That wasn't the game plan, but
the players had in their mind to make sure we didn't give Brittany an open
look.  
I can't say enough about this young team. With one senior on the team, they're
locking and focussed and their heart and intensity is going to benefit us yet
this year and in the future.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about how FahKara Malone hurt you in the
second half, scoreless in the first half, double 13, pushed it up a little
bit?  
COACH STONE: She's the quarterback of that team. She's a special player. And
you've got two 5'3" point guards out there defying all doubters that little
people can't play.  
Both of them can. Both Rae Lin and FahKara are great point guards. They're fun
to watch, a good match-up. But when she gets rolling, when she's moving, she's
hard to stop. She's hard to contain, frankly.  
She handles the ball both right and left. She got loose on a couple of 3-point
shots. But we were digging in. Their posts were beating us inside, and so we
started to choke in a little more, they'd pass that ball right out and got
FahKara going a little bit. Her best game is when they're in transition. And
that's when Purdue is at their best, they can run you wide. They have Wisdom-
Hylton and Campbell coming down the middle and do some damage on the inside.
Their outside game is very good. They're a very good team.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the depth this year in the Big Ten? It
seems to matter, the record of the teams seems to matter, the venues, seems
like for the most part the games are not that out of reach. So can you expand
on that a little bit?  
COACH STONE: What's happened is from top to bottom our league has gotten
better. From top to bottom our league has done a great job in out-of-
conference scheduling. Our RPI and strength of schedule has improved.  
The teams are better. It's exciting for the future because the league is
pretty young for the most part. I mean, I know that there's five seniors I
mentioned from Purdue but their recruiting class is pretty special.  
When you look at Iowa that's going to be playing, they've got some seniors.
But they've got some nice players. But the bottom line, overall I think the
conference is young. It's exciting. And we want as many teams playing post-
season as possible to keep that recognized.  
And I think there's a lot of teams deserving, and I think the better we do in
out-of-conference puts us in a position to have more teams in the NCAA
tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

THE MODERATOR: Okay. We'll open up with the general comments from Coach Lisa
Bluder then go to the student-athletes.  
COACH BLUDER: Want to congratulate Ohio State for a great game. They played
really well. Their defense was great in the first half and it almost
shellshocked us the way they played defense.  
We were back on our heels, turned the ball over too many times at the
beginning of the game and you just can't give a good team like that that many
points right off the bat.  
The second half we came around a little bit. We did a better job taking care
of the basketball, shot the ball a little bit better. So that's good, but
obviously this game didn't go the way we would have liked it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kristi, I think I saw you shaking your head early in the first half. What
was that like the first 10 minutes?  
KRISTI SMITH: You know, it's just frustrating. We obviously didn't come out
the way we wanted to start the game, and you can't give good teams like Ohio
State -- I don't really know what to say. We definitely didn't start the way
we wanted to.  
  
Q. Kristi, could you talk about the turnovers in the first half, especially
that first about eight minutes, I think you had about seven or so, the team?  
KRISTI SMITH: To their credit, they're a great defensive team, and I think
they just caught us on our heels and caught us off guard.  
They were intense. And we weren't prepared for it.  
  
Q. Kamille, did they do anything different than the first time you played
them, defensively?  
KAMILLE WAHLIN: They're just a very good man-to-man defensive team. They came
out and we knew that was going to happen. But, like Kristi said, we were on
our heels and we didn't attack them like we should have like we did the first
time we played them.  
  
Q. Kristi, I know you're not always underneath, but Jantel Lavender and Star
Allen, how can you -- they seemed to have their way tonight.  
KRISTI SMITH: Yeah, they were beasts down low tonight and they got a whole lot
of rebounds and that hurt us.  
We just gotta go work the next couple of weeks and get better.  
  
Q. Kristi, what do you think is the biggest difference between yesterday's
performance and today?  
KRISTI SMITH: Just we didn't attack tonight. Last night I felt as though we
were attacking the hole a lot harder, more aggressive. Our shots were falling
last night. Our shots weren't falling so much tonight.  
  
Q. Could you talk about that a little bit more, both of you, just the shots
not falling tonight, kind of the shooting performance?  
KRISTI SMITH: Basically, you know, when our shots don't fall, we've got to
count on our defense. We've got to get stops. And we didn't do that.  
  
Q. Kamille, you really provided a spark in the second half. You scored seven
points of your team's 15-to-4 run or whatnot. Could you talk about that little
mini run you had in the first half?  
KAMILLE WAHLIN: Wish they could have come a little earlier because when you go
against a team like Ohio State, it needs to be a full 40 minutes. It can't
happen halfway through the second half.  
It was a good little run, and hopefully we can take that run and learn from it
and realize that we need to put that into 40 minutes instead of just a little
spurt here and there. But that's just something that we have to learn going
into the tournament.  
  
Q. Kristi, could you talk about you guys came in, seven-game winning streak,
played your best ball of the year and that first half and overall not playing
as well as you had been?  
KRISTI SMITH: That definitely wasn't the half that we -- or how we wanted to
come out and play, but we have two weeks to work hard and prepare ourselves
for the NCAA tournament and I'm sure we'll take full advantage of it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk just more about that start? What about their defense
changed maybe from the first time you played them or did anything?  
COACH BLUDER: I think they came out much more aggressive than they did at our
place the first time. And, yeah, it caught us off guard a little bit.  
But we have seen good defense throughout the year. But Ohio State certainly is
a great team. And they really came out with that wanting to avenge that loss,
and they did a great job to begin this.  
We turned the ball over too many times. They had 13 points off our turnovers
in the first half. Second half we did a much better job, only three turnovers
in the second half. We did a lot of things better in the second half, but you
can't give that much of an advantage to a great team.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about Lavender and Allen, they really, both had
great games down low?  
COACH BLUDER: They did. And Jantel Lavender is just, she's just a wonderful
player. She's a great, great player. I thought we could do a better job on
Star. I think Star is a quality player as well. But her rebounding tonight was
exceptional.  
Bothers me how many rebounds, she gets seven offensive rebounds. That's
something we have a little control over. It bothers me that we didn't box out
a little bit better underneath.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about what do you think the biggest difference is
between today's performance and yesterday's?  
COACH BLUDER: The ball didn't go in the hole as much for us. We shot the ball
extremely well at our place, and we got to the free-throw line 30 times.
Tonight we got to the free-throw line nine times. That's not enough for us.  
We're a good free-throw shooting team. We're used to being at the free-throw
line. We're used to being able to penetrate and drawing some fouls. And we
weren't able to have that happen tonight. So I think that was a big difference
for us.  
  
Q. Did you guys help your seed this weekend, do you think, for the NCAA
tournament?  
COACH BLUDER: I think so. We came in here playing very well in our last 10
games and played well yesterday. I know the whole thing, the seed, is not
based on one 20-minute performance.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit more about the shooting, seeing they were
pretty cold in the first half?  
COACH BLUDER: Especially from 3-point range, we're a good 3-point shooting
team. But we didn't get many good looks either. Give credit to Ohio State for
that. They really got out and really took away our strengths, and we just
didn't take advantage of some things that we felt we could take advantage of,
too. For example, a guard guarding Wendy down in the block. But we couldn't
get her the ball. And, again, give credit to Ohio State for preventing us from
doing that.  
  
Q. How important of a part to their offense do you see Allen as being? Coach
Foster talked about he thought that what hurt them in the first game was when
she was out for about five minutes late in the first half?  
COACH BLUDER: I'm sorry?  
  
Q. Talking to him for the last month, he's talked about how Star Allen being
out against you guys was what really put them off track then and obviously she
had a great game tonight.  
COACH BLUDER: She did. I mean, she did. She had a great game. Especially
rebounding-wise, I thought she was very, very good. No, she didn't play as
well as she did tonight at our place. That's absolutely true.  
She didn't have those kind of rebounding numbers. I just feel like we should
have been able to beat her off the dribble a little bit more, off the dribble
drive. Again, give her credit that she was able to contain our drives.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the game Kamille had especially against going
head up against the Big Ten Freshman of the Year a lot?  
COACH BLUDER: Kamille, she struggled to begin with. It's tough when you go
into a game like that, and she had some early turnovers. But I think it really
shows a lot of her maturity, the way she turned it around the second half. I
mean, she came out the second half and did a great job attacking and wasn't
scared to pull up.  
And I'm disappointed that we didn't keep getting her the ball in that
situation, and I needed to stress that more. So I'm just pleased with the way
she was able to turn it around, because sometimes that doesn't happen,
especially to a younger player, they're not able to turn it around within a
game like that. So she did a great job with that.  
  
Q. Coach, twice in the game they missed both free throws and then got the
rebound to put it back in. How demoralizing is that?  
COACH BLUDER: That is -- that's one of those things that's pretty demoralizing
when that happens. You get to the free-throw line. They did not shoot well
from the free-throw line tonight. We just didn't take advantage of that with
the boxouts. But, again, it's something for us to really work on in the next
couple of weeks.  
  
Q. Only Kristi and Kamille finishing double figures scoring, how big of an
effect was that? Normally you guys run on being really balanced.  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, but we were still balanced tonight. We didn't have the
people on double figures, but we had two people with 9, two people with 8, two
people with 11. So we were balanced, just not enough high balance.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2009

  

### [Brittany Rayburn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19283)

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

### [Lindsay Wisdom-
Hylton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16907)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  68  
Indiana - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: We will begin with an opening statement from Coach Sharon
Versyp then we'll go to the student-athletes for questions. Sharon.  
COACH VERSYP: I just thought this was going to be a great battle with in-state
rivals. There's always so much at stake. Everyone thinks they're on the
bubble, they're definitely an NCAA team, great basketball team. Have so much
great respect for them.  
We were just able to do really do some things down the stretch. I think
Danielle Campbell's block where Lindsay Wisdom-Hylton was able to pick it up
and pick it ahead of Brittany Rayburn was obviously a big key defensive play
and offensive play for us to get the momentum and do a great job with 14
seconds left and playing really good defense and being able to secure the
rebound.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Lindsay, just talk about that sequence there, looking up and seeing
Brittany racing down the court. Sort of take us through what happened there.  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: Well, she kind of saw that I secured the ball and she
kind of just took off and it was a great play.  
And I kind of wanted to make sure I gave her a good pass. So not turn the ball
over. And just throw it out of bounds. I kind of tossed it up there, gave her
enough time to get it. She did a good job with finishing with contact.  
  
Q. Brittany, talk about how you controlled the game especially in the second
half. What did Coach tell you at halftime, some adjustments?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: We just came out fired up as a team. We were like now we
have it where we want it, and we had to go fight for it. There was really no
change in game plan. We just went out there and wanted it more in the second
half.  
  
Q. Lindsay, you're down 14 in the first half and then you guys finish on a
17-to-4 run, but Brittany had nine points in that stretch. How big was that
stretch for her to maybe take over and be aggressive going to the hole?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: It was huge. We were trying to be more aggressive. Our
outside shot was not falling at that time. And she was the only one really
taking and being aggressive to the hole. She was able to get to the line a
couple times. And we were feeding off her. We all get excited and had the
momentum going and we did good.  
  
Q. Brittany, you were really kind of composed. Looked like every time you
had the ball you were getting bumped or hit and you still came back and were
driving hard to the basket. I guess what was your mentality in the game,
especially in the second half?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I knew coming in here it's tournament time and all
upperclassmen were telling me it's a different atmosphere. Definitely was. It
was more physical and something we have to focus on and going strong out
there. It's really no different than any other game. So I felt like by people
telling me what to look for really helped.  
  
Q. Brittany, compare this game, your own performance with the first time you
played Indiana.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I just felt like I was more composed. It's been a long
season. I felt like we've grown more as a team, and I feel more comfortable
with who I'm playing with and I think they feel more comfortable with me and I
think we just played more together as a team this game.  
  
Q. Lindsay, did you feel like this team's experience sort of helped you
through that period in the first half when you got down to double digits
there?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I think so. Just everybody on the court, we had to
execute and take care of the ball and play good defense, and that's really
what we were stressing. We've been here before. A lot of people, not Brittany,
but we've been here before and been in these types of situations.  
And I think the last time we played them it was the same situation but we
weren't able to execute and finish at the end. That was the problem. Both
teams have grown since then and we did a better job executing at the end and
that's why we came out on the top.  
  
Q. Brittany, this is your first college post-season game. You would expect
nerves a little bit, but if there were, they sure didn't show.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Again, basketball has a lot to do with composure. You can't
freak out in situations. When you have five senior leaders on your team, it
helps you stay composed because you know they're going to step up and do
things too. It's not all about you and it's definitely easy when you have
people leading you through it.  
  
Q. Lindsay, I believe you actually fist pumped after the first free throw
you made. Just kind of talk about the importance of this win for you guys. I'm
sure you really wanted it after losing to them earlier this year.  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: Exactly. We did lose last -- earlier in the season to
them and we wanted to come out. And we have that in-state rival. We really
wanted to come out and do better this time. And I think we did, and we showed
it. And we were kind of feeding off of each other with energy.  
And we were able to come back with being down with a deficit. We did a really
good job coming back and we just fed off each other's energy.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with Coach Versyp.  
  
Q. Sharon, what changed in the complexion of the game when Rayburn came in
and started attacking the basket like that?  
COACH VERSYP: We needed somebody to attack. They were being so aggressive on
offense. And FahKara Malone wasn't getting any kind of penetration, nobody
else was. And Jodi Howell's 3-ball wasn't falling. Those are the things we've
asked from Britty. We told her if you're in rhythm shoot the 3.  
Other than that she's a great pull-up jump shooter. She knows how to get
people in foul trouble. She has great body control attacking the glass. She's
matured so much in the minutes she's played with her upperclassmen. She just
knew what she needed to do and she was obviously very successful.  
  
Q. Just to see this team finish the deal in this kind of game and this kind
of environment, what did that mean to you to see that happen like that?  
COACH VERSYP: It was a huge key for us. Our five games that we played so well,
we pretty much had average of 18-point wins, then we lose a close one at
Michigan State.  
So this is great for the psyche. Everybody thinks the game is so physical
right now, but it's more of the mental edge. And I think our players stayed
focus. When we were down by 14, I constantly said, Don't worry about the score
in the next four minutes; we're cutting it to an 8-point lead. And then the
next, Get it down to 6. And we said before we went in we wanted it to 4 and we
had it to 1. So when you walk in, no one was panicking, we were in great
shape.  
  
Q. You started out the game in man then went to the zone, then you went back
to some man in the second half. What did you see out of your team that you
said let's go back to some man here in the second half?  
COACH VERSYP: I think it's just a gut reaction as a coach. You just see the
tempo. And if someone's hurting you and they hit a couple 3s, because we
didn't cover anything actually when we were in that zone.  
First half, we held them the last seven minutes. They didn't have a field
goal, just had free throws. And we went to our one defense. Then in the second
half we kept switching it up so you're always trying to keep the team off
balance.  
But it was more my gut I was changing it on the fly most of the time.  
  
Q. In your opening comments you said IU is definitely an NCAA tournament
team. Could you expand why the committee should put them in?  
COACH VERSYP: They've had a great season. We all have highs and lows. They've
beat some very good teams. I totally feel we should have six in the
tournament. And the Big Ten is very tough, has a lot of parity.  
So I think if you look at ours, IU has outside shots, the inside, they're very
competitive, they're fun to watch. They play great basketball. And I just
think they deserve it, as well as our Big Ten Conference, that six should get
in.  
  
Q. After watching Jori Davis score 22 yesterday, how did you plan to
neutralize her today?  
COACH VERSYP: She was a key. Jamie Braun and Whitney Thomas and Jori Davis,
when they start getting the stroke -- I mean, Jamie had a really great stroke
going. But we knew we had to take something away. Can't take everything away
because they have such a well-balanced scoring attack.  
But I really feel that that was a key to really keep her down in scoring as
much as we can, get her in foul trouble a little bit. I think [Lakisha]
Freeman, she doesn't get a lot of credit, but she's really our best defender.
She really locks down players and doesn't allow them to score a lot of points.
And I thought she and our team collectively, whether we're playing man or zone
or switching, we all did a nice job.  
  
Q. We've managed not to talk a lot about Lindsay, but she had 17 and 15. Can
you talk about -- she seemed to have a hand in almost every critical play it
seemed like.  
COACH VERSYP: That was a big key for her. She was not happy at all how she
played at Michigan State, and she was going to make sure no one had a good
contested shot; that everybody was taking care of the basketball and she
wasn't going to turn the ball over.  
But, you know, Lindsay Wisdom-Hylton was facing the basket. They were double-,
triple-teaming her down low so she had that great face-up jumper. Her
rebounding is just amazing. She just has a knack for the ball. She's a great
leaper. And she's been a huge key to our success. How do you have 15 -- you
have more boards than points. And she's going to be the key for us in the
March run.  
  
Q. Can you talk about FahKara's defense in the last series on the Jamie
Braun and how she denied her?  
COACH VERSYP: I thought one of the big keys before they called the timeout is
Jamie is such a great shooter, she has a great step-back. And every time she
started penetrating, then she started bringing it back.  
FahKara, we always teach when you start bringing the ball back, to approach
and force them to the sideline. And I thought she couldn't get a good look
off. And then they called the timeout. And then just every time everybody who
was switching every screen, we didn't want a 3 to occur. Everybody denying,
not foul the shooter period. But I thought FahKara just wasn't going to let
her get the ball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Jolette Law](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18032)

### [Lacey Simpson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18034)

### [Jenna Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18033)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  70  
Illinois - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening statement from Coach Law, and then we'll
go to the student-athletes. Coach.  
COACH LAW: I give a lot of credit to Ohio State. First five minutes of the
game they dictated. They pressured the ball. And they got after it. And we dug
a hole early in the first half, and we just took the cover, I think my team
came back in the second half playing a bit more poised and dictating on
defense.  
We ended up playing 34 to 24 in the second half, but it was a little bit too
late.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Lacey, do you feel like you guys came out a bit tentative or intimidated
today, especially with the younger players?  
LACEY SIMPSON: I definitely think we came out with a more fear mindset. Ohio
State, they came out ready to play and they were hitting shots and ours wasn't
falling.  
  
Q. Jenna, what did you tell your younger teammates about playing on this
stage before the game, about how they should come out, I guess?  
JENNA SMITH: I mean, we just come out every game ready to play. Coach has a
saying: Don't blink, don't back down. That's the way you have to look at it.
You have to come out and play.  
It wasn't any special speech or anything we told them special. Just don't be
nervous. We played Ohio State twice. We knew them and they knew us. It was
just you have to bring your A game today.  
  
Q. Jenna, what was kind of happening in the locker room at halftime? What
was going on?  
JENNA SMITH: I think all of us were getting angry. We were getting blown out
by halftime. It was just embarrassing. That's the first thing that coach said
at halftime, it was embarrassing, getting blown out at halftime.  
A lot of us were angry. We knew we needed to play better in the second half to
get back into the game. I think a lot of us were just more fired up than when
we came out in the beginning of the game.  
  
Q. Jenna, I know the loss is still fresh, but the future of this program
looks pretty bright. How soon will you be able to look forward and start
focusing on what's ahead next year for this program?  
JENNA SMITH: I mean, it is a tough loss. And I wish we would have gone out a
better way. You always do have to look for it. We were just talking about how
we've grown as a team, gotten closer. Our freshmen have grown.  
Lacey and I will be seniors next year. We'll have to lead the way. We have a
big freshman class coming in. Our sophomores, they've been here a year. We
don't lose anybody that has played in the Big Ten tournament, that has played
with us in the last games. And that's what's going to help us in the long run.  
We have to think positive and just stick together as a team and work hard.
Basketball players are made in the spring and summer, like coach said. And we
just have to work together.  
  
Q. Lacey, as you look at this, do you guys carry some momentum into next
year coming off of a couple of wins here before tonight? Is there momentum
going into next year now?  
LACEY SIMPSON: Of course. Every time you have a loss like this, you always
have it in the back of your head. We know we have some things to work on.
We're just going to take these whatever breaks we get and get back to work.  
And we work out everything we do, we're going to remember this. And we're
going to feed off of it for next year.  
  
Q. Lacey, kind of a rough shooting night for yourself and a bunch of your
teammates. Was this more of a defense of Ohio State, or was it just not
falling tonight?  
LACEY SIMPSON: The shots just wasn't falling. I don't think it really had
anything to do with Ohio State's defense. We got going a little bit better in
the second half. I guess the first half wasn't our half.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Continue with Coach Law.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about kind of the intimidation factor a little bit
and what you told, especially, your younger players before the game about
that?  
COACH LAW: Just before the game, it's like right now, this is it. It's just no
time to get scared or no time to blink. Just you have to look Ohio State toe
to toe. They're the champions of the Big Ten, and just go out and play. I
never try to talk about the NCAAs and all that stuff because I have a young
group.  
But right now, it's 40 minutes. And treat this as a championship game. We win,
we go on. We lose, we go home. Just look at them: Just play free. We have
nothing to lose, everything to gain because we've done it all.  
  
Q. There wasn't intimidation factor, especially in the beginning with that
start?  
COACH LAW: I just think that Ohio State was the aggressors. They came out,
they pressured. They got up on my guard, Shavelle, a little. It was hard for
us to get into our offensive sets. And I just think that once we turned the
ball over a couple times and our shots weren't falling, we didn't do anything
on defense.  
The most important thing that I was really upset is we weren't talking or
communicating on defense like we were yesterday. And I just think that some of
my freshmen were a little nervous.  
  
Q. Last year's successes and the win over Ohio State, did that kind of have
a negative impact maybe this year, kind of gave them something to shoot for on
you a little bit?  
COACH LAW: I'm sure. In the back of their minds it's like we're not going to
let what happened last year happen to us this year. They came out focused.
And, again, I give a lot of credit to them. They came out and they dictated.
They wanted it. And I just think that last year, in the back of my mind, if
you lose as a first seed, you're not going to let that happen again.  
And, again, just like tonight, after we go back and I watch them again, just
getting my team charged right now for we know how this felt. We don't like
losing in the second round. We want to make sure we focus on what we need to
do. And the positive is that everybody's coming back. Keep them uplifted so
that when the newcomers come in they'll be able to share this experience with
them.  
  
Q. How much more difficult is Ohio State to stop when people like Allen and
Johnson have their games going like they did especially in the first half?  
COACH LAW: I just think when I look at the stat sheet, and I look at Star
Allen, and Brittany Johnson is the one really got going early. And you know
Jenna Smith -- and you can look at Jenna and Jantel Lavender pretty much X'd
each other out. Star Allen and Lacey Simpson.  
But the key factor was, Johnson came in, started doing her damage. She was
perfect from the field. She got going. When she got going, it's hard to stop
them inside. Their inside was their inside. And I knew she was a great player.
But she came out, she was perfect from the field. She couldn't miss.  
  
Q. Talk about the decision with Lacey and the starting lineup after
yesterday's game and how is Whitney Toone healthwise?  
COACH LAW: Whitney, she's day to day. She has fluid on her knee. With Whitney
playing, I wanted to keep the pressure off of Whitney. Whitney played
extremely well. She was comfortable coming off the bench. Didn't want to lose
Macie, because Macie is an integral part of our offense as well. But just
right now had to go with my gut, go with Macie Blinn and see how it goes and
bring Whitney in off the bench.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about what you said to your game what you said
to them after the game, maybe what you're going to talk to them after this?  
COACH LAW: I told them pretty much right now, we lost the game. It was
unfortunate. If we played the first half like we played the second half, it
would have been a different story. But the most important thing is I've seen
-- I don't look at the record. I know that this team has grown. We've gotten
better, and I gave each one of them different things, different areas that
I've seen growth.  
And the positive is just don't think about what happened this year, take all
the positives so that we can build on it next year. This is going to be the
nucleus of my team.  
And right now those, we look at 10 and 21. I know the season wasn't a 10 and
21 season. Because my young people, my freshmen, they did get better. Lydia
McCully got better as a point guard, confidence later in the season. Macie
Blinn was very confident. She became a confident shooter. Whitney Toone came
in and played some key minutes the last couple of games.  
I'm just encouraged that next year they're going to be better. They're going
to be a year older. And they've logged a lot of minutes. And the experience
they had this year will definitely carry over into next year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2009

  

### [Aisha Jefferson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16887)

### [Lykendra Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19276)

### [Suzy Merchant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17249)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Wisconsin  56  
Michigan State - 50

  
THE MODERATOR: We will open with a statement from Coach Suzy Merchant, then go
to the student-athletes. Coach.  
COACH MERCHANT: Gotta give Wisconsin a lot of credit. I thought they did a
great job of pressuring us, and we didn't handle it. And I think that was the
story of the game.  
I certainly felt like we had our opportunities. But I mean they rattled every
guard we put out there, which caused our inability to get the ball inside as
well. And they did a nice job of bothering us, bringing the ball up the court
in the quarter court, denial of our wings, and we didn't have anybody that
kept eyes on the pressure at all in terms of taking it to the basket.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Aisha, did they do anything differently down there in the second half
that kept you guys from scoring in the paint?  
AISHA JEFFERSON: No, not really. I think us as post players, we weren't
showing. They were very physical. And in the second half, I think we kind of
let down in the second half, especially on their two post players. We let them
loose. I felt we attacked them in the first half which caused them to get in
foul trouble, and we just went away from that.  
  
Q. Lykendra, what happened on that technical that you got hit with?  
LYKENDRA JOHNSON: Our arms got tangled up. I tried to get myself off of her,
and she ended up calling it a dead ball tech.  
  
Q. You guys brought it pretty close there at the end. Either one of you --
what was going through your mind? Were you guys just trying to attack a little
bit more?  
AISHA JEFFERSON: Definitely, started in the second half. That late, because we
were running out of time, were just trying to turn it up at the end, just
because we were running out of time. We should have started like that the
second half, and we were just thinking about trying to score at that time. And
that's only the reason we had a little more intensity.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with Coach Merchant.  
  
Q. Were you surprised with so many offensive fouls in your half court sets
that you had?  
COACH MERCHANT: We haven't had that all year. I mean, that's a world record
for offensive fouls, calls against Michigan State.  
  
Q. Did Wisconsin do anything differently in the second half?  
COACH MERCHANT: No. They played the same game. The thing they did was they got
into our grille a little bit and we didn't respond. We needed composure.  
We had some inconsistency from that in our guard play. It was the other end.
Sometimes you get real good effort and focus and composure. And sometimes you
don't. And today was one of those. We didn't.  
And we talked a lot about turnovers. And I thought Rae Lin D'Alie, give her a
lot of credit, but I thought she embarrassed us out there today. We just threw
it to her and we gave it to her and she took it from us. You look at the 17
points off turnovers and it makes it pretty difficult to defend.  
  
Q. You guys have dealt with turnovers all year. But was that just something
that --  
COACH MERCHANT: These were turnovers for touchdowns again. That's the
difference. We've been turning it over. But they haven't been as severe. And
then obviously today, I mean, it was -- give it to them. We didn't want any
part of stepping up, and we couldn't get into scoring pocket to run our
offense. And that starts with the point guard position.  
And we didn't have wings that could get open. And we tried everything. We
tried ball screening. We tried high post entries. We tried screening in. We
did everything we possibly could that we had. And it came down to stepping up
and being a player and handling that pressure. And we just did not do it. And
you have to give them a lot of credit.  
  
Q. Coach, how good are they defensively? How much better are they than they
have been in the past?  
COACH MERCHANT: I definitely think they're a lot better than they have been in
the past. No question. They're very physical. I thought that played a major
factor. They were very physical off the ball. We couldn't cut. We couldn't
even go to set a screen at times to free our people up.  
Normally I think they really blast you off the ball. And on the ball obviously
they really get up into you and when you pass away, it makes it difficult. I
do think they definitely have improved that part of their game.  
  
Q. Despite the loss, do you feel you've done enough --  
COACH MERCHANT: I do. I don't know why we wouldn't. I certainly believe that,
yes.  
  
Q. This was your third different starting point guard against Wisconsin. If
you're fortunate enough to reach the tournament, where are you at with your
point guard situation?  
COACH MERCHANT: Obviously losing Brittney was detrimental. But we went 4-2 in
those games beating Ohio State and Purdue and Indiana. We've done it with a
couple different people.  
We tried [Kalisa] Keane there. We tried Mia Johnson there. And, of course, we
could use Porsche Poole a little bit, but I try to use her off the ball a
little bit because she's better off the ball. I don't know how you want to
answer that except where am I at with it? It is what it is. And we only have a
handful of options.  
But they've been pretty good to this point. They just did not step up to the
challenge.  
  
Q. This has kind of been the game plan that other teams have brought against
you the last two games. Is there anything you guys can do differently to kind
of keep those turnovers down or try to --  
COACH MERCHANT: We've tried. We had the four-man bring it up. To me, I just
feel you have to be able to pass and dribble. You have to get the ball from
one end to the other to run offense. That simple. However we do it.  
We've done it with four-man bringing it down and point guard, makeshift point
guard bringing it down, our off guard bringing it down.  
I mean, we have 100 different options really. But at some point you have to
dribble the ball down the floor and get into an offense, however you do it. I
feel we have enough options, we just did not do a very good job of it today.  
  
Q. Could you reflect on Allyssa's milestone with the block buster?  
COACH MERCHANT: Obviously she's a force in there. Certainly feel like it's
nice to have her back, if we do get beat on dribble drives, that she's back
there to do a good job of going after shots.  
And that's something that plays -- doesn't matter where we put her: If she
ends up getting switched out on a perimeter guy, that 6'9" frame does bother
people. Give her a lot of credit for that. That's a great feat. She still has
one more year to go.  
  
Q. Lastly, do you think having that lack of 3-point shooting, that lack of
outside presence in the game, has been hurting you because the last two teams
have just been packing almost five people in the paint.  
COACH MERCHANT: I think tonight's game was more about them getting into us
than packing it in. I thought we did a good job of when it went in there of
making extra passes and getting some looks.  
But certainly that's something that -- it's nothing new. We knew that they
were going to get up into us, and I think the story of the game was more us
turning it over against pressure than it was getting double teamed on the low
post. We couldn't even get it into a position to get the ball into a low post.  
That just hasn't been the case. We've done a very good job up until this
point. You look at our last six games without Brittney, and we've done a very
good job of that. So tonight we did a very, very bad job today, and obviously
it cost us the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2009

  

### [Amber Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18028)

### [Felisha Legette-Jack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16871)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  68  
Indiana - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up with a statement from Coach Felisha Legette-Jack
Jack, then go to Amber.  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: What a great game. What a great in-state opportunity for
our community to see that we have great women's basketball in our state.  
I just think that we're just going to continue to get better. And we're
getting closer to really representing -- we're not over that edge yet, but
we're on our way.  
I thought Purdue played really hay basketball down the stretch. I thought our
kids did some fantastic things as well. And I'd like to watch those last three
minutes to see really what happened before I can really let this settle into
my spirit.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Amber Jackson?  
  
Q. Amber, the first I think ten minutes you had 10 points, then the rest of
the game only had 3 points. What changed with Purdue's approach to you?  
AMBER JACKSON: They changed their defense. And they doubled me as soon as I
touched it, so I couldn't get a good look off or even think to dribble because
they were collapsing on me pretty hard. So all I could do was really kick out.  
I just tried to stay on the boards and do what I could defensively to help our
team.  
  
Q. Amber, I know it's tough times right now, but can you put it in words,
the disappointment you feel right now, to come so close in a game that meant
so much?  
AMBER JACKSON: I say right now for my team and myself, the pain is pretty
insurmountable. Playing at Indiana, playing against Purdue, that's the one
game you don't ever want to lose, especially on a stage like this.  
We as seniors are really expecting to get to post-season play NCAA, and
hopefully we still have a chance. But this game meant so much to us. And to
lose this, it hurts. For it to be Purdue, of all people, just to lose, to come
this close, it looks as if everything is so close, three rebounds and we just
didn't pull it off at the end. So I'm very disappointed.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Amber.  
Questions for Coach Jack.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about how maybe things changed for
Purdue when Brittany Rayburn came in and started attacking a little bit?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: Oh, she attacked. We attacked. They made shots. We missed
a couple shots. A couple of free throws we needed to hit in order for us to
get our momentum going again, for us to set our press.  
But I thought they had a collective unit. You can't put your concentration on
one kid. You have to put it on all of them. And she just happened to be the
one that hit the shot.  
  
Q. Sharon Versyp (Purdue head coach) said that you guys definitely are a
tournament team. And after today's performance, I'm assuming yourself that you
guys think you're right there and you can beat any teams in the Big Ten and
other conferences as well.  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: That's great to hear from my colleague. I really believe
that she's right. There's nothing in my spirit that tells me that we're not
going to be one of 64. I think we laid our hats out there throughout the
season, and it's up to the committee to make that decision.  
One thing I know, whether we get into the tournament or we're in the great
WNIT, I just know that this is a team that everybody needs to see. I think
this is a great television game for all to see our conference.  
We have a fantastic conference. I think that Purdue, it's unbelievable for
them to go out and do what they did against Texas without their point guard at
the time and run the gamut down the stretch as they usually do, it's a credit
to their program as well. So I think we're on our way. I think we're on the
big stage.  
  
Q. Coach, you called a timeout with 14 seconds left. What were you guys
trying to do that last possession? What was the play call?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: It's teachable moments. Even under duress situations, I
ask my team what they think would work, who felt good. I wanted to see what
eyes light up before I make a decision on what call to make.  
I really felt Jori Davis was the solution down the stretch. After we made that
call, we had little Whitney hit the ball. We were trying to make the back
defense play little Whitney so we can hand it off to Jori. But the kid never
came. So we had to continue with the dribble. They go to Amber Jackson and we
just fumbled the ball, fumbled the ball, and we had to make a duress
situation.  
I like the idea what Kim Roberson tried to do. Let's not try to tie it, let's
try to win it. And it just fell short. But I love the spirit of this team. I
love the spirit of these individuals, because what they're saying is when they
would leave Indiana University they're going to be prepared for a bigger stage
and it's called life. They're ready.  
  
Q. Coach, after yesterday's win, you talked about your players' eyes in the
beginning of the game. And today's game was a polar opposite start to
yesterday's game. Did you see it in your players' eyes tonight?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: Absolutely, I saw it the whole way. Sometimes the ball
just doesn't fall in the hole. I just know there from the beginning to the end
everybody that stepped out there was prepared and they were ready and they
were defending what we thought that we were trying to receive, is that win.  
We just fell short. We ran out of time. I'd love to look at that last three
minutes to see what really happened, because I just think we did all we could
do to put ourselves in the position to win. And at the end of the day that's
all you want from your players.  
  
Q. You guys had some foul trouble towards the end of the first half and they
were able to cut it to 1 at halftime, how key was that?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: That was really key. With Whitney Thomas and Kim Roberson
still in the game, with us up by 12, I think we could really take that up to
20 with that momentum we had. And when we had to go to the bench a little bit,
that hurt us. Not that they couldn't score, our kids, they wouldn't shoot.  
And what we talk about is, again, this microcosm of life thing of the game; if
you've got an open shot, you've got to take it because you're not certain if
you'll get that second one. When you have Purdue's defense, you certainly may
not get that second chance. And our kids wouldn't take those first shots.  
  
Q. How big was it to get Jamie Braun going again?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: Jamie Braun is not going to stop. She is like the Eveready
battery. You think it's dead, want to throw it away, but it sparks up again.
She had a bad game.  
You won't find Jamie Braun having two bad games. She's a kid that she
understands that problems happen, things happen. Next play. Next opportunity.  
And she was going to start up whether we got her going or not. It was great to
see her step back, but she always does.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  70  
Illinois - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Jim Foster and the student-athletes. Are
you going to decline your opening statement like you usually do? Okay. So
we'll go straight to the student-athletes. Raise your hand and we'll get a mic
to you.  
  
Q. Jantel, the start of this game you guys hit the first of your 10 shots.
How focused were you guys for this game and how good were you at the
beginning? Is this one of your better starts to a game this season?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I think so. I think we came out and we reversed the ball well
and there was open shots and everybody was knocking them down.  
  
Q. You lost to these guys last year. Did you want to make a statement -- is
there any kind of a statement in this game that you're a better team than you
were a year ago, Jantel?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: Definitely. I think we came out and we knew we had lost to
them last year. And we knew it was our chance to get some -- get tough against
them because we lost to them last year and I think we came out extremely
focused and ready to play.  
  
Q. Brittany, I think I looked you up. I don't think you even scored in this
game last year. How much more prepared and in what ways were you more prepared
to help this team than you were a year ago?  
BRITTANY JOHNSON: I think I'm more confident and my teammates are confident to
me which allows them to pass me the ball and hit the shot.  
But I think that last year from this year I overlooked my shot. I didn't look
for my shot. And this year I think I just need to step up and hit shots.  
  
Q. Sam, you weren't even here last year. How much were you guys pushing to
get this game, and it's the kind of transition game you got it in, and how
much easier does it make it for you guys to play when you can go out and
run?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: What was the question again?  
  
Q. You guys got the run of this game. Illinois is hard to run against. How
much focus was there on getting out and running in this game and how much of a
difference did it make for you in getting your offense going early?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: Well, every game you want to run. So it's just like -- it's
like an every-game thing that we want to push the tempo and run.  
And today I think the wings ran real well and we were flowing well. We just
got some fast breaks and everyone was being aggressive, and just bringing
energy which was what the game plan was.  
  
Q. Jantel, again, in this game with them -- you didn't feel sorry for them,
I guess, in this game is what I want to ask you, that you just kind of kept
your foot on their necks in the game. Is that something that this team might
be better at doing this year than you were last year?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: Can you say it again?  
  
Q. Basically you guys never let up in this game. Are you better at not
letting up on somebody this year just because you've got a big lead?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: Yeah, we've been focusing on that, just playing a -- being a
40-minute team instead of being a 20-minute team. We showed today we came out
for two hard halves and showed we can be a team to play 40 minutes straight
pushing the ball up-tempo and just having fun.  
  
Q. Jantel, was it safe to say that it was nice to have Star Allen out there
this year, I guess that's a big help?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: Definitely. I think Star is a huge help. I think she comes
and she brings a lot of energy, and she plays extremely hard and she's fun to
play with in the post, and the high-low game is like we have a good chemistry
on the floor.  
And you can always depend on somebody to be in that rebounding position and
other post positions, post up and score and rebound and everything you look
for in a post player.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach Foster.  
  
Q. Jim, just the opening of this game, how good were you in the opening of
this game? How did you like the way you opened this game, and just how focused
were they?  
COACH FOSTER: I think any time you go on a run of the amount of shots we made
in a row and percentage of shooting, sometimes that makes you very nervous,
because you know it's going to change.  
No one continues to play at that pace and that tempo. But what gave me a
comfortable feeling was how hard we were playing on the defensive end of the
floor, and we were just really digging and getting after it so that even when
we hit it a little low offensively the balls are not dropping quite as often
as it was early.  
They're not making shots, and the shots they did make they had to work very
hard to get them. So I liked our defense as much as I liked our offense in
terms of the start of the game.  
  
Q. Coach, you seem to be able to spread the minutes around in the first half
quite a bit, you sat Sammy quite a bit and also Shavelle Little. What allowed
you to do that and what was the thinking behind that?  
COACH FOSTER: Sammy got too fast, and we're not going to put her out there
with too fast in the half, we're going to sit her. And Maria came in and did a
good job and everybody was out there, continued the ball movement and the
defensive intensity. So we didn't pay a price for that.  
  
Q. Coach, the 10-for-10 to start, maybe you've seen something like that
before. Put that in perspective, because kept looking up and everything kept
dropping.  
COACH FOSTER: Sometimes that's the way it is and, again, what I enjoyed more
than that was us starting people, because you know that you're not going to
make every shot you take in the course of the game.  
And if you're going up and down and you're exchanging baskets, your quick
start could come back to hurt you. But the defense was of such a level that I
wasn't concerned in that vein.  
  
Q. A follow on that, is that even better in the last two or three weeks,
that the defensive intensity (indiscernible) like Iowa, has that gotten better
with this group?  
COACH FOSTER: Yeah, I think we're playing more with a sense of desperation. I
think teams that really, really get after it defensively understand the season
could end at a moment's notice at this time of year, and we don't want that to
happen.  
  
Q. As we move ahead to the semifinals now, there will be four teams playing
for position in the upcoming NCAA tournament. I know you talked last week a
little bit about the respect that the Big Ten gets. As we move forward, how
would you compare the talent in the Big Ten top to bottom compared to other
major conferences?  
COACH FOSTER: I think that's a question that Joe McKeown (Northwestern) and
Kevin Borseth (Michigan) could answer better as people walking into this
league and having had a discussion with Joe the other day. His comments were
that the league is a heck of a lot better than his perception of it outside of
it.  
And I think when you get inside, it's a very physical league. Very physical
league and probably the most physical in the country. And it's almost a relief
to get out of it when you get into the post-season if you're playing on all
cylinders.  
And I think there are some teams that are playing very well for this time of
year. And it probably hasn't happened in a few years in this league. And I
think the fact that you had to fight every night, the fact that Northwestern
and Michigan, when you play against them, especially at their place, you're in
for a war that night, and you just have to get to play 40 minutes. I don't
think that's necessarily been the case in this league.  
When I was in the SEC, I thought that always helped us, when we went into the
NCAA tournament. There was a fear of you losing any time you play in the SEC.
I think that's starting to evolve in this league. And you might not see it in
terms of records. But the league is better.  
Coaching certainly is better. And the competition, I think, is going to make
better teams in the post season.  
  
Q. Coach, could you please comment on Brittany Johnson's offense tonight and
what she gives you?  
COACH FOSTER: I was more pleased with Brittany's defense, to be quite frank.
Brittany makes shots. Brittany's been making shots. And if you look at the
numbers that she's put up in the Big Ten as adverse to her season numbers,
you'll see a significant jump.  
What Brittany has learned how to do is learn to play hard, as has Alison
Jackson. And a lot of times players coming out of high school don't understand
the intensity necessary at this level. And especially on the perimeter.  
Post players, they get a quicker blip, because if you don't understand it
quickly, you just get the heck beat out of you. But the perimeter, it's more
subtle, and I think last year when we got tweaked with injuries, they didn't
understand the intensity level.  
This year, when we got tweaked with injuries, they were more than ready, and
they play hard every day, and as a result we're a better basketball team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Wisconsin  56  
Michigan State - 50

  
THE MODERATOR: The routine will be the same. We'll open with a statement from
Coach Stone then go to the student-athletes for questions and then we'll
dismiss them and go back to Coach Stone.  
COACH STONE: I haven't had a chance to look at the stat sheet, but I do know
that defense sometimes doesn't show up in the stat sheet in ways outside of
blocked shots and steals.  
But this team, we're down 21 to 9 in the first half and you're sitting there
wondering how we're going to score. It was a matter of time. We shot 26
percent in the first half and we're only down 6. That's a lot because of our
defense. Our post defense was outstanding. I thought Rae Lin was unbelievable
up on the ball. Our gap defense was very, very stellar, and everybody did what
they had to do. At halftime we addressed rebounding.  
I thought we played a very, very good line of defense early. But then they got
the shot off and then they got the rebound and we fouled. So we talked about
playing defense without fouling, making sure that we clear the glass and
everybody rebounds, including our guards, and that we do what we do
offensively.  
And turnover-wise, 17 is not bad against a team like Michigan State. They're a
great basketball team, probably the most physical team in the conference.
Lykendra Johnson is one of the best offense rebounders I've ever seen. Aisha
Jefferson got going late, but I thought overall offensively and our ability to
take care of the ball down the stretch versus their pressure, that used clock
for us, we found a good shot out of it. Rae Lin's jumper on the right wing was
huge. Lin's shot in the lane was huge down the stretch and Tara had that
offensive rebound climb in. Those were big for us down the stretch when it
comes to possessions.  
But I'm proud of this team. Wisconsin in the history of our program has not
been in the semifinal game very often, nor ever to the championship game. So
we're motivated by our play recently. We're motivated by the tough losses
we've had throughout the seasons. We're motivated by the fact that our team is
together, and we're looking forward to whoever we play tomorrow. And you're
going to see that defense again tomorrow. We'll be back. We're high on
adrenalin right now and we're excited to be playing the semi final.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please. And just raise your
hands and we'll get a mic to you.  
  
Q. Rae Lin, in previous years you guys were known as a pretty electric
offensive team. How quickly, when the coaches wanted you to focus more on
defense, did your team really pick it up? And how much better are you now than
you might have been, let's say, in November?  
RAE LIN D'ALIE: Well, yeah, when I came in here freshman year we were
definitely -- it was more about offense. And my junior year, the start of it,
we got a lot of new people in the program. I mean, we got a couple of new
coaches, new strength coach, trainer, players, transfers.  
So we came out with, okay, it's a new year, we're going to have a new
identity. And our identity is defense. And it's grit, it's grime, and it's
about getting it done no matter what and getting it done together.  
And the greatest thing about it all is you know no matter what that there's a
group of people, maybe 20 or so, that no matter what, what happens, that have
your back, and that's the best feeling in the world.  
And right now, like Coach said, we're all on the same page and we're just
clicking really well.  
  
Q. Rae Lin, looks like you have a really good shot on your coach, in the
second half, and had her covering up and doubling over here toward the end of
the game. Could you talk about your game with your coach.  
RAE LIN D'ALIE: Yeah, apparently I punched her, which I didn't remember. But I
was just like really high on adrenalin, and I think I wanted to chest bump and
maybe my fist got stuck in the middle. So sorry.  
COACH STONE: It's all right.  
  
Q. Rae Lin, you got six steals in the game. Was there anything you thought
you could exploit in Michigan State?  
RAE LIN D'ALIE: Just ball pressure up top. I got done telling someone that
it's so easy to pressure the ball when you know the four people behind you are
going to be in your gap and have your help, because if she gets by, Lin does a
great job and Tara, the 4s are usually up top making sure she don't get by
like in the middle of the lane.  
So it's very easy to get up and pressure the ball when you know your teammates
have your back.  
  
Q. Tara and Lin, you got a 6'9 " girl and some other gals that have some
size to them. Talk about the fearless nature with which you attacked against,
for starters, the all-time blocking leader in Big Ten history.   
LIN ZASTROW: First of all, when you have a great shot blocker, you can't just
go over because it's going to come right back at you. So you have to try to go
around her. Like throughout the game we always tried to bring her out, so
whoever she was guarding we would try to come out so that the other one had
like a shorter person on her and could go more over the person guarding them.  
But she's a great shot blocker and you can't go through someone like that. You
have to try something else.  
TARA STEINBAUER: Just to echo what Lin said, I think a huge thing for us was
to be physical down low with them, get them out of their sets offensively and
hopefully we can make some plays, and I think we did.  
  
Q. Again, let's go to Lin. They are really big inside. How physical was it
inside and how do you think you guys did?  
LIN ZASTROW: Well, first of all, it's the Big Ten, so we knew coming in we
expected that, we all talked about it. You can't back down from a team like
that. They're great and physical and strong inside and outside. You can't back
down from that. So I think we came out strong and we responded to them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach Stone.  
  
Q. How about the punch?  
COACH STONE: Okay. She was pretty excited. Rae Lin is on a mission right now.
She's our captain. She's our leader. She's 5'3". She's a tiger out there. When
she's focused like she is and she can lead our team, that makes our job a lot
easier. But she came running off, and she's like we want it more, we want it
more and her excitement took over.  
And she just came and her arm went and -- I run and do sit-ups; it's a good
thing because I might have fallen down. She took the wind out of me. It did.
But that's all right. It could be worse. I'd rather have that than the other.  
  
Q. Were there any changes you made when you did go down those 12 points that
helped you get -- I saw you guys started packing the paint a little more?  
COACH STONE: That's our defense. We play the pack defense and you want to pack
it in. That's the number one game goal. That and rebounding. And we did that
all night long. When Rae Lin can pressure the ball like she does, and she
trusts her teammates -- we talk about servanthood and serving each other and
being in the gap for somebody else. She knows that and she can get up in
pressure. It allows our post players to be physical down low.  
I just look at DeHaan's stats. You hold her to 9 and 6, she has four blocks
and we talked about us offensively you can't go over the top of 6'9". You just
can't. Have you to go around her and take it at her. And I thought our post
defense was outstanding.  
But we didn't change, we made no adjustments defensively in the second half.
Our defense was fine. Offensively we missed three uncontested layups, and
that's okay. That's a good shot. We can make layups. That's not an issue. I'm
not even going to make an issue out of it. When you're down 6 and missed 3
uncontested, the game is tied.  
So you can go to that or go to a lot of different shots, or go in and out, but
we stayed aggressive. We got them in foul trouble in the second half. That
helped us, because the first half, many of their points -- I'm not sure what
that total is -- were from the free-throw line. It wasn't field goals. It was
from the free-throw line.  
We talked about not following, playing our defense, getting rebounds and
taking care of the ball.  
  
Q. Coach, is this pretty much the same blueprint you guys won by at home
against Michigan State?  
COACH STONE: The game plan, exactly the same. I thought we played better today
than we did at home. At home I'm not sure what the first-half score was, but
we had given up points off of turnovers in the first half. When they came out,
Lykendra got the steal mid-court, it might have been Lin had the ball and they
stepped in the pack. They caused two turnovers right there.  
At Michigan State that was the nightmare we had there. At our place in the
first half, that's what they did to us, caused us to it turn over. And they
got run-outs. When I look at stat sheets and fastbreak points, one of our
nonnegotiables is to not give up points in transition. We only gave up 4.  
Those 4 points right there, I know which turnovers they came from, so do you
all, half court, on their pressure.  
We played better against them tonight than we have in the first two outings.
It's tough to play a team three times. We all know each other. You know their
personality. You know their sets. It's executing. It's getting physical and
getting the rebounds and doing the little things. And I thought we did a good
job in the second half making sure we did that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Iowa  79  
Minnesota - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up with an opening statement from Coach Pam Borton,
then go to the student-athletes for questions.  
COACH BORTON: You've got to give Iowa a lot of credit for playing a great
basketball game today. Four people in double figures. Wendy Ausdemore had an
unbelievable game. And you gotta give them credit for playing well.  
I was very proud of our kids and the heart and hustle until the very end of
the game. And Iowa was a better team today than we were.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For Ashley or Brittany, talk about Iowa's offensive execution. They
seemed to have it going today, shot 50% for the game. What particular
difficulties did they show you today?  
ASHLEY ELLIS-MILAN: You know, I think Iowa, throughout the whole Big Ten
season, they have unbelievable offensive sets and they have unbelievable kids
who can shoot.  
And Wendy Ausdemore did an unbelievable job tonight for the Iowa basketball
team. And not only do they play offense, but they rebound. Kachine was
unbelievable. I thought she went out there and she was tenacious on the board
and didn't give up.  
I thought their offensive execution is great. They can hit a shot anywhere on
the floor. And I thought they did well, very well.  
BRITTANY McCOY: I feel like the same way. We knew they're a great offensive
team. And we set a goal for ourselves to keep them under 60 points this game,
because we knew if we kept them down, we had a chance to win.  
I felt we executed well on defense. But like Ashley said, Ausdemore went off
and had a great game. Kachine Alexander had a great game. And a lot of times
we were there on shooters and there on the catch and they were still able to
get the ball in the basket.  
  
Q. Brittany, it seemed pretty obvious that you were really determined to be
aggressive to start this game off. You were driving to the hoop and such. I
thought offensively you guys executed pretty well today overall. Did you feel
the same?  
BRITTANY McCOY: I thought we executed really well on offense. Personally, I
feel like whenever we play Iowa I have the ability to get in maybe more than
when we play other teams.  
I don't know, I just feel like a lot of times I have mismatches on the
perimeter and I like to exploit that. We had people hitting big shots for us.
I was able to distribute the ball. I felt we had good ball movement on
offense. We were getting the ball inside. So we executed well but they
executed better.  
  
Q. Brittany or Ashley, how do you think this loss affects your NCAA
tournament chances?  
ASHLEY ELLIS-MILAN: I think it affects us a lot. We needed to come out tonight
and win and we didn't. And it affects our bid for the NCAA tournament, and
we're just going to have to see what happens and go from there.  
BRITTANY McCOY: I feel the same way. We know whether we end up in the NCAA
tournament or NIT, we do have a couple more weeks of basketball. We're just
going to put our heart and souls into it. We're just going to keep working
hard and get as far as we can.  
  
Q. Can you talk about ending the Big Ten season against the rival Iowa and
kind of what the rivalry has been to you guys, Ashley and Brittany?  
ASHLEY ELLIS-MILAN: The rivalry between Iowa and Minnesota is, it's heavy. We
get ready for these games between Minnesota and Iowa and Minnesota and
Wisconsin. Those are big games for us.  
And we beat them at our house. And we lost to them there. I thought today both
teams gave their best effort. And the better team won tonight. So I give it to
Iowa.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Pam, there was a four-minute stretch there in the second half where you
finally got some defensive stops. But you couldn't make any hay with it. Did
you feel like that was the lost opportunity there?  
COACH BORTON: I think it was. I think there was a period in the first half as
well when I thought both teams were executing very well. I think it was about
the 12 and a half minute mark to the eight and a half minute mark where they
scored nine straight points. And that's kind of where they pulled away in the
first half.  
Second half we did get some stops. I think we missed a couple free throws in
that area as well that I felt like we could have, we just couldn't get any
closer than eight or 10 points in the second half. And I thought we had our
opportunities, and we wanted to take advantage of the times that they did miss
shots and the times that we were able to get some turnovers and we did not.  
  
Q. Coach, just looking at your season, got off to a really good start. The
last four or five games struggled a little bit. Can you talk a little bit
about maybe what's changed for you guys?  
COACH BORTON: Well, I'm not sure what's changed. I think it's just been the
last week. I thought we were having a great season up until last week when we
played three games in one week, and lost two games that we probably shouldn't
have lost. And we had a great game at Michigan State. So I thought we played a
lot better today than what we did in a couple of games last week.  
But we don't want to erase everything that we've done those first four, five
months before that. So I think it's just been our consistency. It's been our
consistency all year with we had three players in double figures. If we were
able to have that all year, we would have been fine with who is going to show
up and do what on this team. So I just think it's just been a lack of
consistency on our team.  
  
Q. You had talked going into this game that you thought you needed to win to
get an NCAA bid. Are you pretty much in your mind kind of convinced that maybe
NIT might be the route you go, or are you still going to be sitting on pins
and needles?  
COACH BORTON: I think we'll be sitting on pins and needles. A win today would
have been a lock for us, with 20 wins and beating all the top teams in the
conference other than Purdue, once or twice. I think we still have a shot. The
Big Ten is a very strong conference. We finished in fifth place, and we'll
wait and see.  
  
Q. Coach, I think Iowa started shooting for the game 10 for 13 at 3-point
range. Is that hard to overcome when somebody comes out that hot?  
COACH BORTON: It's very typical of Iowa. I think they came out at our place
and it was 20 to 6 in just a matter of minutes, it felt like. And we knew we
had to weather the storm and hope that they were going to miss some shots and
really kind of step up our defense a little bit.  
But every time that we did, Ausdemore would come down and hit a big shot, or
Alexander would get an offensive board. And I thought those two players played
very, very well today.  
  
Q. You got it within 10. You made a stop. Then you had a wide open 3-pointer
on the other end. Do you feel if that had gone, maybe you could have gotten
over the hump, do you think maybe that moment was the crucial moment in the
second half?  
COACH BORTON: You know, you never know against a team like Iowa. I just felt
we needed to take advantage of every offensive opportunity we had. With as
many weapons as they have, they have four or five people in double figures.
JoAnn Hamlin coming off the bench that had 21 against us at their place. And
they just have so much balance, and they're so efficient offensively, that
when one person's down, there's one or two people who step up on that end.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about Ausdemore? Shot the ball well, talk about her
game.  
COACH BORTON: I thought she played very well. I thought she hit some big
shots. And there was one shot that we had two people on her. I think it was a
shot clock, the shot clock was going down. I'm like that was the icing on the
cake. That just told you what kind of game she was having right there.  
And she's a great player. And with her playing the 4 position, the power
forward position, sometimes it creates a mismatch. A freshman guarding a
senior with her experience I thought exploited Jackie Voigt quite a bit on the
perimeter, but I thought she played a great game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about just JoAnn Hamlin and kind of what she means to Iowa?
She wasn't there in the victory you had against them. And what difference does
she make?  
COACH BORTON: I thought she made more of a difference when we played them the
first time. She gives them more depth at the post. She's a tough kid inside
and gives Skouby a breather coming off the bench.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Wendy Ausdemore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18067)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Iowa  79  
Minnesota - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We're going to open it up with a statement from
Coach Lisa Bluder, then we'll take questions for the student-athletes. So
Coach.  
COACH BLUDER: I'm happy in the way we won this game, once again with balanced
scoring. Almost five people in double figures. We shot the ball well. We
rebounded well. Won the rebounding war and only had 11 turnovers.  
So pretty happy. We had some defensive breakdowns, but overall I thought it
was a nice game for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Wendy, what does this win mean now looking back at the last minutes of
the game?  
WENDY AUSDEMORE: This is a huge win. We beat them at our place earlier in the
season and then we went one-on-one with them and they beat us on their home
court. So it was nice to get them again on a neutral court.  
I thought the team did a really good job coming out ready to play today.  
  
Q. Wendy, you scored that foul on that layup at the free throw and you took
the lead for the rest of the game. Can you talk about holding on and blowing
away at the end also?  
WENDY AUSDEMORE: Again, I just think the team really stepped up and got some
defensive stops when we really needed to. I think they got within 10 down the
stretch, but just the balanced scoring throughout and just people stepping up.  
  
Q. Kristi, just talk about the way you guys were able to pull away in the
beginning of the first half and keep the lead this time.  
KRISTI SMITH: We really just stressed before halftime, trying to get the
momentum, to take that into halftime with us. And all throughout the second
half, you know, we really stressed they're not going to go away and we need to
keep getting stops on defense and keep up the intensity.  
  
Q. Kachine, you played really well inside tonight. What did you do to
maintain that position?  
KACHINE ALEXANDER: I tried to come out hard. I knew a lot of people know I'm a
pretty good rebounder and just tried to read the ball. And my teammates got me
the ball pretty well today and I took it hard to the hole.  
  
Q. Kachine, you were slow to get up. How are you feeling and what
happened?  
KACHINE ALEXANDER: My head hit the floor once, and then she sat on my head and
it hit again. I think I'm okay. I just saw the doctor. But just take it easy.
And they didn't check on me, so we'll see. A really bad headache, but I'll be
all right for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Minnesota is one of your bigger rivals, how did if feel to beat them
after they beat you last time out?  
KACHINE ALEXANDER: Great. We thought about it before, but coming from
Minnesota it's always good to beat the Gophers. I told them at halftime, this
is the second half; we're going to come out hard because this is probably
going to be the NCAA berth if they win.  
It was great. I'm having a ball.  
  
Q. Kachine, a lot of your baskets were taken of course off the dribble
getting to the hole. Can you talk about -- had a couple of lefty layups?  
KACHINE ALEXANDER: I just pretty much read the defense. A lot of the team try
to get off of me. I try to take them off that way and attack their hip, and it
seems to be working. Just keep doing it. Coach tells me attack, no matter how
they're playing me, attack and get my teammates open.  
  
Q. Wendy, can you talk about your shooting performance, 4, 5 from 3 and the
percentage?  
WENDY AUSDEMORE: Well, it's good to see them go down. I think in years past
I've had a couple of rough times in here. So it's good to see them go down.
But give credit to my teammates for getting the ball to me when I was open.  
  
Q. Kristi, you know Emily Fox well from growing up. What's it like playing
her?  
KRISTI SMITH: It feels really good. Emily and I have always -- we had a good
rivalry growing up and it's kind of odd that we play each other here, but it's
fun and I always enjoying playing against her and she's a great player.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I think right before Wendy's big 3-point play in the first half you had
said drive on them because they've been driving on you effectively. How happy
were you to see that?  
COACH BLUDER: That's an important part I think of our game is that we have to
penetrate hard. A lot of good things happen to us when we attack and
penetrate. I felt Minnesota was beating us at our own game a little bit. So it
was time to turn the tables, and they did.  
  
Q. Coach, a few times during the season you guys had leads, kind of let the
other team get back in. Tonight you held that lead and extended it at the end.
Can you talk about that?  
COACH BLUDER: Very happy about that, and we talked about how Minnesota had
been kind of a second-half team. They played better in the second half. You
know, we had the lead up at their place, and then they came back. We had a
6-point lead with a couple of minutes to go.  
So when those things happen to you, I think it was never let down. I thought
our team was very focused tonight. In every huddle I thought they were really
in tune with each other. They were really listening well. And so I thought
that they were very, very focused for the entire 40 minutes tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed like for a while there the teams were kind of trading
baskets and for a stretch there in the middle defensively it looked like you
guys kind of stepped up. Could you talk about the defense. It was an offense
game then for a while there you got some stops?  
COACH BLUDER: It was a pretty offensive game with us scoring 79 points, 44 in
the first half. When we began the second half we were trading baskets back and
forth. We talked about it in our timeouts. It's not good enough to trade
baskets. The only way we're going to stop that is by with our defensive stops
and getting the rebounds. And I thought Ashley Ellis-Milan did a really good
job getting inside, getting some paint points, high percentage points.  
She forced us into the zone and then our zone was effective after that. So it
was also taking some time off the shot clock, which was nice.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the first game with Ohio State, the only regular
season game with Ohio State, and what you think of Ohio State, the team you'll
face tomorrow night?  
COACH BLUDER: I know we're facing a great team. Jantel Lavender, Player of the
Year, they have the Defensive Player of the Year, the Freshman of the Year,
the Coach of the Year. It's obviously a very good basketball team. We played a
very good game when we beat them at our place. I thought we -- it was a game
that we shot the ball well. We boarded well. We took care of the ball.  
And so I'm sure Ohio State's remembering that and would like to have a little
-- avenge that, but they're a great basketball team. But everybody you play
this time of year is usually a very good basketball team. So we'll be looking
forward to it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your streak, how you've performed, especially coming
into the Big Ten tournament and how you think you played today based off
that?  
COACH BLUDER: I thought we played well today. Again, I thought we shot well. I
loved the balance we had. Seven games in a row was nice. But we want to make
it eight.  
  
Q. Coach, this is the first time I've had a chance to see Kachine Alexander
play. I've rarely seen somebody with that height get those kind of rebounds.
Can you talk about what she does on the board and what she gives to your
team?  
COACH BLUDER: She's fun to watch. She's a special player because she has that
second effort. You think the ball is going out of bounds or that Minnesota had
the ball and all of a sudden she comes up with it. And to me that's just
heart. She just doesn't give up pursuing the basketball on a rebound. And I
love that about Kachine because she gives us so many more possessions just
because of her outright hustle and heart to go get the basketball.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Wendy Ausdemore's game, shot well, had seven
rebounds?  
COACH BLUDER: She had a great game. When she gets confidence stroking the 3
it's so much fun to see her. And now she's at the power forward position, and
sometimes we can create mismatches with her, or sometimes power forwards
forget about her and forget what a 3-point threat that she really is.  
But she leaves our university as one of the best 3-point shooters of all time.
And she's had a remarkable career and obviously she's a great person as well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Jolette Law](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18032)

### [Lacey Simpson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18034)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Illinois  58  
Penn State - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening statement from Coach Law and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH LAW: Just proud of my kids. They played extremely well, definitely on
the defensive end. Initially we started out playing man. They started
attacking us. We changed it up, started playing at different defense, a little
zone to try to contain them a little bit. My kids played extremely well down
the stretch.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. With what happened here last year, does this seem like déjà vu all over
again with the opportunity you have?  
LAYCEY SIMPSON: Most definitely. It's weird in a way 'cause last year we were
the No. 9 seed, and this year we are. Just feed off that. I love playing in
the Big-10 tournament. A whole different atmosphere. I love it.  
  
Q. Jenna, what did you think of your teammate Whitney Toone tonight?  
JENNA SMITH: I love Whitney's game. In practice, she elevates over everybody.
She gets the rebounds nobody expects anybody to get. She gets so excited to
rebound. She always brings intensity on defense and is always attacking the
basket.  
That's one thing you love about her, she's always aggressive for offensive
boards, defensive boards. That's her bread and butter.  
  
Q. Lacey, you were down early in the first half. Looked like you turned on a
switch. Can you talk about that.  
LACEY SIMPSON: Me and Jenna have been there. We just kept saying, Keep
fighting, it's not over, plenty of time left. We feed off each other. As soon
as someone scores a basket, gets a key rebound, we feed off that. It pumps
everybody up.  
I didn't have a doubt at any moment in the game that we were going to lose
tonight.  
  
Q. Lacey, the shot that you hit to beat the shot clock from behind the
backboard, is that when you thought you couldn't lose this game?  
LACEY SIMPSON: Yeah, when you hit shots like that, you have to win games. I
don't know. I just try a little move. I heard coach yelling, Shoot it, shoot
it. I just hurried up and threw it up there.  
Yeah, when you hit shots like this, I don't know, to me you're gonna win the
game.  
  
Q. Jenna, can you explain why you guys are maybe so successful playing here
in the Big-10 tournament.  
JENNA SMITH: I mean, I don't know why we're so successful. I think we just
bring so much energy. We always come off the regular season with a positive.
We aren't always coming off a loss or a win. I think with we feed off of each
other. Coach always said it in the locker room, You win this 40 minutes, you
get another 40 minutes. If you're not, you're done. You think your season is
done after this. You take pride each second you're on that court. You lose,
you're done. I think thinking about that each and every play comes into play
with us.  
  
Q. Lacey, you do get Ohio State in the next game. What do you have to do to
beat Ohio State?  
LACEY SIMPSON: Really it's going to come down to our game. Have to continue to
play together offensively and defensively. Everything else will play out.  
Of course, we have to stop their post, their inside and their running game. At
the end of the day, it's going to come down to how we play, and that's playing
together.  
  
Q. Lacey, you got the record for most steals. How does that make you feel?  
LACEY SIMPSON: It makes me feel so good because that's something I take pride
in, playing defense first. That's something I've had in my mind since I first
came to Illinois, I'm going to break this record. Breaking it here in the
Big-10 tournament, with fans, the team here, it's very fulfilling.  
  
Q. Lacey, you talked about playing here in this Big-Ten tournament. When you
started your career here at Illinois, it wasn't quite the same. Can you talk
about the difference between what you experienced now and when you first got
here.  
LACEY SIMPSON: Now it seems like the game's at a higher level. It's just fast-
paced, more intense. It's fun. A lot of energy. In the past, you know, it
wasn't like that. Now it just seems like it's funner. That's why I look so
forward to playing in this tournament. Seems like everybody's trying to bring
their A game. You want to bring your A game, too. For the most part, that's
the difference.  
  
Q. Jenna, last two games against Penn State, they pulled away down the
stretch. Were those two games going through your head at all?  
JENNA SMITH: I think most definitely. They beat us on our court and their
court. Like coach was saying, everybody, third time's a charm. We knew we had
to beat them. It's tough to beat a team three times. That's what coach kept
saying. We thought about that. We knew they were going to come and push. They
had seniors, great backcourt that didn't want to lose. We just had to play
together. Every team is going to make runs, but we have to stay together.  
  
Q. Jenna, explain what the difference was this game between the previous two
games.  
JENNA SMITH: I think the biggest difference was that we played team defense
and we attacked best and just shared the ball with each other. We made the
extra pass to get the wide-open person. We were working it inside outside. We
played team defense. We helped contain Tyra Grant. We got out on the shooters.
We boxed out. We just did the little things we didn't do in the previous game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. You're dismissed. We'll continue with
questions for Coach Law.  
  
Q. Does this feel like last year? Is it the same feeling at this point, that
you need the next win?  
COACH LAW: Definitely. It just feels good when you walk into Conseco Field
House, you can't help but think about what happened last year. This is
altogether a new year. Definitely going to feed off the team. We're the ninth
seed. We don't have anything to lose, everything to gain. If we bring our
game, stick to the game plan for 40 minutes, it's anybody's ballgame.  
Just trying to prepare my young people to let them know either you play or we
go home. I just think that right now my veterans, by duo, my dynamic duo,
they're constantly telling the young ones, We did it last year. They're giving
them a lot of confidence saying, We can get this done.  
  
Q. In what ways has Fabiola Josil come the farthest? Looks like a different
player.  
COACH LAW: You know, I always knew that Fab could be a great player in this
league. I think her confidence is up. She's playing defense. I think she's
starting to understand what we're looking for in the offense. Took the
pressure off of her from being the point guard, put her at the two spot so she
didn't have to think a lot, she can just do what she does best. She's really a
scoring guard. Told her to just step in the gap. She must be confident to take
these shots.  
I think once you get a good game under your belt, you start playing the
defense, dictating, she's asking the questions, she's understanding the game a
little better, understanding what we're looking for in our offense as well as
our defense.  
I think in the beginning, she was a little timid, a little unsure. She's a
little bit more confident now, and it's showing.  
  
Q. Talk about Whitney Toone today.  
COACH LAW: Whitney has been playing with a sense of urgency as of late. She
comes in the game and she's like, Coach, whatever I need to do, I'm willing to
do. I can rebound. I can bring what I bring. I play defense. My energy, I'm
not going to let the energy level go down.  
Even the last two games she's come in and attacked the offensive boards and
the defensive boards. She stuck to the plan with defense. She's looking at
playing defense first. If there are open shots, she's willing to take the
shot. You can tell that leadership, that veteran. She's playing like a
veteran. She's a junior college kid. I told her I need her to be able to just
come in and play free. She's been helping us a lot down the stretch.  
  
Q. Is it a foregone conclusion she'll start tomorrow?  
COACH LAW: I'm gonna -- I don't know. It's a game-time decision. I just think
that right now, I'm looking at the chemistry on defense, who's talking. Who's
the five unit working well on defense is probably gonna start. I think Lacey
Simpson didn't do anything wrong. It's just at the time she picked up a quick
foul. I knew Penn State was looking to attack her on the defensive end. I'll
probably have the same starters as I had tonight.  
  
Q. You had seen Penn State twice before. You've seen Ohio State twice.
Expect any surprises or do you just know each other?  
COACH LAW: We know each other. I give the utmost respect to Coach Foster (Ohio
State). He's a great coach. He's going to have this team prepared. Bottom
line, we just have to make sure we're all on the same page at a time. If they
do anything differently defensively, we need to make sure we can adjust.  
We're gonna focus on them, watch some film. We played them twice. It's really
going to come down to how well we execute, how well we do things that we need
to do.  
  
Q. This is your second season. Can you talk about that second year.  
COACH LAW: The second year, you know, is much -- I feel like I'm much more,
you know, settled. You know things now. This is the second time around. I can
say this year I've become a better coach, more patient coach, than I have been
in the past. I just think that second year you just really -- you know,
especially with the team, the ups and downs we've had this season, you learn
how to make adjustments and know how to get through to your kids. It just
seems a little bit more -- I'm more settled this year than I was last year.  
  
Q. Was controlling Tyra Grant and Mashea Williams off the dribble kind of
what turned this game around?  
COACH LAW: Definitely. I mean, I think when I called the timeout, initially I
thought the first couple plays they were looking to put their head down and
get to the basket. They went on that run. They were up, they had 11 and we had
4 or 6. I knew that was the game plan. I had to make some adjustments to
control the dribble-penetration. I only have four or five guards. Pretty good
guards. Tyra Grant, second in the league with scoring. Mashea Williams is
quick. Also Brianne O'Rourke.  
The best thing I could do is try to contain them, throw a couple of junk
defenses at them, make them think a little bit. I think we caught them off
guard and tracked them in. They were penetrating into my post players. Just
had to make an adjustment. My main game plan was to try to play man-to-man.
Once I saw they were attacking off the dribble, I had to make some
adjustments.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2009

  

### [Tyra Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18020)

### [Coquese Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18021)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Illinois  58  
Penn State - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Washington and
then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH WASHINGTON: I'll just take questions.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions then for Tyra Grant.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the team just never giving up, play for the seniors.  
TYRA GRANT: We always want to play for our seniors and try to put 'em out on a
good note. But today we couldn't do that. But we still tried to play hard and
tried to fight hard to the end.  
We did some couple things in the first half that, you know, we don't usually
do. We try to come out and, you know, come out better.  
  
Q. The difference in your mind from this game and the two games you played
against them in the regular season?  
TYRA GRANT: The difference was I guess we just didn't stick to our game plan.
You know, inside out, get it to the post. If they kick it back out, then have
a shot or drive it to the hole. I felt like we didn't stick to what we were
supposed to do. We did other things. And that just didn't work out for us.  
  
Q. You'll be back next year. You're kind of still part of the future. Can
you look forward. I realize it's hard to do now. You have new players coming
in.  
TYRA GRANT: We have a great recruiting class coming in. I'm sure that they can
help us do a lot as far as take us far in non-conference, conference, and even
the Big-Ten.  
I'm hoping -- I'm not hoping, I know that we'll be able to do better things
next year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. You can go back to the locker room. We'll continue
with questions for Coach Washington.  
  
Q. Same question. The difference between this game compared to the two in
the regular season?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, I didn't think we defended very well this game. Lacey
Simpson and Jenna Smith pretty much had their way. I didn't think we did a
strong job defensively on Illinois as a whole as we had the first two games.
We allowed them to get their confidence, get a rhythm.  
I thought they out-hustled us, I thought they out-toughed us and kind of put
us back on our heels, especially in the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2009

  

### [Jori Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18048)

### [Felisha Legette-Jack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16871)

### [Kim Roberson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16872)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Indiana  68  
Michigan - 50

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening statement from coach and then go to the
student-athletes.  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: I thought that was a fantastic game to watch. You saw a
team down and out. We had a freshman come in and hit two big threes. That
helped us believe in the possibility. In the second half our defense stepped
up, we were able to get some steals.  
I just think that this is a team that's fighting for something bigger than
themselves. Just an honor to be on the ride with them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kim, can you talk about the pressure you put on in the second half, how
effective that was creating turnovers.  
KIM ROBERSON: The pressure in the second half was pivotal for us. It allowed
us to generate offense from defense, get us an extra possession.  
  
Q. Can you talk about playing Purdue under the circumstances with as much
pressure as is on you, now having to go through them to reach your goals, and
the rivalry.  
JORI DAVIS: We just want to take it one game at a time. Michigan was a good
team. Purdue is also a good team. We just come here to do what we have to do
to get to that final stage. We're going to play our hardest with the right
energy. We can come off successful.  
  
Q. Jori, what was going on in the second half? You were in the zone, as they
call it.  
JORI DAVIS: Nothing. Really a couple shots didn't fall for me. One of my
seniors, Whitney Thomas, kept telling me she needed me. That's something when
a senior really needs you to step up. They want it so bad. We're here for the
seniors, no doubt about it.  
I just knew in my heart I had to do something that we came out with a win.  
  
Q. Kim, what were some halftime adjustments? What did coach tell you in the
locker room?  
KIM ROBERSON: I think she just said to pick up the energy. I know at the end
of the half we made a run. We were just trying to build upon that in the
second half. We put on a press. That helped generate steals for us and created
extra offense possessions.  
  
Q. In regards to the first half, they just pounded the boards. 20-10
difference. You evened it up in the second half. Also getting to the free-
throw line, 12 compared to two in the first half.  
KIM ROBERSON: I think coach wrote that on the board. We knew we needed to box
out, find our man, keep them off the boards. That allowed us to push the ball
on offense. That allowed us to attack and get to the free-throw line as well.
We dictated.  
  
Q. Jori, were you shocked to be down early, not even to score for the first
seven minutes of the game? What was going through your mind at that point?  
JORI DAVIS: No, I wasn't shocked. We knew we were going up against Michigan, a
good team. Like I said, it was more so shock that we have to get our energy
up, not so much shocked that we were down, 'cause we knew we had to come
through. It was just a matter of fixing it and coming back strong.  
  
Q. Kim, you're a senior. What was your mentality going in? Coach said a lot
of you have your backs against the wall. Potentially this could have been your
last game. What were you thinking as a senior in that situation?  
KIM ROBERSON: You're right, it could have been my last game. Just as much as
the underclassmen are playing for us, we wanted to play for them and lead them
in a way we have a sense of urgency. We know what it's going to feel like
there's no tomorrow for the four of us.  
Our underclassmen stepped up, then we led the way. That's how a team is.  
  
Q. Kim, with everything on the line tomorrow, playing your rival, possible
NCAA berth, does it feel like it's going to be the biggest game of your career
tomorrow?  
KIM ROBERSON: I'm just taking each game at one time, like the rest of the
team. Yeah, Purdue is our rival, but it's tournament time. All the other stuff
is extra. We're just playing the team that's next. It happens to be Purdue.
That's what we're going to do, focus on Purdue, not the Purdue as our rival,
but Purdue as our opponent.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. You're dismissed to the locker room.
Questions for Coach Jack.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you tell your team when you were down 12-0 early in the
first half?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: We talk about the eyes. Something about our kids' eyes.
When I look in their eyes, I can almost tell if we're ready. I could never
find it in their eyes. Coaches wanted me to call a timeout. I was just waiting
on that moment to click in.  
We made a substitution with Lindsay Enterline. Lindsay's eyes were right. She
became contagious. It spread around the team. Even though we were still down,
I felt like the fight was about to begin.  
It wasn't about, Oh, my God. It was about, Once you lock it in, we got a shot.  
  
Q. You may have hit on it with Whitney Lindsay, bringing her off the bench.
I don't know if she had a score or assist. You had her in a few minutes in the
first half. Great job leading the offense in the second half.  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: I think when you watch your kids work out extra on their
own in the gym, you come in at 11:00 at night, you see a couple people out in
that gym, and one of them is your player, one of them is Lindsay. You know
when her time comes, she's going to make the most of it.  
She didn't hesitate. She knew she was prepared. That's what happens. Success
comes when you prepare. She is certainly one of the few kids on the team that
spends a lot of time in the gym.  
  
Q. Are you at all concerned with the nature of the Big-10 tournament, the
short recovery, being rested enough to play tomorrow?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: It's the coaches that are out of shape. The players love
to play the game. I wish I was a player. I think I'd be even more conditioned
if I played the game.  
But, no. This is tournament time. You can't be worried about something you
can't control. It is what it is. I think we're going to be as ready as we
possibly can. I just want this tournament to continue because I think there's
a place at the top for this team, not because of basketball, but because of
the story I think we can tell. This is a special group. This is a group that
brings you 3.0s all the time, out in our community, that has a passion for
leaving a legacy. I just want us to continue to win so we can get to a place
where we can tell our story.  
  
Q. Not too long ago Michigan had the lead by about 12 or 15 points. Tonight
they had the lead again. What's the mindset there? Did you expect them to come
out? How did you counter that? Did you feel relaxed even though they had the
lead?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: It's never about Michigan. It won't be about Purdue. It
won't be about Michigan State, whomever else we might play. It's about
Indiana. A lot of coaches can go both ways, think about the opponent, figure
out their philosophy, how they're going to defend. I may be not that bright. I
feel it's important I put all my energy on our team. I really concentrate on
our kids' eyes, our defense, our offensive segments, what's working for us. If
they put a zone out there, I'm still going to run what I think is best for our
team.  
I just think that, yeah, they went on a run. We didn't. The only thing I was
concerned about, not that they were up by 15 or 18 points, I was worried about
our kids' eyes and our tenacity of purpose.  
  
Q. How confident are you about a win will get you into the that next
tournament?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: I don't know about that. I think we've done a good enough
job to make this committee think about us now. I think we're going to come out
here and give our best performance tomorrow. I think we went out and beat an
ACC team a Big East team, a Big 12 team, all on the road. We had 15 road trips
and we won them all. I think I'm going to play 15 games on the road, and we
had a winning record on the road. That was something that didn't get us in
last year. We recognized all the things that didn't get us in last year and
we've cleaned them up. We'll continue to work hard.  
But I think we made a statement today.  
  
Q. Early on Krista Phillips was really asserting herself inside. On your
offensive end, Amber Jackson could play against anyone, but Krista was giving
her the most problems. Can you talk about how you neutralized that.  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: It wasn't Krista stopping Amber. It was Amber stopping
Amber. I said nicely, as politely as I can, in the heat of the moment, Amber,
you're stopping Amber, not Krista. If you saw the last two rebounds Amber got
over Krista, you'll know why I was so angry with Amber. Amber is one of the
best post players in this conference, in my opinion. But she has to go out and
represent that every single day. When she doesn't, I need to get in her ear
and help her find her way to that place where I know she belongs.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the play of Carly Benson and what you did to stop
her?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: We thought she was the solution to their team. We decided
that wherever she was, we're going to have somebody knowing exactly what kind
of chewing gum she chews, what kind of dental work she has. We needed somebody
in her face the entire second half.  
We made that nice adjustment. We decided if she's going to be there, she's
going to have to be there for the right hand. I think she's one of the finest
players that came through our conference. I wish her well in the future. This
particular day, we just wasn't going to give her another 20 minutes. We gave
her the first 20.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll see you tomorrow.  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: Thank you, guys, for all you do for women's basketball.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Rae Lin D'Alie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19251)

### [Alyssa Karel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19250)

### [Tara Steinbauer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19249)

### [Lisa Stone](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16858)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Wisconsin  60  
Northwestern - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up general comments from coach Stone.  
COACH STONE: Very proud of our basketball team. Our post defense was solid,
our ball pressure was good. We addressed rebounding at halftime. Told Tara
Steinbauer to get on the offensive boards, on the weak-side boards, and she
did. Nearly a double-double. Rae Lin D'Alie played nearly the whole game.
Alyssa Karel does what Alyssa does. The help of our bench, Caitlin Gibson gave
us quality minutes. Jade Davis off the bench, her shots were timely. I thought
we did a decent job of valuing the basketball.  
I'm proud we weren't playing another 40 minutes against a very good team.
Hopefully the fact we played this first day is to our advantage. We'll get
rested up for our game with Michigan State tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Speak a little bit about the performance of your team today.  
TARA STEINBAUER: All week we've been practicing on keeping the ball from
getting inside. It's been one of the things we really stressed. I think our
guards did a wonderful job on the wings with ball pressure, which was huge for
us, so it was more difficult for them to get the ball inside. All in all, I
think it came down to hustle and to playing as hard as we could, and we did
that.  
  
Q. Northwestern brought the score down to three, is that when you guys felt
like something needed to happen?  
TARA STEINBAUER: Absolutely. That's the moment of the game where we all have
to come together. We knew that it was our turn to go on a run. I think we all
came together. That's exactly what we did. Coach, in the timeout, she's been
saying the same thing all year, our identity is in our defense, we have to
maintain it. I think we did a really good job of that all game.  
  
Q. Northwestern really narrowed the gap in the second half, did they play
differently?  
ALYSSA KAREL: Yeah, you know, in the second half they were really trying to
stretch out our defense. I think that's where a lot of their points came in,
where we would double in the post, they would kick it out to their open
player.  
After a few times out, coaches told us we have to have the best ball pressure
we've had all year. I think that's where we kind of turned it around.  
  
Q. You guys played well defensively today, can you talk about that?  
RAE LIN D'ALIE: I mean, that's our go-to. Our defense is our go-to. We were
happy but we weren't satisfied. They came out. They stretched us out in the
second half. They got great skip passes. Brittany Orban knocked down some
threes. They really stretched us out.  
As far as the first half, I think that is what we're about. That's our go-to,
is our defense. It wasn't as surprising as it should have been.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the play of Northwestern?  
RAE LIN D'ALIE: Oh, yeah, definitely. They're a great team. They just go hard
all 40 minutes. You can't relax on that team. The moment you do, that's when
they start to catch you. They're smart. Their coach has done an amazing job
with them. They're much different than when he came in here as a freshman.
Definitely all the credit in the world to them. You're not going to beat them
if you don't play hard. That's the bottom line.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies, you're dismissed to the locker room. We'll
go back to questions for Coach Stone.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about the play of Northwestern today?  
COACH STONE: Starting with Jade Davis, we're a defensive team. When you have
an offensive threat, like Jade, she's a freshman in her first Big-10
tournament, Game 1, comes in very relaxed. Her first shot was quick. We don't
really take quick shots. Those are ones, yeah, if it goes in, work the ball if
it doesn't. She was in rhythm. Felt very confident. We come in an hour before
the game not having shot in here at all. She found the bottom of the net right
away.  
They cut it to three. Jade went on her run. Her three-point shots, got right
inside the defense for the two-point shot, that was timely, huge for us.
Defensively I think she got mad at herself when Kristin Cartwright beat her
off the dribble. Near the end, they were pressuring us, she was very confident
with the basketball. She's proven she can make some timely free throws. I
think our last opponent where she had to make some free throws was Michigan
State.  
Caitlin Gibson as a senior has been here. Time is diminished a little bit this
year. But she's always ready. This was a great game for Caitlin. It's a game
that suited her skill set both offensively and defensively. I kept wondering
when we would go back with Lin. We had momentum with Caitlin. To save Lin
Zastrow's legs under that four-minute media was huge for us. Made a nice high-
low pass into Tara. Had a nice up-and-under move. Defensively she's a tough
matchup. I can't say enough about those two.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the difference between the first and second half
today?  
COACH STONE: I thought we came out right away in the first half with that. We
talked about the first four minutes. We also talked about the second half
determines whether you win or lose the game, it's that second half. They came
out and got comfortable. They spread us out very well. Starting knocking down
three-point shots, which means Amy Jaeschke is not scoring, but the other
people are.  
Again, that's a great credit to Joe and what he's done. They're not one did
dimensional. Brittany Orban is a great freshman. She's a very good player.
They've got a nice nucleus of players, a different look, a confident look for
the future.  
  
Q. Northwestern played really competitively all year, what does that mean
for the Big Ten?  
COACH STONE: It's great. The bottom of the league's getting better. That's
huge for our conference. That's huge for the implications of post-season and
the strength of our conference. I think everybody in the league did an
outstanding job in their non-conference schedule, in terms of strength of
schedule RPI. We're banging heads against each other 18 times. You come to the
Big-10 tournament. I think you're seeing, in my hope, many teams in the NCAA
tournament this year and in the future because of what you're talking about.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. See you tomorrow.  
COACH STONE: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Wisconsin  60  
Northwestern - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open with a statement from coach and then go to the
student-athletes.  
COACH McKEOWN: First half obviously we got off to an awful start. I was proud
of our team, the way we bounced back in the second half, made it a great game,
had chances. We didn't take advantage of those.  
It's tough to come back spotting that many points in the first half. Took a
lot of energy for us to make a run that we did in the second half. Again, I
thought it was a great game in the second half. We had beaten Wisconsin at
Northwestern. In that game we kept the pace where we wanted it. Today we just
couldn't control that.  
Got to give them a lot of credit. They made a couple big plays when they had
to, when we had some momentum, had really made a great run. I wish them the
best.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the Kristin and Brittany.  
  
Q. The team started out slow, how did you turn things around?  
BRITTANY ORBAN: In the first half we knew things weren't going our way, had to
bounce back. Had to play like it was our last game. We came out with the
confidence we needed, made our plays, things we needed to do to chip away.
Defense was crucial, to get stops on D. We were able to pull it back, but just
not totally close the game.  
  
Q. Why did the team start out slowly?  
KRISTIN CARTWRIGHT: It might have been nerves. I can't really speak for the
whole team. We came out, we were playing hard, but we were just making little
mistakes, mistakes we usually don't make. Kind of got us a little rattled. It
took us a while to get our composure back. Once we did that, we were able to
put the ball in the basket.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
KRISTIN CARTWRIGHT: I think we've improved so much over this year, even
throughout the Big-10 season. It's kind of hard to see with our record. But if
anyone watched or followed any of our games, they could see the improvements
individually and as a team. We played very well with each other. We were able
to compete in every game we played. We might not be able to win, but we're
definitely able to be very good competitors.  
  
Q. Cartwright had 12 points in the first half, what happened there?  
BRITTANY ORBAN: I would say it wasn't as much as getting her better looks. We
were looking more inside, looking to get her one-on-one more. It was the
moving outside once she got the ball. They were trying to double down on her.
She's experienced that all season.  
It was just a matter of how the guards were rotating on the outside. I think
we did a better job in the second half looking to get her open passes.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, you're dismissed back to the locker room. We'll
continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. 41-38, Jade jumps up and bites you.  
COACH McKEOWN: Yeah, I thought we had thrown a couple different defenses at
Wisconsin at the start of the second half. Got us back in the game. But she
came in and made a couple plays that really were back-breakers. We got it to
three. They go right back up. We get it down to six. They make a couple shots.  
Alyssa Karel, she made a couple big plays, too. But Wisconsin played with a
lot of poise today. I thought we rattled 'em there the first six, seven
minutes of the second half. I really thought we were going to win the game a
couple times there. We just didn't defend like we did all year. I was really
disappointed the way we broke down defensively in about a six-minute stretch,
12 minutes to six minutes, I don't have the box. We were scoring. We loosened
them up. We had some crucial turnovers, too.  
They're just a real solid defensive team. You're going to have to -- you can't
give them anything. I thought we did that.  
  
Q. Four of eight in the second half from outside the arc. Did you feel late
in the game you could have stuck with outside shooting or do you feel with
Davis they were watching your threes too much?  
COACH McKEOWN: You know, when you're down, we're not good at matching people
basket for basket, three balls. We haven't proven that all year. I just felt
like we really wanted to get inside, get to the foul line, stop the clock,
give people a chance to get set on defense. I thought we did that in the
second half. The last couple minutes, the second part, when we went Erin
Dickerson in, everybody knew we were trying to get her open looks. We got Amy
Jaeschke a couple open looks. Didn't go down. Erin, we couldn't get her freed
up. Wisconsin did a good job.  
The reason we got to the basket a lot was because they were really guard than
on the perimeter, taking away some of the looks we might have gotten earlier.
Brittany drilled a couple threes on kick-outs. They made it a lot tougher down
the stretch to shoot a three.  
  
Q. Did Wisconsin make any adjustments for the second half that helped them
get better shots off?  
COACH McKEOWN: It didn't help that we left them friggin' wide open, too, to be
honest with you. That was a problem. We had some breakdowns. I think we went
into a couple defenses where we just didn't guard a couple people on purpose.
I think that helped us get back in the game.  
But they did a good job, too, of substituting, getting people in there to make
shots. I gave them a lot of credit. I thought she did a real good job of
countering that. We were trying to play chess instead of checkers. We played
checkers in the first half. We're not good at checkers, obviously.  
  
Q. I know it's hard to look past this loss, but what can you say about the
nucleus returning of this team, the killer instinct that Brittany represented
coming out of the locker room, Maggie's contribution throughout the season?  
COACH McKEOWN: I was disappointed. We don't worry much. I was at George
Washington, we always had All-Americans, players of the year. We were always
the No. 1 seed. I never worried then about who made all-conference, things
like that.  
I was disappointed Brittany didn't get some recognition on the all-freshmen
team in the Big-10. I thought she had a great year. But I thought Brittany had
a great year. I know there's a lot of good players on that all-freshmen team,
but I certainly think she's one of them. When you score 25 points at Ohio
State, she's been our leading scorer three of our last four games. I was
really surprised at that.  
We don't worry so much. Our program gets individual, we don't worry about
individual awards. From day one, she didn't act like a freshman on campus, and
really was a leader. I probably should have named her captain at Christmas.
She's just a tough, hard-nosed kid, plays a lot bigger than her size.  
I think the nucleus with her, Amy has two years left. I thought Maggie had
some big games for us. She's fighting off some injuries. Struggled a little
bit down the stretch. Minnesota the other night, she drills a three to give us
a cushion.  
Those guys I think and players that we signed. Kristin Cartwright probably
played her best game last week. Jenny Eckhart, she progressed through the
year. It's tough on them. It's a new system, a new coaching staff. They've
been challenged at a high level this year to compete with everybody. That's
what we're trying to put in place at Northwestern. I think we did. I think we
accomplished all those things.  
  
Q. How much easier is it going to make it at the beginning of next year that
players have been in your system a year, know what you want, what to expect?  
COACH McKEOWN: I think it will be a lot easier on them. It may be tougher on
me. I never had a losing season before, so I can't tell you this was easy. I
don't really like going home today. I might make everybody stay around, watch
the whole tournament.  
These guys obviously have to get back and go to class. But next year I'm
planning on staying a lot longer. I packed for five days.  
  
Q. Did you recruit Orban or something you found here?  
COACH McKEOWN: All the players that were here were here when I took the job in
June. She had signed with Northwestern. So did Maggie and Ally. There's not a
player on the current roster we recruited. They were all year.  
Brittany, we watched her play. I had known about her in high school. She
played on a great high school in Ohio. She was a tremendous engineering
student. Focused and tough. We're really pleased she's here. Got to get all
those good players out of Ohio.  
  
Q. I know you haven't had too long to look back on it, but from day one to
now, how far do you think this team has come? What are your overall feelings
about year one?  
COACH McKEOWN: If I had a crystal ball, I thought I did a bad job of preparing
this team for the non-conference schedule. We left five or six games on the
table. I just feel like with my experience and success we've had as a coaching
staff, I just felt like this is a team we could be sitting here with 14 or 15
wins. We left a couple things. Purdue game went to overtime. Illinois game, we
made a shot, they waved off a shot. When you look back, I feel like I didn't
have a feel for this team. I would have done some things different myself.
I'll take the blame for that.  
I really feel like, some of these games we got beat in December, maybe
November, I just wish we could have had some more momentum going in. I should
have done a better job there. But hopefully that will help us next year.  
It was a great year. You heard Brittany say that. I mean this sincerely, I'll
get off the pulpit here, none of our players worried what other record was.
They played hard all the way through the month of February and March. We
played two of our best games last week, Minnesota and Iowa. That says a lot
for the character of this team because most kids would have said, I got spring
break coming up, get me out of here. They really wanted to be the best team
they could at the end of year. I'm proud of that. I'm really proud of the job
my coaching staff did to develop that. I would have fired me at Christmas.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Indiana  68  
Michigan - 50

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with a statement from coach and then go to the
student-athletes for questions.  
COACH BORSETH: I'd like to thank the four seniors that are sitting here for
all they've done for Michigan basketball. I know they've been four very hard
years, trying to get the program turned in the right direction. I know the
year didn't turn out probably the way they'd have liked it to, or the season
ended probably the way they didn't want it to.  
They really exerted themselves for the two years I was fortunate enough to
coach them and I'd like to thank them for that.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jessica, what made their press so effective in the second half?  
JESSICA MINNFIELD: I don't know. They were just pressuring us a lot. We
couldn't get in the right spots. Either our passes were too long or they were
too short. I felt like we were moving really fast. It just wasn't falling in
our hands.  
  
Q. What do you think was the main problem today?  
CARLY BENSON: I think we've taken care of the ball a lot better than we did
today. I think we're capable of playing better basketball than we were today.
I guess that's a little frustrating to end on that note.  
  
Q. Carly, what is it about that outcome that happened so many times this
season? You have been in the lead, then sort of fallen off. What is it about
that?  
CARLY BENSON: I think if we knew, we would have fixed it obviously. We don't
know. I'm not sure.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, you're dismissed. Thank you. We'll continue with
questions for coach.  
  
Q. What were some of the things that you did or talked about in the second
half to try to counter the press?  
COACH BORSETH: That's kind of what our really demise has been. Every time
someone's pressured us during the year, we've struggled. That's really what
it's been, the problem that we've had, right from the get-go. When people put
pressure on us, a lot of times we aren't physically strong enough to be able
to handle that.  
It really surfaced today. We had to beat someone off the dribble. That was
really the bottom line. You had to beat someone off the dribble on that trap,
and we weren't able to do that. Try to substitute and put ball-handlers in.
Unfortunately we don't have a lot of them. Jess is our primary ball-handler.  
Really presses are not very complicated to beat. If you can take one person
off the dribble, they're not very complicated. We couldn't get by the first
wave at all. That was frustrating.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the importance of momentum swings, specifically in
this game.  
COACH BORSETH: It all had to do with that press. That was the whole giddy-up.
Thought we had a good game plan coming in. They went to a man. We got them out
of their zone. When they did, our offense went from being around the basket to
being close to halfcourt.  
Our emphasis at halftime was, push back, lower your center of gravity, get
more toward the lane. Instead of complaining about them shoving you for
rebounds, get back. They're being physical. You got to be a little more
physical with them.  
I thought when we started the second half, we did a pretty good job with that.
They lowered the boom and trapped us. We couldn't get out of it. Presses are
not very complicated. They really are not very complicated. You got to get out
of the first wave. We got out of it a number of times and then at that point
just came unraveled.  
  
Q. You played Indiana about four days ago, had a very similar result. Did it
hurt you having to play them again right away?  
COACH BORSETH: I'll be honest. I was really hoping that someone wouldn't do
this to us all year, what happened today. We always stayed at bay with teams,
never really made them mad. You know what I mean? I think Indiana is very
athletic. They're athletic. They've got athletes at all their guard positions.
They took their big kid out, put four perimeter kids in there, just run-and-
jump type scenario. I think that was probably the difference in today's game.  
But it's always been the same scenario. It's always been the other team just a
little more physical gets up and invades our space a little bit and we don't
do real well when they do that. As long as they're at bay, we can do some
things. But you got to be able to do things with people up on you a little
bit. That really hurt us today.  
  
Q. You're a coach who doesn't have a lot of patience. Has it been hard this
year dealing with everything?  
COACH BORSETH: It's been hard for everybody. The players, they really, really,
really tried. That's what you want your players to be able to do. It just
didn't work out. It's hard going into that locker room after every game. It
is. Putting a week's worth of work in and I don't want to say failing, but
failing at your job I guess to a point. It's hard on everybody. It's not just
hard on me. It's hard on them, too.  
That's what the game's about: it's about the kids.  
  
Q. Krista Phillips was scoring pretty good early in the second half. Did
that press just take her out of it, too?  
COACH BORSETH: We didn't even get a chance to look at her. Never got a ball
across halfcourt for about five minutes, did we? I don't think it even got
across halfcourt. We tried. Put Courtney Boylan in there because she's a good
ball handler. Tried Carmen Reynolds. Tried to break anything we could
potentially break. Jessica Minnfield was having trouble. When she did have it,
she went down into the corner and picked it up. We just did some things -- you
got to be able to get by somebody. Got to be able to get by somebody in that
press. You got to be able to beat it off the dribble and create. It's just not
possible for you. They just pass through presses.  
You have to be able to put it on the floor. When we did put it on the floor,
they knocked it out of our hands, reached behind us. We just weren't very good
with it.  
  
Q. You said at the beginning of the season, coming in last year, you really
wanted to establish a tradition of women's basketball at UofM. Would you call
this season a step back or how would you characterize it?  
COACH BORSETH: I don't know. I think people watching, you've got to determine
whether or not they see basketball on the court. If they see the kids are
having fun, if the kids are trying. I think they did. I don't think they kids
ever gave up. I thought the entire year they played hard. You want kids that
do that. I thought the entire year they played together. You want kids that do
that. I thought they played smart.  
I'm biased. I think it resembles basketball. It really does. We're not the
most gifted at times in things that we do. Melinda Queen is a great player,
she really is. But when you have to match Linda up against Jefferson (Michigan
State) who has two inches and 30 pounds on her, that's a little more
difficult. [Veronica] Hicks is a little thinner, too. It's more difficult.
[Krista Phillips] got better as the year went on. Today she was really good as
the day went on. Carly Benson I thought really came on strong at the end of
the year, she really did. I thought she had a great end of the year.  
It's going to go in the right direction. Anybody that's a naysayer, we're
going to make it go in the right direction. We feel we're headed in the right
path. This might have been a step backwards. I don't know that. I looked at
where it was two years ago. The program never had a chance in a lot of games
that they played in. I think we were in just about every game we played. There
were not many games we were out of.  
This one here was probably the bitterest for all of us. Not bitter, but what's
the word I'm looking for? I don't have a word for it. This was a game we
didn't want to end on this note. We didn't want to end on this particular
note, going down fighting.  
It's going to work. It's going to take a matter of time before it works, but
it's gonna work. I think we've got the right people in place. Happy with our
recruits we've got coming in. We're gonna make it go.  
  
Q. It seems like you had a habit of getting down on yourself mentally when
things started to unravel. What can you do as a coach to keep that from
happening?  
COACH BORSETH: Well, you got to be able to dribble around somebody. Have to be
able to dribble around somebody. This isn't rocket science. You got to have a
player that can get around somebody. You got to dribble around somebody.  
We're in the right spot. We got the right people taking the ball inbounds. We
think we're putting it into the right player's hands. You got to be able to
make things happen.  
I thought for the most part during the course of the year a lot of times we
were in the right spots. We didn't make shots a lot of times down the stretch.
Other teams did. But you got to be able to score down the stretch, got to be
able to put the ball in the basket.  
We averaged 53 points. That's not a lot of points to average in a basketball
game. You're not winning many games averaging 53 unless you're really holding
the other team down. Got to be able to score in this game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Kevin.  
COACH BORSETH: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Utah  63  
San Diego State - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to go with the University of Utah. Student-athletes
for University of Utah, Kalee Whipple, Katie King, and tournament MVP Morgan
Warburton. Coach Elaine Elliott, if we could start with general remarks about
the game.  
COACH ELLIOTT: I'm just, you know, so pleased for these kids, this team. They
worked hard this year. You know, we gave a team with, you know, freshmen point
guards the toughest eight-game stretch that we've probably ever done to a team
as far as scheduling early in the year. They were so resilient. They believed
in themselves because they were competitive and they didn't put it all onto
whether they won them all.  
So when it was really sort of time to start blossoming, they really grew into
a great group. I'm so pleased with really where their head was in this
tournament. I think that's what carried them. I guess it was maybe heart a
little bit more than the head, which is nice to say about a team, as well.  
I really commend San Diego State for an amazing season. They will do extremely
well in the NCAAs. They will represent us well. As you saw, they had us on the
ropes certainly most of the game. Just a great 1-2 game, rubber match,
conference championship tournament matchup. I don't know that you could ask
for more.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll open it up for questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Morgan, could you talk about the last four minutes or so of that game.
Did you make a conscious effort to take it over like that?  
MORGAN WARBURTON: I think it just sort of happened. Thankfully my team got
some screens for me, I hit that one three to get us up a couple points. I
think we all came together and realized this is it. What's good about this
team is we find ways to win at the end of games. I'm just so proud of
everybody.  
  
Q. Talk about the difference between the first and second half.  
KALEE WHIPPLE: The first half, I don't know where I was. I think I was focused
more on defense than I was on offense. Didn't take a lot of shots. Didn't feel
really open.  
But the second half just kind of went out there and just kind of tried to
rebound more, get to the offensive rebound, maybe I could get to the line, do
things like that. I wasn't really focused on shooting. But just happened.  
  
Q. Kalee, do you remember the play that you and -- beat the shot clock on
Morgan's pass, you tipped it in? Did you think it would get it up in time? How
much of a momentum lift did you feel that was?  
KALEE WHIPPLE: I was hoping I got it up on time. Me and Morgan had that look.
She looked at me. I cut to the basket. She gives that squint-eye look like,
You're going, right? I went to the basket. It was a really big momentum. She
just hit that three and then we got that shot. I think that was just a boost
of confidence for our team.  
  
Q. The first part of the second half you looked like you were playing a
little tentative. You didn't take the lead until three minutes left in the
game. What happened that gave you that boost to take the lead?  
KATIE KING: You know, going through my head the entire game, I just thought
we're going to win. That's what my mentality was. So we didn't necessarily
panic or anything. Where some teams, you know, going into three minutes left,
four minutes left in the game, they sometimes panic. We just stayed together
as a team and just kept playing.  
  
Q. Beth Burns admitted her team panicked down the stretch. Did any of you
sense that?  
MORGAN WARBURTON: For me, I don't necessarily think they did. I think they're
a really great team. They're really athletic. They get to the boards, get to
the rim. But, you know, I think we were the ones that made the plays in the
end. They made plays throughout the whole game and were ahead of us. At the
end, we were the ones that made the plays. I don't think they necessarily
panicked.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss the student-athletes. Thank you,
ladies. Now we'll open it up for questions for Coach Elliott.  
  
Q. When you look at the postgame stats, one number stands out, free throws.
What do you attribute the disparity to there?  
COACH ELLIOTT: I mean, we were aggressive and had to be because, you know, the
style of defense that San Diego State runs. They're gonna get after you.
They're gonna chase you. They're gonna overplay you, which really forces you
to play to the rim more. We played to the rim a lot tonight. We only took
seven threes. It's a lot different feel to a game that way.  
I mean, I don't know what else to say. I mean, obviously getting to the line
was huge. It's kind of the two styles. We kind of play between them and the
basket, and don't overplay a lot, try not to allow so much to the rim. Maybe
it's a difference in styles. I don't know if Beth felt differently. You'd have
to ask her.  
  
Q. Looked like you forced San Diego State to play your style from the start.
How were you able to do that? There were a couple times it looked like San
Diego State might run away and you sort of hung together. How were you able to
do that?  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, you know, they forced us into 11 turnovers the first
half. They're so good when they're scoring off turnovers. I mean, if they can
get transition, and even their transition offense was on makes. I mean, they
just push it right back at you. Your kids, if they fall asleep, you're in
trouble. They got that on us the first half. That was the reason and the
discrepancy of field goal attempts. The first half was turnovers. It was just
the wrong kind of game for us. We knew if that was what we were looking at at
the end of the game, they would have won.  
We controlled that the second half. We can talk about it. Doesn't mean we
could have done it. Our turnovers were down.  
In terms of their attacks in the open court, because of whether it was a
defensive play or offensive transition, just weren't a factor in the second
half. And that was the big story for us.  
I don't think we would have survived that.  
You know, we felt like if we could run offense that, you know, we could -- if
you force them to defend in the halfcourt, that's not what they would choose.
They'd love to get you some steals before that and get some open-court stuff.
So that was to our advantage.  
We've been down a lot. These kids' heads were in great places this whole
tournament. They never really were concerned about it as far as it being a
panic time. They didn't think about the score as being the game. How much time
do we have left? We got eight minutes to play. That's what they focused on.
That allows you to just keep making plays and not worry about it in the game.  
  
Q. Morgan hit your biggest shot yesterday and today after not having a good
shooting day. Talk about the mentality that takes.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Yeah. It's amazing. I mean, it takes guts because when you're
willing to make plays to win a game, you may also not win games. You know,
you're not going to make all those plays. That takes a big heart and that
takes somebody who's willing to take the failure of missing a shot to the
wonders of making a shot.  
That's what most people are fearful of. They don't want that situation. Morgan
just isn't that way. You know, you just sort of always look at parents, at
their parents, go, What are they like? That's probably why you're like that.
She's a happy-go-lucky, happy, honest kid. She's made more than not. I'm happy
for her because she's good enough and she's been able to come through with it.
She's been wonderful for us.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Kalee Whipple's play. Did you have to
talk to her at halftime or did she just come out with that fire in the second
half, carry the team there?  
COACH ELLIOTT: Yeah, no, there's been times when she'll get like that and
you'll feel like her head's not there and that's the problem. I never felt
that way about her. She was fine. She's hurting. About six minutes into the
start of that game she made a cut. She hurt her hip flexor from last night. I
wasn't sure she'd play. That was where her head was early, I can promise you.
Unfortunately, there's not much you can do about that if a kid's kind of hurt.  
I think you get into the real meat of stuff. I just think it didn't matter. It
went away. When it went away, I think she just really was focused.  
  
Q. I know the story is still being written on this season, but what has
allowed this group, what is special about them that has allowed this to
happen?  
COACH ELLIOTT: This is really a unique team. I suppose I'd use the word
'overachieve' because we just really had a lot to sort of put together with
this group. Freshmen point guards are just not the way you want to go. When
you have two of 'em, it's tough. And when you have a senior who's a great
individual player, but then still have so many sort of, How are we going to
put the rest of it together, you can't win with one or two kids. And, again,
giving them such a taxing early-season schedule where they took their lumps.
It's a real testament to who they are.  
I think that's why they've won games here, why they've won close games. They
would have folded before this if they just didn't have that in their
character.  
That got them to this point, so it's really not surprising that that's
allowing them to win these kind of games.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Utah  63  
San Diego State - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by San Diego State student-athletes Jené Morris
and Paris Johnson, and coach Beth Burns. Coach, if we could start with you
with some general comments about the game.  
COACH BURNS: Well, I think it was a great game. You know, I told our team, how
cool was it that they were 13-3, we were 13-3. We split with each other. It's
like you're on the playground and you both have H-O-R-S. We have a chance to
find out who gets 'E' before it's next season.  
They are a great champion. I thought we gave them everything we had and then
some. They really made it difficult for us to get inside the paint, to get
anything through the paint. They played to our weaknesses, obviously. We just
weren't able to get enough from the perimeter to match them.  
With that said, I thought defensively we did a fabulous job. They made some
great plays in a spurt that, as we just talked about in the locker room, I
think affected us a little bit because we'd been able to maintain that lead
for a majority of the game. We reacted a little bit I think when Warburton hit
that really big three.  
I couldn't be prouder of our team. Stranger things have happened. But I think
our season is going to continue forward. So we will regroup after this and be
excited to see what happens on Monday afternoon.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll open it up for questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Paris, how did you think you reacted after that three that Warburton hit?
Seemed like things got maybe a little tight for you.  
PARIS JOHNSON: When that three was hit, you know, we couldn't let that get us
down. We knew we still had a chance. We just got to keep fighting back, don't
let anything stop us from what we're trying to accomplish.  
I mean, it kind of gave us a little shake, but we still had to push forward.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
ladies. We'll open it up for questions for Coach Burns.  
  
Q. Postgame I'm sure you look at the stat sheets, the free throws stand out
to you?  
COACH BURNS: Free throws always stand out to me. What are you gonna do? What
are you gonna do?  
You asked; I answered.  
  
Q. It seemed like you had a problem with their set stuff underneath. Talk
about that a little bit.  
COACH BURNS: Well, they're real good at it. You know, we usually have two full
days of preparation. Everybody's teams are different. Our team is a physical
rep team. We came over here this morning. Some people don't. It is a very
mental time of year. But if you have a physical rep team, you have a physical
rep team. We need to walk through things. It helps us more to walk through
things and talk through things.  
Anytime you're in a tournament setting, it makes it that much more difficult.
If something new is in, we have to try to adjust in a timeout.  
But without question, I wouldn't disagree with you. We did our best on the fly
with some stuff that was new stuff. We adjusted to it in a timeout, but not
until a couple had gotten away.  
  
Q. Kalee Whipple had no points in the first half. What did she do so
differently in the second half?  
COACH BURNS: Just kind of Kalee Whippleized. She's a great player.  
You know, I think I've seen just about everybody play Utah this year. I don't
know that we haven't played Morgan and Kalee as well as anyone in both of our
contests.  
What hurt us was Katie King. What hurt us was Badon. What hurt us was such an
inordinate disparity on the free throw line. We don't generate enough offense
to be able to combat that. She was 20 minutes away from scissors and a net.
That's what we do this all for.  
I don't think we didn't not do something. I'm not being disrespectful. They
may have adjusted. I'm not saying they didn't. It's nothing I hadn't seen her
do that much before. And that's what I told our team.  
Obviously the people who were responsible for her are inconsolable. When great
players make great plays, great players make great plays. You've got to live
with that.  
  
Q. Are you nervous at all about Monday?  
COACH BURNS: You know, we've done our work. I think we've really done our
work. I don't know that you could say, you know, in league a road loss at
Utah, a road loss at TCU Round 1, we had a road loss in Wyoming early, but
they proceeded to I think finish 8-8 in the league. We're on a run of about, I
don't know, probably 8-2 over our last 10 games. We obviously had a non-
conference résumé.  
But who knows. You know, until they call your name... Obviously, you're here,
you're absorbed. I have no clue what's happening across America at other
places. I think I've said this before: I am all about No. 1 seeds winning
their tournament because stuff happens. If somebody has a better résumé,
then...  
But I believe we can compete in the NCAA tournament. I believe we've done
enough to compete in the NCAA tournament. But usually more than 64 voices are
saying that at this time of year.  
  
Q. How hurt was Paris? Was she limited in the second half?  
COACH BURNS: No. I mean, I don't exactly know. I haven't had time to really
revisit.  
I think, you know, she got the ball. She got swarmed. Don't believe there was
a call. She got swarmed, went up, and somebody had a body part. So she went up
and an arm stayed down. It just was the pain. You know how that happens, when
you go one way and another way. It was that shooting pain.  
I didn't know at that time, and obviously then they go on a run. We have to
have two freshmen bigs in there. You have to do what you do. Then I got the
word she's okay, she's okay. It was kind of a stinger, I think.  
I thought she was fine in the second half. I just think they aren't going to
give us paint points. Our only paint points were run-outs. They're not going
to give us anything easy in the paint.  
  
Q. I know you're probably not going to answer this question, which is
unusual for you, but is there anything that can be done about the traveling in
this league?  
COACH BURNS: Meaning?  
  
Q. The non-calls.  
COACH BURNS: I thought you meant because I have to fly, I look that bad and
I'm so fatigued. One plane ride too many. A lot of years of flying those
planes (laughter).  
You know, I'm consumed. I've got a full-time job. I think we have to revisit
the tournament. By doing the things that we did, I was told, hurt ourselves
relative to there's other tournaments that are going on. If you have a
tournament to work as an official and there's no bye day, you're going to make
more money. Some of the other leagues put exclusivity into their leagues. So
that's really hurt us.  
In other words, before they could go Big 12 on Wednesday, Mountain West on
Thursday... Now there's been a problem and people are gonna stay where they're
gonna stay. Because we have that gap day, people don't want to work this
tournament because they're going to lose money.  
I don't know how that changes unless you go to a different venue.  
But I think this spring will be lively with people's interpretations of what
this structure means for the league. I mean, you could argue that it worked
the way it was supposed to work, if that's the way you intended it to work
because the two top seeds ended up playing one another. But I think there's
going to be a lot of discussion on that. One of the, I think, big deals is
because of how it affected which officials you could get to come to your
tournament.  
Everything's on the line in this game, everything.  
  
Q. Did you feel like you started to rush things a little bit after
Warburton's three?  
COACH BURNS: No question. No question. And, you know, they're such a good
team. I only had two timeouts at the time. There's a lot of game left, and you
don't want -- you know you might have to score and call one.  
I just think it's -- if it had been a back and forth, I don't think it would
have been. But we'd been able to get the most minute of separation and
maintain it for about eight trips, whether we came up empty or not, came up
empty, got a stop, came up empty, got a stop. For us with a breakdown, we
don't usually give up threes. We'll give you twos before we give up a three. I
think that hurt psychologically, too. That's something we don't really like to
do.  
And I tried to get them back. We're not a three-point shooting team,
obviously. But we sure can put it on the floor and get around you. I think we
just got a little panicked. That's what I just talked to our team about, how
wonderful it is that we can still learn this lesson and apply it next week,
'cause that's what we've got to take from this. Nobody wins a NCAA tournament
game by 15.  
What's three with two minutes to go? It's nothing. But I thought it shook us
up.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  71  
UNLV - 63

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to get going with UNLV. Student-athletes for UNLV,
Jamie Smith, Shamela Hampton. Coach Kathy Olivier. Coach, if you could give us
your general remarks on the game.  
COACH OLIVIER: I just -- I don't know. I thought it was a great run at the end
of the year. A great time to catch on fire. I thought we did a very good job
against a very, very good basketball team.  
San Diego State has a lot of talent. Their post players are good. They have
good quickness. They have perimeter shooting.  
I just thought our team just never said 'die'. I'm just glad that Mike Hammer
gave me this opportunity because that was a great run and I had a great time.
I learned from five seniors all about the Mountain West.  
I just wish it could continue on, but we got our -- our run got cut short.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time, we'll open it up for questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Shamela, you kept this team hanging around. Just how were you able to do
so against Paris?  
SHAMELA HAMPTON: I played great defense on her. I told the reporter yesterday
I want to try to keep this team on my back and try to play good defense on
her. I think I did kind of a good job.  
She got some good shots. But I think I boxed her out really well and not let
her get easy shots at me.  
  
Q. Offensively how'd you do it?  
SHAMELA HAMPTON: Offensively, I had a lot of confidence. This could be my last
game. I'm going to try to carry this team and lead them on my back. Once I get
the ball, I'm just going to try to score every time.  
  
Q. Shamela, can you talk about a journey with a first-year coach in your
last year and what the last three or four days maybe taught you about the
potential the program will have with Kathy as the coach.  
SHAMELA HAMPTON: First, I want to say that I'm honored that I have a coach
like Olivier. She has taught me a lot here. She has helped us throughout this
journey. And I thank her for that. And I thank our athletic directors for
bringing someone like her to this program.  
I think next year, you know, we will get her program, and I think we're going
to take it really, really far.  
  
Q. Jamie, can you just talk about San Diego State's athleticism and how much
trouble they gave you guys.  
JAMIE SMITH: They're a very quick team. We had a little bit of trouble on the
transitioning on 'D'. They're a really good team, but I knew that -- I had the
confidence we could definitely keep up with them and beat them. Unfortunately,
we did fall short.  
I think that we had a really good season, and I'm very proud of our five
seniors, especially Shamela. She really stepped up.  
The only thing - I'm not going to lie - I'm sad just because I'm not going to
play with them. But I have no regrets in this season. We played really well,
and we showed Las Vegas what we could do.  
  
Q. Jamie, this season has been an up-and-down freshman year for you. You've
been named Freshman of the Year. What do you look towards going the rest of
your career? Specifically next season, what do you take from this season to
build toward the next seasons?  
JAMIE SMITH: Definitely something I'm going to take is Shamela's fire that she
had. She was a great leader. Next year we're going to lose five wonderful
seniors that were all great leaders. I'm hoping next year I can really step it
up as a leader.  
I have really the best to follow. That's what I'm looking forward to.  
  
Q. Shamela, this being your senior year, this was a sad way to end this
season. What was your level of motivation just going into this game? Did you
feel like you had to try to will this team to victory today because it could
potentially be your last game?  
SHAMELA HAMPTON: Yes, I had a lot of confidence going into this game. Coach
has preached us that defensive rebounding is going to win this game. As a
senior, I try to give our team confidence. Hey, we could do this.  
I'd try to hype Jamie up before the game. You're a great player. Just rebound
and score for us, and you will help us win. I try to help our team by
motivating them and saying we could do this.  
We fell short, but as a senior, I'm glad how we ended the season.  
  
Q. You guys made a big run toward the end but weren't able to close the
deal. It looked like maybe some shots were rushed. Can you just talk about the
end there, maybe what didn't go right for you.  
JAMIE SMITH: I think that just in the heat of the moment all of us are just
trying to not really so much do it by ourselves, but we're just trying to win.
In the heat of the moment, some shots are not going to fall for us, but some
did. I think that in the end we just put it all out there. We weren't going to
step off that court and not fit in. Like we put it all on the floor.  
So that's what we did, and we just kind of fell short. I don't think that for
one second we didn't leave it all on the floor.  
THE MODERATOR: I'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
ladies. Open up for questions for Coach Olivier.  
  
Q. If they told you what the Mountain West was, then what did you learn
about what the Mountain West was? When you see a team that was 0-16 three
years ago in the conference, does it give you hope it can be done quickly to
where you can get to that level?  
COACH OLIVIER: First of all, they just taught our staff a lot. We're new to
the conference. The seniors were constantly talking about road trips, what
it's like playing these different towns, the altitude, the different coaches.
They knew all the players. They're very basketball savvy.  
As far as the rebuilding process, we know it's going to take time. I think
this year, the last week of the season, it's been a great run. I think we can
definitely build on this last week and a half.  
I mean, the focus was at a total different level than it was at the beginning
of the year. They believed. I think that's the big reason of our success.  
Shamela has taught Jamie a lot. Jamie's feeding off everything Shamela's done.
I mean, just listening to her answer the questions and sit up here the last
three games, she's stepped up to the plate. That leadership thing, she will
take another level. This year as a freshman, that wasn't her job. I think next
year we're going to be young, and it's going to be another challenge.  
I think it's, again, probably about a three-year process. In year three we're
hoping to be one of the best in the conference. Again, these five seniors are
the ones that really gave us that direction.  
  
Q. Kathy, what did you do to get back in this game? Was it a combination of
maybe a strategic move or San Diego State sort of backing off the gas pedal?
What was it?  
COACH OLIVIER: To be honest, at the beginning of the game I thought we were a
little nervous. The first two games I didn't feel that way at all.  
This game three, they were starting to feel it. They were a little -- they
were quieter. Just kind of a different sense. So kind of took us some time to
get what they call 'our swag' back, so to speak.  
Once Shamela started demanding the ball, and you could tell they were getting
more and more comfortable, as in 'they', as in our players.  
Defensively, we got a few tops. Things started to go our way a little more. I
think we were on a 15-1 run. You could tell things were going our way. That's
kind of what we've done all year. The momentum swings are huge with this team.
We felt good. I think just down the stretch, that last 1:30, nothing went our
way. We were trying to as a staff get us back to where we are feeling good.  
We kind of just hit that wall. You know, a couple calls go their way, not our
way, and that's the game. That's basketball.  
I mean, San Diego State's a great team. Beth, Coach of the Year. I mean, that
was my vote. They have two all-conference players on their team. They got the
quickness. They have the inside game. They have all the things you want in a
good basketball team. I think their future is -- they're going to be good in
the NCAA tournament, I would think.  
  
Q. Can you expand a little on the seniors. When you come in, especially
Shamela, they're either going to accept you or not. If they don't, it's going
to be a rough time for you the first year, but they did. When did you know
they did? And is it always a concern kids that have only one year left and
there weren't many expectations for them? When did you know they had bought
in?  
COACH OLIVIER: The first week on the job I had individual meetings. Shamela is
-- she's, I mean, a dream. Seriously.  
She comes in, and we talked. I was just getting a feel. That week it was still
school for them. So I had an opportunity to work them out. And I could tell
she liked our individual workout.  
And she just bought in from day one. I mean, she bought in. She took
ownership. I think for her it was more about I'm going to make this a good
senior year for her and for her teammates.  
And as it went on, she was just buying in more and more. Liked some of the
things we did early in our individual work.  
When they came back after the summer, it was easy. I mean, she came in in
great shape. She worked out all summer. And the team was anxious, just anxious
to get started, kind of have a new beginning.  
I mean, again, I was -- I got put in a great situation as much at the
beginning I was like, Oh, no. There was so much that we had to do as a staff
to get this thing going in different ways. We had to make a lot of changes.
But not in the team ways. In the team it's more about building their
confidence.  
And once Shamela bought in, you know, everyone else -- Shamela's the leader.
Once she bought in, the other seniors were starting to buy in. It's all she
wrote. It was good.  
I wish that we wouldn't have had so many ups and downs. And the last week,
week and a half, they didn't go that far down. We were just -- we were at
fives and going to nines and tens, where in the season we were at eights and
nines and hitting some ones. But emotionally we just got on par, on cue, and
we ran with it. Shamela bought in, honestly, like after our first individual
session. She was a champ.  
  
Q. Just taking back from this game, you were down by as many as 18 and got
cut down to 2. Then you said the team kind of hit a wall. Did you feel that
was more of the team just getting tired, or was it the slow start have more to
do with the need for desperation at the end?  
COACH OLIVIER: Again, we went on that run. It wasn't like we hit a wall. I
don't want to be set up here for any fines. But we hit -- you know, things
just didn't go our way for whatever reason. If it was calls, if it was maybe a
basket here or there, things didn't go our way.  
That was the wall we hit. It wasn't like a physical wall or a mental wall. It
was more of we just didn't get the calls didn't go our way.  
I thought our team continued to fight through. We tried to mix some things up
defensively. We almost had the steal at half fort that might have changed some
things. Indy stepped up the last six or seven minutes, and she just attacked
the basket. We had different people down the stretch step up.  
Shannon had a great end of her senior year. I thought Brittany came back, had
a great game today. Allison Holiday did some good things today. We had
different people step up. It just didn't go our way. It wasn't meant to be
this year. For whatever it was worth, it wasn't meant to be this year. The
last two minutes, San Diego State, they're a good basketball team.  
  
Q. Just building off of that for next season, what do you look to try to
rebuild? Obviously, you have to replace Shamela and the other seniors. But
besides that, what else do you feel the team needs to work on going into next
year if they want to be a contender in the conference?  
COACH OLIVIER: Yikes. I haven't even thought about that. I mean, the seniors
we're going to miss. Bottom line, they're great people. They're competitors.
They were giving their guts. They had a focus. They're older. They have the
experience.  
We're going to miss their experience, their leadership, their buy-in. I mean,
they were crying in the locker room. No crying in basketball. That's out.  
As far as next year, again, back to the drawing board. We'll sit down, talk
about it. I mean, how do you replace someone like Shamela? That's going to be
rough. She's just -- she's got that drive and that desire and that muscle.
6'3". How many 6'3" girls are out there? If anyone knows anyone, let me know.  
We have some good freshmen coming in. We signed a class. I believe they were
ranked in the top 50 recruiting class in the country. You never know. Jamie
Smith, look at her. She stepped up. Signed late. Did a great job. Relentless.  
I'm looking forward to next year even though I didn't want any of this year to
stop. This year was fun. It was a great run. I'm just here for a reason, and I
thought this last week was that reason. This last week, they experienced what
they hadn't experienced. As seniors, they had their confidence. They felt good
about what they gave the community, what they gave the students.  
They were talking about having the faculty here. A lot of them had professors
at the games. They felt really good about themselves. That's what it's all
about. You learn so many things from the game of basketball. That's what it's
about.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Utah  56  
New Mexico - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to get going with university of Utah. Student-
athletes are Kalee Whipple, Morgan Warburton, coach Elaine Elliott. Coach, if
we could start with you.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Obviously, I'm so proud of my kids. My team just -- it was just
such a battle. They played it out to the end.  
I tip my hat to a great New Mexico team. I mean, boy, did they have us on the
ropes. They just -- they've had a tremendous tournament.  
It's tough to beat any team consistently. It's really tough to beat a good
team, and it's really tough to beat New Mexico. Just an amazing team, an
amazing game.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time, we'll open it up for questions for the players.  
  
Q. I wonder if you could kind of take us through that last sequence with the
winning basket, and if the poor shooting night was on your mind at that
point.  
MORGAN WARBURTON: You know, it wasn't. Elaine took me into the huddle before
the free throws and said, hey, get the ball and do what you can with it. No
matter what the score is, you've got to take it. Just that confidence with her
and in my team. I wasn't thinking about anything else but winning the game.  
  
Q. Kalee, talk about the foul shots at the end of the game. You guys had
been doing so well the whole game. All of a sudden, not just you, but everyone
started missing. What happened with that?  
KALEE WHIPPLE: That's a good question. I think I just got in my own head for
my sake with free throws. Thinking about it too much, overthinking. Don't
shoot short, and then you hit short.  
I mean, coach just said, Forget about it, we'll move on. With everyone else, I
think everyone on our team did pretty well with free throws. I don't know.  
  
Q. For both of you, how would you explain the difficult shooting night that
you had, and how did you feel like you got back into this game with the big
comeback?  
MORGAN WARBURTON: For me, I think Josi and Sasha, those huge threes they hit
for us was awesome. To come off the bench and shoot like that is just great.  
When it's not going your way, you've just got to find other ways. We gritted
it out on defense and tried to find other people to hit shots. And it happened
that way.  
  
Q. Morgan, traditionally in the past two games you guys have made a run
towards the end against New Mexico at the Pit. They were up five, and you guys
made a run. Why have you been able to make those runs against New Mexico?  
MORGAN WARBURTON: I don't know. You can't really explain it. Elaine's been
able to help us out, knowing that you just got to keep battling.  
That's what this team really did, and I'm really proud of them. There's close
games where we didn't come back and we just lost the game. This game was a lot
better than most with those of us coming together and realizing this is our
last chance to do something. We've got to make it happen. It's been against
New Mexico all three times.  
  
Q. Morgan, can you just maybe go back through the last shot a little bit,
about what was any particular plan you had? Were you just going to do whatever
you could? Did you think the ball maybe wasn't going to come out there? It
kind of bounced around.  
MORGAN WARBURTON: When I had it, I was going to shoot the three. I felt like
it was there. And I just decided to take it in. Luckily it fell through.  
I wasn't really thinking. I was just thinking, Try to get to the rim and make
a shot, make a play. It went my way that time.  
  
Q. What do you think the turning point in the game was? Your defense and
offense seemed to turn around in the second half. What do you think the
crucial turning point was?  
KALEE WHIPPLE: I think Morgan already talked about it. On the stat sheet we
had 17 bench points, and New Mexico had 7. I think that's a big turnaround
point where our players came in.  
Like when me and Morgan weren't shooting as well, they hit big shots for us. I
think that turned us around and gave us some momentum to get defensive stops
as well.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss the student-athletes. Thank you,
ladies. We'll open it up for questions for Coach Elliott.  
  
Q. I would imagine you were surprised to see those last two free throws from
New Mexico pop out. What was going through your mind as that last play
developed with Morgan?  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, obviously, Amy is so amazing. And she's the reason
they're in the position to win. So on a personal level, it's always tough.  
Obviously, Kalee's missed free throws. Had it gone the other way, she would
have been the one that would have felt that way. That's tough. There's no
doubt. I feel for any great player like that.  
What was the rest of the question?  
  
Q. I was just curious what was going through your mind as Morgan brought up
the last shot.  
COACH ELLIOTT: We were set. They don't usually remember what you've told them.
It seems like they just -- the shooters go to the corners. Our kid inbounded,
has to trail. Kalee's got to pick off a defender that's on Morgan. And Morgan
has to know if you're we're down one, two, or three based on the free throws,
what kind of throw she's going to make. Whether she has to make the three, go
to the rim, if she's got shooters in the corner.  
Kalee had fouled out. We had Sasha in the corner and Halie Sawyer is who we
had left. That's the way we can play it with a player like Morgan. It worked
out.  
  
Q. Elaine, in this new format, did it feel weird at all not to play till
Friday? Do you think not playing till Friday affected the game in any way
positively or negatively?  
COACH ELLIOTT: No. I just think the debate on the format's been off base. They
talked about it.  
It's sort of like whoever wins or loses, then you start talking about must
mean somebody's tired, must mean somebody's rusty.  
The reason that it was done was to try to get our highest seeds in the semis,
which I think is still the best thing for our league. It did a better job of
it than the year before. This year we had 1, 2, 4, and 7 in our semis.
Everybody still has a chance. I think that's probably better for us in the
long run.  
Last year we had 2, 4, 6, and 9. So as far as what my understanding was as far
as what we were trying to accomplish and how we could help our league, I think
that's good. In terms of each and every game, I knew that whatever happened,
if somebody asked me, Oh, were you rusty today? The answer is no. It was going
to be no. It would have been, No, New Mexico beat us.  
You come and play under all different circumstances, and you do that all year
long. It's not about not having practice time on a floor. It's none of those
things. We play on everybody's floor, and the kids have played there four
years and you come in and play one night.  
It's not part of the discussion for us in terms of what should be highlighted.
What you highlight are the two teams playing, and that was a very, very
amazing, competitive game.  
  
Q. Elaine, the decision to play McDermott, McKinnon, and what their
contributions were and why the coach didn't play them earlier in the season
more.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, Sasha wasn't even available. She's had knee surgery - her
third knee surgery -- second knee surgery. She hasn't played for three years.
So she was hurt all of preseason. And it's just been basically back with us
the last four weeks.  
And Josi McDermott is a kid who, quite honestly, I thought she'd never play
for us because she had back surgery last year. She didn't play last year. She
was coming off her back surgery and was out in our pre-season. Neither one of
them has had any kind of a real season of preparation to play certainly in
those circumstances. But that's our bench. That's who we have. I'm just so
proud of them obviously.  
It gives us more firepower because they do have better offensive skills than
our point guards. So you obviously noticed that we played Morgan at the one to
try to get some people who could help us on the offensive end because that was
obviously -- I mean, we weren't really stopping on the first half either, but
we also needed to catch up. We had to do a little bit of both. They just did a
great job.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the gumption your team has had to pull out three close
games against New Mexico.  
COACH ELLIOTT: It's been -- you know, whatever. It's pretty amazing because of
New Mexico is amazing. You know, this game really was just -- I was just a
cheerleader for 20 minutes. I just wanted them to just go to war because I --
you know, New Mexico battled; the first 20 minutes was theirs without a doubt.  
So we were just asking that, Listen, this is -- we don't want to go down
without a battle. They just seemed to respond.  
I kind of feel foolish. I'm not sure I've ever been quite that animated. I
just sort of didn't know what else to do.  
  
Q. What do you think the problem was there in the first half in the first
part of the second half, where you guys couldn't make defensive stops and your
shots weren't falling?  
COACH ELLIOTT: That would be New Mexico. They're just -- you know, they're
just very good. They're very well coached. You know, they can take advantage
of mismatches. They're all inside-out kids. They can drive the ball. They can
shoot.  
That's just a very tough team to match up against. We were not able to contain
them in the first half and starting into the second, without a doubt.  
After that, I mean, there was a lot less pointblank. We stayed between them
and the basket better. If there's one thing we did, that's about it.  
We also did a pretty darn good job on the boards in that regard. That changed.
You know, neither team had this amazing offensive rebounding night. But I felt
like the loose balls were there and sort of the second chances were theirs. I
feel like maybe that changed in the last ten minutes.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  71  
UNLV - 63

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with San Diego State. Student-athletes
today, Jené Morris, Paris Johnson. Coach Beth Burns. Coach, if we can start
with some general comments from you about the game.  
COACH BURNS: First, congratulations and tip of the cap to UNLV and Coach
Olivier and all that -- the excitement that she's been able to generate in her
short tenure.  
As I just said in another media setting, you know, it wasn't very long ago
that we still have a little Cinderella box back in our closets as well. We
certainly understand where they are.  
I think she's done a fabulous job with her team. They gave us everything and
then some here last weekend - and the same today.  
With that said, I couldn't be prouder of our team. I think sometimes people
think when you have a season where you've had a lot success - we're co-
champions - we've reached heights we've never reached before, that it's all
easy. It's not easy.  
Every game is similar to this. We've got to work like crazy to be successful.
But at the end of the day, 23 times now we find a way to win. I'm really proud
of our effort.  
They made run after run. I thought we kept our composure and couldn't be more
excited than an opportunity to play the Utes tomorrow afternoon.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time, we'll open up for questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Paris, did you start to see a little bit of yourself in them, in the way
you were last year, coming into this tournament? Teams get on a roll, and all
of a sudden they get pretty dangerous.  
PARIS JOHNSON: UNLV has beaten some key teams, and that gives them momentum.
Just like last year we came in and beat Wyoming and beat TCU and ended up in
the championship with New Mexico. It builds your confidence and gives you
momentum. They came in as strong as we did, so they're a great team. And we
tip our hats to them too.  
  
Q. Jené, talk a little bit of the final minutes in that game. You were up
16, I think, with about 7:30 to go. All of a sudden the lead is to four.
What's the feeling on your guys' part at that time? Was there any urgency? Any
panic at all?  
JENÉ MORRIS: I think we expected it from UNLV. We've seen time and time again,
where especially the last couple of games UNLV has come back. Players have hit
big shots on their team.  
I think as a team we stuck together. That's how we've been so successful this
season, working together and sustaining for 40 minutes. I think that's
something we've learned to grow over the last couple of years, is keeping our
composure, and when things get tough, we have to stick with it.  
As a team we work together. I don't think it was a surprise for us at all.  
COACH BURNS: And may I humbly add, she also was in foul trouble and on the
bench. So if we want to get to that point too... 'Humbly' for her.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss the student-athletes. Thank you,
ladies. We'll now open it up for questions for coach.  
  
Q. Did you ever think the game was going to end?  
COACH BURNS: I looked up one time, and it was 16 minutes. And then I looked up
about ten minutes later, and it was 16 minutes. And then I think about a half
hour later it was about 15:30.  
You know, I know our team. I've coached them for a while. And I know coach's
team. I mean, they got after it. I think we got a little fatigue and we lost
-- sometimes leads, we just lose our aggressiveness. And, as you can see by
watching us, we only are good when we are aggressive.  
We go at people. We're not a spread-them-out, in-and-out, throw-it-out, shoot-
threes type of group. That's not our strengths. We've got to hit you hard.  
And I think that we tend to relax a little bit, not lose focus or not not
appreciate the seriousness of the moment. I think they get a little fatigued.
It's hard to play as hard as we do on both ends of the floor.  
I think we get a little bit of a cushion, and we relax a little bit. Good
teams come back and hammer you. Shamela Hampton is a heck of a player; has
been an all-conference player her entire tenure here. And I think she -- I was
going to say quietly. That would be a lie to say she quietly kept them in it.
She kept the heat on by getting high-percentage shots.  
I really felt we wanted to shut down everybody else. We didn't want them to
get momentum threes and 'O' boards. And just make them work each possession.  
  
Q. Did you do anything special against Jamie Smith because she didn't have
the type of game she's been having?  
COACH BURNS: Well, I think we did a very good job against Jamie in San Diego
and did not do a very good job on Saturday, which shows her development and
growth as a freshman.  
I wouldn't say 'special'. When you have a great big like you do in Hampton,
kind of a young forward is going to reap the benefits of that early because
everyone is so consumed with Shamela. But she's got such a thumper - and I say
that with such great respect. You can't teach how she goes to the glass.  
Shamela had more success because we changed some things and just said, If you
have to face-guard, cross-body block, do what you got to do, let them get
their first shot. We can't let them get a second. I think our pressure kind of
negates her three-point game. That's what we attempt to do.  
But we did change a little bit how to keep her off the glass because she goes
at it so hard.  
  
Q. For someone who's taken an 0-16 team to one of, if not the best teams in
the league, can you talk about what is in store for Kathy at this school,
trying to build a program, how you did it, and what she might be able to do
here in terms of contending in this league?  
COACH BURNS: I think first applaud UNLV for -- coaching is about fits. And
applaud UNLV for getting someone with energy and enthusiasm that loves it
here, that is from here, but most importantly is a veteran. That's because I'm
old now (smiling). If I was 30, I'd say they should have hired a younger
person. But they went out and got a veteran person.  
Coach Olivier and I have recruited against each other since we were both 25
years old. She's going to get after it in recruiting. And her energy and
enthusiasm and her bench -- she's got good coaches on her bench. Caitlin did a
great job for many years. So she surrounded herself with great people.  
That's what it starts with, good people, get after it hard. She's got talented
young -- I mean, I thought their point guard, Helms, had a great sophomore
campaign. Chaney came on really strong. Future is very, very bright.  
She's going to do it because she'll stay positive and get after it. But don't
have her do it too quick. Come on. Little steps.  
  
Q. They did a pretty good job on your running game, didn't they?  
COACH BURNS: They did a pretty good job? Well, they've got good athletes. You
know, I knew coming into the game that we were going to have to pick our
spots. Q really hurt them on Saturday. Q really kept the ball in her hands.
They worried about some other people, and I thought really the difference
tonight was they tried to take Q out of the game. And by taking Q out of the
game, that kind of opened her up to get other people involved. She really did
a nice job.  
Jené Morris just for a period of time just took it upon herself. I hope
everyone here, if anybody was dissenting that she's the defensive player of
the year in our league, I think she kind of solidified that a little bit
today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Utah  56  
New Mexico - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to go with the New Mexico Lobos, players Amy
Beggin, Angela Hartill, Coach Don Flanagan. Some remarks by you about the
game, coach.  
COACH FLANAGAN: First of all, congratulations to Utah. Played an excellent
game. I thought it was a hard-fought game.  
Obviously, we had a lead throughout the game, and it was tough at the end. We
needed to execute a little bit better. They got the ball in their best
player's hands, and she converted it.  
But throughout the game I thought we played well. I'm happy with our effort. I
thought we played up throughout the game, defended very well, and just played
an outstanding game.  
But, again, congratulations to Utah.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up at this time for questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Amy, can you talk about that last series a little bit. You obviously
stepped up to the line with a chance to kind of put them in a real bind, but
you played 40 minutes. Was fatigue a factor at all?  
AMY BEGGIN: No, it wasn't a factor at all. I stepped up there with confidence,
and both of them felt good. I just didn't convert them. They gave it, like
coach said, to Warburton, and she converted.  
I take all that responsibility on me. I've got to step up there and hit the
free throws. I've been in those situations plenty of times before. Just
frustrating to know that if I would have hit the free throws, we would have
won the game.  
  
Q. Amy, can you just talk about the defensive job you did on Morgan during
the game and then just on that last sequence, just how you saw what happened
when she made the shot.  
AMY BEGGIN: I mean, I just tried to make her work the whole game and make her
work for every basket she gets. She's a great player and just try to chase her
all around.  
They set up a ball screen at the end, and we tried to double it. She just kind
of beat us a little bit and put a finger roll in the basket.  
It was a nice shot by her.  
  
Q. Angela, just talk about basically the way these three games have gone
with this team this year, and even going back to last year. Is it a situation
where you guys just really could never feel comfortable with them, even if you
have a big lead in the second half?  
ANGELA HARTILL: I thought we played well throughout the game. We missed a lot
of easy shots. We didn't attack them on offense because they were attacking
us. They were drawing the fouls. That's something we weren't doing.  
We didn't hit free throws. Yeah, they're a tough team to play just because
they're very well-rounded. They have two outstanding guards that are really
tough to defend.  
I don't know. Just a good game. But unfortunately, we didn't get the win.  
  
Q. Angela, could you just talk about Amy's performance during the course of
the game regardless of what happened in the last waning moments.  
ANGELA HARTILL: Amy played her heart out. Everybody on our team played their
hearts out. I absolutely trust Amy to have the ball at all times during that
kind of a situation during the game.  
So I don't put the blame on any one person on our team because it's a team
effort: we play as a team, we win as a team, and we lose as a team.  
Amy did all she could. Everyone did all that they could. That's just what
happened.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time, we'll dismiss the student-athletes. Thank you,
ladies. Now open it up for questions for Coach Flanagan.  
  
Q. Coach, I asked Elaine a similar question. Why does Utah have the
gumption? You've had some leads, and they've just been able to take it away
from you.  
COACH FLANAGAN: They do seem to have a great deal of poise. They have two
players that are very difficult to stop. In fact, I don't think anybody really
stops them. We're doing our best to stop them, but slow them up a little bit.  
But with those two players, they're exceptions, they're first team all-
conference. They're not only exceptions on offense, they're pretty good
defenders. So we have to help out off on them, creating other players on their
team to have opportunities.  
I mean, one player had two threes. She's shooting 22% from the three-point
line. We've got to play percentages because you've got to help off on
Warburton and Whipple.  
So they had our number this year. I mean, there's been times when we've had
their number. They have great players, and they are well-coached, and they
don't make a lot of mistakes.  
I thought we played pretty darn well. We just didn't make some shots that
normally we could. But I thought it was a great game, a great college game. I
thought we played very well. Not unhappy. I would have loved to have won, but
at the same time, I'll take that effort. And if we'd played most normal teams,
we would have won that game.  
  
Q. Obviously, coach, you can't understand or know what the NCAA is going to
do. Do you feel like this is a team that deserves a bid?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Yeah. You know, we're 22-10. We have some good wins. We didn't
beat Utah. That's unfortunate. I mean, we had three opportunities to beat
them, and were in a position to beat them two out of the three. All of them
were close.  
But I think we are. I think we have the ability to play with NCAA teams. We've
got some good wins over DePaul, Nebraska, Texas Tech. I think we're playing
well again. I thought there was a period of time where we weren't playing
great, but we're playing well again.  
If I was on the committee, I'd vote for us. Of course, I'm not on the
committee.  
  
Q. Coach, this may not have made a difference in the outcome of the game,
but we were curious about that call in front of the Utah bench when they
called a foul. Was it a loose ball foul? And why you guys didn't go to the
line on that particular case.  
COACH FLANAGAN: That's what they called it, was a loose ball foul.  
  
Q. That's not a foul shot?  
COACH FLANAGAN: That was not a free throw. I was kind of hoping we didn't get
fouled there because then we could have run some time off the clock.  
But then it ended up that we did that and they fouled Amy, fouled our best
free-throw shooter. You know, Amy had an exceptional game, and that probably
gave her too many things to do. She has to play the best player on the floor
defensively. She's got to bring the ball up and start our offense. And then
she gets 16 points. I think she outscored everybody.  
And then she takes it very, very difficult, as she's pretty upset over missing
those free throws, and really she's an excellent free-throw shooter.  
We had many more opportunities. It wasn't just Amy. We had lots of
opportunities. We had layups and other people miss free throws. You know, we
didn't defend that well. You know, there's 40 minutes. There's lots of
opportunities to score and prevent people from scoring.  
So I thought Amy played a great game. It's just that, under a normal
circumstances, she hits those two free-throws, but she didn't. And the game's
over, and we move on.  
  
Q. Elaine probably won't like me much for saying this. But when you look at
it, you say you would have beaten most normal teams in those circumstances. Do
you feel that Amy steps to the free-throw line, your best free-throw shooter,
how much has luck been an element in these games with Utah?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Well, you know, I think there's a little bit of luck in
winning games from time to time. But they won the game, and they won the game
not through luck, but through execution.  
You know, from time to time, you're going to get a lucky bounce in games. I
mean, we had a game against Colorado State. Amy shoots a three. It goes
straight up in the air and comes straight down through the basket. I don't
think I've seen a shot like that.  
So sometimes the ball bounces your way. And in a one-point win, ball could
bounce anybody's way in a one-point win. It's not necessarily -- I mean, there
could be an element of luck in it. But Utah won the game not because of luck,
but because of execution. They did a great job.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll conclude. Thank you, coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

UNLV  84  
TCU - 75

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by TCU student-athletes Helena Sverrisdottir and
Shayla Moore, and Coach Jeff Mittie. We'll start with some opens comments from
Coach Mittie.  
COACH MITTIE: Well, I thought Vegas clearly outplayed us. They had to beat a
lot of people tonight. They'd have beat a lot of people tonight. When they
shoot 52%, shoot 43% from three, almost 90% from the free-throw line, they're
going to beat a lot of people. It's tournament time. You catch some people
with some momentum, just a wave of enthusiasm and passion, anything goes.  
I thought we waited too long. We got off to a decent start, but then that run
right before half killed us. If we could have kept it at 10 or 12, I think we
would have been okay. But they ran away from us.  
We fought hard in the second half, but just came up short.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the play of Hampton and Smith inside. Did you expect
UNLV to be able to be as strong inside, both defensively and offensively as
they were?  
COACH MITTIE: I think the thing that we had done to them in past games was we
really disrupted their rhythm offensively. They had better rhythm tonight, so
they were able to get the ball in there. They only had two turnovers at
halftime. Last time we played them, we forced them into 25 turnovers.  
We know how good Smith and Hampton are. They're both more physical at times
than we are. We're more of a finesse team. We needed to disrupt them out front
more than we did in the first half. We didn't play with enough energy to do
that.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes first, then we'll
get back to coach, please.  
  
Q. Helena, how difficult is this loss for you, as leader of this team? What
goes through your mind now that you have time to sit back and reflect on the
game?  
HELENA SVERRISDOTTIR: I'm just really disappointed, of course. I feel like we
could have come out here and played a lot harder than we did.  
A lot of it is on me. I feel like I could have stepped up better in the first
half. We made some mistakes. We weren't on the same page as a team. Right now,
it feels really bad that we just lost this game, so...  
  
Q. Could you talk about the new format, whether you like it, don't like
it.  
HELENA SVERRISDOTTIR: I don't have an opinion on it really. I guess that's how
it is right now, so we just have to go with it. Whatever.  
SHAYLA MOORE: Just me personally, I don't think we were too much worried about
the format. It's new. Everyone has an opportunity to get a championship.
That's what we were coming out to do.  
  
Q. Shayla, you came out with a lot of energy in the second half. Immediately
when you came into the basketball game, you got into the flow.  
SHAYLA MOORE: Energy is something that we really didn't have in the first
half. So when I got my opportunity to play, I felt that I could bring the
energy. And my teammates just kept feeding me the ball. It kept going from
there.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let the student-athletes go at this time. We'll continue
with questions for Coach Mittie.  
  
Q. You have beaten some really good teams this year. Obviously this isn't
the way you anticipated your season coming to an end. If you had to make a
case to the NCAA selection committee, what would you tell them?  
COACH MITTIE: You know, I think if the NCAA committee's listening to coaches
making a case across the country, if that's what they're going to base it on,
we're really in trouble. I think our résumé speaks for itself. Obviously the
wins over Cal and Maryland, and specifically a road win at Cal is something
that you think they'll take a look at.  
But we have other wins in this league. You go back a week ago to Utah. We've
got some good wins. I mean, we'll see where it shakes out. I've been in this a
long time. A lot of it just depends on what happens across the country.  
Now you're getting me to make a case. I guess that was the reason for your
question, huh?  
I don't know all the parameters of those things. This is a disappointing loss.
It's hard to get your head around that. I'm really proud of this basketball
team, though, because this team has really, for a new team together, four
sophomores, Younger has only been started -- she maybe started five games.
When I took the timeout with 40 seconds, that timeout was just about me
telling them how proud I was to be their coach because this team has really
worked hard.  
So I think they've done a lot this season. Whether that turns into an NCAA
tournament, I hope it does, because I'd like to see this team play. We haven't
shot the ball very well lately, so that has really hurt us. If we shoot the
ball, we're very dangerous.  
  
Q. For this team now, how do you get them to regroup mentally knowing that
they put a lot into this tournament, preparation for this tournament, now into
the post-season situation?  
COACH MITTIE: Well, that's a good question. I'm not sure. Obviously, I'll sit
back and take a look at that.  
If you look back the last three weeks, every game has been a grind. I mean,
the 41-38 over New Mexico, the Utah game. We dug ourselves some holes in those
games. We went out to San Diego and were down 14. Came all the way back and
had it tied with four. So, you know, we'd been down this road before.  
I don't know. This group's fine mentally. I mean, they're hurting right now,
guys. In the locker room, they're hurting right now.  
I think my job is just to really just tell them that I'm not judging this team
on one game. This has been a great group to coach. Out of my 17 years, this
has been one of the most enjoyable years I've had as a coach with the team.  
I'm hurting for them right now.  
  
Q. What did UNLV do different offensively to be more effective in this game
after you had been so effective against them earlier in the season?  
COACH MITTIE: The one thing we noticed last night watching them play is they
were very committed to getting the ball inside the zone. They've shot a lot of
threes against us the last time. That's really what we want you to do, is to
fall in love with that three-pointer.  
Tonight they hit more threes than they ever had against us and shot it less
than they ever had. So we knew this was a team playing with great rhythm, and
certainly more committed to getting the ball into the areas that hurt the
zone.  
They really attacked it inside. They did a good job of -- people against our
1-3-1 have tried to get physical in the blocks against us. They have personnel
that can do that. So they just mixed that up very well.  
I thought, watching 'em last night, I thought they were a much more committed
team. You know, new coach, getting what she's trying to get out of them. This
team, everybody always gets caught up because they struggled so much early,
but this team beat Utah a couple weeks ago, this team had San Diego State on
the ropes. This is not a big surprise here that they're playing very well and
playing at home very well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

UNLV  84  
TCU - 75

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UNLV student-athletes Shamela Hampton, Allison
Holiday and Jamie Smith, as well as coach Kathy Olivier. We could get started
with some general comments from you, coach.  
COACH OLIVIER: All right. I'm just really, really proud of our basketball team
right now. They're just playing with an I don't want to go home attitude.
They're extremely focused, very coachable. Right now that intensity needs to
stay for a couple more games.  
We took care of the ball. We asked them to take care of the ball. They did
that. We only had 10 turnovers tonight. We started the game with so much just
drive. It was a good night to be a Rebel, that's for sure.  
And the clock could not go fast enough, by the way (smiling).  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Are you guys, especially after last night, is the confidence level sky
high right now?  
SHAMELA HAMPTON: I can speak on that.  
I'd say our confidence level has went up. Coach has helped us with that. She
said we could do this. In the locker room, she kind of, you know, hyped us up
a little bit to make sure that we have the confidence to go on the court.  
As a leader on this team, I have helped with that, to have confidence, tell
everybody we could do this, make them believe. I think that's what we did
today.  
  
Q. When did you turn into John Stockton at the line?  
SHAMELA HAMPTON: Actually, I'd say coach helped me with that. She gave me
confidence. She said I could do that. She's like, I love your stroke, keep it
up. I thank coach for that. She has helped me.  
COACH OLIVIER: I think Shamela wants a job after her senior year.  
  
Q. Allison, you played during a critical stretch of point guard. You had
eight assists for the game. Talk about coming in for Erica, what that meant
for the team.  
ALLISON HOLIDAY: I just tried to go hard every chance I got. When I have that
chance, I'm going to go and prove to Coach KO that I really want to be out
there. I took advantage this game. And it felt good.  
  
Q. Jamie, second double-double in a row. You shot over 51% as a team. What
was happening tonight with the shooting?  
JAMIE SMITH: I think that we just had a lot of confidence coming into this
game. It was really a team effort. It wasn't just one person hitting outside.
I mean, everybody was hitting outside. Everybody was grabbing rebounds. Me and
Shamela worked really well inside together I think tonight.  
It was just an overall team effort that really got our confidence going. After
that we just kind of did it.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let the student-athletes go at this time. Thank you,
ladies. Questions for Coach Olivier.  
  
Q. The key was hitting over the zone. Was it as simple as that: just making
shots?  
COACH OLIVIER: The first time we played them at home we thought that we played
them fairly well. They came out with the W, but we played them tough. Our
defense had a lot to do with that.  
The second time we played them, we didn't feel like we played well at all. TCU
is a very, very good basketball team. They should be in the NCAA tournament in
my mind with no doubt. They beat Cal. They beat Maryland. I mean, I believe
they have 20 wins, 19 or 20 wins, very well-coached. We knew we were going to
get zone. We talked about it as a staff. We made some adjustments in our zone
offense. The players really listened up, came in hit some big shots, which
opened it up for the inside game. Jamie and Shamela took advantage of that.
Allison got the ball to the right people. That's all she wrote.  
  
Q. With the new format in the tournament, you have to win four games in five
days as opposed to three in three days. There's some people who like the day
off, some people who don't. What are your thoughts on the day off in the
middle?  
COACH OLIVIER: Well, I mean, I'm just glad we're at that situation where we
have to think about that. To be honest, I think our team's gonna be fine.
We're taking the day off. We're gonna do a talk-through instead of a walk-
through. We have a few people playing a lot of minutes. But their adrenaline's
flowing right now. So as much as a day off, I hear what you're saying, it
scares me a little. I just think this team, you know, we lost to BYU twice,
then we beat them last night. We lost to TCU twice, then we beat them.  
There's one other team that we lost to twice in this conference, and we get to
play them on Friday. San Diego State is a very, very good team. They have a
great inside game. They have great perimeter players. I think it's going to be
a great matchup. It's gonna probably be a track meet, so I think we can use
that day off and hopefully it will help us.  
  
Q. Did you stick with Allison during that long stretch because she was
playing so well at that point?  
COACH OLIVIER: Allison, you know, I know she hasn't played a lot of minutes
this year, but we have a lot of confidence in her. She does a really good job
against the zone 'cause she's a great passer and she sees the floor.  
Erica does a great job with the tempo. It just so happened that Erica got in
foul trouble. Like Allison said, you know, she took advantage of her
opportunity.  
I love that she did well. I thought it was great. I thought it hyped up the
team, got the crowd going. She hit a couple threes, if I'm not mistaken. Three
for five. She hit three threes. Allison, she's an upperclassman, she knows
what she's doing. She has a lot of confidence. Against certain teams, she's a
big asset for us. Tonight was one of those games.  
  
Q. Defensively in the first half when you got the big lead, you seemed
really frustrated. Seemed you were mixing up defenses.  
COACH OLIVIER: Yes, we were mixing it up a little and try to keep them off-
balance. They're a great basketball team, No. 4 is one of the best players in
the conference. She gets comfortable. Their team gets comfortable. So we were
trying to just make her work a little more by reading the defenses. I mean,
you're only going to be able to contain her so much.  
You know, we have to get better. It's very obvious. I know everyone in this
room knows this. But we have to get better at the end of the game, be able to
hold leads a little more than we have, take care of the ball, not get so
flustered, like be in that situation and expect to be in that situation and
handle that situation.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

New Mexico  62  
Colorado State - 48

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by New Mexico student-athletes Angela Hartill and
Amy Beggin and coach Don Flanagan. Coach, if you could start with some general
remarks about the game.  
COACH FLANAGAN: Yeah, first of all, I want to compliment Colorado State.
Played with great effort. They appeared that they didn't have anything to lose
and they came out and played that way.  
I thought their defense in the first half bothered our offense, got us out of
our offense a bit. We missed an awful lot of shots because of their pressure.
And then their offense was difficult to defend because they've got some pretty
good drivers and then they've got some pretty good shooters. For a long period
of time there was a pretty darn competitive game. I thought because of these
two players to my left we kind of closed it out in a positive way. But, again,
Colorado State played an excellent game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Angela, it seemed like they decided to double down you a lot. Can you
talk about how you just decided to take them on the perimeter.  
ANGELA HARTILL: Uhm, I felt that was the only thing that was open since the
doubles coming from the other post player, I thought it best to clear them out
so I could hit the other post player that was open.  
So that's basically what I tried to do.  
  
Q. From where we were sitting it looked like an extremely physical game. Was
it as physical as it looked like?  
AMY BEGGIN: Yeah, I thought it was really physical. Both teams were battling.
Colorado State drives and drives and drives. They were attacking almost the
whole game. At the end we finally started to attack back at them. But it was
really physical both ways.  
  
Q. Amy, have you ever hit a shot like that in a tournament? We watched you
all year long sink shots. The one that bounced up and kind of fell.  
AMY BEGGIN: No, I haven't. It kind of felt good to get a bounce go our way.
Seems like we haven't had one of them in a while. I was struggling a little
bit with my shots. My teammates stuck with me, just stuck with that shot and
we got a lucky bounce.  
  
Q. It seemed like you were able to keep Amaka Uzomah, she got her rebounds
but wasn't getting the points like she did yesterday. What were you able to do
inside to keep her from being an offensive force for them and make her a
defensive-type player?  
ANGELA HARTILL: Just try to push her off the block as far as I could
basically, and just give her a little bit of space because I noticed she likes
to drive, she likes to spin. By me stepping back and keeping my hands up, it
was difficult for her to shoot over it. So that's what I tried to do.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss our student-athletes. Thank you,
ladies. Open it up to questions for Coach Flanagan.  
  
Q. What's different going into this game against Utah? Now that you have a
day's rest, anything you're going to do different?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Yeah, but I'm not going to tell you (smiling).  
You know, both our games with Utah were difficult games, close games. And down
the stretch they were more effective offensively than we were.  
We're hoping that we can execute, keep it close again, and execute better down
the stretch.  
But I think the most important thing with Utah is that you defend their two
great guards as best you can, because you can't stop them. And then make it a
rebounding game, you got to win the rebounds. They're very good in their
possessions. They shoot a high percentage shots. They're very good free throw
shooters. They really don't have a lot of weaknesses. Their only weakness
might be that they haven't played in this tournament yet and we have.  
  
Q. It seemed like in the first few minutes Angela was dominating in the
paint, then they kind of did something to change that and force her to the
perimeter. Was it something they did or did you feel she got away from the
paint game?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Well, usually we're trying to take what they're giving us.
They were doubling a little bit and then being physical with her. I allow the
player pretty much to determine that. She's a player that's an inside-out
player.  
What they did well, I thought, was they mixed up the zone and man. So we were
running pretty well against their man, and then all of a sudden there's a zone
there. I think that gets us to slow up a little bit.  
I didn't think we adjusted too well. By them mixing things up, it helped them
defensively. And then so we were always kind of struggling to get into
whatever offense it was.  
Angela just figured it out. I figured she'd start hitting sooner or later.
Then, of course, Amy's floor game is excellent. Then she gets you 20 beside
that and then she chases everybody and defends as well as anybody in the
league. I think she might be the best defensive player in the league, just
because of her effort and her quickness.  
  
Q. Again with Amy, what is it like having a point guard like that at the end
of the game that can nail down a win like that?  
COACH FLANAGAN: She's a gamer. What it's like to coach somebody like that is a
pleasure. She's a team-oriented person. I would say she's a throw-back kind of
player. You're always going to get effort. She's extremely dependable. And she
does so many little things.  
You know, I think she got double-figure rebounds if I'm not mistaken. I think
she had 10 rebounds. She gets 10 rebounds, 20 points, takes care of the press,
defending their toughest kid. Later on she's going to cook supper for all of
us (laughter).  
  
Q. At the end of the game for about the last five minutes or so you had kind
of an unusual lineup on the floor for you. Was that just an attempt to kind of
match up with their quickness?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Well, I hadn't played Nikki throughout the game. Their point
guard is a driver. I thought if we could get Nikki to put some pressure on
her, that would relieve Amy to go play the shooters. Amy can get over screens
better than anybody. Really, Nikki's a good defender on the ball. So I thought
that really helped us late.  
They were having difficulty real late because of the pressure on the point
guard, not allowing them to start their offense, and then Amy being able to
get over screens better than anybody else that we had out there. So that
really helped. I thought Nikki's contribution, although she didn't play that
many minutes, I thought those quality crucial minutes were very important to
the team.  
  
Q. Back to the double on Angela. It opened up a lot of shots on the
perimeter. Yesterday you knocked them down. Why couldn't you knock them down
today?  
COACH FLANAGAN: That's a good question. You know, you never know from game to
game how kids are going to react to it. And I think there was a little bit
more pressure, run-out pressure on us. I thought their defense was quite good.  
If you have free shooting with your team, they're usually pretty accurate. But
then you put somebody with their hands up, they drop down about 10%. Then
somebody that's all over you, probably drop down another 10%. So when people
contest shots, it's much more difficult to be accurate with shots. You really
have to focus on the rim.  
I think every team has that kind of difficulty from time to time.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH FLANAGAN: Thanks.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

New Mexico  62  
Colorado State - 48

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Colorado State student-athletes Bonnie Barbee
and Kim Mestdagh and coach Kristen Holt. Coach, we can start with you with
some general remarks about the game.  
COACH HOLT: Well, first of all, I'm extremely proud of my team. We've come a
long way this year. You know, I'm proud of my seniors, that they really bought
into what we wanted to do. They were a huge part of leading this group.  
These two here to my left have just been great all year. They, too, have
bought in. We just had a great group of kids and we fight.  
I am extremely proud. New Mexico is an extremely good team. They hurt us
definitely on the boards. With our turnovers, that pretty much was it. They
had a lot of possessions offensively. Our possessions were low. If we're going
to win any games, we've got to have our possessions being up in the 60s, I
feel. At halftime that was a concern. I was pretty happy with the fact we were
only down three, considering we were getting beat pretty good in both areas.  
Again, they're an extremely good team and I expect them to do well in the next
round.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Bonnie, it seemed like you were able to stay in and make up for some of
the turnover problems by hitting a lot of threes early. As the game went on,
those threes just weren't falling. Were they the same kind of shots you were
taking or was it a matter of maybe you started forcing them?  
BONNIE BARBEE: Uhm, I would have to say as the game goes on, of course your
legs are getting a little tired. And, of course, UNM was pressuring us out a
little further out. We had to shoot them a little deeper. I don't believe it
was just because we were out of rhythm or out of range for our shooters. I
just feel as though it was later in the game for us.  
  
Q. Kim, at what point did you feel this game started getting away from you
guys? With five minutes to go, it was still a three-point game. Was there a
sense it got out of reach at some point or did that not happen till the
buzzer?  
KIM MESTDAGH: I think with our turnovers and we started fouling, we put them
on the free-throw line too much, then the game started slipping away.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss the student-athletes. Thank you,
ladies. We'll open it up to questions for Coach Holt.  
  
Q. They said defensively, Don was saying you were causing a lot of troubles
with them early the way you were mixing things up with the man and zone, kept
them out of sync. What adjustments did they make down the stretch that maybe
got their offense going midway through the second half?  
COACH HOLT: Well, I think, you know, they did a lot of different things. And I
thought what they were doing early on, in the second half they did a lot
better. They executed it a lot better.  
And, again, I think that we just never recovered from the deficit on the
boards. It was just so hard for our kids. Each kid, I could hear 'em on the
bench saying, We got to box out. Then that kid would go in and do the same
thing.  
You know, I just thought that they -- you know, I'd have to probably look at
the film to answer specifically where they were really hurting us. I just felt
they were hurting us in a lot of different areas. But we were hanging in
there. Like you said, at the end, we just didn't have enough in the tank. We
had some key turnovers that really were costly, I thought, at the end. Like
Kim said, we just put 'em at the free-throw line. You just can't do that to a
team like that.  
  
Q. Is this the kind of game where it hurts maybe to not have a true go-to
player, somebody you can count on to put up 15, 20 points a game?  
COACH HOLT: Well, that's hurt us all year (laughter). But at the same time I
think if you're scouting us, you don't know who's gonna score for us. I was
looking at our starters that we scored three, three, four and four. I mean,
that's tough.  
Some of those players are players that can normally get us more than that. I
mean, even if Britney Minor can get her average, which is about eight points a
game, there's some difference there.  
So, yeah, that was tough. But I thought their defense was really good. I'm not
going to take it away from them at all. I don't think it was we were able to
hit as much as I thought they were just pressuring us and causing us to kind
of be out of rhythm at times.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH HOLT: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

UNLV  66  
BYU - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by BYU student-athletes Mindy Nielson and Shawnee
Slade. Coach Jeff Judkins, if you could start with some general remarks about
the game from you.  
COACH JUDKINS: I want to give Vegas a lot of credit. I thought they played a
really nice game. Especially they came out early and were very aggressive
attacking the basket. They made quite a few first shots early in the game.  
We kind of got ourselves in the hole a little bit. But I'm proud of my team
coming back. Not just once, but several times throughout this game we got down
pretty far the first half. Cut Utah down to five going into the halftime. Made
another run the second half. We came back and had a chance to really win this
game, being down as far as we were.  
But it's kind of been this way the whole season for us, at least the last
month. We've done a great job of fighting back and showing a lot of character.
Just can't seem to get over the hump a little bit.  
But I'm proud of these guys. I'm proud of their effort. It's hard when things
don't always go right for you to keep pushing. I thought they showed a lot of
toughness and dedication to this team. Just too bad it just didn't work for
us.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll open it up for questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. You cut it to three and Jamie Smith hit a three the other end. Did you
feel that was pretty much the game right there?  
SHAWNEE SLADE: I think that definitely was a big factor in that last minute
there. Kind of knocked the wind out of us. It was a great shot by her. But,
yeah, definitely.  
  
Q. You were having strong defensive play on India Chaney. About two seconds
left on the shot clock, she threw a prayer from the top of the key. Was that
kind of one of those plays you were like, Well, this is how the game is going
to be?  
MINDY NIELSON: I don't think that was the case at all. It was a shot she took
and it went in. I don't think -- we didn't think that was it for us at all.  
But it was something we needed to come back from, whether winning or not. It
was just unfortunate that the ball bounced their way tonight. So we just got
to come back from that.  
  
Q. Shawnee, you guys were able to come back from 16 points down. What did
you do to get back in the game and have a chance to win?  
SHAWNEE SLADE: I think it was just being aggressive on both ends. I think we
definitely needed to have a couple more hustle plays than they did. We fell
short.  
But I think it was just that we had to play with a little more heart. Fought
hard, but just fell short.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss the student-athletes. Thank you,
ladies. We'll open it up for questions for Coach Judkins.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you swept UNLV earlier in the season. How tough is it to
beat a team three times and get your team prepared to play a school they've
played three times?  
COACH JUDKINS: I think it's very difficult. I think you saw it in the game
before ours. Colorado State beat Wyoming, and they beat them twice.  
You know, playing Vegas here, it's not as big a home-court advantage, because
they don't play in this arena. But it's still travel. Like we had to play Air
Force, travel here, where they didn't have to. Made it a little bit easier.
Seemed to have a lot more energy than us.  
I don't know if that was -- they came out with that. But it's hard to do it.
But, you know, this team, I think, could take that challenge. In the past I've
had many teams that we've beat teams three times. They also lost a key player
today on their team. That was to our advantage.  
But I thought Vegas played -- the three games we played, this was the best
game they played against us, I thought.  
  
Q. How was it difficult to block Jamie Smith out? She seemed to find the
area. Was it because you were in zone or what was the issue?  
COACH JUDKINS: That was part of it. We had to go zone with us being in foul
trouble with Foreman. I really don't have a player that can handle the ball
and run the ball as well as Jaz. When she got in fouls, I cut my defensive
philosophy of playing man-to-man. I had to go zone, hoping we could keep her
in the game as long as possible. They also were hurting us on penetration. We
felt maybe we could do a better job of hitting the outside shot. By doing
that, you give Jamie Smith an opportunity to rebound. She has a great knack.
There's no question in my mind she's the best offensive rebounder in our
league, period. She just has a good feel. There's players like that. Some
players just know where the ball's coming off. She seems to do that very well.  
I wish she was a senior. It's going to be tough (smiling). She did a great
job. She hit some big baskets for them tonight. That three-pointer, as you
mentioned earlier, was a big basket. Three seconds on the shot clock, and she
hits it. She got numbers of rebounds with them missing and then her getting
second and third opportunities.  
You don't realize how much that helps a team when you're struggling to score.  
I would like to man them. That puts a little more responsibility on the person
that's guarding her. But tonight we just couldn't do it. Hopefully next year
we'll have our opportunity. I'm sure I'll remind my players of boxing her out,
not letting her get offensive rebounds. I told them that was the key to the
game, before the game, was to not let her get eight or nine rebounds. She did
it. We have to do a lot better job next time.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH JUDKINS: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Colorado State  64  
Wyoming - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: Colorado State players Amaka Uzomah and Zoi Simmons. Coach
Kristen Holt. We'll start out with general comments by Coach Holt, then get to
questions by the student-athletes.  
COACH HOLT: I'm extremely proud of my team. Going into this game, we talked a
lot about kind of dictating the tempo. I felt like the first two times we
played Wyoming, they dictated the tempo of the game. Our tempo is to try to
pick it up and run as much as we can. We pressed a little bit obviously today.  
So that's what we wanted to do. We felt that that would play to our advantage.
I think it did.  
So I really liked the start that we had. My team was as focused as they've
been in any game this year. It's a good time to be focused. We had good
practices leading up to today's game. These two here to the left did a superb
job of just bringing a lot of energy. Zoi took care of the ball very well.
Thought she did a great job in the press. Amaka was huge on the boards and
made some shots that sometimes I don't let her shoot (smiling).  
But, no, I thought we were making a lot of shots in the first half, shots that
we don't normally hit, shots that we don't normally take. I thought at times
in the second half, we were trying to take those same shots and weren't
hitting them. Those were not good shots for us, which I think led to Wyoming
being able to come back in the game. That was part of it. Again, when we came
out in the second half, we were short on everything. A lot of that had to do
with all the energy we had in the first half.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. What is it about tournament time? Do you think maybe you should just
forget about the regular season and come straight here to Vegas and start
knocking people off?  
AMAKA UZOMAH: To tell you the truth, I don't know what it is about tournament
time. All I know is we come into this 0-0 any conference. You just got to
fight for it all. It's a new start. Yeah, we might have started off rough in
the season, but we put that behind us, come in, say it's a new season, a new
team.  
  
Q. Was it a little bit tough to be playing -- you aren't used to playing
with that kind of lead and trying to protect it. Was it a little strange in
the second half?  
ZOI SIMMONS: Not really. We just had to, you know, keep focused. Because
during the second, you know, half, we were always, you know, going down, like,
by 5 or 10. We always lose it. We had to just, you know, keep focusing and
play hard.  
  
Q. You were making a lot of shots in the first half. Wyoming wasn't. What
were you doing defensively to really shut them down in the first half?  
AMAKA UZOMAH: In the first half, we had to play them straight up. It was every
man for themselves to play them straight up and not to sag off of them,
because they all can shoot. Wyoming is a great offensive team. They can play
ball. We also had to cut off baseline and help each other out as teammates. At
the same time we play them straight up, you've got to be there and help. That
was our game plan.  
ZOI SIMMONS: Our main focus was on defense and just, you know, run on them,
mainly just transition.  
  
Q. Amaka, Kristen said some of those shots going down for you in the first
half are ones she normally doesn't let you take. What gave you the confidence
to take them and then make them?  
AMAKA UZOMAH: I really don't know. Like, I guess, after the first two, because
the first two were post shots, my third one, when I made that turnaround
jumper, I just told myself, if I'm going to shoot, if I'm going to come out
and stay focused, I've got to come out with confidence and show my teammates
I'm there for them. If I have to make a jumper, I got to make sure I stay
there, which I did. I usually fade away and stay back on defense. I stayed,
held my follow through. When I made it, I looked at her, It went in. Then went
back on defense (laughter).  
I had confidence in that shot, though.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss the student-athletes. We'll open it
up for questions for Coach Holt. Thank you, ladies.  
  
Q. Kristen, what happened to Britney and will she be able to play
tomorrow?  
COACH HOLT: I just visited her in the training room. She's going to have to
have a couple stitches. But other than that, I'm not sure. I know she ran into
one of our players. I think she ran into Kim, because Kim had a cut on her
elbow.  
I think she says she's going to be okay.  
  
Q. We thought she broke her nose. What did she do?  
COACH HOLT: She could have. They're going to take her and check it out and see
if indeed she did. She had a pretty good cut on her nose.  
  
Q. A cut?  
COACH HOLT: Right here, across her nose.  
  
Q. On the bridge?  
COACH HOLT: I think so. I didn't get a good look at her because they had her
all bandaged up.  
  
Q. Did you get the feeling this was like last year all over again when this
got going, the environment, the atmosphere? I know you're the head coach and
not the assistant. Did you feel some of that same energy as things got going
in the first half?  
COACH HOLT: Well, you know, I don't think about last year too much. I was just
really pretty happy with the way we started the game and how we came out so
quick. There's been a lot of games this year where we haven't been able to do
that.  
Then to be able to kind of hang on to it, because, again, I thought in the
second half they made some adjustments. We came out a little flat, were
missing short. I was concerned that when we started missing shots, that maybe
our confidence would let down and maybe we'd give up. I took a timeout to try
to get them focused.  
My team's a lot about keeping 'em focused and keeping 'em working hard and if
we can do that, not that every team doesn't try to do that, but if we can do
that, we can be in a ballgame. That was kind of the whole purpose of today, is
we just really knew we had to come out with great energy and focus, because
Wyoming is a very good team. They've handled us both times that we played them
this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH HOLT: You're welcome.

### [Jamie Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19396)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

UNLV  66  
BYU - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: The student-athletes with us are Jamie Smith and Shamela
Hampton. Coach Kathy Olivier. Coach, we'll start out with some general
comments and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH OLIVIER: Well, I thought our team did a great job. We were very focused,
a lot of intensity out there tonight. You know, we talked about it throughout
the season when we lost to BYU at home, then we played them in a very, very
close battle on the road, and we said, We hope we play them again.  
Our wish came true. We really stepped up to the plate with a great deal of
intensity and a great deal of focus. It was a total team effort.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jamie, you had a double-double in your first Mountain West tournament
game. What was your preparation going into your first playoff game as an UNLV
Rebel?  
JAMIE SMITH: I think the whole team just focused up. Like coach had said, we
had the mentality of going in there and getting them back for losing to them
twice during the season.  
As a whole, like we always just focus all together. And when we all go in
there, we do our warmups. That's pretty much the preparation. It's like any
other game.  
  
Q. Jamie, they cut it to three, then you grabbed a key rebound, hit a three.
Can you talk about how critical that stretch was.  
JAMIE SMITH: Uhm, well, it was critical, like, for our team just to get that
momentum swing. Getting the rebound was just a team effort. We all boxed out.
I'm just the one that happened to grab it. Coming down, E did a nice
penetration, which opens it up for me. That was to E, too. I think that was
crucial for momentum because we started to get on the downward spiral, so we
needed to pick that up, and we did. That gave us a little bit more momentum to
even get ahead a little bit more. It went our way in the next couple minutes.  
  
Q. When you have a freshman like this, you have the intentional call, she's
the one to step in and push you back, she obviously is the one to have key
plays, rebounds and shots, you saw it all year, but talk about when you first
saw her play here, and has anything she's done surprised you? Tonight, would
it surprise you she did what she did tonight?  
SHAMELA HAMPTON: When Jamie first got here, she worked hard. She was one of
the consistent players we had on our team. In practice, we was like, Okay, we
have Jamie Smith coming in for us. She was a great rebounder. I was like,
Coach, she can help us out a lot. That's what she did. I'm not surprised at
all. She's a hard worker, consistent, does what it takes to help this team.
I'm glad she's my teammate.  
  
Q. Seeing as your next two opponents are TCU, and if you beat them, San
Diego State, both teams that beat you at home, is this like the UNLV revenge
tour 2009?  
SHAMELA HAMPTON: Uhm, that's funny that you mention that. Coach said that once
we beat BYU, we have a chance of playing -- getting back at TCU for it.  
So I think this is the opportunity for us to show our conference, that we're
here to play in a conference. I think you could call it a payback.  
  
Q. When the game got tight, did you start thinking about the two previous
games with BYU?  
SHAMELA HAMPTON: I thought about it as a senior. I could talk about that. Like
we played them, like coach mentioned, close at home. It is kind of -- felt
like déjà vu a little bit. I kept my leadership going and made my teammates
believe we could win this on our home court. I think my coach could speak on
that.  
JAMIE SMITH: Actually, I had pretty strong confidence in our team. Especially
since Shamela is such a great leader, she would always step up. We always do
those team huddles, if you notice, if anything is not going our way. In those
team huddles, we have E telling us to come on, one of our top leaders telling
us to come on. That's confidence for the rest of the younger players on the
team, everybody in general.  
I think that her being such a great leader helps when we are going on a down
spiral.  
  
Q. You did combined for 20 rebounds in this game. How do you feel you
compare with TCU's front court, dominating the way you did against BYU
tonight?  
SHAMELA HAMPTON: Rebounding, coach put poster boards everywhere, in our locker
room, in our lounge, everywhere. She told us that we had to rebound to win
games. I think this is the key for us, in the Mountain West Conference, box
out and rebound. We have to do the same with TCU tomorrow, rebound, rebound,
work hard. I think we'll get a win tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss the student-athletes and we'll open
it up to questions for Coach Olivier.  
  
Q. Coach, at the last game we asked about the foul situation. This time 30
minutes into the game you only had fouled four times the whole game. Do you
feel that was one of your main points of emphasis for this game this time?  
COACH OLIVIER: Well, as you heard Shamela, it was about rebounding. We were
doing subliminal messages throughout the locker room about rebounding,
rebounding, rebounding. So it was more about that.  
As far as the foul situation, we did a very good job. We played a lot of zone,
which allowed us to be a little more aggressive and not get in as many foul
situations.  
We just did a very good job. We were extremely focused. They were very, very
coachable. We did a great job tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, Hampton's free throws really seemed to be the difference. Was
there a different technique? Was she fortunate?  
COACH OLIVIER: I thought that was going to be one of the first questions
tonight. Again, they were so focused. I mean, in that dressing room, we were
in the locker room before the game, you could just tell. They were sitting on
the edge of their seats, their eyes were big. We always thought we were good
free throw shooters, but with that extra focus, they just got it done. For us
to shoot over 80% from the free-throw line, it's a great day to be a Rebel.  
Shamela, again, she was not going to be denied. She had a great deal of
intensity going.  
  
Q. You mentioned the zone. When you played in Provo, that zone brought you
back in the game. Did that show you that's what it took to beat this team?  
COACH OLIVIER: Again, we didn't want to send them to the free-throw line.
They're a very aggressive team. We thought if we could make them shoot some
outside shots and make sure that we rebound, which we again did, then we could
play with them.  
We just did a great job with the game plan. My staff did a great job preparing
'em. We just brought it home.  
  
Q. Compare the TCU playing style with BYU's playing style and how much of a
change you will have to make to the game plan on one day's notice.  
COACH OLIVIER: Again, when you're in conference tournament time, you've seen
these teams. For a team, when you were asking about preparation, what did you
do differently, I mean, it's the end of the year. They're feeling more and
more comfortable with the staff, more and more comfortable with each other,
more and more confident as we go along.  
TCU, did they beat us at their place? Yes. They crushed us at their place.
They beat us at home. But it was a close game. We battled. I feel like our
team feels like we can compete with anyone. We did that the other day against
San Diego State, who is a great team. They're going to get into the NCAA
tournament. I think TCU belongs in the tournament, too. They're a great
basketball team, too.  
If we can come in with the same kind of focus and with that same kind of
intensity we did tonight, I think it's going to be a game. I think both teams
are going to battle. Both teams are going to come to battle. TCU, great coach.
They have some great players. Their point guard does an unbelievable job
setting up the rest of the team. We're just gonna have to battle. We'll use
some zone, some man, mix it up. I'm sure they'll do the same.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach.

### [Kim Kreke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19380)

### [Ardie McInelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13836)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

New Mexico  84  
Air Force - 41

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Air Force. First we'll take a quick statement
on the game from Coach McInelly.  
COACH McINELLY: It's kind of been typical of what we've done all year. We
played in spurts of the game. We found ourselves doing that again. I thought
for the first 10 minutes, we were playing, competing very well. The next 10
minutes, even though we shot well, 42% in the first half, we gave up too many
three-point shots. Amy Beggin went to town on us. We got down by 20 points in
the first half. It's pretty tough to come back on a team like New Mexico in
the second half when you're down 20 points.  
But our players gave it, you know, they made a good effort the last 10 minutes
of the game and I'm very proud of our young women. We didn't win a lot of
games. I was quoted as saying this before. Our seniors will be very
successful. Our team will continue to be successful even though we didn't have
a successful season. But these young women, they come out and they work hard
every single day. I'm very proud to be their coach.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Liz, how difficult was it? This was going to be a tough team to beat
anyway. I think you had 15 turnovers. Especially the offensive rebounds they
got, how difficult did that make it on you guys?  
LIZ DUNSWORTH: Well, New Mexico is a very tough team. They were just able --
it seemed like every time we went to the boards, they were just there first.  
KIM KREKE: It's definitely tough for us to get to the boards. You know, it's
something that our team will work on next year. The girls will get better next
year.  
This is an off year. But it's not like we didn't work hard on rebounding. It's
not like we didn't work hard on our offensive skills. We'll put our hard work
to use in the off-season. The juniors, sophomores and freshmen will get
better. Air Force will change as a program. They'll get better.  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank
you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Same question. The turnovers and the offensive rebounds, how much of that
hurt you?  
COACH McINELLY: Well, it hurts quite a bit. As I said, we were playing right
with them in the first half. They had nine offensive rebounds in the first
half. That was a very telltale sign.  
We also, you know, had -- well, I think we only had five turnovers in the
first half. In the second half we had much more. Sometimes you start playing
tight, you start trying to force things. You know, we are young. Sometimes we
don't read the defense. It's just about, you know, film work. Sometimes we're
making the pass to the wrong side of the defense and they're tipping it away.  
Because of our youth and inexperience, I think that was certainly exploited
today. Don Flanagan and his staff, they do a heck of a job there at New
Mexico. They've got a very good balance of young women. As you can look at
their stats going into the game, of course Amy Beggin, she's someone that you
have to stop. You have Hartill, then eight or 20 other people that score.
Well, not 20, but it seems like it (laughter).  
They're scoring anywhere from six to eight points. I think they have good
balance. Not like they have to have a go-to player. As I said, Kim alluded to
it earlier, our young kids will continue to learn, continue to do those
things. We will get better.  
But, you know, it's the seniors' last game. I felt bad. Dana Loveless didn't
get to play. She's been out with an ACL all year. Brooke is not a hundred
percent. She has a knee problem, as well. Who knows. She may be getting a
surgery after the season. And Kim, she's a kid that just gave it her all the
whole time.  
We ran out of gas, ran out of people, but we certainly didn't run out of
heart. Because of that, I love our kids. I know it has nothing to do with the
game. But I just want to thank everybody, wish the rest of the teams the best
of luck.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Colorado State  64  
Wyoming - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: Student-athletes for Wyoming, Megan McGuffey and Hillary
Carlson. Coach Joe Legerski. Coach, if you would start off with some general
comments on the game.  
COACH LEGERSKI: I think in general today Colorado State came out with a great
deal of energy early. I thought they really attacked the basket. They were
quicker in transition. We just had to respond from that.  
It's very difficult to continually battle from behind. I thought that as far
as Wyoming is concerned, we left too many plays out there on the floor today
that in tournament play you need to make - none bigger than about 1 minute 40
to go. I believe we're down 6 and we don't come up with a rebound off a missed
free throw, then we don't foul again and come up with the second one. Those
are plays that you have to make to be in basketball games.  
But I thought the theme today was CSU's energy and how much they attacked the
basket.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Megan, you have played from behind this year and been able to come back,
get some big wins. How much harder is it to do it in a situation like this,
with the tournament, trying to beat your rival for the third time in a
season?  
MEGAN McGUFFEY: Yeah, like coach Joe was saying, CSU came out with a great
amount of energy. They were just the aggressors the whole game. So, you know,
it's hard to play on your heels when they're playing on their toes the whole
game.  
Yeah, unfortunately we couldn't come back.  
  
Q. What about in the first half, you just had a hard time making baskets.
You mentioned the energy. Was it that energy that caused you to miss a lot of
shots or were they doing something defensively?  
MEGAN McGUFFEY: Uhm, I don't know. I guess we're a young team. You know,
sometimes those shots don't fall. Wish they would have now.  
But, you know, CSU just kind of put us out of our comfort zone. We weren't
getting our feet set. You know, sometimes those shots don't fall.  
  
Q. Joe was talking about the rebounds at the end. What made it so hard,
especially on those free throws? What did they do to make it hard for you to
rebound all day?  
HILLARY CARLSON: Uhm, I kind of think they were really intense. They have
really big girls. They're really good rebounders. It gets hard at times.  
Just couldn't come up with it.  
  
Q. Megan, I know this possibly could be your last game. What kind of
feelings are you going through right now with this situation?  
MEGAN McGUFFEY: I guess it's pretty hard to articulate at this point. But I've
said all along, I'm really proud of the fact that I came to the University of
Wyoming. I'm really thankful that coach Joe gave me a scholarship to play
here.  
I don't want to end it like this. I hope we get another shot. But it's kind of
up in the air right now. But, like I said, just really proud to play with all
these girls and play for someone like coach Joe. It's been a good experience.  
  
Q. Hillary, doesn't help right now, but how big was it for you to get some
experience in a tournament like this? Maybe you can look back at this game a
year or two from now.  
HILLARY CARLSON: Yeah, definitely. I mean, we had freshmen, sophomores there
in the game the whole time. It definitely helps for our team next year, to get
this experience, you know.  
  
Q. Hillary, Amaka, some of the shots she made in the first half she said
were shots that coach tells her not to even take. Did she surprise you with
some of the offensive play she had?  
HILLARY CARLSON: At times, yes. We scouted her, noticed she's a driver. So you
kind of give her her space. You know she's going to drive at you. For her to
hit those shots, that's great on her part. Working to change her game a little
bit, so...  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss the student-athletes. Thank you,
ladies.  
We'll open it up for questions for Coach Legerski.  
  
Q. I know it's kind of a helpless feeling when you're not making shots.
You've gone through this this season before. Was it pretty helpless in that
first half?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I think it is, yeah. You take a look at the last two games,
we're 1 of 29 from three-point range. You're not going to win very many games,
if any, shooting 1 of 29 from three.  
You have to be able to use that. I think, you know, we get players in position
to make plays. I came into this game knowing that Colorado State had more
tournament experience than we did on the floor with their victories last
season. We're out there with a couple of freshmen, Emma, Kristen, that I
thought did a great job. This is Hillary's first time to step out on
tournament play. Those are some challenges for those kids.  
Once again, I can think of one play where we got a steal and the lay-in. That
gets very frustrating. First half, we were 8 for 13 from the free-throw line.
Those are things that I think at times you have to step up and make those
plays, whether it's at the line or from the field.  
  
Q. You mentioned that free throw. It happened twice actually. What were they
doing to box out there and to keep it hard on the boards?  
COACH LEGERSKI: At times it's the way the ball bounces. I'll go back and look
at the film to see if we missed a checkout. You take a look at the players we
had out there. They're putting a lot of minutes to try to come from behind.
You never know if somebody takes a moment off at the line where they just
relax for a split second. Those are the things that determine a game. Those
are small plays that have a big impact. I thought Colorado State made the
plays. That's what you need to do to get a victory at tournament time. I give
credit for them because they came up with two big ones about 1 minute 40 to
go.  
  
Q. How realistic, any chance at all for you to go on? What do you hear? I
know before this tournament somebody mentioned something about a possible NIT
bid.  
COACH LEGERSKI: What I've come to understand is that we've gone to post-season
the last three years. There were times I thought we were going to the NCAA
tournament, and we went to the NIT tournament. There were times when we
thought we were going to go to the NIT and we didn't go.  
The interesting part about post-season play is that you have to step out on
the floor and put yourself in a position that makes it difficult for a
committee to make a decision to leave you out.  
Whether we've done that or not, I don't know. I'm proud of this group. When
you graduate the senior class that we lost, and we lose our starting point
guard in September, all of a sudden I got a brand-new back court. To have a
winning season with a brand-new back court in this league? Once again, 8-8,
fifth in the league, this is a disappointing day for us today. You have to
reflect back on what this group has accomplished and how difficult it is for
them to continue to, once again, have a winning season.  
This is the fifth consecutive winning season for Wyoming. No Wyoming group has
ever done that. Megan, Elizabeth and Rebecca ended up tying the most victories
in a career. That's a tremendous effort by a group.  
Whatever happens post-season, I just know that what they've accomplished this
season, I'm very happy with. Disappointed today, you bet. I'm always
disappointed when we don't come out victorious. But I'm very happy with what
this group accomplished.  
  
Q. The same question I asked Hillary. What will this day mean for them, the
young players, whether they make it to the post-season or not?  
COACH LEGERSKI: When I look at the young group, what we talk about in the
locker room is, you have to build from this day, and it starts right away. You
can't show back up in September and expect to play at a very high level
without putting the time and effort in.  
It's difficult being a Division I athlete. It never stops. And that's what
these young players have to learn. I know they're tired. For Kristen, Emma,
they played more basketball this year than they probably played in the last
two years combined. For Hillary to get that opportunity, I thought she
established herself as a tremendous force on the inside for Wyoming, which we
have not had in the past.  
So we're gonna keep working at it. If a phone call comes for post-season, it
comes. If it doesn't, we just go back to work. That's what we do, keep
building on what we have. We've never finished less than fifth in the six
years I've been at Wyoming. I'm very proud of that and the accomplishments we
continue to make and strive for at Wyoming.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

New Mexico  84  
Air Force - 41

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by New Mexico. We'll begin with an opening
statement by Coach Flanagan, general remarks about the game, then we'll let
you ask questions of the student-athletes.  
Coach.  
COACH FLANAGAN: Well, we know Air Force plays hard. Sometimes they don't have
as much height or as much talent as some of the teams, but they're always
going to give a hundred percent. They really played hard. We had to match that
intensity. I thought that's one of the things, was our goal, was to match
their intensity.  
We seemed to shoot pretty well against them. I thought our defense was
excellent. Amy got us off to a great start, hitting her three-point shots.
They were mixing up their defense with a zone and a man. I thought we did a
pretty good job of adjusting to that. We stuck basically to our man-to-man
defense.  
I had an opportunity to play a lot of different people, which is probably a
good thing in a tournament like this, especially if your goal is to play four
games. So we got everybody in. I thought a lot of people played well. Just two
of the players that played well are up here, but I thought a lot of our team
played well.  
So I thought it was a good start for us. We felt good the way we started this
tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll open it up for questions to the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Amy, were you surprised at all when you were making your threes that Air
Force stayed in the zone for pretty much the entire first half?  
AMY BEGGIN: Well, I thought we were moving the ball really well. My teammates
were doing a great job passing. I mean, we struggled with some zones earlier
this year. I mean, the last couple games we've been playing really well with
it. I just give that credit to my teammates for finding me when I was open.  
  
Q. Amy, the first half, it seemed like you were able to get pretty much
anything you wanted offensively. How good did that feel?  
AMY BEGGIN: It felt really good. We really wanted to get out to a good start
in this tournament and just kind of get our nerves a little bit in check. I
thought we did a great job coming out and starting the game strong.  
We had a good start to this tournament.  
  
Q. Jessica, basically the bench really contributed a lot of points. Is that
something you're trying to emphasize in this tournament?  
JESSICA KIELPINSKI: I think so. We'll play four games to get to the
championship. Uhm, I think that you need to keep your players in the game and
going in off the bench, the beginning games, it helps to build your
confidence. If going in in the early games is going to help you going through
the end games, I think.  
  
Q. Coming into this tournament, knowing it's as wide open as it is, so many
quality clubs, the mindset of you guys individually, collectively, if you get
together as a team without coaches around, the mindset knowing that every
game, every possession, every half has to be critical.  
AMY BEGGIN: Yeah, definitely. It's kind of a cliché. We really do want to take
it one game at a time, try and focus on each opponent we're playing. The third
time we're playing a team, so it doesn't really come down to scouting reports
as much any more. Just executing the little things, getting after those loose
balls, just hitting some shots when you're open. It's just a matter of
determination at this point of the season.  
JESSICA KIELPINSKI: I agree. Just coming together all at the end of the season
is the main time you all need to come together.  
We all are coming to play at our peak. I think we're really clicking right
now.  
  
Q. Jessica, did you think Amy had to come out in the first half? She scored
18. Do you think that helped you out a lot in the second half?  
JESSICA KIELPINSKI: I think it did help us a lot. But I don't think that she
had to come out. I think that other people, like we all were ready to take our
shots. Amy, honestly, she was ready. She had all those shots. I think it gave
us a huge boost going into the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this
time.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Flanagan.  
  
Q. Last year at this time, this would have been a playing game day.
Obviously a first-round game. Do you think you get more out of this game than
you would if you just had a hard practice today?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Yeah, obviously. I think probably the most important thing
right now is playing in a tournament and having success. So, you know, playing
any opponent is excellent for you. And if you have some success, you win that
game, you feel more comfortable in the tournament.  
I think feeling comfortable in a tournament is probably as important as any
preparation that you could have.  
  
Q. A lot of the season you have been dependent on Amy. How important was it
to get her some rest in the second half in preparation for the
quarterfinals?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Yeah, you know, I didn't give her any rest the first half. We
had a nice cushion. I was really hoping that the first four minutes of the
second half we could expand that lead a little bit and then I could get her
out, which eventually happened.  
And I thought Amanda Best, as soon as I got Amy out, I thought Amanda played
very well at the point. She's not accustomed to playing the point. She ended
up with 11 rebounds, 8 points, played really well.  
Amy wasn't getting back in. So it's really important that we get Amy a rest.
But, you know, I think probably the most important thing is we got everybody a
rest. I don't think anybody played more than 25 minutes.  
  
Q. Did you think Amy was going to go off like that in the first half?  
COACH FLANAGAN: I don't know. You know, she's had her moments. She's a big-
game player. Usually during the regular season somebody was just nose to nose
with her. So she doesn't get a lot of looks.  
They gave her some looks. If she gets a pretty good look, she's pretty
accurate with her shot.  
  
Q. How good do you feel right now about your team in terms of where it needs
to be in a one-and-done kind of tournament, in light of the fact there are
four or five quality clubs that could win this thing, including you guys?  
COACH FLANAGAN: I'm glad we're included in that now. I thought some people
were discounting us (smiling).  
I think that getting started like that is encouraging. I feel pretty
comfortable right now that we can play well. We need a lot of people to play
well, but at the same time I think we might be playing our best basketball
right now, or at least being as comfortable as we've been and as poised as
we've been all year long.  
I certainly think this is a very good team. I think they're capable - and
we'll talk about it one game at a time. I think the most important thing now
is focus on your next opponent. There's a lot of good teams out there. There's
a bunch of good teams. I'm not talking about the first three either. There's
some good teams that are playing this game and the following game.  
  
Q. You just alluded to it. You said a lot of people had discounted you,
which is kind of odd considering you are back-to-back tournament champions.
How has the team embraced that new role?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Well, I think, you know, we have had some players playing in
this tournament and have won this tournament before. In fact, several have
been involved in winning this tournament. So I think they feel comfortable
playing here in this environment.  
So let's just see how we play. But I feel good. You know, sometimes as a coach
you have some worries about certain positions, whether you can match up and
things like that. I thought today we proved, through lots of players, that we
can match up pretty well with most teams.  
Now, I realize Air Force is not one of the better teams in the conference. But
they play very, very hard. I thought the way we played them showed that, with
so many of our players playing well, that was encouraging.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH FLANAGAN: You're welcome.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Connecticut  76  
Louisville - 54

  
AMY YAKOLA: Pleased to be joined up here at the podium by Louisville head
coach Jeff Walz, as well as student-athletes Angel McCoughtry, Deseree' Byrd
and Candyce Bingham.  
Coach, when you're ready, an opening statement, please.  
COACH WALZ: Yes, ma'am. First, I'd just like to congratulate Geno and his
staff and all of his kids for a game well played.  
You know, it's one of those when you sit there and you look at it as the game
was unfolding, we did a lot of good things. We had the tempo of the game going
the way we wanted it to go. Unfortunately, we just, you know, missed some
shots we normally make.  
And, you know, it's the big stage. It's our first time playing in a
championship game. And I felt really good going into the game. The first five
minutes, again, was the one I was most concerned about, and I thought we came
out and Angel hits the first 3, they come down and score, then we score again.  
I mean, we went back and forth and I felt really good about things. And then
we just started to rush some shots. Tina Charles did an outstanding job of
intimidating us. I thought she made us alter a lot of shots that we really
didn't need to alter.  
And, you know, we couldn't -- we had no answer for her. I mean, she's the one
I told you all two days ago that I was most concerned about. She's so active
in the post. We can defend post players that like to stay on the block and
just try and post up, because we've got some kids that will work and battle
and fight to do that.  
But what she does so well is she just moves from block to block so quick that
at her size we have a hard time trying to keep up with her. And then when you
can't throw a 6-4 body at her, it just makes it really difficult for us to
slow her down. And, I mean, the kid gets 25 and 19. I'm not sure you can do
much better than that.  
But with all that said, I am really proud of this group of kids. No one
expected us to be here. No one really gave us much of a chance in this game.
But I thought we fought. I thought we competed. And unfortunately it just did
not go our way. And those are the things you're going to have to deal with. So
that's it.  
AMY YAKOLA: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Des, I know it's a difficult moment, but when you look back on this whole
experience, what will you think about?  
DESEREE' BYRD: Me, I'm just blessed. I'm blessed to be here. Just coming from
where I'm from, I'm just blessed to be here, again, with these two girls on my
left and right. I mean, it's still an amazing feeling to be here, like you
said. Unfortunately, we came out with a loss, but I'm blessed. I'm truly
blessed.  
  
Q. Candyce, just talk about you guys, the shots, like Coach said some shots
you normally would hit just didn't fall for a good stretch of that first
half.  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: I mean, yeah, just shots that we normally would make or we
practice every day in practice, and we just didn't make them. I guess we just,
like Coach said, got a little intimidated, just didn't concentrate. She just
altered some shots. We usually make those and we didn't.  
  
Q. Angel, can you tell us what is it that -- the emotion you take away from
this? Is it pride? Is it disappointment after the way you guys played in this
game versus the game the last time you faced them in the Big East
championship?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: We have nothing to be disappointed about. We're going to
hold our heads up high, and we're grateful to be here. Unfortunately, we
couldn't come out and be national champions. But we have so much to be proud
of. And they're going to be a great squad next year. I'm excited to see them
next year. We're just going to hold our heads up high.  
  
Q. Angel, after your hot start, did they run a lot of different defensive
looks at you?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I mean, if they did it wasn't nothing I wasn't used to
already. I know they switched it up, went 3-1 a little bit, then they went
back to man. But it was nothing I wasn't used to.  
  
Q. Angel, I think you scored 10 of the first 15 points. Was it a mission of
yours to get the team going quickly and to come out that quickly?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I just wanted to help us keep up, because they can score so
fast. But the main thing is also get the teammates involved, and that's
another thing too, to get my teammates involved. So it's just a matter of we
just wanted to win.  
  
Q. Just for any or all of you, what has these few days been like with the
number of fans that you've had here and the number of people that you've
probably drawn to the program just through all of this?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: Words really can't describe. It's a really great feeling. I
mean, unbelievable feeling. I mean, I'm sure we probably had more than -- you
know, tonight than we did the other night. And just seeing all the fans at the
hotel just cheering us on, and I'm sure we'll still have more when we get back
there and others, but, I mean, it's just a really good feeling.  
  
Q. Angel, you talked about the TV thing a little bit and about not wanting
to be viewed as underdogs. Through the course of this tournament, particularly
making to it the championship game, do you feel now like you've shown why the
program deserves respect?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: Oh, yeah. I definitely believe we've shown why we need some
respect. And I know people are going to -- next year they're going to look at
the schedule and say, Look, we've got to play Louisville. It's going to make a
big difference next year as well.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Jeff, what does it say that a team can go through an entire season and no
one gets -- every win is by double figures?  
COACH WALZ: They're pretty good. I'm not sure what you want me to say. They're
a great basketball team. I said it the other day. I'll say it again today.
They've got three State Farm All-Americans on it. There's 10 of those players
selected each year. They have three of them. That's pretty darned good.  
And Geno does a great job with them. He gets them to play as hard as any team
we've played against. And it's just a tribute to him and what he gets his kids
to do.  
  
Q. Coach, you were called for a technical after Candyce Bingham scored a
basket. What was it that you were objecting to on that play?  
COACH WALZ: I was a little concerned with the amount of contact that happened
on the shot before that. I think Mo may have actually scored on that. I think
Candyce went up or went up for the first shot. And I just thought there was a
lot of body contact.  
And I just tried to voice my displeasure, and they obviously didn't like it,
which is okay.  
  
Q. Was it your strategy to try to ride Angel today?  
COACH WALZ: You know, no, not really. We came out and our first thought was
when they put Renee Montgomery on Des was to go flat for Des and let her back
her down.  
And Des got six great looks to start the game that she normally makes. She's
not your typical point guard, has some good size to her, can back you down,
and normally makes that little turnaround jump shot. Then she split it once
and had a layup, and unfortunately we couldn't get one of those to go.  
And then we came out and we ran some things for Angel, and she was patient and
stayed within the offense. And I thought she did a very good job.  
  
Q. Coach, it's pretty remarkable for you to have gotten as far as you have
after just a year or two at that school. Is there anything existing at
University of Connecticut that doesn't exist at Louisville to keep you from
doing exactly what Geno's done there at UConn, and is that sort of your goal
to have a consistent team that's going to be here every year?  
COACH WALZ: I think that's every coach's goal. That's why we do this. It all
comes down to players. I mean, you can be -- everybody wants to say you can X
and O and you can draw stuff up, but we drew the same stuff up tonight as we
did on Sunday night.  
Unfortunately, we just didn't make it. So, you know, we have to get out there
and continue to recruit. That's the biggest -- that's the most important
aspect of this game. If you don't get players, it doesn't matter what else you
do.  
So, you know, he continues. And Geno continues to get great players, and
that's why they're back here year after year. So our goal is go out there and
compete with them on the recruiting trail and hopefully get one or two away
from him and see if we can't continue to build this thing here. No problem.  
  
Q. Jeff, you had nine freshmen and sophomores play in this game. When you
look at the future, how valuable have these last three weeks been to that
group of players?  
COACH WALZ: It's been a great experience for all of them, to have the
opportunity to play in a national championship game, to make the run that we
did through the NCAA tournament as a freshman and a sophomore; should give us
a lot of confidence and a lot of excitement to carry over to next season.  
And, you know, that's one of the things that I challenged the returning
players with in the locker room after the game. We have to find out who our
leaders are going to be this spring and this summer to get in the gym when I
can't make them get in the gym.  
That's the difference between your great programs and your good programs,
because, I promise you, Maya Moore, Renee Montgomery weren't going to the
beach all summer. I mean, they spent hour after hour in the gym. You don't
become the players they are if you aren't a dedicated player.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you about the post game and what you said to the group
as a whole.  
COACH WALZ: I first just told our two seniors, Angel McCoughtry and Candyce
Bingham, I think both of them, to have the opportunity to have your first head
coaching job be with two players that are seniors like those two, they've made
my first two years very enjoyable. They've taken a lot of responsibility upon
themselves to be leaders. And that's what you need if you want to be a
successful program.  
Then, you know, I talked to our freshmen and sophomores, just talked to them
about the opportunity of getting back here. I told them the story: You know,
at Maryland we started two freshmen, two sophomores and one junior when we won
a national championship in 2006. And everybody thought this is easy. We'll get
back here every year. And, unfortunately, you know, those kids never made it
back to a Final Four.  
So you've got to get in the gym and you've got to be willing to work every
single day so you can get back to this. And I'm hoping our freshmen and
sophomores heard that, because it's tough.  
I mean, I got a really nice text from Marissa Coleman today wishing us luck.
And I know how bad that young lady hurt after our game in the Elite Eight. And
it's a feeling that I hope our kids don't have to experience. But it's one
that you can't take for granted the opportunity to get here and you can't take
for granted you'll ever get back here either.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been staying with them throughout the first ten minutes of
the first half, and there was a lot of motion and energy in your offense at
that point. From that point forward throughout the first half seemed like you
were settling more into half-court sets and sort of a lot of standing around.
Was that a fatigue factor setting in or was there something different they
were throwing at you?  
COACH WALZ: There wasn't a fatigue factor. They weren't throwing anything
different at us. When I look at the game and I watch the game, I actually
thought we got some really, really good shots and missed some 1- and
2-footers.  
Yeah, our goal was to try to run with the ball when we had numbers at our
advantage or if we got a steal off of our press. But if we didn't, our goal
was to run the shot clock down and try and cut the game down to possession by
possession.  
Like I said, we got really good looks. I was proud of our kids for the way we
executed. But, unfortunately, we just could not put the ball in the basket.  
  
Q. Coach, I just want to ask you about Deseree' Byrd. And we've seen all
week that this is a young lady with an awful lot of pride. Just lost what has
to be a very devastating game, and she shot 1-for-10. And instead of sitting
there with her shoulders slumped over and instead of making excuses she sat up
straight and looked us in the eye and said "I'm blessed" after shooting
1-for-10 and losing a game that must have been so difficult for her.   
COACH WALZ: That's just the way all our kids are, Des included. It's like I've
told you from day one, we're honest in our program. And, you know, it hurt
Des. There's no question. I know she wanted to play a lot better. But she
played hard.  
And I told her before the game started, if we can come in the locker room
after the game and look each other in the eye and say I gave it everything I
had, then that's all you can ask for. And I thought Des did. I thought all the
kids did.  
Unfortunately, the ball just did not go in the basket for us. You have those
games. And you just really don't want it to be your national championship
game, but it happens. For us to get a 68 field goals attempted, 10 more than
they attempted, and we get 19 offensive boards and only turn the ball over
nine times, I mean, you look at the stat line, and we played a pretty damn
good game. Unfortunately, we just didn't make them.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you, Coach.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Connecticut  76  
Louisville - 54

  
AMY YAKOLA: Pleased to be joined up here on the podium by Connecticut head
coach Gene Auriemma as well as student-athletes Renee Montgomery, Tina Charles
and Maya Moore.  
Coach, when you're ready.  
COACH AURIEMMA: The worst part about doing something like this is you have to
be asked what it feels like. Now, I'm not saying it's because we don't want to
say what it feels like, it's just you can't put into words what it feels like.  
This is the first time since the brackets came out that I don't feel like I'm
going to get sick, physically sick, thinking about everything that was ahead
of us.  
And I told these guys in the locker room, ever since 1995 and the team went
35-0 at Connecticut, every team after that was compared to the 35-0 team and
they couldn't handle it. They didn't want to handle it.  
And after that 2002 team, every team was compared to that team. And now this
year, after these guys ran off a bunch of wins, they had to live with the
whole aura of going undefeated and winning a national championship at
Connecticut.  
And then the more we won by, the margin of victories kept getting bigger and
the more it was expected that, well, of course they're going to win. Of course
they're the best team ever. Of course, of course, of course.  
Well, there's nothing that I'm more proud of than the fact that especially
these three came in every day from September 1st until today and gave me
everything they had every single day. And, like I told them, I hope I gave
them as much back, and tonight we gave you the best of what we got.  
AMY YAKOLA: Questions for student-athletes.  
  
Q. Renee, just describe the feeling for you guys to put in all the work all
year and to come out like this tonight?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: It feels great. I mean, it's hard to believe just because
when preseason was going on -- preseason was so hard. And I'm like, oh, my
goodness, we haven't even played a game yet. And then you get to practice and
the practices before the game and that's even worse.  
And it's just, you think, okay, we need to win 39 games to get there. It seems
like forever away, and now I'm actually sitting here and we won 39 games. And,
I don't know, it's just really hard to explain because it's something you
wanted so bad and a lot of people I don't think get to feel the feeling when
you want something really bad and you work hard for it and then actually get
it.  
I think that's one of the best feelings, that it wasn't, you know -- the
scores might have showed that we won by a lot, but it wasn't easy. And just to
work hard at something and win with people I love is the best feeling -- I
don't know how to explain it.  
  
Q. Tina, Coach was saying the other day that he believes that somewhere
inside you lies potentially the best player in the country, it's just a matter
of convincing you of that. After tonight's game, are you closer to being
convinced?  
TINA CHARLES: I was always convinced ever since I went to Connecticut that I
do have the potential to become the best center in the country if I wanted to
be. I just needed the players around me to help me, which they always do every
time I was in practice, and just having Coach in my ear, just pushing me all
the time.  
One of my first -- when I came to campus and -- on my unofficial visit, the
one thing I keyed in on was just Coach saying the only way you're going to
play is if you work hard, and that was something that was a challenge and I
just accepted it and went with it.  
  
Q. Renee, could you just comment on Tina's game tonight?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: She was great. Before we went out there, Coach told us we
needed to establish the post game. And I think she took it personally. She
really came out there and she played aggressively on both ends of the floor.
And I think that might be the best game I've seen her play in a long time, not
only because of the stats, but because how she carried herself and how she
scored. Even though she was getting fouls, she made sure she made the basket
anyways. And on defense she was trying to block all kinds of shots.  
I don't know, just the way she carried herself during the game was
unbelievable.  
  
Q. Tina, just to follow up exactly on what Renee said. I was going to ask,
you seemed like you were smiling the whole game on the court. You had a
demeanor like you were having a totally great time. Can you talk about how you
were feeling as the game was unwinding?  
TINA CHARLES: I felt great. It was always fun to come out and just play with
this team, specifically. The past two years I had fun, too, but just with this
team and how hard we worked since September, like Renee said. And just the
fact that it hit me that this is going to be my last time, like, playing in a
Connecticut jersey with Renee. So I wanted to have as much fun as possible.  
  
Q. Tina, a lot of kids dream of this stage, national championship on the
line. Your team needing you to come up big. Can you just try and describe your
emotions that your team needed you, Coach needed you, and you were able to
deliver at the most important time of your career?  
TINA CHARLES: You know, like I said, it was just another challenge, and I just
wanted to show my teammates that they could depend on me, and that was just
basically it. I just wanted to show that I'm going to send off Renee just
feeling happy and everything. She's about to be drafted, God willing, and
everything is going to go great for her. But I just wanted her to have all
smiles in the next step of her career.  
  
Q. Renee, you talked about how the beginning of the season, all the
expectations on you guys and you going through training camp and it was so
hard. I'm curious about all three of you. Now that all those expectations are
over, is the predominant emotion happiness or relief?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I think a little bit of everything. I think we can actually
finally like breathe. I feel like every time we've won something this year --
I'll start back in preseason. Salt and pepper won the challenge, but
everything we won, the Cancun tournament, the regular season, Big East, we
always couldn't be too excited because we have another game to follow up. We
can't dwell on that win because we have another game that we have to win.  
So I think this is the first time we actually can just stop and really enjoy
the win for more than a couple days. And I think that's just the biggest thing
that we can actually -- because I think the mentality of our team is we're
happy with what we did but we're always looking to the future. And now I think
we have, you know, time to enjoy this win and all the other ones.  
  
Q. Maya, with the team this close, what does it mean for you guys to
accomplish the ultimate goal together?  
MAYA MOORE: Like Renee said, just to be able to achieve this goal with people
that you love. I mean, I just -- I couldn't stop crying at certain points
because I was so happy to have won with every single one of my teammates. I
just really feel like this year we really just sacrificed and put each other
first and genuinely cared about each other.  
And that's the best way to win it, because if we were on a team that we didn't
really get along or we just came, did our work and went our separate ways, it
would be nice but it wouldn't feel as good as it does right now to have your
family up there with you and win it.  
That's why I came here. And when I signed, that's what I was hoping to get.
I'm just glad I got one and I was able to do it with these wonderful girls.  
  
Q. Maya, when Becky Burke hit a 3, made it a four-point game, Coach ripped
into you guys a little bit. You went on a defensive run, they didn't make
another field goal pretty much the rest of the half. Just run me through that
stretch in the first half, beginning of the second half and what you were able
to do to turn the game around defensively.  
MAYA MOORE: Anytime somebody scores on us or they do hit a 3-pointer,
especially, we really try to defend the 3-point line very well. It just fires
us up. I mean, we know that when another team scores, we want to drive it
right back at them.  
And usually when that happens, you know, Renee will push it in transition and
the next thing find Tina and we will get one in and we'll just keep thriving
on that momentum.  
I think it's a maturity, sign of maturity for our people to be able to have a
team come close and be battling with us the whole half and just be able to get
on spurts and get on runs like we were able to do. And that run right there
and the way we started off the second half was key to the margin of victory
that we ended up having.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you. Congratulations.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Geno, you mentioned yesterday that you couldn't remember wanting anything
as badly as you wanted the title for Renee. Could you just speak on that now
that she has one?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. When you've been fortunate enough as we've been to win
multiple national championships and to have a couple of undefeated teams, you
know it was because somewhere along that line there was probably a great guard
that defined who we were, because that's just the way it is.  
It's like if you win a Super Bowl, you probably have a quarterback that
defines the team. And every one of those players that were All-Americans and
great players had the same characteristics as Renee.  
And she did everything they did. She handled herself exactly the way they did.
She worked as hard as they did. Led as well as they led.  
So for a lot of them, it happened before their senior year. You think back to
all the great ones that we had, Jennifer and Sue and Di and, you know, all of
them, Shea, Svet, all of them, it happened before their senior year. By the
time their senior year came around, it was like, okay, well, whatever, if it
doesn't happen at least it happened once.  
But to have Renee go through three years and do what she did, the thought of
it not happening for her was just, honest to God, I've been ill. Doc said, Is
there anything I can give you? Yeah, I said, Give me a sleeping pill so I can
wake up when the game ends.  
I've never felt like I felt. You would have thought -- if you followed me
around the last two days, you would have thought that my team had no chance to
win. That's how -- it was incredible. And now I'm so speechless. I'm so
overwhelmed by how I feel about the way that it ended, that I feel like -- you
know what, I kept telling myself all day long today, I said, you know, look, I
know God loves everybody, and I know he's a benevolent God, and if for some
reason I've done something to offend him and he doesn't like me, don't take it
out on me. These kids deserve it. She deserves it. Even if I don't. Which I
don't care if I don't or not.  
But all I kept thinking about was, man, I do not want to get up tomorrow
morning with that feeling. I don't. And now I don't have to.  
  
Q. You said about two weeks ago how legends are made by winning national
champions. Did Tina cement herself as a UConn legend by her performance
tonight and the rest of the tournament?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, she's kind of like a legendary make a blockbuster movie
and now we're going to wait to see how she follows that up next year. That
kind of legendary.  
She's not Meryl Streep yet, but she is getting closer to where Tina wants to
be. And that's what I'm happy about. Tina's always wanted to be what she did
today. It's just that when she looked out there and said, Ooh, I'm not sure
she believed that she could do it.  
And it had to happen for her so that now she knows she can do it. And one of
the things we talked about was: You can't be a great player unless you play
great in this game right here. If you ever want to be called a great player,
you've got to play great in this game.  
And she did. I said, Go out and get a triple-double. Score as many points as
you want. Block as many shots as you want, go ahead. Play like you're the best
center in the country. And maybe I should have said that before every game
instead of going in there, Tina Charles, blah, blah, blah. Maybe she was
waiting for me to say that. I wish she would have sent me an e-mail or
something. I would have said it earlier.  
  
Q. Geno, when Renee was talking about the mentality of the team, always
looking ahead to the next game, in past experience of five national titles,
how much have you allowed yourself to enjoy it before you started to look
ahead to the next challenge? And the second part of the question is based on
what you've seen of Maya, Tina, the freshmen, what you know is coming next
year, do you think this team, the core of this team is capable of pulling off
a Taurasi-like kind of run over the next couple of years?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, as far as the enjoyment part, there have been wins that
I've enjoyed over the course of the season that I thought were really, really
special and really cool. There have been moments in practice that I thought
were really neat and I've gotten enjoyment out of it.  
Honest to God, the longer I'm doing this, the more I'm in this situation, the
harder it is to enjoy it while it's happening. But the better it feels after
the fact. So as we were going along on this ride, I'm constantly looking
around the corner to see what's next, so I'm not appreciating the scenery
along the way. And it's not until afterwards you look back and you go: Wow,
that was really cool. I'm glad we did that.  
And, yeah, for me, you know, I have a tendency to put the season behind me
immediately. Like starting tomorrow, I'm not going to be thinking about this
past season. I'm not going to be thinking about next season either.  
So I've got a couple months where I can just clear my head and think about
nothing. Come the middle of August, I'll be trying to figure out how we can do
the same exact thing next year. And the minute we lose our first game, I'll
start screaming at these guys: You're nowhere near as good as last year's
team, they were unbelievable. Because, I don't know, I can't get past looking
to the next thing.  
But having said all that, I do not ever want to burden these guys with what
Diana did. That's just too much. That's just too much. I think they're capable
of doing anything next year. But to sit here and think, you know what? Yeah,
we've got what it takes to win three in a row. Man, come see me like middle of
November. And by the middle of November I'll have a pretty good idea.  
  
Q. Geno, you said yesterday you were interested in finding out how that --
or before that, in fact, how the men's game would turn out given some similar
situations. A, to what extent did that, you know, soothe any concerns that you
had? And, B, what did you draw from that that did make you feel like, hey, you
know, things have a way of turning out the way you want them to?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, when I saw last night's game I thought, man, you know,
Michigan State just ran into a whirlwind. Carolina was the best team in the
country all year, just people forgot about them, a couple of injuries, a
couple of losses, but all year long everybody said Carolina was the best team,
and they proved it last night.  
And I kept thinking, I wonder how many times the best team in the country wins
the NCAA championship. Sometimes it's just the best team for six games or the
best team for one night. I thought, well, that's what's going to happen with
us. We're the best team in the country, we're going to win it. Then five
minutes later I like, nah, just too much coincidence that it would happen two
nights in a row. So you start to have like these jitters.  
But in '91 I went down and I touched Stan Musial's statue in the front of the
old Busch Stadium and he was only good for a half (laughter). So this time I
got them all. I got the whole crew down there, went all the way back, all the
way back. And I figured, you know what? Now I'm a true St. Louis guy. I got to
touch all the statues, rubbed all their heads. This was great.  
  
Q. Geno, I think the Yankees might be the only other team besides yours
where people can say, You haven't won in five whole years, what's wrong?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I know. I know.  
  
Q. My question is, since you have not won, did you start to doubt how you
did things, the players you were getting, are we doing something wrong,
anything like that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Uh-huh. It is kind of the most insane thing when you think
about it, that who knows what could have happened. With a little bit of luck
we could have won five in a row. We could have -- we could have eight or nine
by now. I don't know anybody else that's had the injuries we've had to their
great players.  
So with any kind of luck, we could be sitting here with eight or nine and all
that. I could be second to John Wooden. That's the way some -- although,
actually, you don't ever want to compare yourself to the men's coaches because
that's a completely different ball game.  
There came a point during the last four years that it really was about you
haven't won five national championships. As a matter of fact, you haven't won
one since 2004. And some people, including me, I would just as soon walk away
from that, because that means, you know, that there's not an appreciation for
what we did. But, again, that's the world we live in. That's the world we
created.  
And there was that four-year period where I really, four years? Five maybe? I
started to question a lot of things. I started to question our recruiting. I
started to question whether or not we had slipped in the way we prepared, the
way we did things in our office, preseason conditioning, practice, the way
practices were structured. I started to question everything, post-season
workouts. Whether I had it anymore. Whether our coaching staff had been too
stagnant.  
And, yet, every one of those years we were winning 30 games. Like in every one
of those years we won 30 games except one, if I'm not mistaken. I think
Renee's freshman year maybe, maybe we won 30 games all four of Renee's years
there. I don't even know. I know we lost in the final eight. Final eight
overtime. Final Four.  
And you're thinking, you know what, maybe it's just time to hang it up, we're
not any good. That's sad, isn't it? That's like going to the World Series five
years in a row and now winning it. Well, then you, you know, I don't want to
be called the Atlanta Braves. You know, you win the most games and you don't
win titles. People go -- like you're not any good, my point is. Like you're
not any good, you know? Even though you're really good.  
But that's the world we live in now. Nobody remembers our string of
accomplishments. They just remember you haven't won a national championship in
four years.  
But I'm glad I stayed.  
  
Q. If you still do not want to declare which of your teams was the best
ever, could you at least compare and contrast your undefeated teams in
approach and how they handled the pressure of what they did?  
COACH AURIEMMA: The first one had no idea what they were doing. As a matter of
fact, I just had this discussion with Jamele and Rebecca recently.  
The first one had no idea what they were doing. We got to Minneapolis. We
stayed so far from the Final Four, they didn't know there was a Final Four
going; they thought we were on a road trip and they were just going to play
two games.  
Then we played Saturday-Sunday. It's like, What are we doing here? Then we win
and we go home and there's people lining the streets of I-91 and kids are
going, It's like the O.J. chase, cops everywhere. Helicopters. It was
unbelievable. And it dawned on them that they had done something that was just
incredible.  
Then the 2002 team, they were so pissed about what happened in St. Louis in
2000, they actually thought the first day of practice, if we lose a game, it's
a disgrace. They actually thought that anybody that walked on the court that
really believed they should be on the same court with them was out of their
mind.  
And they played like it. This team, this team is young, fun-loving, enjoy each
other's company. They're fun to be around. They get a kick out of spending
time together, going to practice. And as it's all unfolding in front of them,
they're kind of like, yeah, everybody thinks this is like something big. Like
Renee said, we've got another game Wednesday, yeah, who do we play Saturday.  
And it wasn't until late, late, late in the season that they really started
bearing down on it. And that's when I think I started to see a different side
to them.  
But all three teams in and of themselves are separate, but they all had that
one quality that they were really, really tight together, loved each other for
the most part. And they were easy to coach. Really, really easy to coach.  
  
Q. Coach, I went and looked and saw that your first team at Connecticut
actually lost more games than it won. This did not happen automatically. This
did not happen by magic. It took a while to build the program to where you are
right now. I see schools where the administration has a commitment to women's
athletics and for whatever reason they don't win. I see very few that win that
really establish a standard of excellence that don't have the real commitment
from their university for that. Tell me a little bit about how University of
Connecticut has played a role in setting the standard of excellence that
you've got with your basketball team.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I think if a school wanted to win a national
championship right now, it would be a lot easier than in 1985 when I got the
job at Connecticut. When I got the job at Connecticut, 1985, the goal at
Connecticut was don't finish eighth or ninth in the league. And try to get up
from eighth or ninth to fourth or fifth and live happily ever after and
everything is good.  
Why would the expectations be high when you don't have a locker room? You're
playing in a place where they roll up the bleachers, metal bleachers, and
you're treated like an intramural team. So the expectation level was just try
not to finish last, Coach, that would be a really big deal.  
Today, every BCS school that wants to win a national championship can do it.
Every one. Every BCS school in America, if they wanted to, could do it. At
Connecticut, they want to. Now if they didn't want to, in '85, in '86, '87,
'88, '89, I mean, there's a long time there where they didn't want to, because
they couldn't. They couldn't afford it.  
But that doesn't mean I didn't want to. I wanted to. But I think if every BCS
school, and others maybe -- see, in men's basketball anybody can win a
national championship. You don't have to be a BCS school. You can be any
Division I school and have a shot at it. Mid-major, high major, doesn't
matter.  
In women's basketball it's a little bit harder. But there's a lot of BCS
schools out there that have a tremendous amount of resources, great
facilities, tremendous tradition in their university and in their athletic
department, that if they wanted to, they could. Half of them just don't want
to.  
Now, more and more each year want to because they can see, you know, it's
pretty cool if you can do this. It means a lot to the university. It means a
lot to the community. It means a lot to a lot of people. It's something
significant now. But that hasn't been the case yet.  
And it's getting better and getting better, and five years from now I would
venture to say a lot more BCS schools are going to be trying to win a national
championship than there were five years ago. And that's kind of the
progression that we're making. There might have only been five in 1991 that
could win it. Maybe now there's 30, 35 that are committed to winning it.  
So maybe in five years it will be 70, 55, who knows. But I think we're doing
our part to kind of help that.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 6, 2009

  

### [Sue Donohoe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15066)

### [Jacki Silar](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18999)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  
AMY YAKOLA: Pleased to be joined up at the podium by the chair of the Division
I Women's Basketball Committee, Jacki Silar, as well as from the NCAA staff,
Sue Donohoe.  
Jacki, if you could, just give us a brief opening statement and then we'll
take questions.  
JACKI SILAR: Just want to say on behalf of the Division I Women's Basketball
Committee and the NCAA staff, we're excited to have our host of the city of
St. Louis and the Missouri Valley Conference take a part in this fabulous
tournament. They have done a great job over the last year to prepare for this,
and we're really excited to have UConn and Louisville participate in the
championship game tomorrow night, on Tuesday night.  
I think throughout the championship tournament we've seen some outstanding
games. We've had some upsets, which is exciting in the women's game. We've
taken our game to I think a new level with 16-sites format that has enabled
more of our fans to take part in cheering on their teams, as well as having a
better experience for our student-athletes.  
So we are continuing to look at different ways to grow our game and we always
need the help of our women's basketball coaches as well as our media folks to
help us propel this fabulous sport into everybody's homes, as well as getting
new people into our stands to enjoy this fabulous game.  
AMY YAKOLA: Questions for either Sue or Jacki.  
  
Q. This is a couple of attendance questions. The stands weren't full, and I
know that some groups had cancelled. What kind of groups had cancelled for
this?  
SUE DONOHOE: What we have, we have different groups that get allotments. We
have the local organizing committee that gets allotment. Then the Women's
Basketball Coaches Association and then the four participating teams, then the
NCAA.  
And so those are your primary allotments. And there's no doubt the local
organizing committee, they had some tickets out of their allocation. Our NCAA
allocation we had some tickets. WBCA. And the teams that traditionally have
needed 15-, 1600 tickets, they didn't need that many tickets.  
And so you did see some holes, particularly in the upper level last night. I
think it's a reflection of the difficult economic times right now. And I think
the local organizing committee and the Coaches Association did a great job in
trying to move their tickets as well as they could. But I think it just
reflects the economic challenges that we're in right now.  
  
Q. Do you think that not having a Tennessee or somebody like that there
could also hurt? Would that have helped to sell more tickets or not?  
SUE DONOHOE: I'm not sure. Because, I mean, traditionally when we've had a
program like a Connecticut or an Oklahoma in, they will simply tell us we'll
take everything that you've got. And I think that they were a little bit
surprised that the demands weren't as great as they probably anticipated.  
Having Louisville, which is four and a half hours from here, certainly you
would think that folks could hop in a car, come over, drive over, and I think
we can anticipate having a lot of that happen on Tuesday evening.  
So I don't even know that a traditional attendance driver like Tennessee, that
we would have seen anything any different. I do, I truly believe it's a little
bit of a reflection of folks have so many discretionary dollars right now and
didn't choose to use it on tickets.  
  
Q. You mentioned the first- and second-round games going to 16 sites. Do you
have figures on that? Did you get a boost from that versus the eight sites
over the last few years?  
JACKI SILAR: Again, a reflection of what has happened here at the Final Four.
Our numbers were slightly down. But we also out of our 16 sites we had six of
them that were totally neutral sites, which didn't have a home team playing.
Where, in '04, when our attendance was the highest ever, we only -- out of the
16 only two were neutral. So it's kind of a combination.  
SUE DONOHOE: And it's difficult, there's no doubt about it. You look at higher
seeds playing on lower seeds' floor. And I don't think any of us that walk in
the world of women's basketball want that, but where we are with the game
right now, that's the reality of it.  
And there are a lot of coaches that understand, you know what, if I'm a 2 seed
and I'm playing an 8 or a 9 on their floor, hopefully a 2 seed's going to be
the stronger team. Sometimes that's not always the case. But I think the
committee made the decision a few years ago to try eight sites with eight
teams. You know what, it was a risk. And after three or four years and
evaluating it, it didn't do what we needed it to do.  
So you've got to say, okay, that didn't work. The most successful format we've
been in, bar none, eight sites, eight teams, 16, top 16 seeds, the best format
from an attendance standpoint, a logistical and operational standpoint, is 16
predetermined.  
There's some folks that say, well, let's go back to the top 16 seeds and
announce that on Monday night. If we do that, ESPN's ability to be able to
televise and produce 63 games, we won't have those opportunities in first and
second rounds. So as difficult sometimes as it is, it's where we are right
now. Is that where we ultimately want to be? No, probably not.  
But you look at some of our sites this year that didn't have a team there, and
that's not the championship experience that you want. So it's something that
we've all got to keep working on together.  
  
Q. Is it never going to be considered that it's not worth the television
getting every single one of those games televised to avoid situations? I'm
just curious if that door's just shut, you're never going back there?  
SUE DONOHOE: I think that's a great question. And I think I'm not one that
will ever say never. So I always believe there's always a door open now. You
know, how far your foot is stuck in it, I don't know right now. I think there
are a lot of people that for years worked so hard to get the television
exposure that we now are lucky to have, and I think we all benefit from that.  
And they did a great job at the negotiation table. I think we would have to
really, really look at it. Certainly our contract with ESPN, we're entering
into a phase here over the next 18 months where we will start renegotiation.
And I think we've got to consider what's best for the overall good of the
game.  
It's interesting, if you talk to a coach that is from a high-profile program
that they are on television every week all regular season, they'd say, you
know, get rid of those early rounds on TV and let's get to a format that's
better for us.  
If you talk to some of those programs that the only time they're ever on
television is that first-round game or that second round game, that exposure
for them, there's not enough dollars in their marketing budget that buys them
that kind of exposure.  
So you've got to look at it, I think, what's good for the best, and what's
good for all. But to say will we ever consider that, certainly I think as we
move into this next negotiation of our contract, we'll have some good dialogue
and discussion about what's best for us.  
JACKI SILAR: What I would like to see is I would like to see the growth of the
game. I would like to have the fan that is just the fan of women's basketball,
not the fan of that particular university or institution, and that's where we
have to take our game. It's a fabulous game. It's a different game than the
men. It's played below the rim.  
And when a regional or first-round site is determined for the men, within a
year the tickets in that city are already sold, and they don't know what teams
are going to be there.  
But they sell those seats already, because those people are fans of the game
of men's basketball. And that's what we have to develop. You know, we're
young. We haven't been around that long, if you really think about it. We have
time to grow, and we have time to get there. And that's what we have to
develop. And we need everybody to help do that.  
  
Q. It's been more than two decades since two men were coaches in the
national championship game. What significance do you put on that, if any? And
it's okay if there is no significance to it.  
JACKI SILAR: I would have never known that. I put no significance on it
whatsoever.  
  
Q. To go back to what you were saying about growth of the game. I think
everyone wants that, but wanting it and actually seeing it happen are two
different things. When you have a crowd -- a fortunate crowd like you had out
in LA, and unfortunately Raleigh was not well attended, how do you look at
those things and try to avoid them, saying I understand you want growth of the
game, but there are places in this country that have consistently, for more
than a decade, produced crowds in the Midwest as opposed to some other
places?  
JACKI SILAR: Well, I think when we have to put forth our sites, our
predetermined sites for first and second rounds and regionals, I think the
committee has to really, really examine where you're going to put those sites.  
Now, TV does dictate that we have four in the Pacific and Mountain time zone
and four in the Central time zone and the other eight in the Eastern time zone
for the first and second rounds.  
But we as a committee, we've talked about that. And we have criteria. And in
the summer, when we meet, we examine those types of things. And I think that
will be one of our discussions about how can we help this, how can we ensure
that the institutions that do get the first- and second-round bid for their
institution, that they do have a marketing plan in place prior to submitting
that bid, that they really are committed, even if their team doesn't make it,
that they are committed to getting people, new people, new fans, as creative
as they can be.  
And the NCAA -- Myles Brand is an exceptional pioneer for women's basketball.
And he's put forth so much money towards marketing our sport. And I can't tell
you how much that means to this game. And it will benefit down the road.  
SUE DONOHOE: And I would add to that. Because from a staff standpoint we've
been working with these host sites now for 18 months, 24 months, and I feel
like we had really good host staffs this year. They worked hard at it.  
For instance, we did struggle out in LA. What we need is we need more, some
more sites in the Pacific time zone, the Mountain time zone, to be part of the
bid process.  
The other thing that I think that's really important is a host institution and
their staff will work really hard and put a lot of energy and effort into it,
and then when those teams are sent to that site, getting the fans to travel
with their teams.  
We require each of our teams to purchase a minimum of 100 tickets. 100
tickets. And we've got some institutions that don't purchase that full
allotment. And so you got a lot of host institutions that do a great job and
they may presell 2,500 or 3,000 tickets, and then you've got to partner that
with teams bringing people with them.  
We will go into another bid cycle late spring, mid-summer, and it's our hope
that we'll have a strong group of institutions submit bids so that we've got
some good choices to make for the future.  
  
Q. You see that staying at 16. Are you guys committed for the next -- can
you say how many years you feel like you're committed to 16 predetermined
years?  
JACKI SILAR: I think any time you make changes you need to stay with it. I
rotate off the committee, but I would hope that the committee will stay with
it for a four-year cycle. I think until you really figure out if it's going to
work, you can't make a switch after a year or two.  
  
Q. The other question is, does NCAA set ticket prices? Because ticket prices
in Raleigh are $50 and I think you unfortunately did get caught by a bad
economy. And you have tickets sold in advance so you can't like lower the
price. But how does that set up and how do you revisit to try to make those --
especially if the economy isn't improving, to make those more attainable?  
SUE DONOHOE: That's a great question. We've got minimum ticket prices for
first and second rounds and for regionals. So we tell them, okay, here's the
bottom of the range. And then we allow the host institutions to set what their
price is going to be as long as they meet the minimum, because they know their
marketplace better than we do. And so you might have a ticket priced at one
price point in the Raleigh regional and it might be different than the
Berkeley regional. And it's based on market.  
I think one thing that we've done over the last several years, and I would
venture to say more than ever this year, in light of the economic landscape,
we got as creative as we could.  
I mean, we worked with our hosts and we simply said: If you've got an idea
that you believe will help us with ticket sales, send it to us, shoot it to us
and let us review it and take a look at it. And we did things like special
baseline ticket sales. We did things like family four-packs. We did a lot of
group sales that typically we've never done in the past. And I felt really
good about the efforts and the collective efforts that the host and our staff
put into it.  
But, again, it's a difficult time. But I do think that we've looked at how we
can be more creative and be more effective in our marketing efforts to help
our sites.  
  
Q. This is a follow-up to the Final Four prices. The NCAA sets those. In
light of what's happened this year, this might have happened with the men,
too, if Michigan State hadn't ended up in the Final Four there, has there been
any consideration to maybe lower prices next year for the Final Four in light
of the economics this year?  
JACKI SILAR: I don't know. Sue, you do the prices.  
SUE DONOHOE: We have not. Because Final Four tickets for 2010 are already on
sale. They've been on sale now about a month and a half. But I will tell you,
we've got an opportunity next year with us being in the dome, and we're really
looking at some kind of neat things that we can do, because we can set the
seating capacity at, say, 25,000 or thereabouts.  
And that building gives us some flexibility. So if we want to offer like a
special student price so that teams can bring their students in, and we sit
them court-side or something like that, we've got some neat ideas and I think
you'll see some things put in place for next year's Final Four.  
Although the ticket prices are set, I think we'll see some structure. We'll
put a model in that kind of gives some folks an opportunity to experience it
in a different way. And we're excited about trying it.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you, both.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  
AMY YAKOLA: I'm joined by head coach Jeff Walz of Louisville as well as
student-athletes Deseree' Byrd, Becky Burke, Keshia Hines, Angel McCoughtry
and Candyce Bingham.  
Coach, an opening statement when you're ready.  
COACH WALZ: Yes, ma'am. Again, we'd just like to thank everyone involved with
the Final Four for just giving us such a great experience, everyone that's
worked with our student-athletes to make their experience here -- I'm sure
they'll agree -- it's been outstanding.  
And I'm proud of this team. I'm proud of everyone involved in our program,
from my assistant coaches to our managers, to our administration, everyone
that has given it all they have this entire season. And for us to be able to
sit here today and say we're going to practice the last possible day you can
practice is an awfully good feeling.  
We'll come out tomorrow night and throw a game plan out there and see what can
happen. So we're excited to be here and appreciate everything you all have
done.  
AMY YAKOLA: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Angel, last night there was a reference at least once during the
broadcast about the lesser team. Do you think by now this whole underdog thing
should go away? Are you surprised by that? Where do you stand on all this?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: No. We want them to keep saying the other team's going,
because that's how we win. So I hope they wish Connecticut wins tomorrow.
That's what we've been thriving off of, so we don't want that to change.  
  
Q. Are you surprised by all this? Frankly, even we were a little taken aback
by someone so polarized in the national semifinal, and then of course you come
back and win.  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: We just came out and believed. We weren't surprised at all
when we won the game. We knew we would win the game. We just want people to
keep doubting us.  
  
Q. Candyce, can you talk about the three of the last five games Becky's made
two 3s that came at the most opportune time, the biggest time in the game?
Talk about her development as you've seen it through this year.  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: I mean, she's come on at the right time. I know a couple of
us during the game just kept telling her to shoot. And at one point she said
she will, she will. So we kept looking for her, and she knocked down 3s at
crucial points in the game. And that's what we need.  
  
Q. Candyce, UConn was saying yesterday that they're convinced that you're a
different team than you were on March 10th when you played them in the Big
East final. How has Louisville changed in that month?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: I believe we are a different team. I think that our freshmen
are really starting to buy into things more and putting in the time. They
started putting in the time and knowing that they are a crucial part of our
program and being successful.  
I mean, Coach said when they don't play well, we don't play well. And I think
they finally realized that we don't play well when they play well. So they're
really starting to pick it up. And we are a different team than what we played
them the last time.  
  
Q. Angel, can you just talk about the Big East championship game and what it
was that either Connecticut did on you defensively or what you did. I mean,
was it just an off night for you?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: That was a time, you know, we don't want to use it as an
excuse, but we did play a double overtime game, then we went down to the wire
with Pittsburgh, then we played in front of all their fans at home. And then
they were just getting rebound after rebound after rebound.  
Now we have to take it upon ourselves to really box out and don't give them
one chance on the offensive end. And that's what I think the difference was.  
  
Q. Angel, have you given any thought as far as tomorrow being your final
game, and also can you just give us your thoughts on your career as a whole at
Louisville?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: Yeah, it's great to play the last game of the college
season. My career has been great. I'm blessed. And I have no complaints, win
or lose tomorrow. This is what everybody dreams of doing. And to be here is
just amazing. And then to play one of the great teams of America, it's great.
You wouldn't ask for anything else.  
  
Q. Becky, this is for you, how does the team start to believe that you can
beat Connecticut after what's happened? How do you get over the -- if there
even is an emotional hump to get over? And, secondly, what does that tattoo on
your back say?  
BECKY BURKE: This is a national championship game and it's for everything. So
I think we're not looking at what happened in the past two games. Obviously
we're pretty familiar with them because they're in our conference. But this is
a national championship, it's for everything. You're laying it all on the
line. So I think anything can happen.  
And my tattoo says "Be strong in the Lord and the victory is yours."  
  
Q. Geno said last night on the TV that he thought you were the biggest
difference or one of the biggest differences in the team in the last month.
Talk about how much you've improved in this round and what you've done
different in the NCAA tournament.  
DESEREE' BYRD: I just think I've been more relaxed. Like I've been saying, the
patience with the coaches and the patience with my teammates and the
confidence they have in me just being out there running the point guard for
this team has been lifting me up. I think that's what's been the difference
maker.  
  
Q. Deseree', do you see this as a David-Goliath thing like so many people
do, and, if you do, are there advantages in that?  
DESEREE' BYRD: We were just talking about that before we walked in here. But,
yeah, you can look at it like that. I know many people said Geno never lost a
national championship game. But neither has Coach Walz. (Laughter.) Thank you,
Ms. Kim.  
Like I said, we still want our doubters. They add fuel to our fire. I think,
like Becky said, this is the national championship. Anything can happen. And
we're going to leave it all out on the floor.  
  
Q. Could you just comment on Renee Montgomery and what she does and what a
tough matchup that is for anybody?  
DESEREE' BYRD: I mean, Renee Montgomery, UConn's point guard, she had a great
game yesterday, offensively and defensively, and I think it's one of the best
games I've seen her play, all-around game.  
She's a great point guard. I think a lot of people look up to her. I mean, we
come out defensively, play a perfect 40-minute half. This is anybody's game.  
  
Q. Angel, can you tell us how you ended up getting to Louisville after the
St. John's situation? Do you ever think about how your career may have been
different if it played out at St. John's instead of Louisville?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: After not being able to go to St. John's I had to take
another route. But I knew once I came to Louisville that this is the place I
needed to be.  
When I signed with Louisville, everybody was like why are you going there? Why
would you go to Louisville? Nobody ever heard of Louisville, and the women's
program wasn't the caliber that it is now. But for some reason I seen
something that a lot of people didn't see. And I think now they're saying --
now we see why you went to Louisville.  
  
Q. Deseree', you all have obviously built up a pretty hardcore fan base. I
wonder if you have any words for them before tomorrow night's game.  
DESEREE' BYRD: We just appreciate all the support from all our friends and
family. I mean, we're blessed. We're truly blessed to be in this position that
we are in. And, like I said, we really appreciate everything that everybody
has done for our program and all our fans who came out and support us.  
  
Q. Candyce, can you give us your thoughts what it's been like to play with
Angel and your thoughts on her as a player?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: It's been great coming back home. Again, I never thought we
would be in this position. But Angel is a phenomenal player. I love playing
with her. Some people might think it was -- I should be different as far as
she gets all the attention or whatever. But I love it.  
She just makes it so much easier for other people to play with her. And, I
mean, sometimes she has her moments. But other than that, she's a great
player. And she's going to be phenomenal at the next level, too. So I just
really enjoy playing with her.  
  
Q. Keshia, we see you all the time in the Big East obviously in Connecticut
and we're wondering how you guys think the program is going to carry on next
year when Angel and Candyce are gone and what the next step for Louisville
basketball is going to be. Just wondering what your point of view was on
that.  
KESHIA HINES: Well, we have some great freshmen coming in next year. Even
though we're going to miss Candyce and Angel, it's another year and it's part
of life. We gain some and we lose some. We're going to do the best we can.  
DESEREE' BYRD: Can't replace a Candyce Bingham and an Angel McCoughtry. But I
think we feel like we all feel the same way, and I think we want to have the
same feeling next year. Everybody is going to get in the gym and work on their
weaknesses and get better as individuals. Because as Coach Walz said, if we
get better as individuals we get better as a team. He's going to push us just
like he pushed us this year.  
With Angel and Candyce -- without Angel and Candyce he's still going to push
us to the fullest, to the best as we can be.  
  
Q. Candyce, I was wondering, could you talk about just like since the
beginning of the tournament, since Selection Monday, you guys got sent down to
Louisiana and just the ride that it's been, like just keeping winning and
winning to get here?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: I'm so glad we got a 3 seed. Because I think we had the most
promising route to get here. I mean, I don't know. You know, people are
doubting us, saying we couldn't do this, we couldn't do that, but we beat two
No. 1 seeds and a No. 2 seed. And we believed. We didn't let the 3 seed get
down. We didn't let having to play at LSU get us down because we all just
believed.  
We've played in front of crowds like that all season. So we just believed in
each other and believed in the coaching staff and now we're playing for the
national championship.  
  
Q. Candyce, how have you changed since you first got to the program? How are
you different now than maybe when you started? And I would even ask that about
the team. What have you seen in that time how the program and the people in it
have changed?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: I think for myself, leadership has been a big factor in me
changing, and then with the team, just believing in one another. And then when
we got a new coaching staff I know at first it was hard to buy into what they
were saying, but we knew that Coach Walz had won a national championship. He
knew what it took to get there.  
So I think it didn't happen overnight. But we knew that in the end him coming
here and bringing in that staff would get us to the point we are today. And it
worked.  
  
Q. Candyce, just following up on that. Maybe, Angel, you can chime in here
if you would like. But do you recall that first drill of the first day of
practice, and what was that? And when you were going through that, did you
ever, in your wildest dreams, think about that it would lead you here, that
doing something like that would lead you here? And how far away did that dream
seem then and now that you're on the threshold of it? How real does it seem?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: Yeah, we have this drill, what is it, 21 free throws. And you
have -- you and a partner. And you have to make basically a 1-and-1 free
throw, whatever, but we didn't make it. We just ran. This was last year. We
just ran for like an hour straight. And this year there were different drills.
We had one person pretty much give up on the drill and you were just looking
around and saying, wow, what are we getting ourselves into.  
But with six freshmen on the team that's what's going to happen. You're going
to have days where you're just kind of like, What is going on? What are we
getting ourselves into? But we had plenty of meetings and talked to them and
told them how things were going to be. And it finally ended up working.  
We didn't think it would at that time. But it finally came through and we're
in the national championship game.  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: Well, it's just been crazy. We had to run for hours. It
seemed like it was going to be a long year. But ever since the North Carolina
game last year, that's all I dreamed about was getting to St. Louis and
getting to this. I've actually had a dream about it, putting on the hat,
running up and down the court. So hopefully my dream can come true tomorrow.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Jeff, can you just talk about what -- you talked a little last night
about the development of everybody other than Candyce and Angel, especially in
the tournament and what Becky kind of has brought to this team.  
COACH WALZ: Yeah, it's been a year. It's been a two-year process for Keshia
and Des. And we had our freshmen, we had to put them on a fast track because
they didn't have the luxury of playing like a normal freshman. With Keshia and
Des, their first year we could throw them out there and if they had some
problems I could sub them back out.  
To just give them time to reflect on the bench and relax and put them back in.
But we've started two freshmen the entire year, just about. And it's been good
for them, but at the same time it's been tough on them. Because they've had to
learn as the game's going. There's no time for them to sit on the bench and
kind of reflect and try to take things in.  
We've had to have freshmen step up and play, and especially this past month in
the NCAA tournament, Becky Burke has stepped up big. Monique Reid last night
-- I watched the game film this morning, and Mo was as good as anyone on the
floor defensively for us. She just did an outstanding job.  
She took the ball hard to the hole in the last two minutes of the game. Just
did everything we asked her to do. And our kids are starting to play a year
ahead of what they really are. Des and Keshia are starting to play like some
juniors and our freshmen are starting to play like sophomores. And that's what
we have to have if we want to have a chance to compete tomorrow night.  
  
Q. How would you rate yourself as a motivator? And in your career where does
this game rank as a motivational challenge?  
COACH WALZ: You know, we keep it real. I mean, that's the one thing we do.
I've always been a believer in being honest with players. So when it comes to
motivating them, I just try and challenge them. I told Angel last night at
halftime, she was bad. It's the worst I'd seen her play, and it was.  
So I wasn't going to walk in there and tell her it's okay, because it wasn't.
And that's what we've done for the two years I've been there. And our players,
you know, at the moment they might not appreciate it, because every player,
when they leave a locker room after a game, they go back and see their parents
and the first thing they say is, Great job. You did a great job. It's a lie.
Just tell them the truth.  
So I've told our kids after our UConn game in the Big East finals, I told
them, When you walk out of here, if your parents tell you you did a good job,
they're lying to you. Just tell them you're awful. And that's what they
appreciate now because they at least know they're going to get the truth.  
When our kids play well, I tell them they play well. I'm the first one to
praise them and tell them they've done a great job. So we motivate by just
telling the truth to them.  
And our entire program is based on that and our players learn to respect that,
and that's all I really care about.  
I tell them, I'm not trying to find 15 new friends. I'm there to coach a
basketball team. But what I do care about is when the day's done and we walk
off the floor that they respect me and they know I'll take care of them. And
that's what it's all about. It's not just about winning basketball games.
We've done a great job of that this season, but I'm just as proud of what
they've done off the floor as I am what they've done on it.  
So motivation is not tough if you're just honest with players. And for myself,
it's going to be fun tomorrow night. We're going to have to come out and play
a great game. There's no question UConn is the best team in the country.
There's no doubt. But what we have to do is find a way to play better for 40
minutes. That's it. It doesn't have to be 42, 43. We've got to play a better
basketball game for 40 minutes.  
If we can find a way to do that, well, then we win tomorrow night. And that's
not going to say that we're a better basketball team if we can figure that way
out. It's going to be a challenge for us.  
  
Q. I know you've talked in the past, but can you revisit the tape that you
showed Angel to kind of open her eyes to how immature she was being and how
far she's come since then? And kind of as a follow-up, did that really present
itself at halftime in the national semifinals? I mean, in the past could her
maturity even allowed her to come out and play as well as she did to end that
game?  
COACH WALZ: All we did was -- Steph Norman, my assistant, we sat down and I
watched some game film and I'd ask her, Hey, let's clip out about four minutes
of Angel her freshman and sophomore year, just the way she reacted to the
officiating calls, to her teammates and just show her how she's handling
different situations.  
And it's not that she was immature, it's just the kid's a fierce competitor.
She wants to win, and that's what it all comes down to. And people, I think,
had talked to her in the past about, how, you've got to watch your behavior,
you've got to relax a little more. But no one had actually shown it to her.  
And my wife -- we've got a three-year-old that threw food on the floor once
and we laughed at it and we thought it was funny. The next day she starts
doing it again. So we realized we better not laugh at that anymore. So if you
show them stuff on film, especially, kids will change. It just takes some
time.  
And last night's game, Angel, there was no doubt in my mind she was going to
come out and play a much better second half. But she needed to know that the
way she played in the first half was not acceptable.  
And she took the challenge and came out and just played extremely well for us.  
  
Q. Jeff, you mentioned they're the best team in the country. Could you just
talk about what weaknesses you can see such as maybe depth and what do you do
to try to exploit those?  
COACH WALZ: I think I saw their manager drop a bottle of water. So that's a
weakness.  
You know, that's the scary thing about them. They've got three of the top 10
players or 12 players -- 10, right? State Farm team's 10. Yeah. Three of the
top 10 players in the country. Then you've got Tiffany Hayes, who is shooting
the ball extremely well.  
Kalana Greene, I mean, it's just a list of them. We're going to have to come
out and we're going to have to try to find a way to make them uncomfortable.
How we're going to do that, I haven't quite figured out yet. I've got until
7:30 tomorrow night to try and figure that out.  
But we're going to have to try to control the tempo of the game. We're going
to have to make some shots early. The difference is if we come out tomorrow
night the same first five minutes the way we played last night, instead of
being 11-0 it's 25-0. So I'm aware of that. Our kids know that.  
But at the same time, who expected us to be here? I'm not sure anyone did.
Well, actually I know no one did. So we've got nothing to lose and everything
to gain, and that's how we're going to approach this game. We're going to come
out and lay it on the line for 40 minutes. And we'll be proud of our effort,
there's no doubt about that. And hopefully we can play better basketball than
they do for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Two-part question. Following up on what I asked your players. When you
ran them for an hour in that first practice, you say you like to keep it real,
and they were asking themselves what have we got ourselves into. With as many
freshmen you had to integrate on this team, were you asking yourself the same
thing? As a coach, as you motivate your players, is it tough to kind of, I
guess, reconcile wanting them to keep focus but at the same time to have a
purpose for what they do in terms of playing for a national championship? Do
you dangle that as kind of a carrot out there in that first practice and say,
Look, if we do the little things, this is what can happen at the end of the
year?  
COACH WALZ: You know, our first practice, we go into it each year and I tell
them exactly what drill we're going to start off with. So I tell them that our
first individual workout. It's the same drill we do in individual workouts. So
they know what to expect.  
I told them this is our goal. And until we meet it we're going to run. So it
took us an hour. So our first day of practice was just up and down. But what
that did was that got a group of players to understand, hey, when Coach says
something, he means it.  
So it started -- I thought even though it was a bad first day, I thought it
sent a message to all of them. And I've said all year long that our margin for
error is very thin. We've got Angel McCoughtry and Candyce Bingham who are two
fantastic players, and we've got really good role players, and we've got some
that are starting to step up and get better.  
But it's the same thing. We can't afford a lot of mistakes if we're going to
win games. And we've done a really good job. If you go back and look at our
last five games, we've, I think, cut our turnovers down from averaging about
18 to averaging about 12 or 13. And those are things we're going to have to
continue to do if we're going to have a chance to win tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Jeff, you're a pretty animated guy on the sidelines. I was wondering how
you gauge how you approach the officials during the game and what you can get
away with and when you cross the line, or how do you feel them out and know
what kind of conduct or decorum to carry through on a game?  
COACH WALZ: I've watched film of Coach Auriemma, Geno, and I've learned from
him. He does an outstanding job with the officials.  
And we try to have conversation with them back and forth. You know, there are
things I question at times and I'm sure they question my coaching at times as
they're officiating a game.  
But I've got to try to protect my players as much as the next coach does. And,
you know, when they warn you, I say okay, and then you try to back off some.
But I just go as the game goes. Some games are better than others.  
  
Q. This was the year there was so much talk about the Big East men and the
possibility of three teams in the Final Four. As it turns out, there is no Big
East team playing for the title tonight but you have two Big East teams
playing for the title here. Could you speak first to the pride of the
conference, what you think it says about the conference? And also, from a
Louisville point of view, after the disappointment with the men's team,
whether this game alone is enough to bring the campus back up to a very
spirited level, or would it take you guys beating Connecticut to do that?  
COACH WALZ: You know, we had two bus loads of students that came up for the
game last night, bused back home after the game. And I think we've got three
or four bus loads of students that will come back up tomorrow night. So our
campus pride is great. Our men's team had a great year. They ran into a very,
very good Michigan State team that's playing for a championship tonight.  
So that's just one of those things where, you know, our men would have loved
to have been playing in the game tonight. And unfortunately they're not.
Speaking on behalf of the Big East now, I think you just go back and look at
what our conference has done. 13 of our 16 teams played in post-season play.
South Florida just won the NIT. And now you've got two teams playing in the
championship game.  
So I don't think there's a question of what league was the best. I know this
year we were being told we were the second or third best conference in the
country. But I think we showed everybody with the performance we've had here,
not only with the teams in the NCAA tournament, but the teams that played in
the NIT, who the best league was.  
  
Q. Jeff, just wondered if you as a sports fan have a favorite upset and
whether you -- I don't know, Villanova over Georgetown, U.S.A. Hockey over
Russia, and whether you might draw on that in talking to the team?  
COACH WALZ: We've talked about those things, and, no, I really don't have one
that I'm going to sit there and go on. I mean, we've kind of gone on the
philosophy the whole year that we're the Bad News Bears. So that's still going
to be our approach to things.  
It's like I said, no one -- even when I listened to the game of last night,
the commentators, Oklahoma is letting a lesser team come back. They should
have buried them in the first half. This team's not as good. But it just seems
that our kids find a way.  
And we might not have been the most talented team on the floor for the past
four games that we've played. But I think we've been the tougher team and the
team with more heart. And that goes a long way. And we've got a group of
players here that are buying into a system and buying into their role.  
We have kids that aren't shooters that aren't shooting, which is a good thing.
It's like I tell a few of our players when they come over to me and they say,
Hey, coach I'm open, I tell them, There's a reason you're open; they ain't
guarding you. Those kids aren't shooting anymore. Which is good. They're
passing and setting screens for our shooters.  
And I think when you get a group of players that buy into what their job is,
you've got a chance to be successful. Because our past three games we've tried
to make kids on other teams that normally don't score take shots. And we've
been successful with that.  
So hopefully we can continue to do that. Now, tomorrow night my problem is
they all make shots for UConn. So it's a matter of trying to figure out who
we're going to have to try to make more shots compared to what they normally
make.  
  
Q. How much did the way the Big East championship game play out help you
guys regroup for the NCAA tournament, make this run? I think I remember you
saying your team sort of quit towards the end and gave up in the last couple
of minutes. Did that get you refocused and help say, okay, we've got new life
here, new season, and play that way?  
COACH WALZ: You know what, we looked at the film for about one time through,
just real quick, and it was kind of like it was ugly. It was bad. And just
kind of explained to our kids that's not us, we can't let that happen again.  
And the nice thing about it was we had about a week and a half off to forget
about that game. And then a chance to start things over again. And they bought
into coming back and practicing hard and working on the small things. And now
we're playing here.  
  
Q. Coach, it's been more than two decades since two men have coached in the
national championship game. What significance, if any, do you find in that
fact and that time gap?  
COACH WALZ: None. Honestly, it's just one of those that -- our team has just
been playing well and I happen to be a man and he's a man and we're playing
tomorrow night.  
I don't think there's any significance in it at all. I think there's a bunch
of great coaches in our game, male and female. When we go to play somebody, I
don't look down the bench to see if it's a male coach or a female coach; I
just look at their coaching and what they've done.  
So to me there's really no significance in that at all. We're just thrilled to
be playing tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Can you sum up Angel's accomplishments in her career and also how fitting
is it for her to have the opportunity to play for a national championship
tomorrow night?  
COACH WALZ: What she's done for this program you really can't put into words.
I think the easiest way to sum everything up is her freshman year I think they
average about 1,400 fans a game. And by her senior year we were averaging
close to about 8,000.  
So that sums up her career in my mind, just the fact that she brought women's
basketball in our city to a brand-new stage.  
And I think it's going to continue to grow. We're opening up a brand-new arena
in two years, and our goal is to have 10,000 season ticket holders when that
opens. And I really think we have a great chance at that.  
  
Q. How fitting is it for her?  
COACH WALZ: It's wonderful. I mean, she's one of the few players that, you
know, you come out of high school and she was recruited by some good teams.
St. John's, Kim does a great job up there. And she saw in her before what
everybody else saw what she could be.  
And the amount of work Angel has put into her game to go from being ranked
about 80th or 90th out of high school to being a three-time All-American
doesn't happen very often in women's basketball.  
So for what she's done for her career and how fitting it is to play in this
championship game, I'm so excited for her and Candyce.  
We have two seniors that have been the heart and soul of this team the entire
season. And I'm happy for both of them. But I know they're not satisfied with
just playing in this game tomorrow night.  
  
Q. How much of the film from the previous two games do you show today and
tomorrow before the game, or do you use it as motivation?  
COACH WALZ: None. Not going to watch it. There's no need to.  
  
Q. This is a little off-the-beaten-path kind of question, but following up
the question about the male coaches thing. Geno talks once in a while about
how he aspires someday perhaps -- daydreams about coaching men. And I'm
wondering if you ever thought about that, and, more importantly, how you
thought an elite women's coach like you and Coach Auriemma would be accepted
by male players on the college level?  
COACH WALZ: I had the chance, my second year, at Western Kentucky, to possibly
switch over to the men's side and really had no interest in that. I enjoy
coaching the women's game. I enjoy the fact of recruiting, that when you
recruit players you've got the opportunity to see them grow and develop for
four years.  
On the men's side, I've got a lot of respect for what they do because you have
coaches that go out there and bust their tail recruiting to get the best
player and then they're there for one year. We can sit there and -- Geno, you
get a Maya Moore and you're going to get a chance to coach the kid for four
years, and that's a pretty darned good feeling.  
So I enjoy being in the women's game. I don't really have a desire to switch
to the men. But I don't think if he wanted to do it or if I decided to do it,
if the opportunity came about, I don't think it would be a problem about
coaching men. I don't think they'd have a problem respecting us. Basketball's
basketball. You still have to put the ball in the basket. You've got to be
able to draw up some plays.  
So Xs and Os are about the same. I think it's how you handle your players on
and off the court that are going to make a difference how you can adjust
coaching a female athlete and a male athlete.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the Bad News Bears analogy. I mean, you guys have
been a top 10 team all year. Do you just see things inside the program that
you are busting the kids about that they have to fix to get better?  
COACH WALZ: No, you know what, we've been a top 10 program all season long.
But I really believe that it's one of those, I think we're voted the top 10
because we just kept winning. It's like, golly, I really don't want to vote
them there, but they didn't lose; so we're stuck voting them there.  
I mean, our center is six-foot-two and about 145 pounds. When they announce
the starting lineups for last night's game, and again Gwen Rucker runs out to
half court and here comes Courtney Paris, were you not like, wow, that could
be a problem for them.  
Our point guard goes out to shake hands and, you know, Des has just done a
phenomenal job, but she's not your typical point guard. I've had everybody be
like Des will tell you she was a quarterback for a pee-wee league football
team. She played with the guys.  
And when I say that, that's what I talk about. We don't have your six-foot-
four post player. We don't have your five-foot-ten lightning-quick point
guard. We're just different. And I think it plays well into the way we play.  
But that's what I refer -- when I sit there and I say we're the Bad News
Bears, that's what I talk about.  
  
Q. I know you talked before about your relationship with Rick Pitino, could
you expand on that? Do you know if he's coming here tomorrow to watch you guys
play?  
COACH WALZ: I'm not sure if Coach is or not. Got a text from him last night
congratulating us on the win, and some of his staff are here and said that
he's going to try and come to the game tomorrow night. He's been outstanding
to us.  
He's given us the opportunity to come and watch practice, pick up some Xs and
Os from him. He'll sit down and talk basketball whenever he's got time and we
have time. It's a very good relationship, and I appreciate the time he's given
me and my staff.  
And, you know, it's one that hopefully it will continue to grow because it's
benefited me greatly.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you, Coach.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  
AMY YAKOLA: I'm pleased to be joined on the podium today by Connecticut head
coach Gene Auriemma, as well as student-athletes Maya Moore, Tiffany Hayes,
Tina Charles, Renee Montgomery, and Kalana Greene.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know, we're saying the same things every day seems
like. If I was you guys, I'd get tired of listening to it. We're tired of
saying it. But I know we have to say it because you have to write it.  
But nothing has changed in the three days that we've been here. Today we'll do
the same thing we did the day before yesterday. Tomorrow hopefully we'll
prepare the same way we did yesterday.  
We have a great opportunity here in front of us. We're playing a team that
obviously has an awful lot going for them right now. And we're playing a team
that, from what I heard, really wanted to play us, wants to play us, which I
admire their camaraderie that they want it to be an all Big East final. I'm
sure that's what they meant.  
So all I can say is we've done 38 times what I hope we can do one more time.  
AMY YAKOLA: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Renee, could you just talk about Angel McCoughtry not just as a player
but as a leader of the team and what you're most impressed about her?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I'm just impressed about how she really puts herself aside.
I think this last month a lot of the other players on her team have been
stepping up and she's allowed them to do it. I know a couple times in the game
she drove ball to the basket and dished it off to one of her teammates, and
just to have enough trust and faith in her teammates to make a big play, or
when it was going down the line, I think there was a few seconds on the shot
clock and she let one of her teammates shoot the ball.  
You can just see she trusts her teammates, and I think that's big when you
have a player that is always used to having the ball and always used to making
the big play to put herself aside and let her teammates make that play because
she trusts them enough.  
  
Q. Kalana and Maya, I'm sure if you were on Louisville you would be feeling
the same they are, the underdog, it's a great role, nothing to lose. And I'm
wondering where you think the fantasy ends and the reality begins.  
KALANA GREENE: I think when the ball's thrown up in the air, that's when it
begins and when the clock ends is when it ends. It's going to be a good game
for the fans. I don't think they're looking at it as they're any less than us.
At this point in the tournament everyone's 5-0. And they're looking to get a
win just like we are.  
MAYA MOORE: I agree, the game has to be played. And all talk stops. Like
Kalana said, when the ball is thrown up you have to go out and play, and at
the end of the game hopefully our reality will be where we want it to be.  
  
Q. Renee and Maya, have you guys played with a refuse-to-lose attitude all
year? And have you allowed yourselves to think about what's at stake tomorrow,
not only a national championship but an undefeated season?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I think we all played with that mentality, because every
year before this we've lost. And I think everyone came with the mindset that
it takes one game at a time, and we've made it really simple. And we haven't
really looked too far in the future. Each game we're just worried about the
next game, and not necessarily two games in that advance. So right now we're
worried about the national championship game and not really what it's going to
mean to be undefeated but just to get one more win and end our season the
right way.  
MAYA MOORE: Definitely, I think that's the key to our success all year, is
staying focused on what's ahead or the next game ahead and not getting too
wrapped up in being afraid of what if we lose or what if we do this, but just
getting excited and showing up and playing UConn basketball for 40 minutes.
And all the things, the records whatever comes with it, it's something we can
look at afterwards.  
But we're definitely not going to get caught up in the what-ifs; we're just
going to come in and get prepared for the game.  
  
Q. Maya and Renee, Coach was saying yesterday that he would rather play
anybody but Louisville tomorrow because of what happened in the other games.
Do you guys feel that way at all?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I do, just -- I think one of the better things about playing
in the NCAA tournament, you get to play teams you haven't played before that
you don't know anything about and it's kind of exciting to play someone that
you've never played before.  
But, I mean, we are playing them. And so we have to get excited for the game
and we know that in a sense they're not going to be the same team we played
before. So we can look at it that way and just be excited.  
MAYA MOORE: Yeah, I agree. It's fun to play different teams in the tournament.
It's kind of like a matchup of all the big games we've had so far this season
in the regular season championship. We were competing with Louisville and Big
East tournament and competing with Louisville. So this is the third time. So
it's not a different team, but it's still a big game for us. It's somewhere
that our team hasn't been before. So I don't think it will be hard to get
excited about it.  
  
Q. Last night your coach was talking about how you've prepared this season
in each and every drill as though the national championship was at stake. Was
that something that you brought with you this year to the court after you
walked off the court at St. Pete Times Forum, and did that drive you? And how
did you maintain that intensity day in, day out without allowing it to become
drudgery?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I think it's easy when you have things motivating you. For
instance, losing three years in a row. I think you don't get complacent or you
don't lose your hunger because you've never won before. And any time you get
tired you just think of things to motivate yourself with, and losing is the
best motivator for me as well as my teammates.  
And then when we have teammates that are going just as hard as I am and
pushing themselves and everyone has a lot of energy, it makes it fun. So it's
not drudgery because it's fun. Every drill we make it fun. There's a
competition. We turn everything into a competition that we do. And I just
think practice has been fun all year, and we've had a lot of fun in all the
games. So I think it's easy to stay focused when we have the chemistry that we
do on this team.  
  
Q. Renee, I was wondering, with the two Big East teams in the final, and
then the other day with the four All-Americans from the Big East, what does it
say about your conference to have this kind of representation? And also what
kind of camaraderie do you have like maybe with Angel? I know you guys have
been going back and forth a little bit.  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: It says a lot. I think we've been saying all year that the
Big East is a really tough conference to play in. And every game, you know,
the score might not show it, but it was hard games to play in, and we'd wake
up the next morning sore and tired because we got beat up and it was a
physical game and it was hard.  
And I don't know if the score necessarily reflected it so people didn't really
take it to heart, but now that you see it, another Big East team is in the
championship game, and that we had four players from the Big East on the All-
American team, it just shows that it's a tough conference to play in.  
And I definitely think from battling with Louisville over the years that me
and Angel have developed a friendship, and I'm sure we'll be friends once we
leave college. Just not right now (smiling).  
  
Q. Tiffany and Tina, what did you notice, what did Louisville try to do
differently in the Big East championship game that maybe they didn't try in
January and what do you think they might try to do tomorrow night that's
different?  
TINA CHARLES: I think just, you know, it's March, and I think every team is
going to come out and play different. I think even our team has been playing
different in this tournament and the Big East tournament.  
Coach set out a couple of goals for people on the team and individually
everyone had to go out and perform. I'm sure they're thinking the same thing
that they have to perform to the best ability that they can. So I think that's
what they're going to do different.  
TIFFANY HAYES: I just think that it's hard beating a team three times in a
year. They're going to come out hard. Like you said, it's a national
championship game, so they're definitely going to come with something
different than what they've been coming with the last couple of games. And we
just gotta go out and play UConn basketball.  
  
Q. Renee and Maya, if you could both, I asked Angel what she admired most
about the UConn program; she said because UConn players are all business. I
wonder if you could talk about is that something you feel like your coach is
recruiting when he picks you out, but also is it something that develops once
you get on campus?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I think it's a little bit of both. I think they recruit a
certain type of player that they can see potential in being able to play in
this program. And to be able to play in this program you have to be about
business. It's not that we can't have fun, but we just know when it's time to
play and when it's time to have fun.  
And I think that's just something we've done really well this year, and in all
the situations we've been in, for instance, Cancun, we could have easily went
out there and just pretty much had a party for a week and lost the games. But
we had fun when it was time to have fun and we played hard when it was time to
play. And I think that's what makes -- that's what makes us have so much fun
this year.  
MAYA MOORE: I think that when you come to Connecticut you have to have a
certain competitive mindset. And that's not something you can really teach to
a certain point. So the players that Coach recruits, he tries to get tough,
competitive people who always want to come to play. When they're in the game
or when they're on the bench, whatever it is, they're going to bring
everything they can.  
And there's a time and a place for everything, like Renee said, and I think
our team is a pretty mature group to know when it's time to go to practice or
when it's time to go to shoot-around or play the game we have to be extremely
focused, and until the buzzer goes off.  
We've experienced games, except for Tiffany as a freshman, where if you're not
focused you're going to lose. So we know what can happen. And that's why I
really think this year we've come more than ever so focused in knowing when
we're on the court it is about business and it's about winning.  
  
Q. Renee, probably a week from today your life is going to be so different.
You're going to be drafted by somebody. You're going to probably be in a new
city, meeting new teammates, coaching staff, everything. Rebecca Lobo said
yesterday she thought you would be the first player taken in the draft. And
I'm just wondering how you feel about that possibility and do you ever
daydream about what's next in your life?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I know people probably don't believe me when I say I don't
think about it much. It comes to mind sometimes, when people ask me questions
about it. And I'm excited for the future. But it's just -- what's on my mind
the most right now is just winning the national championship. And my life is
definitely going to change. That's one of the reasons why I'm trying to enjoy
these moments I have here right now, because I know the teammates I meet in
the future are not going to be like the ones I have now.  
And everything is going to be different and I'm excited for the future. And
I'm just -- I try to live in the present. But I am definitely excited and
wherever I am chosen to go I'm going to be happy.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Geno, could you tell the story of recruiting Renee? Essentially you went
to see Alexis Hornbuckle and discovered Renee, could you talk about that a
little bit?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, it wasn't necessarily a discovery of her. Obviously we
had had a chance to see Renee play quite often. She played on one of those
high-powered AAU teams with four or five Division I players. And it was easy
to overlook Renee. And you look at her now and to me she's still one of the
little guys out there on the floor.  
Now, imagine her even 20 pounds lighter than she is right now and playing,
again, with all these great players. But when I went to her state tournament
game and I actually saw her play with her high school team, that's when I
really got a sense for her leadership skills and who she is and what she's
able to accomplish.  
And I remember coming back and I remember Chris Dailey asking me how was the
game. I said it was a great game. She said, What do you think? I said, I think
Alexis Hornbuckle is going to Tennessee. She said, Her father told me that
it's down to three schools. I said, I don't care what her father told you. I
said, I'm telling you she's going to Tennessee.  
She said, How do you know? I said, 'Cause I can tell, I know. I've been
watching games long enough. But don't worry about it; we're going to get the
right one. And we did. And what else can I say?  
  
Q. Can you just address how Louisville-UConn rivalry has matured in the last
two years, two Big East finals now and a national championship? And maybe also
how after this game how maybe you guys will take this rivalry to even a higher
level now that you're playing in a national final?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, it's always interesting for us in the last 10 years or
so, however long, it was going to be Connecticut and Notre Dame for the rest
of the Big East history. And then it was Connecticut and Rutgers for the rest
of the Big East history.  
Now it's Connecticut/Louisville. It just seems to me that if you consider
yourself the best team or the best, more importantly, the best basketball
program in a conference, then it's just natural that as other programs get
better you're going to have to deal with that.  
And in this case, again, because of Angel McCoughtry and Candyce Bingham,
specifically, and generally the way they recruited and the way they've built
their program, who knows what's going to happen in the future. Who knows where
they'll be next year. I just hope we're still around to still talk about who
our big rivals are.  
But if you look at our league, there's no shortage of teams that can be your
rivals. And Louisville is just the latest one to step up.  
  
Q. It strikes me, you're not much different than you were when we were
having these press conferences in 1995. You're very much the same. But
everybody talks about evolving in their profession, no matter what their
profession is. Can you maybe give us some insight in how you think you might
have changed in that time period?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I believe I'm a little more cautious, a little more
apprehensive about a lot of things. I'm not as free-spirited as I think I was
back then. I think a lot of things that have happened in the last 14, 15 years
have obviously had an effect on how I view myself and my profession and what I
have to do to be successful in it.  
I can't just go about doing what I want to do when I want to do it, how I want
to do it and have fun. I gotta be somewhat miserable like the rest of the
world. Because you always gotta worry about what you say, how you say it and
how it's going to be interpreted, what you do, how you do it, who's watching.  
So in that respect I probably don't enjoy doing what I do as much as I did
back then. But at the same time I probably appreciate it even more because I
know how hard it is now. Back then I thought, come on, how hard is this? You
go to the Final Four, you win a national championship. And the more times
we've been here, the more times I've been able to experience it, the more
times we've lost at this level, the more I appreciate how difficult it is and
what goes into it.  
So I am a better coach in some ways. But anybody who gets the best players
every year like I do is always a good coach. So if this was 1995 I'd tell you
how I really feel (laughter).  
  
Q. Why has this team been able to maintain its focus throughout the season?
And is this one of the more driven teams that you've had?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, yeah. I mean, it's awfully difficult to answer a lot of
these questions, and I know they're obviously significant or you wouldn't ask
them. But it's difficult to answer a lot of these questions, because how do I
say that this team is driven more than the '95 team or more than the 2000 team
that won in Philadelphia or the 2002 team that was undefeated, or 2003 and
2004 that Di drove them?  
How do I compare that? It's a double-edged sword for us, constantly being
compared to other teams, constantly having to answer about our last loss. It's
kind of why I'm glad the Stanford game is behind us now. We don't have to
answer about our last loss. Now we just have to answer about there's no way
you can lose to this team tomorrow night.  
So there's a lot of difficult questions that I'm in a tough situation that I
can't answer them. The reason that this team is where they are is because they
have all those qualities that those other teams have: really good players,
really committed, really good role players, and they get really good coaching
from their coaching staff. Tonya did a great job for us while she was here,
certainly Chris in all the time she's been here.  
We've got nothing but national championship coaches working with these guys.
But that's all they know. So you put all that together and you almost think,
well, we should be. And when you say that, you go, You know how hard it is to
get here? It's kind of a double-edged sword for us.  
  
Q. Geno, how much of the evidence that's been presented in the first two
games with Louisville, I mean, is indisputable to people trying to evaluate
this game on the outside? And, secondly, what is the value in approaching a
game like this like Louisville is, with their mindset? How does that alter
what the truth is?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, again, it works both ways. I said this the other day, I
think, I don't know to who, but if you flip a coin and it comes up heads 10
times in a row, there's no guarantee that the 11th will be tails. They're all
individual. They're all in and of itself, its own separate act.  
So what we did to them the first game, I don't know that it had any effect on
the second game. What we did to them in the second game, I don't know that it
has any effect on today. Different environment. Different day. Different
attitudes among the players. Different emotions going through.  
So, yeah, I mean, there's no disputing the fact that we won by a lot both
times. But I don't know what that gets you. You still have to go out tomorrow
and make shots and stop them.  
If we don't make shots and we don't stop them, we're going to lose. Just like
they beat Maryland, just like they beat Oklahoma. So obviously they're really,
really good. We have to be really good. And if we are, we'll be fine.  
  
Q. My question to you, you've answered certain parts of my question before,
so I'm going to have to restyle it fairly quickly. But with Louisville, what
can sneak up on you and what can surprise you about that team that's going to
make it difficult for your players tomorrow night?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, that's the one thing that I think is a little bit of a
comfort area, that I don't know what could be considered sneaking up on us. We
know their players inside out. They know our players inside out.  
It's way too much familiarity between both teams. A lot more than you like to
have at this time of the year.  
Obviously have to see how tonight's game goes between North Carolina and
Michigan State. They're not in the same league, but they played once and the
game was really one-sided. I think they lost by 36 or something like that. I
think if somebody asks me, Would you take Michigan State at 30, I would say,
Yeah, I would. Not that I would do anything like that, but if somebody asked
me, I would.  
  
Q. What would you say tomorrow night you by 30 points, really?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Really? No, I would throw up if somebody told me that that's
what was going to happen, because then I know that that's -- exactly the
opposite is going to happen. I always think -- I think the worst. I prepare
for the best, but I think the worst.  
It's the key to being neurotic and Italian and Catholic. Something bad is
going to happen five minutes from now, tomorrow; you just count on it.  
  
Q. I know you touched on this last night, but given the special bond between
point guard and coach and also the kind of birthright it seems that the great
players need to have to win a championship while at UConn, Renee going out on
that kind of note, it's going to be a very powerful feeling within yourself
toward her these last 24 hours. Could you just explore that a little bit?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. I wish we were having this conversation Wednesday
morning or Tuesday night after the game and she was fortunate enough to do
that. But whether it was Jennifer or Sue or Di, Maria, even, to a certain
extent, I think any time you have an opportunity to win a national
championship, you can pretty much follow that trail and it leads right to the
point guard or certainly to a guard who can control the game.  
Now you add to that the special ones just transcend all the practices, all the
drills, all the Xs and Os, all the bus travel, the plane travel, film
sessions. They go above and beyond that. They're not about just, yeah, how are
we going to guard the pick-and-roll. That's so insignificant when you're
talking about those kinds of players, and certainly Renee Montgomery.  
I really admire her as a person. I really do. Even when she doesn't make a
shot, when she takes shots that I think are ill-advised, even when she didn't
talk to me for a couple of years when Tonya was her coach, I still admired
her.  
I've gotten to like her now more now that I'm her coach, and it's been a great
relationship and she's gotten to like me a little more and let me coach her.
But there's -- and if you've been around people like this, and I'm sure you
have, every great team has somebody like this on their team.  
And she's just one of those special people. But not all fairy tales end with
the prince taking the princess home and living happily ever after. Sometimes
it doesn't end right. I guess in a short period of time we'll find out. But I
don't know that I've wanted anything more than I want this.  
  
Q. Geno, the other day Jim Calhoun was talking about his '06 team that had
four or five guys go to the pros. And he said he thought that the lure of the
NBA started to affect the way they were playing. Well, this game that we have,
we probably have the top two picks in the draft, and they seem to be doing
fine. Doesn't seem to be affecting them at all. Why do you think women are
able to stay more focused, most of the time, anyway, than men?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Obviously, when we talk like that, we're talking in
generalities for the most part. And having a son and two daughters, I think
women are a little more grounded because guys are just schmoes. They just
don't get it. They just don't get it. It's so much about themselves, it's so
much about what people around them are telling them, they don't have the
backbone to stand up for themselves.  
Somebody says: Hey, you're not getting enough shots. You're not getting enough
touches. How are you going to get drafted if you don't do this. Now all of a
sudden you've got people thinking about everything but winning a national
championship or state championship, for that matter, or conference
championship.  
I think women don't have as many jerks hanging around them. There's not a lot
of people telling Renee Montgomery: Hey, you're not getting enough shots. Hey,
you're not going to be the first pick if you don't do this, this and that.
There's nobody telling Angel McCoughtry: You gotta go out tomorrow night and
you've got to be MVP of this tournament so you can be the first pick. That
just doesn't exist, I don't think.  
Now, I'm sure it does exist, I just don't think, from my experience, the
players I've had, anyway, ever have to deal with any of that. And maybe that's
why they're able to be as successful in these moments.  
But it's just a culture. It's the culture that we live in. That's how those
boys are raised from the time they're in junior high to the time they get to
wherever they're going. And it's awfully difficult to be successful in that
culture. Really difficult.  
  
Q. Two questions. First, do you want to take a second to brag about the Big
East since you have two teams in the finals and South Florida won the NIT?
And, secondly, as sad as it is, this has been considered a drought for you
guys being back here for the first time in a couple of years --  
COACH AURIEMMA: I said to somebody -- I think I know where you're going. I
said to somebody this morning. I said, Most places in America, they would go
-- you know, big headline: UConn going for their sixth national championship.
Like that's a big deal, right? I think Connecticut -- UConn, which hasn't won
an NCAA championship since 2004, and you go, Holy Jesus.  
So that's kind of -- you're right. You're like, That is a drought. Like, How
dare you? When you win three in a row and you go four years without one, it's
like, Your program has fallen off a cliff.  
So, yeah, that's -- I guess that's what we've created and that's what we've
got to live with. And it's okay, to a point, I guess.  
But one of the things that's gratifying is a few years ago we were at the Big
East meetings in Ponte Vedra, and I gotta tell you, it was one of the more
tense, contentious Big East meetings I've ever been a part of. Miami was
leaving, Virginia Tech was leaving. Boston College said they were staying,
they lied, then they were leaving. So there was a lot of emotion running
through those athletic directors, presidents, coaches.  
And the perception was you'll never be the same. You'll never be as good. It's
the end of the Big East. And now here we are X number of years later and we
have two teams in the men's Final Four. Two in the women's Final Four playing
for the national championship. That's four out of eight. You know, there's a
lot of good conferences, a lot of good schools, but I would venture to say
that the Big East is healthier, stronger, and better than it's ever been.  
And Mike Tanghese and John Marinatto and everybody in that Providence office,
I know they're probably the proudest people in the country right now for
what's happened in this conference.  
  
Q. Taking it a step further with the draft coming up on Thursday, do you
have a sense either from what you know about the league or instincts,
conversations you've had, how they may evaluate Renee and Angel on Thursday
and how that might all work out?  
COACH AURIEMMA: No. Again, I don't allow myself. We've had a couple of coaches
and a couple general managers and those people come to practice and all that.
But I'm not really involved in any of that at that point. I really don't care.  
As a matter of fact, I didn't even tell Renee that she was invited to the
draft. They want her there in person. I didn't even tell her that. I didn't
tell Maya Moore that she was AP Player of the Year. I don't tell these guys
anything. I figure in due time they'll find out. I didn't tell her that she
won the Wade Trophy. I figure in time they'll find out. When it's time for
them to know, they'll know.  
If I was a general manager and I had the draft, I don't know, obviously I
would pick Renee because I've coached Renee. But if you pick Angel McCoughtry,
how can you go wrong? I love her. I love her as a player. She does so many
things. I like Kristi Toliver. I like Courtney Paris. There's a lot of really
good players out there.  
I think a team's going to have to make their evaluations and say what's more
important to us, which position and which kind of player is there a best
chance for us to be really good. And sometimes it's not just about this year.  
If you look down, a couple years down the road, is there another player like
this coming along that if we pass on this one we'll get another one. A lot of
things go into making these decisions. Michael Jordan was picked third. Wonder
what those two guys are doing today. He's going in the Hall of Fame. The other
two guys are what? You know?  
  
Q. A lot of stars in this game. I'm wondering with your familiarity with
them what your thoughts might be on Candyce Bingham who is a player that
doesn't get a lot of --  
COACH AURIEMMA: Very overlooked and as key to their team as anybody else.
Angel just dominates the stat sheets so much. What did she get five steals
last night. They all probably led to buckets. Sometimes turnovers just go out
of bounds. When there's a turnover at Louisville there's a basket at the other
end and she's the big reason why.  
But I think Deseree' and Candyce are way overlooked. They're probably the
reasons why they're in the Final Four and playing for a national championship
game. As good as Angel has been, I think since this tournament has started,
and especially Deseree', I think those people have stepped up their game so
much that it's allowed people to -- you can't just concentrate on Angel
McCoughtry.  
So I've often believed that those players, those other players that nobody's
talking about, are going to be the ones that are going to decide the game. And
I love both of those two kids. They're exceptional competitors and they're
tough kids.  
And that second game at the Civic Center was a little bit of a slugfest. I got
a feeling the referees are going to have their hands full tomorrow night.  
  
Q. You've been in this situation before. How does an undefeated record
change things?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Not that much. Right now that's not the issue for them, for
me, because if you had three losses you wouldn't approach it any different
than you approach it now. If you had 10 losses, you wouldn't approach tomorrow
any different than you approach it.  
What's in the past is in the past. Being undefeated is a big deal to everybody
else as you go through the season. It becomes a big deal to you if you finish
the regular season and then the tournament undefeated and look back and go,
whoa, that was unbelievable. As you're going along it really doesn't enter
into it.  
If tomorrow we're more worried about being undefeated than winning one game, I
don't know that that's going to be the winning edge for us.  
  
Q. Is there a pressure element at all, do you compartmentalize it and get it
out of the way?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, there's pressure in everything we do. I criticize our
guys the way they eat breakfast. So there's pressure in everything we do, in
every pass, every drill, every time we do anything.  
So the pressure to win at Connecticut is great. Maybe too great. But without
pressure you can't be great. So we love the pressure. We embrace it and we run
with it.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you, Coach.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Louisville  61  
Oklahoma - 59

  
AMY YAKOLA: I am pleased to be joined at the podium by Louisville head coach
Jeff Walz as well as student-athletes Candyce Bingham, Angel McCoughtry and
Becky Burke.  
Coach, when you're ready, let's have an opening statement.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you. Well, I'm not sure what to say. Just a group of kids in
that locker room that I challenged at halftime as much as I could have
challenged a group. I told Angel McCoughtry it was the worst I've seen her
play. She was an embarrassment.  
And that's the way we do things in our program, we're honest. And she came out
in the second half and played the way she's supposed to play, and I'm so proud
of her, and Candyce Bingham sitting next to me, she played for all -- every
second she was on the floor she played.  
It was a game that we just had to dig down. I thought we did a good job in the
first half of defending when we got them in the half court. But,
unfortunately, they scored on transition point after point, and that was just
killing us.  
So it was just a crazy game. And I gotta give a lot of respect to Oklahoma and
Coach Coale. Those kids came out and battled, too. It's one of those you hate
to see anyone lose, but we're really excited about things, and we're playing
on Tuesday.  
AMY YAKOLA: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Angel, how are you feeling? Holding your heart?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I'm feeling great. Gosh, nobody expected us to be here right
now. It feels so good to prove everybody wrong. I'm not going to call anybody
out this time.  
But I'm so proud of these girls. And we believed. Halftime we were down. That
shows a lot of heart to come back and play against this Oklahoma team who have
a lot of great players and to come out with the win. It's a lot of heart right
there.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, Candyce, you talk about those last free throws and the
last couple 10 seconds or so in the game?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: Well, I am a little mad that I missed the last one. But Mo
hustled and she tipped the ball, which took a couple of seconds off. But, I
mean, it was great, when the Oklahoma players -- we went in and out, we were
so excited.  
So like Angel said, this team showed a lot of heart. I mean, we did not give
up and we believed in every single person and Becky came out and hit big
shots. It was a great team win.  
  
Q. What was going through your mind, Angel, when you saw that last shot in
the air?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I said, oh, Lord, I said, I need to be over there. And all I
could do was just pause and watch and pray and hope that it didn't go in,
because if they made that, that's another Rutgers game for us, type game. And
that would have been devastating. But at the same time I would have had no
regrets, and I felt like we all laid it on the line. I've had a great season
and no complaints.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the first nine shots you guys missed in the game and
what was going on and what you were feeling as you're getting into a hole
there?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: Well, I think that just shows you that we're not aliens,
we're human. And I'm so glad to know that we are human. But you know what,
they played great defense. I think we just had those jitters that we just had
to relax and get out of. And I think it took us to the second half to get out
of it, which is sad.  
But we cannot allow that next game. We gotta come out strong for the next
game.  
  
Q. Angel, I want to follow up a little bit and talk about Oklahoma's defense
in the first half and specifically Whitney Hand. I think people would look at
an All-American being defended by a freshman and think that that might be an
easier task than it turned out to be. She really battled a lot, especially in
that first half.  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: Yeah, she's the heart and soul of that team and a freshman
isn't going to start for no reason.  
She hit three 3s on us, and, I mean, our job was really to contain her,
because she makes that team go.  
And I totally commend Oklahoma. They're a great team. And Courtney Paris is a
great friend of mine, and I really respect her. So I just had to like settle
down and just take my time. Second half I said to myself, you know what, we
got this, let's just take our time, do what Coach asked us to do because we
weren't following the game plan in the first half. Once we followed Coach's
game plan, then things started going our way.  
So we believe you now, Coach (laughter).  
  
Q. Candyce, what was the plan to stop? They have such great players, what
were you trying to do to slow them down in there?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: Well, we were trying to locate Hand and obviously we didn't
do a good job of that in the first half. Then just when Courtney Paris got on
the low block to double them, and just trying to keep them off the boards, and
they got some really quick guards, so just kind of tried to contain them, too.  
  
Q. Becky, what were you trying to do against Whitney, particularly in the
second half, and the two 3s you hit, you guys just throw from the outside,
talk about those shots you made.  
BECKY BURKE: In the second half we played a little claw and one -- or I mean
claw and two and box and ones. And I was on Hand. These guys had to get their
screens, just stay on each other, try to let her not let her touch the ball as
much as possible.  
And as far as my shots, I wasn't hitting anything, but in Raleigh I got a
little upset when I wasn't hitting shots so Coach got on me. I was going to
stay positive and kept shooting because that's what I'm out there to do is to
shoot and I eventually I knew one was going to go in. And I'm glad a couple
went in at the end there.  
  
Q. Candyce, can you talk about what was the feeling in being in the middle
of that celebration there? And you've had a lot of celebrations this year, but
this one is to go to the final game.  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: Again, I'm kind of speechless. But, I mean, it feels great.
Knowing that we were down 12 at halftime and we always looked to Angel and she
didn't even have a good first half. But to know that we were still pretty much
in the game.  
I mean, we didn't even play a great first half. We were only down 12. So just
to know everybody came together and we played a good second half. I mean, it
was a really good feeling. And nobody believed in us, so that makes it even
better.  
  
Q. Candyce, what did Coach say to you about the free throws before you took
them, if anything? What did he say in the last huddle? And just being from
Louisville and having Louisville play in this game, how did it make you
feeling?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: He just winked at me and said knocked them down and smiled.
And I'm sorry I missed that second one. What was your second question?  
  
Q. Being from Louisville.  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: It's great being from Louisville and being a part of this.
Words can't describe how I feel right now.  
  
Q. Angel, during the first half, there's something that played on the big
screen and each of the players were shouting out little things about this team
and one of the comments was Cinderella Team. What's your response to that
now?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I wouldn't really say we're Cinderella, because I think
we're just as good as any of these teams. Even though I was mad about the
commercial. They're going to have to change that for the next one, okay? I
mean, they were spoiling us from getting a national championship, too.  
But I wouldn't think of us as a Cinderella, we're just as good as any of those
teams and we want to be considered just as good as those teams, even though we
weren't.  
  
Q. Angel and Candyce, if it is Connecticut that you're playing, given the
two previous games, what kind of a different mindset do you have to take into
this one?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: Well, we know Connecticut is a great team. And a big upset,
Big East, and if we have two Big East teams in there it's really good for our
conference. We're glad to have two Big East teams in the national
championship. We have a lot of respect for Geno and his program, and we're
just going to come out, play hard. We know what to expect. We played them
twice, we're going to come out and play hard and hope to win.  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: UConn is a good team. If they do come out and win, we'll just
approach it like any other game. Coaches will put a good game plan together
and our job will be to execute it.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. It's easy when you've got the stage that we're playing on tonight to
forget that these are very young ladies we're talking about here. Talk about
the emotion of your players. I'm thinking about the block that Angel got and
her reaction and the anger that we saw in Byrd's face when she picked up her
fourth foul, and how you kind of used that to your advantage without letting
it get out of control in a situation like this.  
COACH WALZ: We are on a huge stage. And I told the kids when they came out for
the first hour, when the court opened, to just kind of stop and take four or
five minutes to look around and enjoy it, because it's an opportunity that we
hope to get back here many times. But I've got two great seniors on this team.
This is it for them.  
So I wanted to make sure they really soaked it all in and realized what we've
done. And we play with emotion all season. We do a pretty good job of trying
to corral it in to make sure it doesn't get overboard.  
That's why I took Angel out in the first half. I knew her emotion was getting
the best of her. And I sat her down, you know? And I thought after she came
out, then she went back in, I thought she started to let things come to her
more.  
  
Q. Just talk about your emotion, what you were thinking as Mo tried to get
that -- kind of took a little time there for them to get the ball and then
when the shot was in the air?  
COACH WALZ: Monique did an outstanding job. I thought Mo came in and played
her tail off, especially when Keshia picked up that fourth foul. She was doing
most of the work on Courtney Paris.  
And I thought Mo was going to be able to grab that thing and if they could
have got it they're going to foul her and we're back at the line. But the one
thing that concerns you about that is exactly what happened to us, is Mo is
out there scrambling for it and my other four decided to watch her.  
And Oklahoma gets the ball, throws it up the floor and we've got nobody within
about eight feet of her. And she got a great look. And it was one of those all
game, when we went our triangle and 2, I was going to make Stevenson beat us.
And she had some clean looks, and she made a big 3 late. When that shot went
up, I did think it was going in because it looked good from where I was
sitting.  
  
Q. There's a guy from Louisville named Ali who had a Rope-a-Dope strategy.
Was that a little bit at least the way the game started, do you think? You
think you maybe got Oklahoma lulled a little bit?  
COACH WALZ: That's not exactly the way I scripted it, I will tell you that.
But I told my staff before the game started: I was concerned about the first
five minutes of the game. If we could stay within -- if we could stay within
the first five minutes I felt good about things.  
And they were up I think 11-0. And at half we go in 34-22. So we're only
trailing by one after that first five minutes of the half. I felt good about
things. I told our kids if we'll follow the game plan, we have a chance to
win.  
And we came out in the second half and followed it and knocked down some shots
and was more patient at the offensive end. So I promise you on Tuesday I hope
we don't come out like that.  
  
Q. Jeff, again, if it is UConn that you play Tuesday night, how do you, I
don't know if convince is the right word, but how do you take these girls into
that game knowing what's happened in the two previous games?  
COACH WALZ: Well, you know, it's one of those, you're playing for the national
championship on Tuesday night. So it doesn't matter what the scores have been
in the past. We have to come out and play. Our game at UConn, you know, we
played competitively for 12 minutes, which is encouraging.  
So we've got to just look at some of that and take the positive from it. And
our game in the Big East finals, they got us right from the start. It's the
same thing, I told my staff at that one, too: First five minutes is going to
be crucial.  
And they really took it to us, and we missed some shots that you have to make
if you want to compete with a team like that. Because they're a special team.  
  
Q. What was your focus during the halftime message and also did you change
anything defensively in the second half?  
COACH WALZ: No, I can't repeat what the focus was. To be honest with you, I
told them -- I went in there. I just said, If you all want to play your own
game, that's fine, and then we'll pack up and go home.  
You know, because we put a game plan together as a staff. And I thought it was
a solid one. And I told them, If you want to come out here in the second half
and compete and follow our game plan, tell me.  
And they're all like, Yeah, we will, we will. And I thought we did a great
job. We held them to a 27 percent shooting in the second half compared to 42
in the first.  
  
Q. Coach, you took two timeouts early in the first half. The first I think
at 11-0 didn't seem to work, then called another one at 16-2 which I think was
the low point. What happened in that second timeout that kind of turned things
around?  
COACH WALZ: You know, I tried to talk to them about their body language.
Deseree' Byrd, who has been a leader for us the entire tournament, was
starting to show frustration at the point. When she starts to show that it
rubs off on everybody.  
I tried to calm her down. I tried to calm Angel down. Candyce was really the
only one that stepped up the entire night and played. And we had some good
shots. I mean, Keshia Hines who played her butt off gets 10 boards and 19
minutes of play. She air-balled a 1-footer. We couldn't have gotten her any
closer.  
I knew it was just tightness. It was jitters. So I was going to burn them off.
I had to, just to try and get our team calmed down. And I just am really,
really proud how we responded.  
  
Q. You're talking about how you felt sort of at halftime, did you draw back
to 2006 when you were actually in worst shape against Duke in that title game
with Maryland?  
COACH WALZ: No, you know what, I didn't even think about that at all. It was
just one of those that I felt good that we were only down 12, because we could
have been down 20.  
So I felt good about things, because when we got them in the half court, we
actually guarded them. The problem was their transition game was killing us.
And then we lose Whitney Hand three times in the first half and she hits three
3s and then we hold her -- I think she got two points in the second half at
the free throw line, because I thought that kid was the key to their team. And
we really contained her. And then that kind of stopped their offense from
going.  
  
Q. What do you think the key was to limiting Courtney Paris's touches?  
COACH WALZ: We did a great job of playing in front of her. We had help coming
from the backside. That's all we did all night. We talked about it. We worked
on it for four days. And that's why I was so upset in the first half because
we spent four days on a game plan, and I promise you, I guarantee you half the
fans out there were wondering what we had done for four days, because it was
embarrassing.  
  
Q. You had a couple of freshmen and you have so many young players coming up
and doing things in such a magnitude of a game. What accounts for that and
these freshmen being able to make the plays they're making?  
COACH WALZ: It's a group of freshmen -- I told them when they came in I wasn't
going to treat them like freshmen. You know, it was going to be tough. And
it's been a tough haul for some of them. But they've gotten a lot tougher over
this past three months.  
And Becky Burke is one, you know, she missed a 3 and coming out of the timeout
she goes, Coach, I'm going to make one. I said, I know you are, keep shooting
them. She went back and hit back to back from that corner that really gave us
a lift.  
And Monique Reid played so well for us. You know, we just got kids -- I told
them, everybody has a role and they're starting to believe if they do their
role we have a chance to win.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you, Coach.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Connecticut  83  
Stanford - 64

  
AMY YAKOLA: Joined up here by head coach Gene Auriemma, as well as student-
athletes Maya Moore and Renee Montgomery. Coach.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, all I can say is going into this game I was very nervous
about how we were going to be able to guard Jayne Appel and how we were going
to defend Stanford in general.  
I wasn't that concerned about how many points we would score. I thought we
could get our shots. But I can't say enough about the defensive effort that
these kids put forth tonight. And these two players right here were just
unbelievable, and they just were determined to play one more game, to be in
Tuesday night's game.  
I said to Renee, I wanted you to play in your last game of your college career
to be the last game. And this is the first time that she's had a chance to do
that, and I'm really happy for her, as I am for everybody else on our team.  
AMY YAKOLA: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Renee, sum up your individual performance as well as your thoughts about
getting to the title game, please.  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: My thought process was simple the whole game. Coach broke it
down, just get a score and a stop. And the whole time, every time they shot
the ball, if it went in or didn't go in, I was thinking we've got to get the
ball up the floor quick.  
That was my thought process the whole game, and we have to get a lot of stops
and pressure the ball on defense.  
  
Q. Thoughts on the title game?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I'm excited to have another Big East championship game.
That's exciting. I know they're definitely not going to be the same team we
played before. Everyone gets better and everyone plays a whole lot better in
the tournament.  
So right now both of us are 1-0. And I'm happy for another Big East team to
make it to the championship game, and me and Angel have been talking along the
tournament and we actually was hoping each other would meet, and I guess now,
you know, we did it and may the best one win.  
  
Q. Renee and Maya, how satisfying was this win for you considering that they
knocked you out last year and maybe both of you didn't have your best games
against them?  
MAYA MOORE: It feels good to make progress. And I feel as a whole our team is
better, and we were more prepared this year to compete against Stanford.  
And we knew coming in that they were going to fight. They were going to be
disciplined. They were going to run. They were going to be aggressive, as you
saw. They didn't stop the whole game. They crashed the boards, they ran the
floor hard.  
If anything, we knew what we had to do to beat Stanford. So I'm just happy the
way everybody contributed tonight. If you look at the stats, really balanced
and I couldn't ask for anything more than just everybody stepping up and doing
what they're good at.  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I completely agree. I just think that I'm just excited about
how my teammates stepped up in the big moments just to get us here. I think
everybody came in, they knew what they had to do and everyone did their part
no matter how big or small it was. That's just the most fulfilling part.  
  
Q. Maya, can you just address the defensive effort on their role players
compared to last year, how you shut down Pohlen and Pedersen and Harmon, they
killed you last year, and what were you able to do this year that you weren't
able to do last year?  
MAYA MOORE: That was part of the game plan, too, make sure we guard the
3-point line. Which I thought we did a very good job of up until a little bit
in the second half. Because that's what hurt us last year.  
They were getting inside with Jayne, she's a great player, she's going to
score. We tried to make it tough for her. But if other people start getting
involved, it gives the whole team momentum that way. So we just tried to do a
good job recovering back on them, trying to make it tough for them, pressuring
them, and it worked.  
  
Q. Renee, do you ever surprise yourself with your capacity to come up big in
important situations like this?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I think it's just practice. I think every day in practice I
practice to be able to step up in the big moments, and that's why you put
yourself in every drill, to be able to, when your teammates need you, hit the
big shot or drive.  
You just feel completely comfortable and ready when you've practiced hard
every day to come in in a big game and perform. I think it's just work ethic
that gives you confidence. So, yeah, it's definitely work ethic.  
  
Q. Maya, you guys talked up here yesterday about how uncomfortable Stanford
made you last year. Do you feel like you guys made them uncomfortable early in
the game tonight?  
MAYA MOORE: I like to think so. I was really proud of my teammates for just
stepping up and just really putting pressure on the guards and doing a good
job of trying to help each other.  
I think one of the best moments in the game was the ball was on the sideline
in front of their bench and Renee I think Kalana or Tiffany, you guys just
trapped and just pressured the guards. It was the game plan executed
perfectly.  
So just for Coach to come and tell us to do something and we go out and do it,
it just feels great. Especially right here in the Final Four.  
  
Q. Maya, can you just talk about the sense of comfort you have playing with
Renee when she's locked in the way she was today?  
MAYA MOORE: It feels great, just to know that even when I make a crazy
decision or throw up a horrible shot I know Renee's going to come back the
next time and make something good happen.  
So she definitely -- her presence on the court gives us confidence, and when
she comes in and plays like herself, is patient, aggressive, attacks the hole,
everybody, just lifts everybody. That's an important part of our team, our
point guard, and I really feel like she's led us this way, and we have all the
confidence in the world in her.  
  
Q. Maya, it was 14-13. What was Stanford doing early on and what did you
guys do defensively to stop them and go on that run?  
MAYA MOORE: In the beginning of the game, both teams are going to battle. It's
one of those things where we just can't get -- try to get a 20-point lead off
of one shot.  
So it was going up and down. Stanford was running the floor really hard. And
we had to adjust to that and get back in transition. They were getting some
transition buckets. Once we started containing them that way, that helped
defensively, and then offensively we just found an open guy. Tiffany hit some
big shots, Kalana hit some big shots. When everybody's contributing like that,
our momentum just swings and that's when the lead -- we separate from other
teams.  
  
Q. Renee, how much was last year's game against Stanford like just in the
back of your mind all season long, like as you went through all those drills
and did all the hard work to get back here?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: Stanford wasn't the only team on our minds. You think back
to all of our losses, that was probably the only team in her mind because it
was her first loss in the tournament. But I think back to when we lost to Duke
and LSU, you don't forget losses. Stanford was the most fresh loss, but you
just think back to all the years where you fell short.  
And you just push yourself harder because you know you need that extra 2
percent in the Final Four. You need that extra everything when it comes down
to the Final Four. And we kept on falling short. So you have to change
something when you're not successful, and I think all the losses that I've had
in my career just got me to where we are here today.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you both. Congratulations. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you know Renee so well. Do you have a sense -- when you see
her before a game or you chat with her before a game, can you read her mind,
you know what she's thinking? Do you have a sense of what she might do over
the next 40 minutes?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Pretty much. I think we all do on our team, all of our coaches
are very aware of that. It's not just right before the game, it's the day
leading up to the game. It's everything that she does.  
A performance like tonight is almost what I've come to expect from Renee in
any meaningful, big game, because that's who she is. And she's absolutely
right about -- I don't think there was a drill this year at any one time that
I can remember where she didn't treat that drill like it was for the national
championship.  
Every dribble move, every coming off a screen, you know, every single thing
that she did was at that level every day. And when you do that, as she said,
you expect to be in this position. And that's what you're planning for.  
She's Renee Montgomery, you know? She's just really good.  
  
Q. Geno, 38 games in, does this team continue to impress you by the way it
executes and responds in situations such as this?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. Yeah. We talked about that before the game. We talked
about that when you believe in yourself and you believe in each other and in
the group how you know that the person sitting next to you and the one behind
you and the one in front of you have all invested the exact same amount and
are going to be there for you, it's a real comfort level. It's something that
all great teams share and it allows you to withstand the other teams making
shots, your missing shots.  
It allows you to withstand anything. They're just really intertwined and
really connected right now and they have been since September. My job's been
much easier this year than the last three or four years in terms of knowing
that they're ready to play.  
  
Q. Geno, last time you were in St. Louis, it was a similar situation. First
half you dominated. It was 13 or in that range and you guys didn't come out in
the second half and finish the job. Did you bring that up with them or compare
how this team was able to come out in that second half and just lock up on
them defensively and take this game over?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Actually, I didn't bring up our game with Notre Dame in 2001.
In the locker room I brought up the Louisville/Oklahoma game that was played
right before us. Oklahoma is up 12 and we're up 13, and at this time of the
year, you know, there's no recovering from a bad five, six, seven, eight, ten
minutes. There's no getting it back.  
So I thought if we would come out in the second half and put together a real
good five-minute spurt that it would be hard for Stanford to come back from
that. And they helped us. I mean, they missed some shots and we took advantage
of it.  
But I haven't really mentioned anything about the Notre Dame game back here in
2001. We're on the same bench as we were then. We're in the same locker room
as we were then. There's a lot of similarities. But I'm trying not to burden
them with that.  
  
Q. How satisfying is it to get back a win from a team that beat you last
time?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I like Tara, you know? And I respect what she's done and I've
always had great admiration for the way she coaches and the kids she gets to
go to Stanford and play. And so that really didn't enter any of it. No more
satisfaction beating Stanford than it would have been Oklahoma or Louisville
in the semifinal game.  
The feelings are more about I don't want this team to come up short. I don't
want them to stop playing. I wanted them to be in the championship game. Who
we had to play to get there was really not even an afterthought. I was more
scared and more nervous rather than looking for some satisfaction for beating
them.  
They're a hard team to play against, and any time you beat Stanford, you've
accomplished a great deal.  
  
Q. Since you brought up the Oklahoma/Louisville game at half, how astonished
or breathtaking was Louisville's comeback in that second half, and does that
familiarity give you any sense of what exactly going into the championship
game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I wish we were playing anybody but Louisville Tuesday night.
Anybody. I don't care who. And the reason I say that is -- at least we're
going to have a Big East national champion. So that's a good thing.  
The bad thing is the last team you want to play is a team that you beat the
way we beat them the two times we played them. And especially the last time we
played them.  
So when I saw what they did today, I was not surprised. I wasn't surprised
they beat Maryland. I wasn't surprised they got here. We've seen them play.
I've seen what Angel can do, by herself, just take over games.  
For them to only be down 12 and she hadn't scored yet, you know, Oklahoma's in
trouble. They're up 12, but they're in trouble because Angel hasn't scored
yet.  
So the familiarity works both ways, you know? They know us as much as we know
them.  
  
Q. Is this the most satisfying get to the championship game since you have
Renee who hasn't been there before? I mean, you've had a lot of titles and a
lot of teams make to it the championship, but is there something about her
that this is for her to get a championship and put her name with the other
incredible players to come through UConn?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, yeah, I've kind of felt that from the very first one. I
don't mean to go into the history of Connecticut basketball, but in 1991 I
just wanted to go to the Final Four because I had a couple seniors that were
just responsible for building our program.  
Then in '95 I really wanted Rebecca Lobo to go out as a national champion. And
the same with Sue and the same with Diana. You love when your best players,
the ones that have given their heart and soul to your program and have
accomplished so many things for themselves individually, for your team, for
their teammates, I don't think there's anything greater than winning your last
college game. I don't know that there's anything that could possibly top that.  
And I tell my players this all the time. It's not about me or my coaches or
the University of Connecticut or the fans that are out here. They might not
want to hear that, but it's not about that. Because if we were playing in
front of nobody at midnight, it would still be the same. It's about the
players that are doing it and how they're going to remember their experience
at Connecticut.  
If you're Renee Montgomery and we would be fortunate enough to win Tuesday
night, that would be like waking up from a dream with a smile on your face for
the rest of your life. I just can't imagine that it could get any better than
that.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you, Coach.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Connecticut  83  
Stanford - 64

  
AMY YAKOLA: Joined by Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer as well as student-
athletes Jayne Appel and Jillian Harmon.  
Coach, when you're ready, an opening statement.  
COACH VANDERVEER: First, I'd just like to congratulate Connecticut on a great
game. They have a terrific team, and I thought it was a really outstanding
individual performance by Renee Montgomery.  
And, second, I'd like to just extend my congratulations to Stanford and to
especially Jill and Jayne being up here, having just a fabulous season, a team
I'm really proud of. And I really liked how our team battled. This was a very
tough night for us.  
We did not shoot the ball well at all. We struggled turning the ball over. We
worked very hard defensively, and were in great position and took away a lot
of the things we needed to do. They still made some shots.  
And our team, especially with the leadership of Jill and Jayne, competed for
40 minutes and represented themselves and our team and our university in a way
that I'm exceedingly proud of.  
AMY YAKOLA: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jayne, through much of the first half and a fair portion of the second
half, they seemed to have you playing much further out from the basket than
I've seen in the last five games I've watched you. Late in the game you were
able to get much closer to the hoop. And the scoring picked up. What were they
doing and what changed?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think they came out with a game plan to be very physical,
always have a body on me and push me out away from the block. As the game went
on I just kept trying, kept trying to get in as deep as possible and as close
to the basket as possible. Just kept trying to wear them down, I guess, and
tried to give myself the best opportunity to score.  
  
Q. Jill, was it a frustrating start? There were some quick turnovers and you
guys were having trouble moving the ball around. Then it was 14-13, then they
went on a run. Was that not the start obviously that you guys wanted?  
JILLIAN HARMON: It was definitely a disappointing start. UConn is a great team
and they played a great game. They hit shots. We didn't hit many shots. But
I'm so proud of the way our team stayed with it. We were positive for the
whole 40 minutes, and it's an honor to be a part of this team.  
  
Q. Jill, can you just talk about this being your last game?  
JILLIAN HARMON: I don't know how -- it's been a great four years. I couldn't
have asked more. The best coaches in the world. Best teammates. To have it
come to an end is a bit surreal. I was balling my eyes out in the locker room
not because we lost the game but because I can't play with these ladies again.
But I know they'll come back next year and hopefully be at the Final Four and
hopefully I'll be here to watch.  
  
Q. Jill, can you step back and play coach for a second. What would you tell
your teammates for next year?  
JILLIAN HARMON: Just to work on things they need to work on, to remember this
loss and have it motivate them. I think our loss last year in the championship
game really motivated us just to improve.  
And I know everyone on our team can do that. And I know this team will be back
strong.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Will you talk about those first maybe 10 minutes of the game, how things
went and what kind of hole it put you in?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think, well, first of all, as somebody already mentioned,
it was extremely physical, in terms of the amount of contact on Jayne. I mean,
just -- every time she came down totally pushing her off the block.  
And so that created a situation where she then -- she was easier to double
because she was closer to the perimeter people. And we did turn it over. We
did miss shots that we needed to make.  
I thought we were doing a really good job defensively. We rebounded well, but
our offense was -- we were taken out of our offense by the physicality inside.
And they're extremely aggressive and quick on the perimeter.  
And we just, you know -- we took some bad shots, I thought, early. Some quick
shots. We missed some shots that we needed to make. And we had too many
turnovers.  
At the same time, they did go -- they went on a run where like one time we
just totally lost Montgomery. And honestly, for their team, they really
capitalized on anytime -- for the most part anytime someone was open -- like
the first play of the game, Hayes was left open. She knocked down a 3.  
And we weren't open that much. But we have to help ourselves more by knocking
down shots and making free throws. There's certain things that as a team we
have to do to be able to stay in it.  
We had some open shots we needed to knock down. Had some free throws that we
needed to knock down.  
  
Q. Coach, Nnemkadi spent more time on the bench than she typically does in a
game. Was it part of your strategy to sort of pick up more guard play?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Are you talking about Nnemkadi Ogwumike? Nnemkadi Ogwumike
played really well. And she's averaging about 25 minutes. She played about the
amount of time that she was playing. Defensively it was the toughest matchup
for her guarding Maya Moore. And a couple times she asked for a sub. She's
young and she was tired. But I thought she did a great job when she was in
there.  
And also some of the things that they were giving us were kind of more to be
spread out, and for her to make better decisions on the perimeter and I think
as she gets more experience, to be able to hit more of a high post shot and a
perimeter shot, I thought she did a great job for us. So she rebounded. She
scored. And she really competed well for the time she was in there.  
  
Q. Can you just reflect on the whole season? You lost your best player,
Candice Wiggins, to graduation, lost your point guard but yet you made it to
the semifinal game. And even though this was a bad loss, at this point can you
put it all in perspective?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I mean, Connecticut is a terrific team. One of the
disappointments that I had was as soon as I looked at the bracket -- in some
ways it's like, I mean, I really feel like we could compete on a really good
basis with the other two teams that were here, whether it's Oklahoma. But
Connecticut was head and shoulders above us tonight.  
And what I wanted to make sure with our team was this one game in some ways
did define us but in some ways it did not define us.  
The best thing that happened was the fact that when things were not going our
way, our kids really -- they stayed with things really well. They competed.
They weren't sniping at each other. They didn't have excuses when they came to
the bench.  
I was so proud of that. Now, it was very difficult. We didn't do some of the
things that we needed to do or we wanted to do.  
But we've really grown up a lot this season. And to have Jayne in there. She
really was an All-American in how she kept demanding the ball. Totally getting
bodied out and stayed with things really well.  
We have a very, very young team and we do not have the guard leadership that
Connecticut had. I thought Jeanette filled in really well, but there were
times tonight when we just didn't have the let's set things up and let's run
things that we needed.  
But for the whole season, for our team to be playing in the Final Four with
what we've been through, I'm exceedingly proud. I just can't even -- I have to
pinch myself, say, We're in the Final Four. And I just think that our team
will build on this experience and it will set in that, wow, you get here, and
we want to do better.  
  
Q. You've been coaching for a while. How good is this Connecticut team?
There's been four other undefeated teams in the history of this sport. You've
seen a bunch of them, if not all of them. How good is this team? Where does it
fit in?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Tonight, I thought they played really well tonight. They
don't have -- maybe they don't have a lot of depth, but they don't need it.
They play Renee Montgomery. They shoot the ball really well. And they defended
us very well. They're extremely aggressive. They are extremely athletic.  
I don't know about the hyperbole about the greatest team, whatever, whatever.
It's comparing -- how can you compare? How can have you Diana Taurasi come
back with that team? Geno would know best.  
But they're on a mission. And I think coming out and beating them last year,
they've dedicated themselves. Renee Montgomery has improved tremendously. Maya
Moore is a great player. But I think she was really the difference-maker, and
I told Geno after, I said, That's the Player of the Year right there. She's
phenomenal.  
And their whole team, they stepped up and made plays that they had to make,
and they don't make a lot of mistakes. They don't take bad shots. They play
within the flow of the game and they play with a purpose.  
  
Q. You mentioned in a conference several days ago your preference for not
coaching an undefeated team and how you're uncomfortable with that and your
ability to take lessons from defeats. With a young team and so many players
returning next year, what lessons do you think those young players can take
out of this defeat today?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that's a great question. I mean, what they saw today
either out there or from the bench was a team that has great athleticism, but
they're in terrific shape. They run, and they set screens. They're very
physical.  
I think that they're very skilled. The ability to put the ball on the floor
and go to the basket. We had players go in and the ball was taken right away.
I think players on our team are going to -- if we want to be at this level, if
we want to compete for a national championship, I think there are a lot of
young players who can say, boy, I can get in the gym and I can improve and I
can help our team. And hopefully either from not playing or from even playing
and saying I can do better, I can help our team more.  
Being better 3-point shooters, we didn't shoot the ball well from 3. We
weren't as physical as we needed to be. So, again, this is -- Connecticut's a
young team in a way, take away Renee Montgomery, they've got a lot of young
players, too.  
In order for us to compete with them, we're going to have to really work hard
in the off-season in the same way they did.  
  
Q. I know it's very soon after a loss. But do you have two or three things
in your mind that you know you want to work on for next season with the group
you've got coming back?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that there are some real positives to be gained from
this game, I think, anytime you come to the Final Four. But I think that
people will leave with a sense of feeling great accomplishment of coming, but
a great disappointment in not playing better.  
I would say the number one -- we have to shoot the ball better. We have to
take care of the ball. We have to be in better condition to be able to run. We
have to be better skilled in handling the ball and less turnovers, knocking
down shots. And through our season we have not shot the ball well from the
perimeter. And that's something that we have to improve.  
But I think that that's something that we can do. And players will put the
time into that. But I would just say basic skills. Fundamental skills of ball
handling, passing, shooting, conditioning, and putting time in in the off-
season.  
  
Q. Following up what you just said. When you get in the Pac-10, you've got
two other teams that are pretty high level with you, you've got others that
are developing. And you go for that long stretch. And I think of some earlier
years, the Texas teams and the Southwest conference that play well early and
not see a lot, and then you don't see it until you get here. Would it be
helpful to like get an out-of-conference game in late February or just give a
team a sense of what's ahead?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Our schedule next year is really as competitive, but we
don't have that gap. We played Cal in the first game. So we played two games
all the way through with the Pac-10. And I think the Pac-10 -- I don't feel
that the Pac-10 did not get us ready. I will say this, the physical play that
was allowed in this game was different than what -- but I've said that all
year long. When we came back East and we played Duke, we had Eric on that
game. When we played Tennessee. Next year we're opening at Old Dominion.
Rutgers, we play Tennessee, Duke, Gonzaga, Utah.  
We go to Connecticut. We're starting a home and away with Connecticut. So
we're playing as tough a schedule as an assistant coach could give a head
coach. So I think the main thing for us is to at this point be able to take
positive things from our trip here, and I think our team will.  
And it's been a phenomenal experience. We're thrilled to be here. We want to
compete better, but I'm really proud of our team and how well we've done.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 4, 2009

  

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

### [Whitney Hand](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19708)

### [Ashley Paris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16964)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Oklahoma head coach Sherri Coale, as well as
student-athletes Ashley Paris and Whitney Hand. Coach, if you could give us an
opening statement.  
COACH COALE: Thank you very much. We're honored to be here, honored to be
competing in this Final Four in St. Louis, looking forward to the challenges
that lie ahead and very appreciative of the opportunity.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Ashley, after four years of working, working, working, what does it mean
to you to finally get to a Final Four?  
ASHLEY PARIS: It means a lot. And Courtney obviously has been here every year
for the All-America awards and she's always talked to me about how cool it is
and how much it hurts not to be here and be an All-American.  
But just how exciting it is for those girls who are All-Americans and playing.
So just to be here is unreal. And I don't feel like there's any better way to
end my career, any group of people that, better people that I could have been
around. So this is just fun, real and exciting for me.  
  
Q. Ashley and Whitney, if you could talk about the challenge ahead what you
know about Louisville and this is a program that's new to the Final Four. Is
it hard facing a team that's seen somewhat as an underdog?  
WHITNEY HAND: Yeah, definitely. I think Louisville is a great program. I think
they've gained some momentum in the tournament and they're definitely on a
roll and I think they're playing with some sense of urgency that we haven't
seen really from them yet in this tournament.  
So I think they're definitely on a roll, and I think Angel McCoughtry is one
of the best players in the country, and she's definitely difficult to contain
and they just play really well around her.  
So they're definitely going to be a hard matchup, but they're playing well
right now.  
ASHLEY PARIS: It is kind of hard because they consider themselves underdogs
and they play with that the world's against us mentality and it's hard to play
against. And Angel is a talented player, but they obviously have some great
pieces that go along with her. They mix stuff up on defense and offense and
they're just a very talented team. So it's going to be a great game, I think.  
  
Q. Ashley, can you talk about the matchup with McCoughtry, what a difficult
matchup she is being a pretty big girl who also plays outside and how you guys
might try to defend her?  
ASHLEY PARIS: She is a difficult matchup, because she's a very talented player
and she can score the basketball in a lot of ways, but I feel like we have a
lot of guys who can try to contain her. I feel, yeah, she's a bigger guard,
but Amanda and Whitney are six foot.  
So I just feel like with our guards, I feel like they can do a pretty solid
job of trying to slow her down a bit?  
  
Q. Ashley, Courtney's not here so you can talk about her sort of behind her
back. What is it that you do better on the court and what is it that you are
better than her at off the court?  
ASHLEY PARIS: Off the court, I'm better than her at pretty much everything
(laughter), except for like being annoying and stuff that you don't want to be
better at. On the court, I don't know, it's hard to say. I feel like I really
complement her game and I think that comes with playing with her all my life.  
And naturally I feel like I'm a little bit more mobile than she is and a
little bit more versatile than she is.  
  
Q. Follow-up, you mentioned the mobility. Has that helped? I read somewhere
that you lost some weight over the summer. Do you attribute being a little bit
more mobile to losing the weight or how has that affected your game?  
ASHLEY PARIS: Definitely. I feel like I have more endurance and just I'm
quicker up and down the court and I'm able to be out on the perimeter and give
our guards some room to penetrate and Courtney more room to work on the post.
Yeah, definitely has contributed a lot.  
  
Q. If you could talk about your season a little bit, both of you, why do you
think you got this far? Is there something about the team that maybe we don't
know that helped you get this far, whether it's friendship or the bonding that
went on? Was there a pivotal moment in the season where you sort of catapulted
to this?  
WHITNEY HAND: I think our team really just -- we're as together as any team
can be and I think that's really genuine, and I think that's something you
don't see very often. It's not just surface we have to respect each other,
like each other because we're forced to play with each other; it's a genuine
want to be together friendship and love and family that kind of you can just
see it resonate to the surface.  
And I think that's what made our team special. You've seen very many times
we'll have a struggle in the first half. We'll be down at halftime and I think
we just show that by playing together and playing within each other to just
battle our way back. I think when you're playing for each other it makes it a
whole lot harder to beat than when you're just playing for yourselves.  
ASHLEY PARIS: Yeah, what Whitney said. I think we're a very talented team. I
think our coaches have recruited pretty solid players. We have Courtney and
Whitney and Danielle and just a bunch of depth.  
I mean, we're a good team. I think the main thing about us and the reason that
we're here is because of our chemistry on and off the court. It is that bond
we have and that belief in each other and that we truly want to win for each
other, and I feel like that's why we're here today.  
  
Q. Ashley, you talked a lot about how you've changed as a ball player over
the years, particularly from last year to this year. Tell us how Courtney's
changed as a player. Is she pretty much the same player she was when she came
in, or what's been her development and progression?  
ASHLEY PARIS: Man, it's hard to say that about Courtney. Because most of the
time she's going to have the double-double and dominate a game and when she
doesn't the whole world knows about it.  
So, I mean, I feel like she's become a smarter basketball player here and just
really learned the game and really learned how to make teammates better and
just become a student of the game?  
  
Q. A &M, Iowa State, Baylor made some very strong runs through this
tournament and there have been several other Big 12 teams that obviously
played real well in the post season. Talk about how getting through a season
playing against competition in one of the tougher conferences maybe prepared
y'all for getting to a tournament where you're playing very good teams every
night and how it might make you prepared for the Final Four.   
ASHLEY PARIS: I think the Big 12 is it's frustrating but it's great. I feel
like every time we go into one of these games, okay, they're like a Baylor;
okay, that's kind of like an Iowa State; okay, they're like a Texas.  
I feel like the Big 12 is so versatile and so talented that it prepares you
for everything post season has to offer.  
WHITNEY HAND: Yeah, I totally agree. I think that, I mean, when you go to
press conferences everyone's like how do you handle Georgia Tech's pressure?
You lost to A&M, how is that? But the cool thing is we got to play A&M three
times and the cool thing is we got to play Baylor twice. I mean, that
definitely prepares you and I think especially as a young player it really
exposes you to this kind of attention earlier while you're going through it
later, I guess.  
  
Q. Whitney and Ashley, is it difficult or how do you go about separating the
hoopla of this event and this is a very serious business of trying to win a
national championship? Is that a difficult thing to do?  
ASHLEY PARIS: I feel like you don't take for granted being here. There's a lot
of hoopla going on and I feel like we owe it to ourselves to enjoy it and
embrace it, but we also came here with a goal; that's to be national
champions. At the end of the day this is all great, but we remember we came
here to try to win two games.  
WHITNEY HAND: I think, I mean, the same thing. I think it obviously can be
distracting, but Coach talks about staying within our bubble and being excited
for each other but not losing focus of our ultimate goal.  
  
Q. Ashley, do you feel like you play in your sister's shadow?  
ASHLEY PARIS: I think I've said this last night or whenever I was doing media
yesterday. I feel like most of the world plays in Courtney's shadow. It's not
just me.  
And obviously she's a very dominant presence, and she's a post and I'm her
twin sister and she's done so much for women's basketball and so much for our
program that naturally I play in her shadow. But I enjoy it. I signed up for
it.  
  
Q. This is a follow-up for Ashley on that. Was there ever a time when you
guys thought about going to different schools or were you always a package
deal in high school?  
ASHLEY PARIS: I think we would have loved to be a package deal. And we thought
that way when recruiting started. But I felt like we both decided that we're
going to make the best decision for us individually and if we could do that
together, then great. And I felt like Oklahoma has what was best for both of
us. So it kind of worked out that way.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks to both of you. Questions for Coach Sherri Coale.  
  
Q. Sherri, when Whitney is smiling, what does that mean for your team, not
only game plan-wise? I know it's important for her shots game plan-wise, talk
about that, but also psychologically her infectious personality, how does that
benefit you?  
COACH COALE: I've said a number of times this season that when Whitney's
making baskets from behind the arc we feel like we're invincible and we sort
of play that way.  
I think particularly in this tournament, our team has taken on both Whitney
and Danielle's personality. I think they've just kind of followed suit. One of
the keys I think once you get here, everybody's good. Who can relax and who
can enjoy the experience and who can get lost in the immersion of playing the
game, that might determine who ends up with a W at the end of the night.  
And when Whitney's hitting 3s and smiling and we're jumping around and hugging
each other, it's pretty easy to get immersed in the moment and it allows you
most often to put your best game forward.  
  
Q. When you look at DVDs, game film, whatever, what do you see with the Lady
Cards, the particular style, and what kind of different challenges do they
bring to you guys, especially the whole underdog thing and really never been
here before?  
COACH COALE: The whole underdog thing I find kind of interesting because
nobody on my team has ever been here before either. So it's a new experience
for everyone.  
But Angel McCoughtry obviously is their axis, and as she goes they go. But I
think the people around her know how to play around her and with her and
alongside of her. They don't stand and watch her play. That's the reason why
they're here. They do a lot of things defensively which keeps you from
scripting too much offensively. When you don't know what's coming, it's hard
to be prepared for it.  
I think our guards have to be real heady and we have to handle all those
changes and adapt and we'll see how deep our basketball IQ really is because
we're going to have to make decisions on the fly and react.  
Offensively, I think they're so difficult to contain. I don't know that you
can stop Angel McCoughtry. You can maybe limit her as best you can, limit her
touches, get her off the ball, and then do everything within your power to
keep her from getting the rebound. But she's interesting, because they run
everything to her, obviously. You go through their sets and we could have 12
pages of diagrams of sets that they run. Pretty quick hitters, but they all
have the same exact ending action.  
Angel gets the ball. And it's hard to keep her from doing that, yet that's not
the way that she always scores. She's great on defense her anticipatory skills
are outstanding. So she creates offense for herself.  
She gets a lot of it off defense, anticipating and getting steals, and she
gets a lot of it off the glass. So you try to at least limit her touches in
those two avenues.  
  
Q. How different is this for you from the first time? Because I remember you
telling stories about going to Stacy Hansmeyer, what is this like and what
happens in a Final Four. Do you feel like a wise veteran at this point? How is
it different?  
COACH COALE: I do, I feel like a wise old sage. I've got that Smart Water back
there and I've been drinking it and I feel really good.  
You know, it is nice to have had the experience, but things change every year.
It's funny, we were just in a team meeting this morning. I was trying to tell
my guys what was going to happen at the State Farm All-American press
conference and how it happens. And I was talking about every year inevitably
it's in a room that's way too small for all the people who would like to get
in there.  
We walk in there; it's a daggone banquet hall, it's nothing like it's been,
and they're looking at me like, Really, you've been here before?  
So everything changes as you go, but I do think it's helpful to be able to
prepare just for what the media is like, the open practice, the way you're
pulled in different directions and how you have to at the end of the day
return to your bubble and do the work you're called here to do. So I think
it's helpful to have been here before.  
  
Q. Sherri, what do you need from Danielle tomorrow?  
COACH COALE: Continued leadership. Continued leadership, toughness. Control of
the basketball. Management of the game. We don't ask point guards to do much,
do we. Just listed everything that's important except score 40. We don't need
her to do that, though; it would be nice, and I'll take it if she'd like to.
She needs to run the team, recognize, handle the basketball, stay composed,
have the good face that I think all great point guards who are successful,
they carry the good face with them. If she has that, we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Sherri, kind of the same question I asked Ashley. What do you think is
the biggest improvement in her game in the last year? And people say that
twins tend to have that sort of special chemistry. And I wonder if that helps
the rest of the team, complements it or if that ever gets in the way of team
chemistry?  
COACH COALE: Good question. First of all -- or questions. First of all, in
terms of Ashley's improvement, I think there have been two major areas and
they're connected one to the other.  
One is obviously her improved fitness level which enables her to play harder,
longer, enables her to do more things. I said repeatedly that she has improved
her skill set in terms of facing the basket. But the way her improved
conditioning level has helped us most is in the area of transition, because it
gives us a target down the floor every single time and offensive transition
gives us a post player running rim to rim, and defensively it allows us to get
out from basket protection to get to our shooters and get early defense sets.
She's really affected us in that very important piece of a full-court
basketball game.  
I think the other way that she's improved dramatically has been her
confidence. And it's hard to say which came first. But typically kids'
confidence grows when you give them something really hard to do and they do
it.  
Whether we gave it to her or she gave it to herself, she committed to getting
into physical condition and she committed to developing a perimeter skill set
and when she did that her confidence blossomed and grew, and hard to tell what
came first, the chicken or the egg, but it's been a nice ending product.  
As far as the sixth sense that the twins have I think it's fabulous, I think
very rarely does it cause any sort of a disconnection with the rest of the
team. I think you could see a little bit of it in the second half of the
Purdue game, a couple of high-low passes and extra gives they gave to one
another late in the game when the other three guys on the floor are taking
care of their business and moving, and it allows that sixth sense that I think
is special to twins to sort of rise to the top.  
  
Q. There seems to be a consensus among people who have watched the game all
year that your semifinal was a game for second place. Do you catch yourself
peeking ahead to UConn, the challenge that you guys would face?  
COACH COALE: No. I'm focused on Louisville right now.  
  
Q. Sherri, do you find the last four years have been somewhat of a tinkering
process as far as trying to find the right pieces to complement Courtney, and
why did this year's team connect?  
COACH COALE: I think every season is a tinkering process, honestly. You have
different pieces and parts, and even if you have the same exact team, you have
guys that develop and change and hopefully they're all getting better and
improving in that direction. But no one's static. And it's like riding a bike,
you're either going forward or backward. You're not going to sit still on it.  
So every team is different. I look at through the four-year progression of
what we have had around Courtney and with her on the floor and her freshman
year. We had very seasoned guards who really had a high basketball IQ and knew
how to play around her and with her. She got to go to the block and do the
easy stuff, kind of be -- not that her job was easy, I don't want to say that.  
But she just had to hold down that piece in the paint, and the people around
her thought and moved and created things and she had this incredible freshman
year. Some of those guys graduated and suddenly it got a little bit different.  
And every year there's been a different composition. I think the unique thing
about this year is that we have, proverbially, I guess, all the pieces in
terms of we have a real heady, talented point guard; we have shooters who can
stretch the defense; we have speed; guys who can break the defense down off
the dribble.  
And then Ashley's development, too, and her ability to step off the block and
become sort of a quasi perimeter player complements Courtney as well.  
I think all those things sort of have fallen into place, along with that
magical ever elusive thing called chemistry.  
  
Q. Not necessarily looking at teams in this year's Final Four, but if you go
back and look at some of those Tennessee teams, UConn teams, do you think it's
good for the game to have teams that are so dominating in one year they can
just shear through teams like that?  
COACH COALE: Not especially. I think parity is always good for growth. I think
Louisville being here for the first time is good for the growth of women's
basketball.  
I think it's tough. It's obviously tough to break through that when those sort
of dynasties are in place, but I think you're continuing to see that. I think
we saw more upsets in the NCAA tournament this year than we've ever seen.  
And while you hate it for Pat and everything that she's done for this sport,
and obviously the success of Tennessee and Connecticut have catapulted our
sport into the national spotlight. But in order to continue to grow, there
need to be other folks in the sight. And I think it is healthy for the growth.  
  
Q. Sherri, how much can we expect to see Amanda play, and is her foot
getting better? And the other thing talk about Courtney's second half against
Purdue?  
COACH COALE: I think we will see even more of Amanda. We kind of had to make a
tough decision at the start of the NCAA tournament as to how much we used her,
and I made the decision to only use her if I thought we had to have her early
on, particularly in the first and second games.  
And I think that it's paid off dramatically. She was feeling much better in
the Oklahoma City regional and yet again I thought every day helps. And the
training staff told us that: The longer you can rest her the more efficient
she'll be when she returns.  
We got her some what I call momentum minutes in the first game at Oklahoma
City just to get some timing back and to get a feel for the game. And then
when we had to have her against Purdue. She was fabulous and was able to
practice more yesterday and the day before than she has practiced in three
weeks. And that's because of that two-week rest we were able to give her. So I
expect her to be able to give us whatever we need from her on Sunday night.  
Courtney's second half against Purdue I thought was vintage Courtney Paris.
You know, she's so good all the time. Who does that? Who gets a double-double
almost every night of their entire collegiate career? But she does have ups
and downs and hills and valleys like everybody else, just her valleys don't
sweep quite as deeply as some of ours do sometimes.  
I think what you saw in the second half was what has defined Courtney
throughout her career: will, passion, energy, explosiveness. She just competed
on every possession. And I thought really controlled the real estate right
around the rim.  
  
Q. It's easy to forgive because so much has been made against Courtney and
Ashley, but beyond those two you've got a pretty young team. Talk about beyond
their play on the court, the leadership that you get out of them as seniors.
And then also this is horribly unfair, we're not going to give you a second to
enjoy the success of this year, but talk about the future. You've got a young
bunch that'd be easy to see where they're going to be awfully good for a while
now.  
COACH COALE: I think our leadership has grown throughout the year. Our two
team captains, Carolyn Winchester and Amanda Thompson did a fabulous job early
in the year, sort of solidifying everyone and saying this is what we're going
to stand for and this is how we're going to work and this is what you'll be
accountable for and we're going to hold you to that. And it's not an easy
thing for peers to do. I think all successful teams have it, but it's not an
easy thing to do. And those two guys really sort of put the rudder in the
water and said this is the direction we're going to go.  
And as the season has gone on and Whitney has performed the way she has and
Danielle has grown in her leadership capacity. Those two guys on the floor in
game situations have guided the ship. They've been the ones in charge. I think
when you watch us play I think you see we have as a group collectively sort of
picked up their personalities and we play in their way.  
I think all great leaders have the ability to do that, to infect the people
around them and to say, you know, follow me. I know where I'm going, follow
me.  
And it's really good news for myself and our coaching staff that those two
guys are sophomores and freshmen.  
  
Q. Coaches in college basketball, they seem to be the face, the constants
because the players revolve all the time. How mindful of that are you that
you're one of those faces out there? I asked Geno about it and he said with
your presidency of the coaches association and those sorts of things, you're
one of those people that's out there. But how mindful of that are you and how
important have you taken that role?  
COACH COALE: I don't really think about it a whole lot at times like this. I
think about it more so when I'm wearing the WBCA hat and going from group to
group and doing those type of things than when I'm coaching my team.  
Because when you're coaching your team it's sort of your safe haven and it's
your grungy sweats, if you will, where you are really who you are and immersed
in that thing that you love to do. So it comes naturally.  
I think we have a responsibility, though. And I feel so incredibly indebted to
the amazing mentors in my conference that I was able to come in and learn the
game from in terms of what are my responsibilities as a professional.  
You go from high school to coaching college ball and you know everything that
happens in between those lines. But the big wide world that's beyond that
court is a different deal. And I didn't know much about it. And I had to learn
and I was lucky, because I had Marcia Sharp and Jody Conrad and Phil Berry
(phonetic) to learn from, and the list goes on. Bill Finley. I could go down
the list.  
But our league, I think, really gave me a leg up and taught me that we have a
responsibility that extends far beyond our program and our institution. It is
to this game.  
And I feel fortunate and take that responsibility very seriously. At the same
time, there are lots of faces that are the sport of women's basketball, and I
feel unbelievably humbled to even be mentioned among those.  
  
Q. It's interesting, both you and Ashley when asked about Louisville being
the underdog were quick to say that it was them that think they're the
underdog. I'm curious, what's your take on the team?  
COACH COALE: I think they're really good, obviously. They play in the Big East
conference. You look at their schedule, and it goes W, W, W, W and you see a
loss. And then you see it goes W, W, W, and you see another loss and it's to
Connecticut. And these guys are really good. I don't think anybody that gets
here necessarily sees themselves as an underdog. Maybe once they arrive and
they look at the field.  
But you don't think like an underdog and earn your way to one of these. So
everybody has to -- is given a card or gets an opportunity to play a card and
that is whatever you choose it to be. I don't think it's much of a factor to
us.  
  
Q. Sherri, I was just curious, and I apologize if this has been asked
already. But you're here for a second time with the team. When you come back a
second time I know you have in your mind things I would do differently. What
are some of those things in terms of bringing a team here again that you do
differently the second time than the first experience?  
COACH COALE: Give all those ticket requests to somebody else on my staff and
let them deal with it. You know, as far as the team goes, honestly, we don't
have any idea what we were doing in 2002, we were just playing ball and loving
the journey together. That may be the secret. I don't know that I would change
a whole lot about what we did.  
We were who we had been the entire year. We enjoyed everything. We took
everything in. And then when it was time to go to practice we practiced. And
when it was time to watch film, we watched film. When it was time to play, we
played.  
In that regard I really didn't change much. I went back and looked at what did
we do in practice, how did we prepare, what were the schedules. Because you
know how we coaches are, we keep up with everything. So I go back and look at
it and say, Yeah, that's what we still do. Let's do it again.  
I think what you do has worked for a reason, so you need to stay with that and
feel very fortunate to have opportunity to go back and look at those old
notes.  
  
Q. Question and a half I have for you. Your trip to St. Louis earlier this
year, even though it's in a different gym, how beneficial do you think that
was? And also just your general thoughts about handicapping the field?  
COACH COALE: I think everybody has their motivational or preparatory
activities that they think puts them in a good spot to be able to achieve
their goals. And for us we thought it was important to try to get to the Final
Four city, to plant some seeds, to have the experience for a number of
reasons.  
And in 2002 we played in San Antonio earlier before we went to the
championship game there. So we had an opportunity. And I appreciate so much
St. Louis wanting to schedule that game and allowing us to be here.  
Different arena, but that wasn't really the issue. It was being in the city
and having an opportunity to talk about it. And I do think it has helped us.
Sort of crystallizes things and makes it a little bit more real for you.
Handicapping the field, obviously you just told me that the real game was the
second one, so I didn't know that until you told me. So thanks for the heads
up.  
We're going to go ahead and play six, if that's all right with everybody.
Louisville is really good. I talked about them plenty, probably. As far as the
other two go, Stanford plays so pretty. I love the way they play. They share
the ball. They're skilled. They compete. They just -- they understand the
game. And it's interesting, I heard some little sound bite in the very small
amount of time I've had to watch television over the last week or so, but I
heard Tara say that basketball is like ballet with a ball.  
When I watched them play, that's exactly -- it looks like a beautiful dance. I
think that's the way offensive basketball should look. I have a great
appreciation for the way they play. I don't think there's any program in
America that's tougher than Connecticut.  
I think their toughness is their ace. Are they skilled? Absolutely they're
skilled. Do they have a high basketball IQ? Absolutely they do. What separates
them from the rest of the world? Their toughness. Just mentally, physically,
emotionally, every way you can count it, they're tough. And they're not going
to go away.  
And so I think it's a great Final Four. I think it's a fan's paradise and I
think there will be two really good games on Sunday and another really good
one on Tuesday.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Pleased to have up here on the podium head coach Jeff Walz as
well as student-athletes Angel McCoughtry, Deseree' Byrd, and Candyce Bingham.  
Coach, when you're ready, an opening statement and then we'll take questions.  
COACH WALZ: We'd first like to thank everyone that's involved that's put this
wonderful event on. The hospitality that we've received since we arrived here
has just been outstanding. I know our players have enjoyed the experience to
this point and we're really looking forward for the opportunity of playing on
Sunday.  
It's a group of players from day one we had some goals, we put some things out
there in front of them and they've just continued to rise to the challenge day
after day. And to be able to say we're playing on the last weekend of
basketball is quite an accomplishment for all of these players, and I'm very
proud of them and excited to be able to say I'm their coach.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Angel, the comments you made about Kara Lawson the other night after the
game, just curious why you said what you said and what you think about it
looking back now?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I was very excited during the time and like I told her it
was all in fun and I was enjoying myself. And I wouldn't take back anything I
said because it was all in fun.  
  
Q. Angel, talk about this team this season and why you think this particular
team was the one that made it in terms of the program for the first time, the
program's history, to a Final Four, and was there a key point in time, a game
or a moment where you saw something happen that propelled this team to this
point?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I think it was just because this is our time. Truly this is
our season, we all believed it. We've been saying since last year we were
going to get to St. Louis. Everybody said it, and now we're here.  
  
Q. Angel and Candyce, Coach Walz has been here for two years and now you're
in the Final Four. And I'm kind of curious, what did he have to do for you
guys to accept him and believe in him and get you to play at the style you've
obviously learned to play?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: Well, we already knew he came from Maryland and won the
national championship. So that speaks -- that in itself tells us that he knows
what he's doing and can get us to the same spot.  
So he just came in and had us work hard and be disciplined and obviously it
helped. We're in the Final Four now?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: You know, it takes time when a new coach comes in to funnel
the program in what he wants us to do. But we all believed it. That's why I
think we're so successful within two years.  
  
Q. Candyce, talk about when you were growing up you saw the program not get
a whole lot of publicity, play for less than a thousand people; now you're at
the Final Four and you're on the national networks. What's it like and what's
it like to be here for someone from Louisville who grew up watching the
program?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: Again, I never thought this would happen. But, I mean, it's
history again. And it's an amazing feeling to be a part of this. Because I
think no one ever thought that this program could rise to -- get to this
point. And we've proven that we could. So it's an amazing feeling.  
  
Q. Candyce, talk a little bit about the Paris twins, defending them.  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: They're great players. Courtney Paris, four-time All-
American. That in itself speaks -- that speaks for itself.  
But they're great rebounders, great players, and we're going to have to come
out and make sure we're boxing them out and just follow the game plan.  
  
Q. Angel, can you talk about how you've changed personally since you came to
Louisville, kind of how you've developed and if your teammates could talk
about that, too.  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: When I first came to Louisville I was younger, and if you
don't mature in four years something's wrong with you. I've matured, and I'm a
woman now.  
DESEREE' BYRD: Being here just two years playing with Angel, last year coming
in I was obviously recruited by Louisville, but watching the game she had a
kind of attitude problem.  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: A little bit true (laughter).  
DESEREE' BYRD: She had an attitude problem. With Coach Walz coming in he got
on her enough and he kept it real with her. He's an honest man and whether you
like it or not he's going to tell you. And he basically told her. I think it's
been -- it's just watching my knees go up -- I've been here two years with
Angel, just watching the change, seeing the attitude problem to just it's just
an inspiration to many people around the world. It's respectable (laughter).  
  
Q. Angel, how are the nerves holding up? It's a big week. Deseree' and
Candyce, what makes Angel so good?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: Well, I'm very relaxed right now. This is a business trip;
we're not here for a lot of fun. So we're ready to play.  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: Just her dedication and her competitiveness. I mean, Angel's
always wanting to win, always in the gym, wanting to get better. I think it's
her dedication and competitiveness. And it's rubbed off on the rest of us.  
DESEREE' BYRD: What Candyce said, her work ethic running up the court. Trying
to keep everybody up. We are the sisterhood, and she try to keep us together
as a sisterhood. She try to do things. On the court, she ain't always happy
with what we do on the court, and she yells that, that's because she wants to
be the best and she wants this team to be the best, and off the court she try
to do things to keep us together.  
  
Q. Angel, because of your stature, awards and accolades and people have been
talking about Candyce the past couple of weeks, can you talk about the rest of
the parts like we talked last week and how everybody else has stepped up in
the NCAA tournament when you struggled a little bit shooting a couple of games
and everybody else has really stepped up?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: Well, I have to say for Des, Deseree' Byrd, she played a
tremendous game against Maryland, and Becky Burke stepped up a lot. And that's
what you need, for the girls to step forward a little bit if you're
struggling. And Des put the team on her shoulders. She said, I got you all.
That's the type of attitude she play with, like, I've got the team. And it
really worked and I'm just proud of everybody stepping up. And if one of us
are having a bad shooting night, then we know it's okay because somebody else
is going to step up.  
  
Q. There's a perception that your semifinal game is for second place because
UConn has handled both of your teams. How do you feel about that?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: I mean, yeah, they beat us. But it's a new day. If we do get
to that game, it will be another game and we're going to approach it like
another game.  
DESEREE' BYRD: Like she said, yeah, they beat us, any given day. Third time's
a charm. I'm not saying anything. But, you know, like I told some other
people, we've been playing as the underdogs all year and now there's four.  
And we're one of those four. So like Angel said, this is a business trip and
we're on a mission and we're here to handle our business.  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: We better get past this round first. We're focusing on
Oklahoma. We need to do that and we'll see what we've got in the next round,
once we try to get past Oklahoma.  
  
Q. I know you guys just mentioned doubters. Is that something that you have
had something, do you want people maybe in a sense to keep doubting you guys
because it only makes you want to prove them wrong even more?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I mean, of course. If you watch the commercial, the
commercial strictly says Oklahoma is on a mission to win a championship, but
Louisville is trying to fool with that. We're trying to win a national
championship too. It's even in the commercials. So for God's sakes, I mean, I
don't know what else we have to do to get some type of respect to say they're
good, too, they can win on any given day just like the other teams can.  
But, hey, I think that does fuel our fire.  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: It's okay, they can keep doubting us. We love it.  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: Watch the commercial tonight, you'll see it.  
  
Q. Can you talk to me about, there's been a lot of talk about this is the
first time you've ever been to the Final Four but now actually getting here I
know you still haven't played that first game. But can you talk about actually
being here now?  
DESEREE' BYRD: It's an amazing feeling. I never ever in a million years
thought I would be here. I couldn't ask for a better group of girls to be here
with and coaching staff to be here with. We bust our butts all year and, like
I said, we're on a mission. And that's all I'm going to say.  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: Again, we're excited to be here but this is a business trip.
And we don't want to get too caught up in all the hype or whatever. So we're
going to go out and practice hard and try to win a game tomorrow.  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I'm not on cloud nine anymore. So, like I said, it's a
business trip. I'm ready to play.  
  
Q. Angel, are you at all curious about once we get past this weekend how
you're going to be evaluated by the WNBA, whether you're going to be the first
pick and how your life is going to change at this point next week? Do you
spend any time thinking about it? Do you daydream about it, anything like
that?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: Right now this comes first. This is what we have to take
care of right now. But like I told people, I'm going to go where I'm wanted to
play, where I'm needed to help the team and to help the program win a WNBA
championship. So whether it's for No. 1 or 20, wherever I'm needed, that's
where I'm going to go.  
  
Q. Angel, why do you think you guys haven't received more respect?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I guess because we're the newcomers on the block. We don't
have as much tradition as the other schools. But I still feel like we can
still -- we've played hard to the point we need to earn a little bit of
respect.  
We've had the hardest road to the Final Four. We've had to play LSU. All of
the other squads basically played at home. Especially when California,
Oklahoma was at home. UConn was at home. We were at LSU somewhere with the
alligators.  
So we had the hardest road here and I think that's why it's so special right
now. I think this is our season. I truly believe we can take it all the way.  
  
Q. For any of the players. You've got national media here, what should the
world know about your coach? Tell me about the job he's done and what he's
like away from these cameras.  
DESEREE' BYRD: He's a hard-working man. Like I said, he's going to keep it
honest with you, whether he thinks you'll like it or not. Because he's not
here only to make us better players but he's here to make us better people.  
I think once everybody believes in him, then everybody is willing to make a
change. I mean, it took me a long time to really believe it. And I do. And I
appreciate him. He's one of my fathers and I really look to Coach Walz as a
father figure.  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: He's one that's done a lot for us. And he really cares about
us. His first year he took us to the Big East championship. This is only his
second year and we're in the Final Four. Enough said.  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: Again, he's brutally honest, but I think that's a good thing,
because some people don't like that. But in the end I think you do pay
attention to it. And so, I mean, he's a great guy.  
I mean, he wants us to be great players, but, like Des said, be good people.
So I'm glad that he's been here.  
  
Q. Do you or does the coach have any superstitions that you do or not do
before your game?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I don't really have a lot of superstitions as far as
basketball. I just go out there and play. But I do have one superstition:
Never split the pole. I don't like that. As far as that's said, no.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Have you ever coached or seen a team that kind of came together the way
this one did with so many different players who originally were going
somewhere else and then came together and did it present any particular
challenges?  
COACH WALZ: No, actually. This is the first time that I've worked with a group
of players that four of them I think had signed out of high school with
different schools, but they all ended up at the same place.  
And they even talk about it, just fate. Angel at the time with St. John's,
Chauntise Wright I think at the time with Seton Hall, Candyce Bingham played
two years at Xavier. We just had some players that came together and found a
common ground, and they've been great to coach.  
They're right, I'm honest with them. Sometimes they like it. Sometimes they
don't. But at least, like I tell them, I sleep well at night because I tell
them exactly how I'm feeling. If they're doing well, I tell them they're doing
well. If not, I tell them they're not.  
So they really learned my philosophy of coaching, and I've gotten to know all
of them. So I don't coach each player the same way. But we're fair with all of
them. So it's been a great two years and looking forward to many more.  
  
Q. Did you see the commercial that Angel's referring to and what did you
think when you first saw it?  
COACH WALZ: You know what, the one thing I love about her is she'll just say
the truth. She just speaks from the heart and some people don't understand
her.  
But, yeah, it's not a big deal. They take the schools that they thought were
going to have a chance to make a run for the Final Four and those coaches say
their spiel, and we're the one that we weren't supposed to be here.  
So they weren't prepared for it. Which is okay. And it's understandable. When
it comes down to playing, the commercials and all that stuff, it's not going
to make a difference either way. It's whoever shows up and plays the best. And
at this time of the year a bounce here, bounce there, a call here, call there,
can make a difference of if you're going home or if you're advancing.  
  
Q. What concerns you most about Oklahoma and how do you defend Courtney
Paris?  
COACH WALZ: It's probably easier if I said what doesn't concern me. Because
there's about one thing that doesn't concern me. I mean, there's a bunch of
things that concern me. I mean, the way Danielle Robinson has been playing at
the point. She's been outstanding. Whitney Hand has been shooting the ball
lights out. Then you've got the Paris sisters inside.  
They've just got a very good team. Sherri's done a great job of putting
players around the twins. And it's going to be a challenge for us. We're going
to have to come out here tomorrow night and defend well and rebound.  
If you look at Courtney Paris's stats, I think she's made 219 shots and she's
got 203 offensive boards. It's an unbelievable stat when you look at it. For a
kid to rebound the ball as well as she does at the offensive end we've got to
make sure we've got a body on her and sacrificing someone so she can't get
offensive boards.  
  
Q. Your experience with the Final Four a couple years ago, how does that
help you now?  
COACH WALZ: I think it's helped with the fact that at least I've been able to
share with the players what to expect each day. When it comes to when we get
here, what to expect when we get to the hotel, our practice the other day off
site and then we come here today, you know we've got practice and an autograph
session afterwards.  
Just the small things. Just trying to get them to understand the routine to
make sure we don't get too caught up in what's going on, but at the same time
I want them to enjoy every second of it.  
It's something you don't want to take for granted. We've got two great seniors
here that I want to make sure that they remember the entire trip. So we're
soaking it in. They're having fun, but when it comes to prepare and practice
they're focused. I've been pleased with things. So I expect us to come out
tomorrow night and play hard.  
  
Q. When you went home the night you got the job, if you were being honest
with yourself, what did you think your time line might be? What were your
expectations about how long this job might take you to get this program where
you wanted it to be?  
COACH WALZ: You know, when I took the job, I knew they had some players. Angel
McCoughtry, I've watched her play in high school. And Chauntise Wright. So I
knew those two kids before I even took the job. And once I got on campus and
had a chance at doing about four days of workouts before we were actually
finished with school, I was able to see that they had some talent, especially
with the way we wanted to play.  
We don't -- Keshia Hines has done a nice job for us in the post, especially
with Chauntise out. We don't have a true post player, per se, but the way we
like to play by trying to press and making it an up-tempo game and scoring off
of turnovers, our length and athleticism plays well into that.  
So if I'm to tell you we expected to be here when I took the job in two years,
I'd tell you I was lying. But we knew we had some players and I told them when
I took the job that once you get to the Sweet 16 I really believe anybody can
win. It's just the best team might not win. It's the team that plays the best
that day.  
And we've been playing some really good basketball the past three weeks.  
  
Q. Just talk about this full game round, I don't think you would term
Angel's play as vintage Angel because she hasn't shot the ball very well at
all. A, do you think at some point she's sitting on a big game, and then, B,
what does that say about everybody else?  
COACH WALZ: You're exactly right. I don't think Angel's had a superb four
games. Now, she's played solid. She'll get her 23 points. She gets her 12, 13
boards, three or four steals. But she hasn't had the games that we're used to
seeing.  
And it's exciting for me. It's exciting for our staff to see the rest of our
young kids stepping up the way Monique Reid played in our regional games, the
way Becky Burke has been playing. We've really relied on everyone on this
team. And we've got three solid players each night with these three that were
just up here.  
I've told them, we need two more. And I don't care which two, because they all
get a chance throughout the game and Keshia Hines has been playing well and
Monique Reid and Becky Burke have been playing solid for us. Actually we've
been getting three of them to show up. If we can continue to do that, plus
we've got to get some minutes from Gwen, that we'll have a chance to compete.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what kind of -- your brutal honest it took to get
Angel where you wanted her, kind of more than talking about her attitude and
all that, what you had to do to get her where she is now?  
COACH WALZ: She's a great kid. She's fun to coach. You never know what's going
to come out of her mouth. You know, she's great. Now, when she competes, she
wants to win. And sometimes, you know, she'll show some disgust at a call,
disgust at some teammates.  
And we just took some game film, our assistant, Steph Norman, just went
through and we pulled out about seven minutes of game film from the previous
year before we got there of her reacting to her teammates, to calls. And it
wasn't hard. It's simple. You can sit there and tell someone they're doing
something wrong but until you show them, they really don't buy into it.  
And then as soon as we showed her on film, she was upset. She was like, I
can't believe I do that. So she's gotten better. Now, she's still got some
room to grow, but from where she was before we got here to where she is now,
it says a lot about her character.  
  
Q. You mentioned this a little bit earlier, maybe, but just how good has
Candyce been? Angel gets so much attention, and rightfully so, but what kind
of a player is she, person, and how good has she been this year?  
COACH WALZ: She's been a rock. Angel gets a lot of the press. It's very
thorough. Because she's a fantastic player but Candyce is the one that every
night I know what I'm going to get. We don't have to run a bunch of plays for
her. She just understands the game. She's in the right place at the right
time. She goes hard. She can defend in the post on the perimeter for us.  
She means as much to this program as Angel does. So without her we wouldn't be
where we are right now and I tell her that every day.  
  
Q. I know this is putting the cart before the horse, but did you spend any
time thinking about if you win this game, UConn, the next step?  
COACH WALZ: You know, I think we did a great job. I mean, because obviously if
we play them they're way overconfident. When you lose by a 38 and 28, which we
planned that. So, I mean, it was good coaching on my part. It's not easy to
do.  
You know, we're going to come out here. And it's like I tell them. You can --
it's one game and that's what it's going to take. We're going to have to come
out here tomorrow night and beat a very good Oklahoma team to even have a
chance to play the next game.  
And if we can come out here and do that, then we'll worry about that tomorrow
night after the game. And then, hey, you never know what can happen. If we can
get to that game and if UConn can get to that game, then we'll throw it up on
Tuesday night and see what happens.  
  
Q. Going back to Courtney Paris, have you in doing all your scouting seen
anybody defend her in a way that you think you might try to defend her and
what is your defensive plan there?  
COACH WALZ: Well, we're going to have to throw a lot of players at her. She's
so strong and does a great job of getting position. And Keshia Hines, our post
player that comes off the bench, probably is our best match-up with her, and
that's still not a great one.  
So we'll have to go small at times. We'll have to throw the entire team at
her. We just don't have enough fouls in the post, I don't think, to be able to
just send one at her and try to stop her.  
So it's going to be something where we'll clog up and try and make it
difficult for her to score. But at the same time I'm just as concerned about
Whitney Hand and the way Danielle Robinson gets to the basket.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 4, 2009

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Renee Montgomery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18485)

### [Maya Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19726)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Pleased to be joined up here at the podium by Connecticut head
coach Gene Auriemma and Maya Moore and Renee Montgomery.  
Again, once we have an opening statement from Coach we'll take questions for
the student-athletes.  
COACH AURIEMMA: The same thing I say all the time, whether it's at the
regionals or at the Final Four, game time never gets here fast enough. There's
a million things you have to do and I obviously know they have to be done. But
I know I speak for the players. I wish game day was today, but it's not. We're
anxious to play. We're obviously thrilled to be here.  
I don't think that we're surprised that we're here. This was something that
these kids have worked really hard for. And as I tell them every day in
practice, there's only four teams left. And they're all really, really good.
So I would expect nothing but great games on Sunday.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For either or both of you, can you talk about the matchup with Stanford,
where you feel like your biggest strengths are and maybe where their strengths
lie?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: For Stanford, I think their biggest strength, of course, is
their post game. I think Jayne Appel has really made herself a dominant post
presence throughout the season, and she's just left it up to other teams to
have to try to stop her. And I also think they have a perimeter to go along
with that post game. But I'll say that's definitely one of their strengths.  
As far as us, our strength is running the floor, making it a full-court game
instead of a half-court offense and defense. I think our strength will just be
to push the ball as much as possible.  
MAYA MOORE: I agree, just as far as our strength being -- we like to go. We
like to run. And that's just definitely one of our -- mostly our style of
play. They're a disciplined team. They're going to force us to play their
style of basketball. They're patient with their offense and they get the shot
that they want. So we're just going to have to do our best to try to just
disrupt their offensive flow as much as possible.  
  
Q. Maya and then Renee, anything that you learned from last year's matchup
in the semifinal that could help you Sunday?  
MAYA MOORE: Just how much those little things matter. And the Final Four, all
the things that you work on throughout the year. When your coaches are harping
on getting the little things right. I think this year we definitely took it to
heart a little more.  
And so hopefully we've taken care of a lot of those little things and we'll be
able to execute tomorrow.  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I think we learned that it really is a team concept that
everybody has to work at the same level and you can't let someone work at
their own pace or, you know -- I think that we learned that everyone is
accountable 1 through 13 on our team.  
And that's something that we didn't have last year that we definitely have
this year, that no matter how many minutes you play, everyone on the team
feels they have a role on the team that they have to do every day for us to be
successful.  
And I think that's the main thing, that everybody comes every day ready to do
their role and do the best they can.  
  
Q. Both Maya and Renee, what did last year's game as far as losing, did that
in any way teach you how to be ready not to lose tomorrow night?  
MAYA MOORE: I don't think we ever play not to lose. I think we always play to
win the game. But I think losing last year did teach us a lot of things about
better ways to win, a better way to execute the game or what we did wrong.  
I think we came and we didn't play our style of play. We let them play how
they wanted to play and we didn't play how we wanted to play. So I think it
just taught us how to win more, per se, than to not play how to lose.  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I agree. I don't think you can win championships being
afraid that you're going to lose. And maybe last year, I don't know, our team
maybe was playing with that a little bit. I don't think we came into that game
as confident as we would have liked to have been. And this year we're not
going to play tentative. I think this is win or go home, so we're going to
leave it all out on the court this year.  
But we definitely know through Coach and his experience just telling us that
you can't be on the court being afraid to lose. You have to go out there and
just being excited and competitive to win.  
  
Q. Renee, Maya, did you notice anything about Stanford's court presence last
year, were they more poised, more disciplined than a lot of the teams you
played last year? Obviously had a Hall of Fame coach, very experienced. Was
their demeanor on the court different or more impressive than some of the
other teams you dealt with last year?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I would definitely say yes. I think the main thing about
them is they never take a shot that they don't want to take. They go down on
offense and they keep on working the ball around until the right people shoot
the ball, where they should be shooting it.  
I think a lot of teams sometimes might have players that just take errant
shots that aren't supposed to be shooting it from the 3-point line and they
just shoot it because they're open. But I think Stanford does a really good
job of making sure that people they want to shoot the ball are shooting it
where they like to shoot it. And that's what makes them so tough, because they
have enough patience to wait until they get the right shot that they want.  
  
Q. I'm struck listening to these questions about the loss last year.
Everybody loses sometimes, and yet it seems like there's a different standard,
a loss in any game is different for y'all than it is for any other team. Is
that a pain in the buns or is that the way you want it to be?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I don't think it's a pain, because I think you know that
going into Connecticut. I think it's just -- they said along the years that we
didn't make it to the Final Four that was unbelievable to our fans and to just
the community, because they set such a high standard and we knew that coming
in. So it's not like we can come here and think, My goodness, we didn't expect
this. But we kind of knew it coming in, but it's also good because when you
have high standards I think you reach a higher potential.  
So I don't really see it as a pain; I think of it more as a motivation to work
harder.  
MAYA MOORE: When you come to Connecticut you know the culture of Connecticut
basketball because of the success has been set at a really high level. And
when we go out, our goal every time we step out on the court is to go out. And
if we're going to lose on the scoreboard, it's because another team has just
outplayed us and beaten us.  
And most of the time when we're on the court we feel like when we play no team
should be able to beat us when we're at our best. So that's just kind of the
expectation that we have as a team, that we're not just going to give anyone a
game. So when we do feel like that happens, that's devastating to us. And just
the type of practices that we have throughout the whole year, consistency,
intensity, it just makes it so hard when you lose. So hopefully something we
won't have to experience.  
  
Q. Do you guys have a sense of how you will play in a late-game situation if
it's close? I mean, you've won just by simply obviously a lot of the year, if
this is a two-possession game with 30 seconds left, whatever, are you
confident that it's not something that you guys have experienced a lot this
year?  
MAYA MOORE: We always have to be confident. I think that's something that's
separated our team this whole year. We came in thinking we can make the next
play, get the next run, hit the next best shot. It's one of the situations you
can't get caught up in the situation; just trust your instincts. And I trust
my teammates. And that's when you find out the character of your team. I feel
we've got good chemistry this year and we feel confident in each other to
finish and make big plays. And if it comes down to it, we're not going to be
afraid to make a big play.  
  
Q. Renee, at this point on the eve of the semifinal you've had Coach give
you the scouting report so you know your opponent pretty well. Do you think
anybody at Stanford can actually stop you?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: That's a tough question. I think they're going to find ways.
I know they're going to know all our weaknesses. They're going to pretty much
try to play against that to make us do things we're uncomfortable with.  
I'm sure they're going to try to slow us down, do some three-quarters. I know
they're not going to have everybody crashing the boards like they did before.
I know they'll do things to hinder us from playing the best basketball we can
play.  
But in that sense I think they will. They do have a Hall of Fame coach and I'm
sure she's going to come up with something. But as far as -- I think we'll
still be able to execute a certain extent to our game plan, might not be
exactly how we want to go, but I still think even if, for instance, me or Maya
don't score a point, I have confidence in my teammates that they'll be ready
to step up in the big moment.  
  
Q. Renee, you mentioned Jayne Appel. What have you or the team told Tina
that she has to do to counter Jayne's play?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I personally haven't talked to her yet about it. I don't
think I need to. I think she knows that this is a great matchup for her as far
as dominant post players. They both were up there today for the All-American
awards. So they both I'm sure have a certain level of respect for each other.  
I think she needs to be aggressive. I think any time when she comes out there
and she's aggressive on offense and defense she plays really well against
other top post players. And I've seen her play against some of the best ones,
Courtney Paris and Kia Vaughn. I've seen her play against them. I know she's
capable. I would tell her personally I've seen her do it before, so let's have
it two more games.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, both.  
Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Two-part question on Tina Charles. I know you've said in the past you
needed to push her. At what point did the light go on for her and, secondly,
how much more room does she have to grow as a player?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't think Tina's any more different than a whole bunch of
players I've had at Connecticut. I think players like Maya Moore, Renee
Montgomery, Diana Taurasi, they're different. Everybody else is pretty much in
the same boat. They all come to college and they all think they're pretty
good. They all think they're working hard. Then they get some numbers that
make them feel like, hey, I'm pretty good.  
They get some awards that remind them that I'm pretty good. And my job is to
remind them it's not good enough. And with some players you can't do that,
because it may be all there is. That's all they have in the tank.  
But with Tina, I've seen Tina in high school. I've seen her in AAU. I've seen
her in college do some things that lead you to believe that somewhere inside
there there's the potential to be the best player in the country.  
But Tina may not see that. And as long as Tina doesn't see that herself, then
it was a struggle. So the biggest challenge that I had was how to make her see
it, that inside of you is the best player in the country, the best center in
America.  
Has the light gone on? Yeah, I'm sure it has. I'm sure it has. But in coaching
you always gotta have your hand ready to put it on the switch because it could
go out at any time, and you have to keep turning the light on for her
sometimes, as you do for any player except the two that are up here.  
So I think Tina's going to play great this weekend.  
  
Q. The biggest deficit you faced all year was eight points. That was still
in the first half. Do you have any remaining anxiety if it's a close game
tomorrow night how your team is going to respond?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I have anxieties about a lot of things. You spend a lot of
time in Philly. You can't go up there without having anxieties about
everything.  
I worry about lots of things. I don't worry about what the score's going to be
with five minutes left or three minutes left or 30 seconds left. I don't worry
about that. I figure if we're in the game and there's three minutes left and
we have a chance to win, we're going to win.  
I spent -- I bet you I spent more time worrying about the other 37 minutes and
how to get us to that point. I think we've got -- I'm confident because I've
seen it. I've seen Renee Montgomery and Maya Moore make plays in the last
minute of games last year in practice.  
If you told me there's 30 seconds left and we need a 3 to win the game, I'd
dare you to pick anybody in this tournament that you would want shooting the
ball other than Renee Montgomery and Maya Moore. So I feel pretty good about
that.  
  
Q. First, if you win tomorrow are you going to petition the Pac-10 to get a
share of their title? And also is there a feel that this is kind of like the
championship game tomorrow night since you've already beaten Louisville twice
and Oklahoma once, although it was earlier in the year, this game kind of has
a little more of that championship feel to it?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, I've heard people say that. But it's not. The
championship game is Tuesday night. So I don't want to make tomorrow night's
game the championship game because I don't want to -- if you lose the game you
lost the national championship. So in that respect it's the national
championship game, because if you lose you're done. The national championship
is over for you. But I don't want to be in a position where if we win the game
our guys think we just won the national championship, now the next game's
going to be easy.  
There's no comparison between the Louisville team we played in the regular
season and the Big East tournament and the team that's here today. And there's
certainly no comparison between the Oklahoma team we played earlier in the
season and the team that's here today.  
So tomorrow we've got our hands full with Stanford. No question about it. But
I'm sure you'll ask Tara all these questions. They've got their hands full
with us. Sometimes that gets overlooked. I think your point about is it a pain
in the ass to constantly have to -- I say this all the time to our writers up
in Connecticut. At Connecticut the only story is if we lose. If we win, it's
not a story. It's not a big deal. That story's already been written 100 times.  
The only thing people -- it's like coming to see the gladiators, you know? You
know who is going to slaughter who but you go there, and the only way it's
going to be a big story is if we were to lose somehow, some way.  
And it's a tough way to go through life. But, believe me, I wouldn't want to
be in any other situation.  
  
Q. How do you keep your undefeated team focused on the goal?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I'm a really mean person (laughter). So I went to Catholic
school all my life. And they scared me into doing things the right way all the
time. So I scare them every day that if they don't do it the right way all the
time -- but today you can't use the ruler. You can't take your belt off and
slap them. You can't do any of those things that we were fortunate to have. So
the kids are missing out on a great learning experience (laughter).  
So I just go to practice every day and don't talk about our record, don't talk
about our ranking, don't talk about how good we are. I just keep trying to
find things that we have to get better at. And by constantly looking at those
things we constantly find things that can make us a better team. And that's
kind of the goal every day is become a better team. Not remain undefeated.  
  
Q. Renee talked a bit about Stanford making you uncomfortable. Are they
particularly good at that? Is Tara in terms of game planning particularly good
at making you feel uncomfortable and doing things you don't want to do?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think sometimes too much attention is placed on who is
coaching what team. I'm a lot better coach when I have really good players.
And Tara is a really good coach when they've got really good players. But as a
coach you can only do so many things.  
When we played them in St. Thomas last year, the score at one time was 60 to
36. And then we played them here and they scored 80-some on us. So Tara became
a really good coach in a couple of months and I became an awful coach in those
couple of months.  
When in reality what happens is you have a style of play and you're committed
to it. And if you are committed to that style of play and you're disciplined
enough and you do it, regardless, then you have to trust your players.  
Tara's style of play that they've used throughout the season works great for
the players they have and it's the perfect system for them to play. And
they're committed to it and the players are committed to it and they execute
it flawlessly.  
If they're allowed to do that tomorrow night, they will win. So it's as simple
as that.  
  
Q. Coach, when you were in the Norman High gym recruiting Stacy Hansmeyer
and perhaps Sarah Dimson, I don't know if you recruited her, but what was it
about Sherri that made you an advocate of hers, that sort of made you think
this woman has a future in the college game if she wants it?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I said this on one of the teleconferences I was on. I was
really fortunate growing up where I grew up to be surrounded by a basketball
culture of great coaches, high school, college. I don't think any place in
America has had more good coaches than Philadelphia, where coaching became the
reason why you went. And sometimes to a fault. Like they think they invented
the game, they were in the room with Naismith when the game was put together.  
But I've always had a pretty good eye for what makes somebody good, I think.
So when I walked in that gym and I saw the way their practices were
structured, the way the people moved from one thing to another, the attention
that was being paid to certain details of the game and the way she
communicated with her players and the way they responded to her, to me it was
the same thing that I was doing at the college level. And it's being done in a
high school gym in Norman, Oklahoma.  
So if you can do it there, the gym at Oklahoma is the same size, the court is,
the players are going to do the same things, and you're going to do it with
just better players.  
So there was no doubt in my mind that with her communication skills and her
organizational skills that she would be successful at Oklahoma. Never any
doubt. When I spoke to her associate AD I told her that.  
  
Q. Was that Marita?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah.  
  
Q. I know the story of Jayne Appel's recruiting trip has been talked about a
lot. Can you revisit that one more time, her visit to Storrs?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, any time you're recruiting a kid from California, you
know, you're taking a huge risk to get somebody to travel 3,000 miles to go to
college when there's so many good alternatives on the West Coast and then
you've got to fly over a lot of good alternatives to get to our place.  
But you don't count on snow and ice and all that other good stuff waiting for
you when you get there. And you certainly, when you're having shoot-around the
day of the game, don't expect to see security guards and police come in and
lead your recruit, telling you that we've got a problem. And you realize that
her father's in the hospital going to have screws into his ankle because he
broke it getting into your building. That's not the winning edge, I don't
think. Except we showed off that we have good doctors.  
But even if that hadn't happened, how could you pass up a chance to go to
Stanford if you're a West Coast kid and they really want you bad? It's a risk
that we take and sometimes we win and sometimes we lose. And I thought
wherever Jayne went she was going to be what she is today.  
Because people think recruiting is difficult. It's not that difficult. You
watch kids play AU when they're 16 and the ones that beat the hell out of all
the other 16-year-olds end up doing it when they're 18, 19, and 20. That's
what she did when she was in high school and that's what she's doing now. I
wish she was just doing it for us.  
  
Q. What did you see as having went wrong last year against Stanford and what
has to change this time?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, to beat Stanford you have to have good guards and a lot
of them. And when we were in St. Thomas, we had really good guards and we had
a lot of them. Then when we got out here, we had good guards but we were minus
two of them.  
So we couldn't play the way we wanted to play. We had to play the way they
wanted to play. And you can't let somebody play to their strengths. And we
did. And they played to their strengths better than we played to our
strengths.  
And they made shots that they had to make when they had to make them. And I
thought the game was lost at about the 10-minute mark in the second half, when
we cut it to 1 and I made a couple of mistakes in that game. That was one of
them.  
We had gone from man-to-man to a zone, and they didn't score for three and a
half minutes, and that's how we cut it to 1. And my gut instinct told me as
we're going down the floor, down 1, we need to get out of this because they're
going to figure it out. And I didn't change it. I didn't communicate well
enough with my players. So Wiggins runs out to the corner and gets a 3. We
come down and miss, and now I'm pissed. And I don't get out of it again and
son of a gun makes another 3.  
And now we get out of it, we're scrambling and then Pedersen makes a 3. So in
that stretch the game ended right there and we didn't respond, we didn't
recover. What are you going to do, you know? We could have made those same
mistakes and they miss those shots and we win the game, who knows. But the key
is Stanford won the game. I don't think we lost a game last year.  
  
Q. If you were playing to their strengths, what would you --  
COACH AURIEMMA: Their strengths, I think they're very organized offensively,
they're very patient, very deliberate, very thorough. And they're really good.  
Everybody talks about who we have. I'm not going to run down the whole roster
for Stanford because I'm not familiar with it 1 through 13, but I guarantee
you that most of the players that they put on the floor tomorrow were high
school All-Americans or some version of it.  
So they've got talent. They've got a great center. They shoot the ball well.
They handle it well. That's why they're in the Final Four.  
  
Q. A lot has been said, maybe on the West Coast more, I don't know, about
Stanford's -- over the past decade, if you will, Stanford's talent but
softness, not being a tough team. It was something they really tried to
overcome last year. How do you look now that you've had a chance to pay
attention and scout this particular team? How would you describe it as being a
tough team or maybe not? We know you guys are a tough team.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, we're a tough team. I know this is going to get played
out the wrong way. But I'm going to say it anyway. And I know I'm going to get
criticized for this. White kids are always looked upon as being soft. So
Stanford's got tremendous amount of really good players who for whatever
reason, because they don't look like Tina Charles or Maya Moore, the
perception out there is going to be, well, they must be soft.  
Well, I think that's a bunch of bull. I watched them play and nobody goes
harder to the boards. Nobody takes more charges. Nobody runs the floor as
hard. Those kids are as tough as any of the kids in the country. But people on
the sports world like to make judgments on people by how they look. And it's
grossly unfair.  
I had somebody say, well, you know, Stanford's really disciplined, as if to
say we're not. You know, it's just the perceptions out there that people make.
And, yet, you don't get here to play in these games if you're not tough, if
you're not disciplined, if you're not talented, and you don't do all the
little things that good players do.  
So those West Coast people, you know what, the West Coast in general has a
reputation of being soft. But that's to the East Coast people, you know? And
it's probably true. Because we live in New York and Philadelphia and places
like that and we walk down the street going: What are you looking at? People
on the West Coast go: Hi, how are you doing? So, yeah, they are a bunch of
pansies (laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Pleased to be joined up here on the podium by Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer as well as student-athletes Jayne Appel and Kayla
Pedersen.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Thank you, Amy. We're really excited to be here. Our team
has worked, I think, very hard all season long, and we've improved a lot.  
And we're very excited to have an opportunity to play in the Final Four and to
play Connecticut. We have our work cut out for ourselves, but we're confident
we'll do a good job.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kayla, I know I've asked you this already, and I apologize, but I'm going
to ask it again anyway. Can you talk about how you view this year's team's
toughness, especially now that you're going against a team that's purported to
be, perhaps, the toughest in the country?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I think that defines our team right now, especially with those
big losses at the beginning of the year. I think we really got after it and
worked hard and everybody adjusted to their new roles.  
And I think that takes a lot of mental toughness, more than physical. And I
think that we're running the floor better. We're stronger. Just in every
aspect of the game I just think we're more cohesive and tough together.  
  
Q. Jayne, you guys have won pretty decisively in the last few weeks, do you
have any sense if in a late-game situation, if it's to, say, a two-possession
game late in the game, how you guys are going to react?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think that even though the scores might have seemed like they
were big games for us, we felt they were close the entire game, especially for
us, Ohio State, we felt it was an extremely close game the entire time.  
So I think we'll have confidence if that situation were to come up against
Connecticut.  
  
Q. Jayne, could you just talk about the success that you have had
individually during this tournament as well as your matchup with Tina Charles
tomorrow night?  
JAYNE APPEL: I couldn't take any credit, really, for my individual success
without my teammates. It takes all five of us on the court and really all 12
of us on our team in order for me to achieve what I have so far this season.  
They push me every day in practice. Sarah Boothe has become one of my -- we
all dread guarding her in practice because she has elbows that just go
everywhere. So I give all the credit to my teammates.  
And in terms of the matchup with Tina Charles, I think she's a great post
player. We definitely have our work cut out for us, and it will definitely be
a team effort in stopping her and their other great players.  
  
Q. Jayne, do you still have the promise with your coach that she has to get
a tattoo this year if you guys go?  
JAYNE APPEL: Yes, we do. We decided -- we don't know what it's going to be
yet. We decided it's going to be on her foot. That's as far as we've gotten.  
  
Q. Going against a tough team like UConn, how do you mentally prepare to win
this game as well as balance being student-athletes?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think we have to go and play with confidence is one thing and
come out and not be timid and be able to try and react to runs they're going
to make.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I didn't bring any of my books with me here because I wanted
to focus on the Final Four. But, yeah, we just started a new quarter so we're
not really worried about academics right now. So we're just totally mentally
focused.  
JAYNE APPEL: We did have to finish finals last regionals so that was pretty
tough.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: But we're mentally ready to go.  
  
Q. Jayne, I'll ask you this. For fans or for outsiders they see this rematch
as kind of a déjà vu for obvious reasons. But talking to Connecticut players,
they didn't put necessarily a whole lot of focus on that, even though a lot of
people are returning. What's it like for you guys?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think we feel the same way. I feel like both teams are
extremely different in the -- not only the style of play but the players who
have a big impact on the team.  
Last year we relied a lot on Candice to do a lot for us and they had a
different starting lineup as well. Definitely I agree with them in the sense
that they were two different teams taking the floor, so it's not so much a big
rematch as it is just the names matching up again.  
  
Q. Do you have any stories about some of your early battles with Tina over
the years in AAU?  
JAYNE APPEL: On the court? I mean, we've battled it out every summer. We've
played AU basketball actually -- Melanie Murphy on our team was her teammate
when they played for the Gazelles, I believe. So I always give Mel a hard
time. They had this whole Gazelle chant they used to do. So we've played since
seventh grade against each other. So she's one of my great friends off the
court, but on the court we're going to battle it out.  
  
Q. Kayla, there's a perception that Connecticut's strength is in its
transition. Most of the teams that have played them have marveled at how fast
they get up and down the floor. How would you classify Stanford as a
transition team, and do you think you can keep pace with them?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I think that one of the things we take pride in is our ability
to run. And I don't think a lot of those people give us credit for that. But
that's our game. We run the floor. No other post can run like Jayne can.  
So it will definitely be a fast-paced game.  
  
Q. Jayne and Kayla, you talk about UConn being on a mission since they lost
to you guys last year in the Final Four. Just talk about the mission that
you're on, too, as a team this year after losing in the title game last
year.  
JAYNE APPEL: I think it's the same motivation that we want to get back to
where we were and get to where we're knocking on the door of happening. It was
so close last year and playing in the championship game. But we had a lot of
work to do in the off season. We've really changed.  
Even Coach has told us if I were to take a bet from the beginning of the year
to now on how much improvement we've made and how much of a different team we
are in just one year, starting from the beginning to now, it's a dramatic
difference. So I think we've definitely worked really hard to get to this
point so far.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Yeah, I mean, everybody remembers what it felt like to lose to
Tennessee last year. I think that makes us really hungry and we don't want to
be in that same position; at the same time, we're not content just being here.
We're here to play to win. And we've been here before. So that's our next
step. We want to get the whole thing now.  
  
Q. Jayne and Kayla, I realize Wiggins is gone and UConn has also lost their
seniors, but is there confidence to be gained as to how the matchup against
the existing players played out in Final Four and how you guys were able to
play Maya and Renee and Tina Charles?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Yeah, we have -- I know JJ's not here for us and Candice isn't
here. But us two are playing, Jill, Jeanette, we had crucial roles in the last
game, same as their players.  
So it is a similar matchup but not totally the same.  
JAYNE APPEL: I think there's the experience that both teams gained last year.
I know I think the first time anyone comes to a Final Four it's a whirlwind of
a weekend. I was more nervous for the open practice than I was for the actual
game.  
So I think that this year it will be I think for both teams, you know, a lot
more, okay, we're here to play a game instead of it's great, we're at the
Final Four, it's always fun activities going on. But I think it's more focus
and get down to business.  
  
Q. Jayne and Kayla, how is this a different experience than it was last
year, maybe from the moment you guys won that Iowa State game to sort of
getting back here?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think it was more of an expectation rather than some goal that
we hadn't achieved yet. I know Candace worked extremely hard during her four
years to get to that point.  
So I think this year we have the mindset we weren't going to be happy unless
we got here and had a chance to compete in the Final Four.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I think last year like after winning the Maryland game I was
ecstatic because nobody thought we'd ever get to the Final Four. But after the
Iowa State game we were all excited. But from the very beginning of the year
that's what we knew we wanted to do and we were capable of it. So it really
was expected.  
  
Q. How is the preparation and the emotion different going into a game where
you're the underdog rather than the favorite?  
JAYNE APPEL: We were the underdog all last year. And I don't really think we
really take that into account, we prepared exactly the same way. Our coaches
provided us with hours of film, scouting reports that have everything on it
that you could imagine.  
So I think that we go into the same preparation mode, the same energy amount
that we have with the past games. That's why we do it against the teams every
year or every game during the season, so we can know how to prepare for a team
in a game of that stature.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Yeah, I think if we were the No. 1 seed or the 16 seed we'd
still act the same way. We get the same amount of scouting reports on every
single team, handle every team the same way, pregame ritual is the same.  
So there's nothing really that much more special about being an underdog or
about on top of the world. So we just handle everything the same way. We just
want to play. It doesn't really matter what position we're in; we're just
going to play.  
  
Q. Jayne, can you tell us -- I'm sure you've told the story many times since
you've been back from Storrs, but what was that trip like for you and how did
your dad survive that trip on the way back?  
JAYNE APPEL: He's walking now. No, but it was a great trip. There's a bunch of
schools back East. It ended up the whole plan of the trip was to see Tennessee
play Connecticut in Connecticut. And we were walking the shoot-around, and
being from California my entire life and my dad grew up in Redondo Beach, he
slipped on black ice. I didn't even know it existed. He dislocated and
fractured his ankle when we were outside of shoot-arounds. He had to watch the
game I think it was about less than five miles from the hospital and I got to
go to the game and watch it. He was kind of mad he had to miss the game. He
stayed a few extra days and had surgery. He's fine now.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
JAYNE APPEL: UConn is a tremendous program. They put a lot of energy into
recruiting me, and I went through their entire process. I think it just came
down to me wanting to play with my friends and family and Stanford was the
perfect fit for me and I couldn't be happier with where I am.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Tara, could you just comment on the evolution of Jayne's season this
year? I think she started the year coming off shoulder and knee surgery and
has she not only played her way into shape but into the best basketball of her
career?  
COACH VANDERVEER: She had shoulder surgery last spring, was out for six
months. And she made the commitment that she was going to come back in great
shape. Last year for us she had to play basically 39 minutes a game and we
were watching last year's semifinal game and just the announcers repeatedly
talked about how gassed she was, how tired she was. She was actually sick when
she was here, too.  
But she said, you know, the funny thing about that, she said, I thought I was
in shape. And she really made a commitment in the off-season to really improve
her conditioning. She changed her eating, eating more nutritionally and she's
much fitter this year.  
And unfortunately right in the beginning of our practices, right in the
beginning of September, the beginning of October, rather, she had to have her
knee scoped. So she was out with her knee surgery a little bit. So she was
upset about that. But she has come back.  
She's really the focal point of our offense. We go inside to Jayne and we let
things happen through her. And she's a great passer. She's an incredibly
unselfish and smart player. And just depending upon how teams play her, then
she'll go with the flow. If she's doubled, she passes. If she's singed she'll
work on taking her move. She'll rebound. She plays defense.  
She's had some real extreme games. Like she's get six points in some games and
46 in another game. But she's the same person either way.  
  
Q. In late-game situations, I know you've said there were a couple of games
that felt more uncomfortable than maybe the scoreboard indicated they were.
But if this is a tight game, if this is a two-possession game with a few
minutes left, do you feel good about where your team is?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, probably as a coach you're probably more
comfortable if you're up 20 with a few minutes to go or one minute to go. But
I think Jayne said it, the Ohio State game was a close game. Came down it was
a four-point game. Maybe with three minutes to go.  
And this is what we work on every day in practice. We might not have that many
close games. But I don't think Connecticut does either. We have been in close
games with really great teams. And I think we've learned what to do and also
what not to do.  
So who knows. A lot of it comes down you have to make free throws. You have to
make maybe adjustments. But I feel confident that our players know what we
need them to do and will do it whether it's a 2- or 20-point game.  
  
Q. Could you comment on the development of Jeanette Pohlen, how she's
assumed the role of point guard and how her off-season helped prepare her for
that?  
COACH VANDERVEER: That's a great question. Honestly, we would not be here
today without Jeanette making the same decision that Jayne made in the off-
season to really maximize her potential.  
You know, a lot of players think you become a player during the season and
practicing with your team, and in fact it's just the opposite. And I think
that since the NCAA in some ways has the 20-hour rule they feel like we're
done with practice, we're done. And Jeanette, not only in the off-season in
the spring, but she changed what she eats. She eats much healthier and
nutritionally-sound food.  
She has improved her conditioning tremendously, worked on her skills, her
3-point shooting and ball handling and she was going to play for us no matter
who else came back. So she was either going to play the 1, 2 or 3 for us and
she was going to be out there.  
It just so happened that the 1 spot was the one that was really open. And she
has embraced it. And she's doing a great job running our team.  
  
Q. Coach Geno and his girls talked about how they wanted to really run and
run and run and how you all would try to slow the pace down a little bit. And
it sounded like your players maybe wanted to take on the challenge a little
bit. And you've mentioned your conditioning and that's obviously a real key
role in that. But whether or not how successful you are at slowing it down a
little bit, a game's that got that much transitioning and that much running a
lot of times can turn on not necessarily the starters but your bench. Tell me
a little bit about your depth and how prepared you think you might be for a
game where you are going to be having to run a lot of people in and out
because of the pace.  
COACH VANDERVEER: You never know what is really going to happen tomorrow. But
our team likes to play up-tempo. We like to run. And obviously Connecticut
does, too. We'll play people sparingly.  
So I'm not going to just substitute you go in, you go in, you go in, but if
Jayne needs an extra minute, we'll put Sarah Boothe in. If Jill needs it,
we'll bring in Rosalyn Gold-Onwude.  
We've played three people off the bench the most, Lindy La Rocque, Rosalyn
Gold-Onwude and Sarah Boothe. But Melanie Murphy can go right in. She's doing
really well. And we could play Michelle Harrison. I feel confident going 10
deep in limited minutes. But that's all depending upon the situation. And I
look out there and we have to run the floor with Connecticut. You have to do
some things and that's one of the things that's at the top of the list.  
  
Q. Could you look back seven, eight years ago and talk about the
differences, not just in the sport itself, but the Final Four experience and
everything that goes around this event?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Seven or eight years ago we weren't here. We had been here
and probably noticed a difference last year so much because it's just that
much bigger. There's so much more coverage. There's so many more things going
on. The arena's full. I mean, it's a great experience for -- it's always been
a great experience. But now it's just that much -- there's much more exposure
for women's basketball, and you see it at the Final Four.  
  
Q. I was wondering, Geno was talking a little bit about before Tina and it
seems like Jayne as well, they're two of the most imposing centers in the
country, but they're also just like such nice kids, like he picks on Tina
sometimes and says like carry yourself, but they're both such nice kids but
they're both All-Americans today.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I would include Courtney Paris. She's, of course, quite an
imposing center also. You know, these are women that are -- they're really
comfortable with themselves and who they are, and you can just tell being
around them that they love the game of basketball. But Jayne was wearing heels
like that big last night. I got on a chair to take a picture with her.  
And that's just -- I think that just points towards, I don't know, the
changes, the progressive changes that have come with women being in sports,
how they're very comfortable being out there battling and being aggressive and
being physical and then being off the court, painting their nails, and they're
kids.  
Sometimes we forget how young they are and kind of the things that make them
laugh. But they are really outstanding young student-athletes, and as you said
I think especially the three that are here in this tournament, the three
centers, are phenomenal centers. And how often do you get three that good
coming through the same time?  
  
Q. How would you sum up the senior season Jillian has had?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Thanks for coming down for the tournament. It's great.
Jill's had a phenomenal senior year, and I think a lot of it -- I know she was
Player of the Year in Oregon two times and led the state in scoring.  
She's really expanded her game. She was more of a post player in high school.
She's a 2 guard on our team right now. Her ball handling, her shooting. But I
think she's just had an outstanding senior year because of her summer with the
New Zealand Olympic team. That experience really kind of broadened her horizon
in terms of understanding how people play, how hard they work at the game, how
big it is internationally.  
And I think it's really helped her confidence a lot. But I'm going to really
miss Jill and to know I could only coach her for two more games makes me
really sad.  
  
Q. I know you haven't coached an undefeated team in college but you had the
experience with the U.S. team a couple years back. Could you talk what the
pressure is like of having to coach a team that doesn't lose or hasn't lost
and just what you've seen? I'm sure you've seen a lot of Connecticut this
year, not on film. What's it like and the pressure that as a coach to try to
get a team motivated every game and also the pressure of not having lost?  
COACH VANDERVEER: My hat's off to Geno and his staff and the great year that
Connecticut's having. I don't know. It makes me nervous. In some ways, you
know, with us, we've learned a lot from losing. And you remember we lost some
games early on. Or we even lost a game in the Pac-10.  
And when you lose, it reminds you how much you hate to lose. And it really --
I think it helps us refocus. So he handles it well. And he's coached national
championship teams that have gone undefeated and obviously they have great
talent.  
I was very nervous when we had the Olympic team and we kept winning and kept
winning, and I wondered are there things we're not doing, are there things
that we should be doing better?  
But, again, they're having a great year, and he seems to be very comfortable
with it. Maybe we'll be in that situation some day and I could answer the
question better.  
  
Q. What advice would you give to a young player who would want to play for a
team like Stanford?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Great question. First of all, I think that in order to play
at the collegiate level, Division I or Division II and Division III, you
really have to have discipline.  
And you have to be disciplined in your studies and disciplined in your
workouts. And really challenge yourself to use your time wisely. And that's
the thing that I see with our student-athletes, is that they really manage
their time well.  
They might have time for a little like maybe video game, but not a lot. And
they really manage their time well. They study. They are able to prioritize
their studying and their workouts. But that would be the best advice is be
very disciplined.  
  
Q. I know your answer to this is that's a stupid question. Do you expect to
win tomorrow?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I don't know that I ever expect to win. In any
game that we go into, I don't expect to win. I feel that our team has to do
the right things in order to earn the right to win. So I never go into a game
expecting to win.  
I anticipate we try to work really hard to prepare our team to do everything
possible to be in a situation to be successful. But I don't expect to win any
games.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could comment on the unique challenges facing the
freshmen players on your team, being that they weren't with you when your team
made this run last year, and also, if I may, the contributions you expect them
to have in tomorrow's game, particularly from Nnemkadi Ogwumike?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Nnemkadi was here, not playing, but she was here watching
last year because she was here with the WBCA High School All-Americans and in
fact played in the game that is going on this afternoon. But it is new for
them, and we are counting on them to do the things they've been doing for us
all year in Nnemkadi Ogwumike's situation: start the game, defend well,
rebound well and take care of the ball and play and contribute.  
And we don't have time for freshmanitis or jitters, whatever, it's one game,
40 minutes. We're also expecting great contributions from Sarah Boothe and
Lindy La Rocque. Those three freshmen have performed very well for us all
year, and we're hoping and expecting the same.  
  
Q. One, either Joanne or Charlie talk to you at all after playing UConn in
Trenton?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I've spoken with both, yes.  
  
Q. And second one is, did playing UConn last year early in the season and
getting your butt kicked help you prepare for seeing them in the Final Four;
that you've already played them once and had some idea what they brought and
knew what you had to do better as opposed to this year where you haven't
played them at all?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think last year's loss to them early helped us a lot. And
I thank them for us being in the Final Four because without playing them I
don't know that I could have gotten our team's attention in terms of how hard
we had to practice, the pace that we had to play at.  
Connecticut does a phenomenal job of just the pace they play at. They have
great athletes, and their coaches and players have played at the highest
level, and that's how they play.  
And our team learned a lot from the Virgin Islands loss. I think a lot of
players remember that, and they also remember last year. So we have the
benefit of knowing if we don't do the right thing what it could be in terms of
the bad side, and then knowing if we do the right thing what it could be on
the good side.  
So I don't know that it does -- the other two teams have played Connecticut.
We haven't. But we played them as close to last year -- as close to in this
year as you could.  
  
Q. How does the team feel different today than it did a week ago today?  
COACH VANDERVEER: A week ago we had just -- today's Saturday. We hadn't played
yet. So we were getting ready for Ohio State. And it was kind of the first
game of two games obviously at the regional.  
Honestly, I feel the same way. You want to come in and win two games. Our team
has been on this trip, like I think Jayne alluded to it a little bit -- our
team has been very business-like on this trip.  
I see just like really good focus on what we're working on, whether it's
video. And I think it's great that our team has finished finals. Last week at
this time people were kind of tired and they had been doing their finals this
week. They're well rested. They've taken care of their finals.  
They're very locked into our scouting report and doing the things we need to
do to be successful against UConn. And having been here and having played
them, I get a sense of calm. I mean, we know they're a great team.  
We know what they like to do. Everyone knows what they like to do. But our
team likes the challenge of saying, well, we're going to play our game. And
they're excited about it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Oklahoma  74  
Purdue - 68

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Courtney Paris and Danielle Robinson and Coach
Coale. Coach?  
COACH COALE: Thank you. Proud of our kids, our second-half effort, the
resiliency, their refusal to go away. I challenged them at halftime, 22 points
in the first half, that means we better have 55 in the second, darned if we
didn't have 52, we got close.  
Defensively I thought we were really good all night long against a team that's
difficult to defend, and even though we missed quite a few in the first half,
we made the ones that mattered in the second, and we were terrific from the
free-throw line. And somebody will ask about those turnovers, we had 11 and
that's good for us.  
  
Q. Courtney and Danielle, talk about the first half when you could have
gotten frustrated because shots weren't falling for you and how you kept it
together and regrouped in the second half.  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think whenever shots aren't falling, that's the biggest
issue in a situation, and we knew we could come back second half and finish
plays and that's what we did.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: We knew we weren't shooting particularly well, but we were
playing great defense and points came from the foul line, so if we stopped
fouling, things would change.  
  
Q. Courtney, you played a complete game. Was it just the kind of desperation
to keep this season going?  
COURTNEY PARIS: Yeah. I'm a senior, I don't get another chance. It's the Final
Four. You want to make sure you give everything you can and leave everything
out on the court no matter if you're struggling or not.  
  
Q. Courtney, what's it mean to go to the Final Four?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I'm happy, I finally get to go with these guys, so it will be
a lot of fun. It's been a long four years, but it makes it all worth it. I'm
not surprised.  
I think we got here the way we've been playing and that's together. And just
having fun out on the court. At no time were we up 20 points, but it felt like
it, and I think that's the most important thing for us.  
  
Q. Courtney, there was a point when you made a pass to Ashley and she got a
3-point play. They had just cut the lead down to 4. How big of a play do you
think that was to answer that 3? They had come out of a time-out and got a
good shot and scored.  
COURTNEY PARIS: I thought it was a huge play. They kept trying to double with
the other post player so Ashley would be wide open. And I knew they were
helping with the guard, so she was able to get that shot off and draw the
foul. It was great for our momentum.  
  
Q. Danielle, Coach Coale talked about yesterday how during the off season
and during practices you bring a notebook and write down what you did wrong
and what you can work on to get better. Talk about that dedication and how
it's led to you tonight making the points and keying your team to go to the
Final Four.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: The Coach does such a great job with all of us, making sure
that we're getting better every day, and that's what makes the program
special, is buying into the system and that we do it together.  
  
Q. Danielle, seemed like your motor was running a little fast at the first
half, and I would assume the halftime the Coach talked to you about slowing it
down.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: She talked about not being surprised that I was open.
Malone was guarding, but then she would let up and I was surprised that the
room was there and I was open.  
So she said really just focus on the target and be a point guard. There was
only 20 minutes left in the game and we had to adjust.  
  
Q. Courtney, that's about as animated as I've seen in you a game,
celebrating during the game. Is that as animated as you've been, the magnitude
of the game tonight?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think we were having fun, and we weren't up by 30 or 20,
didn't have the game blown away, but it felt like it. We were playing as a
team and it's fun when you do that.  
  
Q. Courtney, could you talk about that run in the second half where y'all
ended up with the great defensive pressure to control the game, and it looked
like Danielle and Whitney were a big part of that run.  
COURTNEY PARIS: Definitely. We tried to go inside and get some shots and we
got a lot of little fouls and adjusted to it.  
And Whitney came out and knocked down that three off one of those magic plays
that Coach Coale has, and D-Rob hit some shots and got to the rim so fast. I
don't know, I'm just happy we have that one.  
  
Q. Courtney, what was the crowd like tonight and how much of a different did
it make for you guys?  
COURTNEY PARIS: It's amazing and I don't think they realize that. The other
team, when you were at the free-throw line and our crowd is going crazy and
that energy and they're looking and saying it's not just them you're playing
against, you're playing against all these people, too. So that manager was
amazing.  
But they're back there backing us up and keeping us going. I think we have
some of the best fans in the nation and I hope they stay like that.  
  
Q. Courtney, would you talk about your defense, you had six blocks, talk
about going up against the big players and being able to go head-to-head.  
COURTNEY PARIS: Lindsay is really good, I've had the opportunity to play
against her in USA basketball and she moves well off the dribble and has a
nice jump shot. I thought our "scout" was good and we were able to make a few
plays.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, good luck at the Final Four. Thank you.  
  
Q. Sherri, during this era of the Paris twins, there have been frustration
in some ways, Courtney was just named All-American, the first time a player
has done that, talk about the difference at this point, getting to the Final
Four a year in the making and the dedication that has gone into it at this
point, especially with the twins as seniors.  
COACH COALE: Sometimes it's going through the valley that makes standing on
the mountain top worth it. It hasn't been easy, hasn't been easy for any of
us. You have to earn your way, though.  
I think particularly at the close of last season guys had to make a
commitment, you know, either we're going to commit and do this thing, or we're
going to end up disappointed. And I think a lot of our commitment began with
Ashley's commitment to her physical body. And Danielle's commitment to
improving her perimeter shooting. And A.T. being in the gym.  
And you can't discount the addition of Whitney Hand and the spirit and the
life that she infuses us with, not to mention a good stroke from behind the
arc. So it's a lot of things and very rewarding.  
I wish I could think -- I'm still too emotional from what went on, but there
is a great quote by Tony Dungy that I have on the side of my computer that
talks about how being tough makes it worth it when you get there. "Quiet
Strength", that's the name of his book.  
  
Q. Sherri, when you hit the two 3-pointers, you guys were clicking, talk
about that.  
COACH COALE: I've said a number of times, true freshman. When she hits a
three, we feel like we're invincible, and that opened the flood gates because
at that point she hit the three, we ran a play for Danielle to get to the rim,
and turned around, ran a play for the post and then went back to Whitney and
she hit the three from the top of the key. It was huge and it opens up
everything and changes the flavor and complexion of everything.  
  
Q. Coach, Courtney said she felt like you guys were up by 20 the whole game,
I didn't get that impression.  
COACH COALE: I don't remember feeling that way.  
  
Q. I didn't think so. How tough was that game in general? The expectation to
win with all the fans here, was the pressure as much as maybe you've ever
felt?  
COACH COALE: No, didn't feel a single bit of that. Honestly, Purdue was good
and I didn't say anything about that in my opening comments, and I sure should
have. What a well-coached basketball team.  
Every time in the second half that we had a chance to put them away, they came
down and made an incredibly difficult shot. Possession after possession after
possession we could not stretch seven. We got it to nine once, I think, and we
could not stretch, five, seven, five, seven, and that's because they came down
and made big plays.  
They're confident, tough, and well coached and down the stretch they did
exactly what they had to do. They were fantastic from the free-throw line, 31
of 34, goodness, we need to quit fouling people, don't we?  
  
Q. Coach, would you talk about halftime. Were there a the lot of
adjustments, a little bit, could you not wait to get there to get to some
things?  
COACH COALE: Well, sometimes you don't like to see halftime comein' because
you're on a roll and you don't want to stop the rhythm, and sometimes when you
don't have any, you can't wait for it to get there so you can stop and
regroup. I felt like it was one of those.  
I think of Barry Switzer a lot when I go into the locker room, and he is one
of the most revered coaches in college coaching history, and he has a Super
Bowl ring, but aside from that, if you're not careful, you can convince your
team into thinking they can't win.  
And I remember that we played against Cal Berkeley, and tonight when I walked
into the locker room I knew there were a couple of adjustments we needed to
make offensively. I thought we were guardin' the heck out of 'em, they had 12
free-throws in the first half, and that's how they got to 27, so we were
really guardin' them.  
I thought it was the most important thing I could do was to convince our kids
that we could win, and that's what I spent my time talking about not much
strategy, we called a couple of plays to start the second half, told 'em to
continue to do what they were doing defensively, but spent most of my time
trying to infuse them with confidence and get them to believe that we could
win.  
  
Q. Sherri, congratulations. Comment on Amanda Thompson's contributions
tonight. She gave you guys minutes tonight.  
COACH COALE: Thank you for asking about her, and I told my team in the locker
room before we had our team prayer, "How about Amanda being ready when it was
her turn?" She handled this injury with grace and stayed engaged.  
We ran two new sets that we put in for just in the tournament in the last few
days, and she hadn't had an opportunity to do them because we've been limiting
all of her reps.  
We put her in to make the pass and she's just been watching it, and she went
in and threaded the needle and hit the exact pass. No jumper probably bigger
than her contested jumper that she made on the wing when we were making our
run. She plays with no fear. I said all year we get our toughness from A.T.
and she gave it to us when we needed it most.  
  
Q. Sherri, against Georgia Tech you were tied at halftime and not good on
offense, and after the game you said you were more annoyed than worried, was
it the same way tonight? Or were you more worried than annoyed?  
COACH COALE: I don't remember ever being worried, seriously, concerned, maybe?
Not worried. And I wasn't annoyed at halftime, not at all. I felt like we were
playing too fast. We would foul and then come down and try to make up for
fouling really fast.  
Everything was too fast, D-Rob's penetration was too fast, Whitney's three's
were too fast, finishes were too fast, no one caught it before they shot it, I
thought that was trying too hard. You don't get annoyed with kids for trying
too hard, you get annoyed when they're not playing hard. We were playing hard,
we just needed to calm down a little bit.  
  
Q. Would you talk about Courtney getting to this point? I know it's been the
one thing missing for her.  
COACH COALE: First of all, let me just say that it may be the one thing
missing, but winning a National Championship isn't the whole deal. I just left
a sea of players out there who gave us their guts for four years and didn't
get to go to the Final Four and didn't get to play for a National
Championship, who had wildly successful careers at the University of Oklahoma.
And they had experiences that have fueled them and make them some of the best
people on the planet.  
I think it's awesome that Court and Ash and Carolyn Winchester get to end
their careers with a trip to the Final Four, and I hope it gives us the
opportunity to hoist a National Championship trophy, but it's about so much
more than that in collegiate athletics.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about your two young guards stepin' up in a big way in the
second half. They played like seasoned veterans.  
COACH COALE: Whitney and Danielle have been fabulous and our team has taken on
their personality, their demeanor. Whitney, when I took her out, started
yelling immediately, "I'm going to make the next shot." It was the cutest
thing I've ever seen.  
She is 18 years of age and she started screaming at me, "I will make the next
shot ,"and I said, "I believe you, but you can rest for a bit now." She is
just wide-eyed and Jasmine and her think this is what you do, you practice and
go to the Final Four, this is what you do. That's neat, you have that mixed in
with the older guys who know what a climb it is and how hard it is and it's
been a nice combination.  
Danielle Robinson is the engine, there is no doubt about it. She runs the
game, manages the game, gives us our energy, gives us our confidence, give us
life. I can't say enough about the way she managed the game on both ends of
the floor in the second half. I thought she was fantastic, confident, tough,
resilient, all of those things that you want your point guard to be.  
  
Q. Nice hat. You came out before the game standing in front of the bench and
it looked like you looked around and you had this look on your face like "I
really can't believe this crowd." Do you remember that moment?   
COACH COALE: Yeah, I wanted to make sure that I took it all in. These things
are special and you can get so zeroed in that you can miss some of the neatest
stuff.  
I probably knew a lot of those people way up high that I couldn't quite see,
and I wanted to take it in because I knew as soon as they began to announce
starters, I wouldn't think about a single soul, it would be about what
happened between the lines. So I wanted to take a moment and make sure I never
forgot.  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, Coach, best of luck at the Final Four.

Hylton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16907)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Oklahoma  74  
Purdue - 68

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Purdue Boilermakers, Coach Versyp, our
two student athletes, Lindsey Wisdom-Hylton and Danielle Campbell. Coach?  
COACH VERSYP: I thought it was an incredible battle tonight. Oklahoma having
as many fans, hopefully they broke the record for how many fans you can have
at a regional, and the support that they have and how Oklahoma City has taken
care of all the teams.  
I want to thank all of them first and foremost for their hospitality, but a
very tough basketball game, came down to a lot of runs, they hit big shots,
were able to get some offensive boards and we knew that would be a little bit
of a problem.  
We came down and were knocking down shots and they kind of got that 4 to
6-point lead, we needed to get two stops in a row to turn the tide. We kept
battling, but in the end they won.  
I wish Sherri Coale and her team the best of luck in the Final Four. Most of
all I'm proud of our ladies, played very hard, never gave up. Obviously it's
an intense environment.  
I thought we didn't back down whatsoever and we can leave here holding our
heads high.  
  
Q. Lindsay, you guys were behind four points at the beginning of the second,
was that the critical moment?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I think they shut us down, they were able to come out
and run, and I think we put our heads down for a second and they were able to
get the lead and we started coming back and we couldn't quite get the couple
stops that we needed at the crucial times.  
  
Q. Lindsay, you guys talked all week about "us against the world" mentality,
was the crowd a factor or do you tune it out?   
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I feel like we tuned it out the best way we could. We
stayed well as a unit and communicated the best we could. It helps when you
have a crowd of this size, and I think the crowd helped them is what I think
was effective. But I think we were able to still tune them out.  
  
Q. Danielle, what was the feeling at halftime, up five? What did you think
you needed to do in the second half?  
DANIELLE CAMPBELL: Coming in the second half, we thought that we needed to
slow down the tempo and actually execute our plays. We were still up five, but
we weren't playing Purdue basketball, we weren't running sets and executing.
So that was the big thing we said we needed to work on in the second half.  
  
Q. Could you guys talk about what it's like to play against Courtney who
just seems to come at you, come at you and pretty powerful in the lane? Could
you talk about that?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: She's a great player. She got on the boards on us
early, and I think she was able to get us in foul trouble and that hurt us.  
She plays her game really well and she is very physical and it's tough to
defend her. That's what kinda hurt us, the boards early on with her play.  
DANIELLE CAMPBELL: Lindsay said it best, she's a great player and it's tough
to defend her and she did get us in foul trouble.  
  
Q. I know this is an emotional moment, but when you step back, can you
reflect, you guys got this far as a 6 seed, that's pretty amazing, wouldn't
you think?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: Yeah, it is, I think we're the 6th team ever to do
that, and I'm proud of what we've done. I feel like we could have taken it to
the next level, we just fell short.  
DANIELLE CAMPBELL: What Lindsay said. We played hard all this way, we left it
all on the floor, I'm just proud of our team.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on a great season. Thank you. First
question for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, just the ride they put you on these last few weeks and the
momentum they gave you and just everything they gave you this last month or
so.  
COACH VERSYP: This team has been amazing. You hope as coaches you get them
prepared to play in February and March, and we went through a lot of
adversity, handled them very well, really empowered our players. This group of
seniors have been amazing.  
That's what is so sad is now they're moving on to their next life, you know,
after basketball. I think the biggest thing is they totally believed.  
You always try to figure out -- everybody says how does the switch go on? And
a lot of that is confidence. You know, you can tell it, you can see the
swagger on the court, the shoulders are back and it's just a different
mentality.  
The mental imagery that we do, trying to keep it loose, all those things. This
ride has been phenomenal, I'm trying to get them to understand it's a journey,
it's a process, the end result isn't always great, but as you're enjoying the
process, that's what you learn the most and this team is one of the most
special I've ever been a part of.  
  
Q. They got a 7-point lead, you call time-out, you call a time-out, Brittany
hits the 3 and you get it down to 4 and then they come down and Courtney and
Ashley team up for another 3.  
COACH VERSYP: Our kids did a great job, every time I held up a card, they
executed and we scored. We knew we needed to get a stop and Lindsay was trying
to get them off the boards, but they're tall and they have long arms and have
an opportunity to get the boards.  
Didn't break our back because we're going to keep fighting back but, again,
you need to get stops and when we did we needed to make sure we scored and we
didn't maybe a couple of times in a row.  
At the end we weren't out of it, we kept going back and forth and still doing
good things, but we did fall short, obviously.  
  
Q. Coach, I wanted to ask you about those cards. I noticed that you were
flashing printed cards there with your plays on them. Is that because of the
size of the house and the noise?  
COACH VERSYP: It's not normal, but I think when you can -- you have hand
signals, but when people are running down the court, sometimes they're not
always paying attention and you're trying to figure that out.  
So when it started getting loud, I kept flipping the card and we scored every
single time. That was the biggest thing, it's kinda that confidence with them.
They knew exactly what they were going to run, they got into their spots and
they scored. It was effective. Obviously we didn't win, but it was a big part
of our success.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH VERSYP: No, I didn't run out of cards at all.  
  
Q. You came out at halftime, and the first three minutes you hung in there,
still up 7 and then five straight empty possessions. Do you see that as the
difference in the game right there? That's when they went on their run.  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, we had layups down low, didn't knock 'em down, you know,
and that sometimes is draining. But there were times when they didn't score in
the first half and that's why we had a 5-point lead, it just happened to be
the reverse in the second half.  
Theirs was 23% in the first half, ours was 30%, but they were able to do some
things, we were trying to execute, we needed to do that better.  
We were trying to go for the first option and then we got wrapped around it
and doing the things that we do well and that's when we started scoring.  
  
Q. You came into this game in the last three tournament games shooting well.
You picked it up late, but why was it a struggle for you to get that rhythm
early on?  
COACH VERSYP: I think both teams were playing great defense. They shot 30%, we
shot 23. They didn't allow a lot of three's, we didn't allow a lot of three's.
I thought it was a very defensive game.  
A lot of people didn't have good looks. The looks they had down low were
offensive boards and layups, but I thought it was a defensive battle that
first half.  
  
Q. Despite this loss, the runs you've made, it makes people have to
acknowledge that Purdue is among women's elite basketball?  
COACH VERSYP: Like we said before, we're the top-10 winningest team in the
country, 15 Sweet 16s, consecutive NCAA appearance, three consecutive Final
Fours, National Championship runner-up, and I think the stats speak for
themselves.  
The coaches before me and my staff has done a great job and we're trying to
keep with that tradition and being as successful as possible.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on a great season.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Coale, Whitney Hand is here, Courtney
Paris and Ashley Paris will be here in a few moments, Danielle Robinson and
Nyeshia Stevenson at the end. Coach your comments about last night?  
COACH COALE: Obviously very proud of our team, proud of our efforts.  
Excited to still be alive and to have an opportunity to face a very, very good
Purdue team tomorrow night in what we hope is a record crowd for women's
basketball in the state of Oklahoma.  
  
Q. Ashley, talk about being one win away from going to the Final Four.  
ASHLEY PARIS: It's amazing, and last night on the way to the media I was
talking to Danielle and Whitney about it. They just don't understand how hard
it's been since I've been here to get past the Sweet 16 and the feeling was
unreal. And for them it's like, "we're in the Elite 8" it's a huge deal, it's
amazing!  
  
Q. Whitney, your experience in all of this for the first time? What did you
take to heart from Ashley and Courtney?  
WHITNEY HAND: She told us that she was jealous of us last night as we were
walking up, because this is our first time and I mean this is incredible, it's
an incredible feat. There are eight teams left and we're one of the lucky few
that get to practice another day.  
We won and survived, and you can't take any day for granted because you don't
know how long you're going to be able to be here, so I'm just thankful to get
to play with them a little longer.  
  
Q. Ashley, following up on the first question, how much does it mean for you
to be an important part of it, the work you've put in in the off-season and to
have gotten to this point? What does it mean to you?  
ASHLEY PARIS: Personally it means a lot. Obviously to play for a National
Championship and win a National Championship is the dream I had when I was a
little girl, so to be this close to it is just amazing.  
Just being able to shed some weight in the off-season and working on my game
and my confidence, I feel like it's paid off for my team and I'm able to
contribute enough for us to be at this point, so it means a lot.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, Ashley and Whitney, what's the progress of getting better and
the focus you have to have to improve on what's already a good product?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: I would have to say focus on the little things, trying to
get to where we are now, focus on the things from November and focus now.
There is no trying to get better, you can get better anyway.  
ASHLEY PARIS: It's focussing on the little things and fine-tuning things. I
feel personally at this point it's more about how we are together and how we
act on the court and how we believe in each other. Just how we are together
trying to fight through this.  
WHITNEY HAND: Yeah, I mean, Coach always says there is no such thing as
insignificant bad or good days. And I think at this point every second
matters, every second that we're together as a team in the hotel and every
second we're out on the court as a group getting better, so I think they're
exactly right.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, your role has changed dramatically over the last three weeks,
first with the injury to Whitney and then the injury to Amanda. Talk about
shuffling in and out of the starting rotation.  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: It's been a little weird, it's not like I haven't played
this position. I just get to come out and do it a little earlier than usual.  
My teammates rely on me to step up and makeup for some of it, but I rely on
them also to help me and they've embraced me a lot in this role and I really
do appreciate them for that.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, Ashley and Whitney, last night you all played in front of 11,000
cheering fans. You will probably have more fans on Tuesday night. How much
does that help in a big-game environment like this?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: I think it means a lot. Our fans are awesome, and for them
to be here with us fighting the fight with us, knowing that we have one more
game just to get to the Final Four, it's awesome. And we really do appreciate
our fans and we love them as much as they love us.  
ASHLEY PARIS: I've always said it in general, I think we have some of the best
women's basketball fans. I think they would still show up even if we weren't
playing here. Walking out there and seeing 10,000 fans sitting cheering for
you, we're definitely spoiled, and I feel sorry for the other teams, really.  
I didn't know it makes a huge impact for us, but on the free-throw, one of the
girls was like, "we have to play against all of these fans, come on!" So they
do add to the game and it's so much fun to be here.  
WHITNEY HAND: I think it's a lot of fun. When you take visits to the school
and other conferences, they have 2,000, 3,000, you're like, this is all right,
it's girls' basketball, and at Oklahoma it's 12,000 people at every game.  
This is incredible, but it's not unique for us, we're used to playing in front
of this many people, because it doesn't matter if it's exhibitions or regional
finals, they're going to be here supporting us, that's what makes our fans so
special.  
  
Q. Whitney, for the thousandth time would you talk about dealing with your
finger? Does it hurt now? Do you change the way you catch the ball? Do you
think about it at this point?  
WHITNEY HAND: At this point no. I think when I first came back, I think I let
it affect me a little too much. I was weary, maybe, and we tried some things,
like putting padding on it, to the point that I couldn't dribble.  
And I think that I kind of overdid it maybe just being precautious, but right
now it's feeling great, I'm catching it normally, and it's not even really a
factor in my mind at this point.  
  
Q. Courtney and Ashley, when you guys decided to come to Oklahoma, it wasn't
too long after they had been in the National Championship game. Do you guys
recall watching that game in 2002? Had you thought about comparisons between
that team and this team?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I remember watching that game, but I had no idea I would be
coming to Oklahoma. Just thinking back on it, I'm glad to be in the position
we are now and hopefully we can get back there and do what they did.  
ASHLEY PARIS: Like Courtney said, I watched that game, but I never in my
wildest imagination did I ever think I would be here.  
I think what's similar between our team and their team, Coach talks about the
way they were together and the way they buckled down and got through it. I
feel like we feed off of that and learned from that, and obviously Coach has
been there and having her here to tell us how to do it is huge for us.  
  
Q. Courtney and Ashley, to follow up, was it the force of Sherri's
personality that got you here? It doesn't seem like it's a natural thing to go
from the Bay area to Norman. What was it about her that attracted you to come
here?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think there were a lot of factors in getting us to come
here. I loved the people that were here, the players and the whole staff.  
We were always watching the games, and I don't know who you guys were playing,
but this is when I was first sold as Coach Coale as a coach, and they were
beating somebody on the Big 12 and they were missing a ton of layups, and she
made a comment and I thought "I want to play for that coach."  
  
Q. Do you remember what it was?  
COURTNEY PARIS: It was just funny, it was funny but it -- they were winning,
but they were missing layups, but they were still playing well, and I can't
remember what it was exactly, but I just know I was like, okay.  
ASHLEY PARIS: I don't know what Courtney is talking about -- (Chuckles.) I
think just really more so than -- Coach Coale isn't the typical recruiter, she
is not going to tell you what you want to hear and all that great stuff.  
They're just honest and the people around them, and coming here, it's a family
atmosphere, I think that's what sold me. And I didn't know any of these girls
were coming when I first came here, but I had her faith in ability to put good
people around me and around the program.  
  
Q. Courtney, I wanted to ask you about Danielle. When did you see her
getting the confidence she is playing with now? Is there any way that you can
describe things that maybe people wouldn't see that shows why she is a better
point guard this year, maybe not in the box score, but how she leads you
guys?  
COURTNEY PARIS: Definitely, she came in from high school last year and had to
lead a team. That's a hard thing to do, in any position, let alone the point
guard position, and knowing what everybody else has to do.  
I know she has a lot of the little meetings, point guard meetings with Coach
Coale. (Chuckles.) I remember this summer her putting in time in the gym and
her confidence is the biggest thing. She is sure now and it's not just for
herself, but we look at her and she's okay, so we feel like, okay, we're okay.
So that's the huge thing.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think when we started preseason and practices we could see
the difference.  
  
Q. Courtney and Ashley, now that you guys have been here four years, talk
about how you've seen Coach Coale grow as a coach.  
COURTNEY PARIS: Could they get any taller? (Chuckles.) I don't know. I love
the way she deals with people and she knows how to read the situation. I love
what she's done with our point guards and building up D-Rob's confidence.  
I love our individual workouts and how she challenges people, and you could be
playing horrible and she tells you, "hey, here is what you need to do" and she
keeps you accountable and I love that.  
I don't know, I think of anything this year, I think this is for offensively
our assistants, but it may have been just me being younger, not believing that
things were going to work, but every single time this year we bring down a
scout, I'm like, "wow, I believe in this" and we just have to follow through
with the plan.  
ASHLEY PARIS: I don't know how she's grown, but I know that she has helped me
grow. Like Courtney said, she is able to adjust with you and help you with
just the next stage of your life and basketball in general.  
  
Q. Ashley and Danielle, talk about Purdue. Do they compare to any team that
you've played this year, whether in the Big 12 or nonconference?  
ASHLEY PARIS: I was talking to Courtney and another teammate about this, they
compare to like a Baylor, when Danielle Wilson was out there, they have the
Rayburn girl who comes off the bench and is able to contribute a lot, just
like Melissa Jones and a great post presence, athletic, good rebounders can
drive and play the high post and all around solid guards and obviously good
coaching.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Their point guard is quick, their shooters like to get out
and run behind her. Like Ashley talked about, they have a solid post presence
and two seniors that are leading them in the post and they play together. They
compete and play hard and that's what makes them so great and that's what got
'em here.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. Questions for the Coach?  
  
Q. Sherri, do you have a general job description for your point guard? How
does Danielle fit into that? Also, has that description changed?  
COACH COALE: The general job description is "everything is your fault ."
"Everything that goes wrong is your fault, fix it, make it right, you're in
charge."  
It's a big thing, because being a point guard is more than distributing the
basketball, it's more than getting your teammates in the proper place at the
proper time.  
It's a whole ball of intangibles that the really great ones possess, and it's
a way you walk and a look that you have on your face and a way in which you
communicate with others. You are the instiller of hope in your teammates.  
It is your responsibility to arrive at the gym with their best game in your
eyes. We talk about that in the most specific of ways, getting the ball to the
action, getting it below the free-throw line, being able to feed a post
player.  
The most specific things to the most general things, being the first one off
the floor to greet your teammates, all kinds of stuff. It's a big development,
leadership position and your work is never done. You can never get good enough
at it.  
  
Q. How does Danielle fit into that?  
COACH COALE: Gosh, I love the kid. If every kid were as coachable as Danielle
Robinson, you could do this until you're 99 years old. It's unbelievable, her
hunger and her sense of personal accountability, her willingness to take
things and learn from them.  
I always tell our guys the world is divided into two kinds of people,
learner's and nonlearner's, you either do or you don't and the learners get to
keep succeeding. Danielle Robinson is a learner, she'll make a list in her
notebook after practices, this is what I did well, this is what I need to do
better.  
And as a result of that, she is just a sophomore and one of the best point
guards in the country. And I'm excited to watch her because I don't think she
is near her ceiling yet.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the factors you think are prevalent in getting ready
for Purdue in such a short period of time? What's most important?  
COACH COALE: Well, I think maturity level is the first thing that I come to,
and that you have to be able to immediately switch gears and fine-tune your
focus and look at exactly at your opponent and what you need to do to win.  
At this stage in the game everybody is good. Everybody does a lot of things
that are difficult to defend and everybody give us problems on the other end
of the floor. What you have to do is decide what is that one or two -- maybe
those one or two areas where we can be successful, exploit something, take
advantage somewhere.  
And your players have to be mature enough to be able to grasp that and keep
that singular focus. It's not unlike some of the situations we've created for
our team throughout the year. We jumped on an opportunity to play a big Monday
game following a Saturday game for this very reason. So we could figure out
how to turn the page and go to the next opponent. Big 12 tournament puts in
you a position to have experience with this type of thing. It's not
necessarily out of the norm for our guys.  
  
Q. Sherri, Danielle has put together three really nice games in the NCAA
tournament, but probably what stands out for me is her assists and turnover
ratio, it's 2 to 1.  
COACH COALE: That is something that would make her grin from ear to ear, it's
a big deal for her and for me and obviously for us.  
What Danielle has done so well is she has played at the right speed, and it's
such an easy thing to say and everybody goes, "that makes sense ." It's a hard
thing to do unless you've been out there doing it, facing different types of
defenses. You don't understand what a big deal it is.  
Danielle plays at the speed she prefers to play at, not the speed that the
defense wants her to play at and that's all the difference in the world.  
  
Q. Sherri, maybe it's inevitable that I ask you this, but the only other
time you've been here is your run in 2002. Would you compare and contrast the
teams? How they approach the game and how they got to this point?  
COACH COALE: We got all the way to 2:04 before I got that one? I think that's
impressive. I think there are similarities because it's a hard thing to do.  
You don't get to this level unless you have leadership, unless you have
toughness, unless you have unity, unless you have chemistry. Those things, I
think, are consistent and you could probably look at the teams that remain in
this tournament and say they share some of those same qualities. Because I
don't think you can just get here by being good, that's not enough, you have
to have some special things.  
Other than that, there are lots of differences. There are differences in that
that 2002 team, we were scratching and clawing on the walls and saying -- it
makes me think of the gymnast who looked into the camera, you know, and said
"here I come, look out world."  
We were trying to get noticed, we were trying to get on the map, we were
trying to be for real. If you do this thing right, once you are for real and
you do get noticed, you're never in that position again.  
I was speaking earlier and talking about how much fun I had during my son's
high school basketball season this year, and they went into the playoffs and
they weren't supposed to win a game and they were "David" and everybody they
faced was the "Goliath ."  
And everybody they faced they were the underdog, and I had so much fun as a
mom. And I had forgotten how much it feels different, because we're always
supposed to win now, and this is where we're supposed to be. And I think it's
important that we remind our kids and our staff that it's a hard thing to do
and a special thing to do and we need to enjoy it.  
In that vein, I think the similarities are strong. These guys are really
enjoying their time together, here not finished playing basketball together.
That was the thing in 2002 when we sat in the locker room, we cried like
babies after the loss to Connecticut, but it wasn't because we lost, it was
because the journey was over.  
  
Q. Sherri, I wanted to ask you about Ashley. What was the genesis of her
deciding to get in better shape? Did she come and talk to you, did you talk to
her? How much of an impact do you think that had on the team in general to see
a player that had fairly good success kind of rededicate herself coming into
her last season?  
COACH COALE: It was a personal decision on her behalf. Doesn't matter how much
any of the rest of us had talked before or then or challenged or whatever you
want to say, it was a personal decision. And what followed that is the action.  
I tell our guys, sometimes if three frogs are sitin' on a log and one decides
to jump off, how many are still sitin' on the log? Still three, just because
you decided to do it doesn't mean you've done anything yet. And she did it,
and I thought it was incredibly inspirational to her teammates.  
Every time preseason got hard, they looked around and said if she can do that,
I can run the hill. The resonating affects go on and on and on, and when she
continues to keep it off and improve throughout the season, it deepens that
belief and that trust those guys have in each other. It's commitment, and
commitment is contagious.  
  
Q. Sherri, did you go to the Oklahoma games in the '89, '90 games when they
were averaging 69 fans, and when they dropped the program, did you raise hell
from your position? And what made you want to take the job, because Stacy Dale
said you recruited her saying you were going to win because somehow you knew
you were going to win.  
COACH COALE: First of all, my position, sitting at an English desk at Norman
High School, I'm not sure I had a lot of people's ear. I did go to some games
and I remember I went into the teacher's lounge to get my attendance sheets,
and some guy in the lounge said, "hey, did you hear what happened? They just
dropped the OU women's basketball program."  
And I said, "no, they didn't." And he said, "yeah, they did." And I said,
"trust me, they can't, Title IX, they can't." And I went back to class and
didn't think another thing about it, because I knew they couldn't.  
And the news went crazy, that's all you saw on the 5:00 and 10:00 news for a
few days, and obviously the program got reinstated. When you're a ball coach,
doesn't matter the level, you're so immersed in what you're doing. I remember
vaguely the Final Four and what was going on, but you know what I was doing? I
was teaching sophomores how to shoot left-handed layups in the gym at Norman
High School.  
The most important thing you're doing is what you're doing at that time, and
it was important to me because I wanted my high school kids to have a chance
to compete for a scholarship without going halfway across the country. I
wanted them to have the chance to stay here in Oklahoma and play for an
incredible institution, and I knew I had good players but that would be
difficult for a while.  
And I knew it would be a difficult choice for kids for a while, and I hated
that because I had good players that I knew would love to stay at home and
play for our institution, and they didn't have that choice for a while, but
now they do.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH COALE: Maybe I didn't. Maybe I didn't and that was the great blessing. I
didn't think a thing about it, really. I had several people call and groups of
people come to see me. You've got to get this job, and I'm like, what are you
talking about? I'm a high school coach. I can't get a D-1 job! And really
encouragement from Geno.  
I had a unique opportunity in that I had had college grade level kids in my
gym, so I had D-1 coaches in and out of my gym and talked a lot of basketball
with them and realized that basketball is basketball, and there is a whole lot
more to this job than that, but the court stuff, ball is ball.  
So that was a bit of it, and my afinity for the University of Oklahoma, I
don't know that I would have been interested in the position had it not been
at this institution. I grew up in a home where everywhere in the house was
tuned to OU football on Saturday, and you didn't make noise, you go outside
and play if you wanted to.  
When they sang the fight song, you stopped in the house and sang the fight
song, the whole deal. You know? It was a reverence, sort of, and my brother
graduated from the University of Oklahoma and it was the best.  
It was nirvana and so why not try? This is how I live, why not try? Just
worked out. Longest answer in the history of man kind, sorry!  
  
Q. Sherri, maybe -- one of the biggest wins since you've come along was 2000
at Purdue. Now Purdue is here and you're a heavy favorite. Just your thoughts
on the shoe being on the other foot kind of thing. On the David and Goliath
idea, is one of your challenges to play like or feel like that team felt in
2002, to play like an underdog, to play like the team that had something to
prove?  
COACH COALE: You always give questions with lots of clauses, so it takes me a
minute to figure out how I should answer offensively to it.  
A, it is a little bit -- what's the word? Ironic, perhaps, that it is Purdue
here, however there is a vital difference. When we beat Purdue, they were the
defending national champions on their home floor as a one seed, and we were in
our first NCAA tournament, maybe there was one way back when, but the first in
my regime.  
In that regard very, very different. This Purdue team is not unaccustomed to
being in the NCAA tournament. They have had tons of success, won conference
championships, obviously their program has a recent National Championship, 10
years ago they were the national champions, so some similarities, but
differences as well.  
As far as being the underdog and playing as if you have something to prove,
there is a mentality with all great players and great teams that every time
they step on the floor, they should play in such a way as no one has ever seen
them play before and they can go, "wow, this is what I'm supposed to do."  
  
Q. Sherri, I don't know what extent you have had dealing with Sharon, but
what do you know about her?  
COACH COALE: I've actually had very few dealings with her. I really like her
way, though. I'm incredibly impressed by her. And by that I mean I like the
way she handles her team.  
I have crossed paths with her on the road recruiting a little bit. She has
always been very kind and professional. She strikes me as the type of
individual that goes about her business and doesn't mess with any of the other
stuff. She is about coaching her team and putting together a product that her
University can be proud of. I see her leading them and doing special things
with those kids, and I think that's great for our game.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your comments. Good luck tomorrow night.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined on the platform by Purdue Coach Versyp, we
have student athletes, Lindsay Wisdom-Hylton, Jodie Howell, FahKara Malone,
Lakisha Freeman and Danielle Campbell. Coach, please give an opening
statement.  
COACH VERSYP: Just very pleased with our group of young ladies, how we're
representing Purdue University. We have worked exceptionally hard to get to
this spot and we have a great opportunity in front of us.  
Right now in the Elite 8 you have a lot of teams trying to get to that Final
Four. We have a good, quiet confidence about us and we're excited for tomorrow
night.  
  
Q. Jodie and Lindsay, many of your players have come through debilitating
injuries to get where you are. Has that done something to forge your team
together at all, made you guys stronger in some way? You all seem to have
recovered from very serious injuries.  
JODIE HOWELL: I think when injuries come into play, your team comes closer
together and it's more than just teammates having somebody to talk to and it
spills over to the court.  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I agree, just having someone to help you through that
and be there for you.  
  
Q. For Lindsay and Danielle, you guys played in the Elite 8 two years ago,
what do you draw from that experience?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: We've all been there and we don't want to feel like
that again, we want to draw on that experience.  
DANIELLE CAMPBELL: We are looking ahead and we're excited to get out there and
compete.  
  
Q. FahKara, the atmosphere will probably be a good one tomorrow night. What
kinds of things do you draw on in a situation like this, when you have 12,
13,000 fans, most of whom are probably wearing red and cheering against you?  
FAHKARA MALONE: The biggest thing I think the Coach stressed to us and is
communicating, constantly looking at each other and looking at the coaching
staff on offense and defense and staying in our own little world.  
That's what's gotten us this far and the fact that we get to play in front of
12,000 fans screaming against us is going to make us that much closer.  
  
Q. FahKara, their point guard is lightning quick, what's it going to be like
going up against a point guard that can probably match you in speed?  
FAHKARA MALONE: It will be fun. I've seen a lot of game film, and going left
or right she is extremely fast, she pushes the tempo as much as I do. Staying
in front of her is the key, and making sure I can stay between her and the
basket.  
  
Q. Lakisha, the men's team faced a similar situation when they played
Washington in Portland, Oregon, where they, Washington had the big home crowd
there. Did you learn anything from that experience, watching that game?  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: Our men's team did a great job out there and as everyone
said, we're going to use this as motivation. We've been here before, so we're
going to use it as motivation tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Lakisha and Lindsay, when FahKara had her injury, you guys had a tough
stretch, but you won a number of games in a row. How much did that help this
team to get through those games right after losing your point guard?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: You pull together as a team and we had to do that. I
think we did a great job, and FahKara was our captain, controls the tempo, but
we had other players who stepped up and filled her shoes.  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: I agree with Lindsay totally. Other people had to step up and
had to get outside of their box, people who weren't handling the ball had to
handle the ball. People who weren't talking as much had to talk a lot more.
Everyone stepped out of their box and we all came together.  
  
Q. Lindsay and Lakisha, is it better to play with 13,000 people cheering
against you or better to play in a quieter gym?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: No, not at all. It's more exciting playing in front of
fans than it is a dull environment. It's an us against the world-type
mentality that we have to go into the game.  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: Lindsay touched on everything, so I agree with Lindsay.  
  
Q. Lindsay, talk about the match-ups between Purdue and OU.  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: Oklahoma is a great team, they have the inside with the
Paris sisters, and they have a great point guard and it's going to be a great
match up, just a question between who is going to play harder and want it
more.  
  
Q. You guys played a complete game last night, great balance, speed, height,
I'm trying to figure out how you lost 10 games this year. What's the
difference? What's the difference between the team that was struggling earlier
and the team that is playing so well now?  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I just think we've grown as a team throughout the whole
season. We've had some bumps in the road early on, and we've learned from
them. This is the time where every team needs to be playing the best
basketball and I think that's what we're doing right now, which is why we're
being so successful.  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I think the biggest thing is the fact that we have four
freshmen who are playing amazing. They're coming off the bench and doing
amazing things. We have Natasha who comes off the bench, our bench has grown,
which is the reason we've grown so much. We have five starters here who get us
off to a good start, but if they didn't come off the bench, we wouldn't be the
team we are today.  
  
Q. This is for all five. You went line dancing the other night. Talk about
the experience of line dancing and who, in your opinion was the best line
dancer? Coach, you can chime in too if you'd like.  
DANIELLE CAMPBELL: I definitely was the worst! (Chuckles.) It was just fun to
do something totally different and totally new. Coach was on point. I was the
worst. She knew what she was doing.  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Like Danielle said, it was fun to do something
different, and I don't think I'll ever do it again, but it was actually a
pretty good workout, too. I'm going to have to go with Kiki, she was trying to
work it over there.  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: It was an amazing experience, I wanted to learn so bad, and
Coach was instructing us what to do, I have to go with me and Coach on that.  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: It was fun to get out and do something that's from this
area that we wouldn't experience in West Lafayette, and Kiki was calming
everybody down like, "I want to hear what he's talking about ,"so you have to
give it to her.  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: It was great to do something different while we were
here, Coach was good but Chelsea has done it before and she was holding back
because she is from Arkansas and she has done it before, so I know she knows
how to line dance secretly.  
COACH VERSYP: I was pretty good, but Chelsea was better. We call her "B.C.",
big country, so we're good.  
  
Q. Maybe on a somewhat more serious note, FahKara, do you feel like Purdue
needs a win like this maybe to garner better respect to a national level? I
think a lot of people are choosing Oklahoma to win this game pretty handily.
What are your thoughts?  
FAHKARA MALONE: We were here two years ago and we were in the top 10 the whole
year and we got no respect. I don't think this win is going to make or break
our program in any way. I think we're going to continue to play great
basketball.  
We do want to win this game not only for ourselves but for our University, and
hopefully people will take notice once we get the victory after the game.  
  
Q. FahKara, could you talk about the kind of things that Coach demands as
far as a point guard at Purdue? What are the things that you've got to do?  
FAHKARA MALONE: I just made a face because I don't know what she doesn't
demand, really. (Chuckles.) With her coming from the same position, it helps
me a lot. A lot of times, being my junior year, we have so much chemistry on
and off the court, we call the same plays, we know the same defenses, so it's
worked out really well for us, but communication is the biggest thing for her.  
Coming down the stretch, she just wants me to be able to control the tempo and
know who to get the ball to in the right times. So, yeah, pretty much
everything.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, kind of following up on the question to FahKara, what's your job
description for your point guard? What did you want her to do in general?  
COACH VERSYP: The biggest thing is she has to be the leader on the court. She
has to have the toughest mind-set, 'cuz I'm the toughest on the point guard
because they are the leader, they have to be, in my brain, which is kinda
crazy.  
They're the ones who are getting yelled at for everything, if something goes
wrong, so they have to be the toughest individual. And I think FahKara nailed
it, me being a point guard, I never did anything right, you felt like that,
but it made you mentally tougher and in a game it was so much easier.  
So I ride her hard, but with her being a junior, we're exactly on the same
wave length, that's exactly what you want. Her growth between her freshman and
sophomore year was amazing, but she is our high-energy kid, she is amazing,
offensively and defensively.  
  
Q. Coach, much is made of Courtney Paris and for good reason, but the last
couple of games Courtney hasn't really been the person that's stood out for
them. They seem to have grown as a team the last couple of games. Have you
noticed that? Other players on her team, Whitney Hand and Danielle Robinson
stepping up?  
COACH VERSYP: I think that's the key to any team right now that your other
players step up. If you watch other games, they key in on different players
like the one, two and three punch on certain teams, but it's the other
players, like for us, Kiki shooting 9 for 12 for us, that's a Whitney Hand for
Oklahoma, Danielle Robinson being able to score and get to the basket.  
So I think at this point people are going to key on the players that have made
them exceptionally successful, and right now other players have to step up for
your program.  
  
Q. Coach, the players have talked about no respect and getting a big win.
Yet your program has been here not so long ago, in the tournament every year.
Talk about the balance of where you feel like getting to the Final Four puts
this program.  
COACH VERSYP: I think the Final Four or Elite 8, everybody that's a coach
wants to go to the Final Four and win the National Championship, but we're one
of the top 10 winningest programs in the country, we've been to 8 Elite 8s,
100 Sweet 16s, our program is one of the top programs, and that's because of
the administration that allows us to be so successful and the type of student
athletes that we have.  
You've got to have a coach that stays at a program for a while. The programs
that are spoken about are people that have been there 10 to 30 years, 15 to 30
years, I've only been here three years. And there have been a lot of coaching
changes, so I think the story at Purdue is we've won National Championships,
to the Final Four, the Elite 8, Sweet 16, and we have a record with NCAA
appearances and you've had six to seven coaches within a span.  
I think Purdue is doing something right, but that's the biggest thing. Our
kids know that they're great student athletes, and we're one of the top-10
programs. When we recruit, we speak about that, we know how to get it done on
and off the court, but I think the biggest thing is you got to be somewhere
for a while.  
  
Q. With your team's experience, how do you expect them to be able to handle
the environment they will be in tomorrow night?  
COACH VERSYP: We discussed this, and you want to play in front of fans.
There's no question about that. You don't want to play in a dull environment.
I think the best preparation for us is Michigan State. It's very loud.  
But the "Barn" in Minnesota is one of the toughest places to play, it's 8,000
people, but it sounds like it's 20,000 people. We've been in that environment,
it's tough. Other teams have come in here and been able to be successful, so
the biggest thing is playing our game plan, not getting rattled, us against
the world mentality is what we have talked about pretty much all year.  
That's what we have to do, and you've got to feed off the fans. The fans don't
play the game, players play the game and we've got to make sure we do the
things we need to.  
  
Q. Is there a match-up tomorrow night or an area that you're concerned about
that needs to go your way?  
COACH VERSYP: Yes, we've got to be able to control Danielle Robinson. She is
the key, just like FahKara is the key to us. I have so much respect for her
game and her growth of her game and that's why they're playing well. Whitney
Hand, 25, we can't let her shoot the 3. We just can't let her have many looks
because she is the one who gets the crowd going.  
You hit a three, everybody goes crazy, but the 3-ball does something
different. We have to limit Paris' down low, limit opportunities there and box
out.  
  
Q. Coach, having played at Purdue maybe before the glory days of the
program, what would it mean for you to lead the program to a Final Four, and
if I could follow up, do you talk to Coach Dunn much anymore?  
COACH VERSYP: You know, I'm just -- I have so much pride of being able to be
the coach here. I'm very blessed, obviously, to have this opportunity and to
be able to do a lot of different things and bridge the gap and continue to
win.  
Hopefully I will feel that I helped fill that foundation and to continue this
program for a long time would be huge. I talk to a lot of former coaches that,
I guess, were after me, Lynn has e-mailed me and talked to me quite a bit,
Carolyn Peck, we had the '99 championship team way back.  
And all of those coaches and assistants, Nell Fortner, so it is a special
place, we have people out there in Purdue country rootin' for us. It's great
to be on the sidelines and being part of something that's really special.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Purdue  67  
Rutgers - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Rutgers Coach Stringer, we have Brittany
Ray, Kia Vaughn and Epiphanny Prince. Coach, your thoughts?  
COACH STRINGER: I thought that Purdue came on sharp, hot, they understand that
they were looking to attack, I thought they rebounded extremely well.  
It took us quite a bit of time to adjust. And Freeman knocked down two or
three shots before we got it together, and that's disappointing because we
would expect Hylton, Howell, Rayburn to do that, but it was clearly Freeman.
And of course we know that in big-time games, big-time people step up on the
big stage, simple as that.  
Unfortunately, we had to have -- the rebounding had to be key for us, and it
just didn't happen, it just didn't happen. We needed to have -- and
unfortunately we don't have big people other than Kia, so we needed to have
rebounding coming from the guards, we were not effective in our 55.  
Why, because the little guard was quick, and the 4 was able to handle the ball
well enough so it didn't allow us to get into that trap situation, we were
wasting time.  
When we can't score off the defense, we've got to score other ways. One of
those ways is getting to the line, to see if we can get it done that way. I
don't think we could have done anything differently in terms of man-to-man
defense, but credit to Purdue, they did a great job and credit to our team,
given where we started and how we proceeded throughout the vast majority of
the season.  
You know, we're pleased that we were able to get here, but unhappy because we
know that we could have done some different things.  
  
Q. Kia, as you guys closed the gap, did you start believing "yeah, we're
going to actually do this?"  
KIA VAUGHN: Throughout the game there was no doubt in my mind that it wasn't
incapable of us to get the game done. Little by little, at the end when they
went to the free-throw line, it dawned on me that it wasn't in my hands
anymore. We just tried to stick it out.  
  
Q. Kia, looking at where you're sitting right now, can you take any
consolation in that?  
KIA VAUGHN: I'm proud of my teammates and how far we've come. We've fought so
long to get to where we are now. We started off really, really sluggish in the
beginning of the season and not knowing roles or what we were capable of
doing.  
We had the skills and the talent to do anything we wanted, but it seemed like
it was locked in a chest and no one knew where the key was.  
Coach kept telling us we were hot and cold and we had to keep working hard to
find it, and we finally did at the end of the season, it's just that today it
didn't work in our favor.  
  
Q. Kia, Epiphanny, that last pass when you pulled down that rebound and you
threw the outlet to Epiphanny, what were you thinking there, or was there a
miscommunication of some kind?  
KIA VAUGHN: I just overthrew the pass. I seen her going in for the fast break.
And I just overthrew the pass, that's all it was.  
EPIPHANNY PRINCE: I didn't know how hard she was going to throw it, so...  
  
Q. Coach, when you look at where this team came from and how it got here,
how do you feel about it going forward for next season, the freshmen that
didn't play as much as you probably expected, but over all?  
COACH STRINGER: Tell you the truth, I don't know, because we are losing a huge
-- we're losing the battery that is Kia and Heather, they are connected.
Heather and Kia read each other extremely well.  
Obviously I haven't been too impressed with our freshmen in terms of them
handling this kind of a situation. I heard someone make a statement that
Tennessee had all of these freshmen, and we had all these freshmen, and we
were able to get something done.  
But I think you would be fooled into thinking that because our freshmen did
not play a significant role in any of the game, any significant amount of
time.  
We've seen bits and pieces, but as an example, the Tennessee freshmen played
far more games and logged more minutes. However, the biggest issue with our
freshmen is for them to buy into and understand that there is a way to win the
game.  
This game started off today with, you know, you think that we know how to play
the team game. But for whatever reason, we began to take a shot with one or
two passes, we began to take a quick out, and what we know is that anytime
we've shot over 14 three's, we've lost the game.  
We start shooting quickly with one or two passes, that ball was rebounding
long and they were going back to the other end of the floor. I thought that
Dee gathered herself a little later, she is a freshman and she needed to calm
down and know how to attack, because while they were much bigger, they
couldn't be bigger and quicker, so when she began to attack, we got to the
free-throw line.  
That's what we needed from Epiphanny Prince, she goes to the free-throw one
time, there is something wrong with that picture, which means she is shooting
over 6-1, 6-2, 6-3s, which is unusual, because we knew we needed to balance
this out without going to the free-throw line.  
It wasn't for us as a group -- we seemed slow, maybe somewhat intimidated,
shocked -- I won't say intimidated, I think we were shocked with the size when
we really -- a lot of times sizes aren't inflated because they were the size
that they were and they were skilled.  
So I thought they were a little cautious and we started doing things that told
me that we weren't playing together as a team. When we did begin to play
together as a team, as someone asked, did we believe, and I do believe that we
did believe.  
Because we reverted to survival, self-survival, which is -- has been our
nemesis and that's what killed us at the beginning of the year. So our time
outs had to do more with, wait a minute, this is the exact same thing that
we've done in more than half the games, so why are we going crazy now?  
We don't have the direction, we're rushing things, can we slow it down and
become the team that believes and demonstrates trust and faith? But in a game
of this magnitude, it only takes about a good five minutes and that's
basically what it was, we lost a good five minutes.  
And then while we attempted to go back, playing team basketball and doing what
we needed to do to come back, my conversation with April Sykes, for example,
was do you understand what I meant by taking the drive instead of the outside
shot?  
In games like this you're always going to get a 3-point shot, we don't need a
savior, we didn't need to go one or two passes and shoot. And so they settled
down and they were like, "okay, we're going to do the right thing" and then it
was better.  
There was major miscommunication when there was a girl standing there at the
basket, we knew that we were taking switches. For whatever reason, Piphanny
and Dee, Dee did the right thing, she was taking the switch, Piphanny knew she
had four fouls and did not want to take the switch, she would rather play the
perimeter player and not be put in the post position, I understand that, but
they didn't trust.  
Because at that moment Dee said "switch" and Piphanny said "no, I've got to
stay," and in between that the girl was left free under the basket. When you
think about a game that could have been easily decided with one or two points,
that's what it is.  
She's got to come in sharp off the bench, Dee, but you have to be 30 seconds
sharp. We had watched that player at the high-post position do that step
through and backdoor hit a thousand times. Why would we get anxious?  
The only reason I took Kia out is because I didn't want her to kick up a foul
with 23 seconds left. We couldn't give up the points and it's all the little
things that make a big difference.  
Each player knows their strengths and whatever the patterns are, if you drive
better to the right rather than to the left, everything we were calling were
isolations. We needed to come even, or once we did go ahead and once we did,
we thought we would have control of Purdue.  
I thought we did everything down for those few seconds, yes, the turnover was
crucial, those things will happen, but we just got a little anxious and Purdue
was a better team today.  
  
Q. Coach, your team seemed to do better when they were able to run the ball,
drive and penetrate. Very often they seemed tentative, willing to stay out,
settle for a half-court game, pass the ball around and take those outside
shots. Was that part of the game plan or --  
COACH STRINGER: No, no, no, no, that's right. That's why you don't see any
tears in my eyes, I'm upset, more than hurt, I'm disappointed because we knew
what we had to do and we went out there and got foolish.  
Trust me when I tell you that, why would we stand out there and try to execute
when we're dealing with people that are giants, basically. Our advantage was
to get the ball off, pass the ball, like we did before, make the pass, all of
the sudden we got real -- all of the sudden we were going to stand out there
and try to execute and see what's going on and if there was -- several times
we took 4-point shots! You know?  
But I'm not too surprised, I'm upset, because didn't we know? Didn't we lose
like that doing the same thing? So there is a lot of things about us that, as
I share with the team, it is at the end as it was at the beginning, the first
day, the exact same things. It's behaviors, and I'm thinking, why are we here.
So, no, ma'am, absolutely not.  
You should have asked the question to them, what were you supposed to do? And
they would tell you, it was supposed to be drives. When we started doing that,
we would stop the clock -- they couldn't stop us on the drives but we couldn't
figure that out until late, and we wouldn't handle it on the 55, which is
surprising.  
And I think if we had a little more energy, a little sharper, we probably
would have been able to handle a 55 but it forsaked us today. But we didn't
then become smart with the other things that we needed to do. It's very
obvious if you look at the stats, Prince, for example, is an 87% free-throw
shooter, and there is nobody that can stop her. If she comes near a screen,
they're not shopping her, they're going to foul her, so how do we think? We
just didn't play very smart.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Purdue  67  
Rutgers - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Purdue coach, Coach Versyp.  
COACH VERSYP: It was a game of runs, and Rutgers had been playing such great
basketball and had balanced scoring and they were never going to be out of the
game no matter if we were ahead by 20 or 30. We tried to keep that sense of
urgency and our players stepped up.  
The rebounding for us was a big key and Rutgers gave us everything at the end,
going one-on-one to the hole and they were able to knock down some key shots
and we were able to knock some key shots down.  
FahKara and Danielle both knocked down shots, and our players stayed composed,
and I think there was a big reason we were able to be successful tonight.  
  
Q. Lindsay, you've had games this year where you've had second half leads
and let them slip away and ended up in a loss. What do you think was different
today?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I think learning from those experiences and those
losses helped us get to where we are today, and I think we gutted it out.  
And when we were only up with 2 with a minute or two left, I think if this was
three, four, five months ago, maybe we would have let it slip, but tonight we
were able to battle through and come out on top.  
  
Q. Do you feel like throughout the game you guys were able to sustain your
offense for longer periods than Rutgers?  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: Yes, I do feel like that. We had that inside/outside game
which was tough for them to guard.  
  
Q. Lindsay, can you talk about that shot that FahKara hit? It's probably not
often that you have seen her hit the fade-away shot.  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: It's tournament time, anything can happen. We had a
couple of buzzer beater shot clock shots, and when you're feeling it, you are
hot and she had some key buckets down the stretch. And we're playing well as a
team right now and anything can happen.  
  
Q. Lindsay, how important was it to get Jodie going today offensively?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: Jodie is awesome. She's playing so hard for us right
now and she is getting those outside shots for us, and she is attacking the
basket.  
And she did a great job with that today and her offensive and defensive play
has stepped up for us today.  
  
Q. Lindsay, I read where Coach said that you guys were not stressed, not
pressured, everybody has maybe overlooked you. How does this feel now to get
to the regional final and how much is it where you guys are relaxed and
playing and not under any pressure?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I think that's when we play our best basketball, when
we are relaxed and not tense and not worrying about things. We had nothing to
lose here, so we had to go out and play our hearts out. And whoever plays the
best wins the game, and we're playing our best basketball right now.  
  
Q. Lakisha, any nervousness at all when they kept closing the gap?  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: No, there was not. As Lindsay said, we learned from our
experiences. A while ago the team probably would have got the win, but we're
learning and today we were staying tough and we were able to knock down some
key shots.  
  
Q. Jodie, being in the Elite 8, a lot of you players have been here in this
situation before. Talk about being back in this spot.  
JODIE HOWELL: We're excited right now, we're probably going to enjoy this
tonight and get back to business tomorrow. But it's a great feeling to be
here.  
  
Q. Lakisha, three straight games now you guys have been shooting the ball
well. Everyone says you want to peak at tournament time, are you guys doing
that?  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: Yes, we have those who are starting the game and everyone is
scoring well, as well as everyone that's coming off the bench, and everyone is
scoring and playing great for this team right now and it's great.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll see you back here tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot will be made about your shooting percentage tonight. Talk
defensively what you guys were able to do to take them out of rhythm there for
the first 30 minutes or so of the game.  
COACH VERSYP: We started out in our one defense and we didn't look very good
there briefly, so being able to make some adjustments, you know, because of
how they set up, really working the deep corners.  
But I think the changes when we went man-to-man and they didn't score for 5 or
6 minutes and then we got into foul trouble, but our kids sustained it and
were able to knock down shots. But our defense has been our bread and butter
the whole time.  
I think that's been the key because we hope you shoot 50% or 60%, but that's
not going to happen all the time. That will always be a key to our success.  
  
Q. Do they seem to have a different look about them?  
COACH VERSYP: We just have a lot of confidence right now. Every time-out, we
say we're not going to let this slip away, every player on the bench. And it's
a mind-set right now, everybody is physically gifted, everybody is playing
great basketball when they get to that point. And right now it's mental
toughness.  
We talked about that mental toughness early on and now we have it. That's when
you want it to come out is in February and early March.  
  
Q. Your bench didn't give you necessarily a bunch of points, but I thought
they gave you critical minutes, Guyton especially in the first half. Can you
talk about that.  
COACH VERSYP: We need to be physical down low, Kia Vaughn is very, very strong
and we have respect for her. When Danielle got into foul trouble, Natasha gave
us great minutes.  
And Alex was able to bang because she is so physical and being able to knock
down that shot and calling the play for her, it builds her confidence. And I
think we brought our freshmen along well, but now they're understanding things
more and it's not always about offense.  
  
Q. Coach, the shot at the shot clock there at the end, what was that?  
COACH VERSYP: That was a player making a play, they took us out of what we
wanted to run, they did a great job. But at this point, sometimes the stars
align right, there has to be some luck in this, and as soon as it released
from FahKara's hand, I knew it was in.  
She stepped up big for us, she controlled the tempo, played amazing defense.
Our biggest concern was her boxing somebody out, but that was huge. She was
the one in the huddle saying "this is our game, this is our game," and she's
that leader for us.  
  
Q. You talk about your defense playing, again, you've been shooting 50% the
last couple of games and beaten two pretty good teams. Does the defense set up
that offense or offense is a nice by-product?  
COACH VERSYP: For us, our defense always sets up our offense, but when you
knock down a big shot, you don't have tired legs on defense. And I think when
Jodie Howell knocks down 3 for her teammates, everybody gets the energy.  
It takes the pressure off, but everybody is talking about our shooting, but we
almost lost the game on free-throws, so obviously that will be a point of
emphasis, which it always has been. But these kids are enjoying it, they're
enjoying the moments. We have talked about you can't get these moments back.  
  
Q. When Rutgers started making that run at the end and pulled within 2, was
there any nervousness? Did you feel like they were playing the basketball
you'd seen?  
COACH VERSYP: Rutgers or us? Both? Rutgers totally isolated and went one-on-
one. They have phenomenal players and we were able to take it down low and
play off the dribble, and we ended up going into a defense that slowed them
down with the key rebound we got, but we've handled that before, we've learned
from it.  
We've had a heart breaker when we played against Ohio State, and we're not
going to try to allow that to happen again, so our memories went back to us.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, Coach, congratulations, we'll see you tomorrow.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Oklahoma  70  
Pittsburgh - 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the victorious Sooners, Coach Coale,
Ashley Paris, Danielle Robinson, and Whitney Hand. Coach?  
COACH COALE: First of all, I think every student athlete who competes in the
NCAA tournament should have an opportunity to compete in that environment that
we were in tonight, I just think it's special.  
I appreciate the people of Oklahoma for their loyal support and for the
support they give us, and the kids that come to Oklahoma get to experience
something special like that. I think it's unique and I'm very proud of our
state.  
Very proud of this basketball team, I thought our guard play was great
particularly early on, Shavonte Zellous is great on the perimeter, and I
thought we did a tremendous job of contesting her shots and being disciplined
enough not to send her to the free-throw line.  
We battled, did as good of a job on the boards as we have done all season
long, block outs, they are a very disciplined team. And up to the last 10, 12
minutes we took care of the basketball. We got a little lackadaisical at the
end, maybe a little antsy, but I thought we played cleanly, and I'll toss it
back to you.  
  
Q. Whitney, this is two games that you've had a brilliant night at Ford
Center, are you going to have the games moved here next year?  
WHITNEY HAND: I don't think that's my choice. I think it's the environment and
I was lucky enough to hit a couple of shots at the beginning and the way they
were guarding us, it left us wings open and I'm glad the shots went down.  
  
Q. Whitney, in regaining your stroke, do you have a better grip or regaining
confidence?  
WHITNEY HAND: I try not to analyze it too much. I think it has a lot to do
with mental, on how to shoot the ball. It's a matter of getting your feet set
and your elbows straight, a lot of things. I think I'm looking for it a little
more now, a little more confident.  
  
Q. Whitney, there was a moment early in the second half, I think it was a
9-point game, Courtney just got her third, the shot clock was winding down,
you got the ball out to Nyeshia and she made a three. Talk me through that
play a little bit.  
WHITNEY HAND: I'm sorry, I don't remember the play. It was huge. Getting past
the 10-point lead is a big step and I think Ny is always clutch like that.  
I don't remember honestly, but I'm sure it was a huge shot and I think Ny --
(Chuckles.) I don't know what else to say, I don't remember, I'm really sorry.  
  
Q. Whitney, with so many big plays, it's understandable on that. Talk a
little bit about in the biggest game you come up with your biggest games.  
WHITNEY HAND: Once again, it doesn't have a lot to do with the biggest games,
I don't think, I think it has to do with how they guard us, when they're
coming out and double-teaming Courtney.  
No matter where you are on the court, if I'm on her side, it makes it easy to
get a shot off. It's my job to hit shots, and I'm really glad they went in.  
  
Q. Whitney, maybe you'll remember this play, you hit a 3 and you come back
on the next possession and you're falling down and you threw it up in with one
hand, that was a big basket, y'all took control after that. Talk about what
you were thinking there.  
WHITNEY HAND: Really sorry. I do actually remember that one, because I
remember Ashley told me she was proud of me. I mean, I think our game plan was
to attack them, especially against their pressure.  
And at that time they were giving us heavy pressure, so I'm glad the shot went
in because it would have been a retarded shot if it hadn't.  
  
Q. Ashley, does your night start with rebounding like you did or scoring
points like did you? Talk about your night, please.  
ASHLEY PARIS: I think it started with a few offensive rebounds, and I wasn't
able to score a couple times, but I got in a groove and just for a freshman to
be playing like that, feeding off of Whitney's energy, she fueled me the whole
game and I started when Whitney started.  
  
Q. Ashley, in the Georgia Tech game you got off to an 0-6 start, tonight you
got off to a better start. Talk about that.  
ASHLEY PARIS: I know how to make layups, and I blew it in the Georgia Tech
game, and I think they say the guys believed in me, and they said you can
finish and it gave me confidence in this game. And I missed shots early, but
worked on leaving the misses and the passes and moving on to the next
possession.  
  
Q. "D," talk about your game tonight. You had a tough defensive match-up and
you had a good night offensively as well.   
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Zellous is a great player, six rebounds? And she is a great
player, and even though we contested pretty well, she got 7, 8 shots. And
being a point guard, you have to bring your game.  
And even though I got some fouls, I had to lead from the bench and talk to
people, make sure everyone is in the right spot. Even though I didn't play so
many minutes, you still have to lead as a point guard.  
  
Q. Whitney, the way you talk about the game, is it a blur to you at this
point? Are you able to take in what you did tonight?  
WHITNEY HAND: I don't -- I mean, I don't think it's about what I did. I think
we all had a goal coming into this game. It was a goal of making it to the
Elite 8, no one on the court had made it there yet, including myself.  
It was just a matter of taking advantage of how they were guarding us. I think
I had a good game tonight, but shout out to everyone else out there. Danielle
had a ridiculous match-up, that girl scored on me every time I tried to guard
her.  
And Courtney was getting double-teamed every time she touched the ball and she
was getting hacked, so it's not about how great I played, I'm just thankful
we're still alive and we get to play more games with Ashley, Courtney and
Carolyn, so that's great.  
  
Q. Sherri, help us out. Could you talk about Whitney's improvement in the
last couple of games, she's gone from 0 for the Big 12 tournament to finding
her stroke. Can you explain that?  
COACH COALE: Well --  
  
Q. Is it mechanical?  
COACH COALE: Less we forget she has a couple of screws in her finger, and
that's probably the 0-12 that you refer to.  
I disagree with Whitney a little bit in what she says, it doesn't matter the
magnitude of the game. I think she's an extraordinary collegiate basketball
player already, and you can spot the great ones because she shows up when the
lights are brightest.  
I thought she was fantastic, yes, she had great shots, she rebounded, played
great defense, made extra passes driving into the lane, made the leaping layup
that you guys were discussing. She just made plays, and guards have to do that
in order to survive and advance at this stage.  
So don't let her humility -- I love the kid and I love the humility and
appreciate it so much, but I can tell ya, she's big time.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH COALE: Obviously at the beginning, receiving the ball cleanly was the
toughest thing when she came back with that hand, had a splint on the outside
of her finger, but the actual reception, the tactile reception felt different
and unless she got a perfect pass, it was difficult for her.  
As her fingers continued to heal and she has gotten accustomed to adjusting
with that splint on, she's gotten better and better. A little bit is physical,
but a little bit is mental, you miss four games and every human -- Amanda
Thompson comes in tonight and you want to make up for all those games you
missed and you can't do it that way. Even though you know you shouldn't try
to, it's human nature.  
  
Q. Sherri, could you talk about how it feels to be on the doorstep of the
Final Four, and it seems like your team is firing on all cylinders at the
right time.  
COACH COALE: It feels great, the Sweet 16 had been a brick wall for us, and
Randy Pausch told us in "The Last Lecture" that it's -- a brick wall is there
for a reason. They're there to give us an opportunity to show us how badly we
want something. It gave us an opportunity to help drive us through something.  
  
Q. The three that Nyeshia hit with the shot clock going down, one play out
of many, but how big of a deal was that considering the situation of the game
at that point?  
COACH COALE: Considering the situation that we were in from a personal
standpoint, it was tremendous. But I think the biggest part of that play is
what it does to the opponent.  
You know, it's like -- we always tell our guys, offensive rebounds give life,
and when you don't block it out, it takes life away. Our guys were competing,
we're trying to stretch that lead, and Pitt is doing everything they can to
try to chip away at it and we hit that.  
And their the defense -- we've been on the receiving end of that before for,
the defense, it's sort of deflating. So as much as it fueled us and gave us
energy and life, it probably took that much away from them and it was
definitely a turning point in the game.  
  
Q. Sherri, as soon as I asked Ashley, where did tonight's rhythm start for
tonight's team, it seemed you had four people open on the defensive rebounding
side and that just started things from a rookie standpoint, but where did your
rhythm start tonight?  
COACH COALE: I think our offensive rhythm emanates from 3-point shooters,
honestly. When we make early three's, we feel good, invincible. It's like
lancing a wound and releasing the pressure.  
For everyone, okay, we're going to be okay. Whitney is making shots, we're
going to be okay. I know it's a ridiculous amount of pressure and I don't like
the word "pressure ,"but expectations, maybe, for a freshman, but she is
extraordinary and she can handle it. I always feel like when we hit early
three's we have great rhythm on offense and we feel like anything is possible.  
  
Q. Sherri, you guys did a great job of sharing the ball, five players in
double figures, talk about that.  
COACH COALE: At halftime we had 11 assists and that was one of our goals
because we knew if we shared the ball and moved the ball, we could have
success against the defense.  
We wanted to play inside/out and knew they would be focused on Courtney and be
able to get cutters going to the rim. In the second half we fell off in the
end, but we built on that early on.  
  
Q. It probably doesn't surprise you by now, but you're without Amanda, your
starting forward, Courtney doesn't have your typical production, but you're up
by 27 in the second half, could you talk about your team at this point
advancing to the Elite 8?  
COACH COALE: I'm proud of them obviously, and I think our depth and our bench
is something that has been talked about intermittently but never on a
consistent level.  
As teams across the country have been competing in the NCAA tournament without
key guys seems to be stuff talked about and written, and there hasn't been
much talked about us.  
Amanda Thompson is an outstanding collegiate basketball player. She is a
defensive stopper, we get our toughness from her. And all of the sudden we
don't have her, after not having Whitney and getting her back, all of the
sudden we don't have A.T.  
So I think it's been remarkable what these kids have done in terms of their
mentality and their intestinal fortitude, for lack of a better term, just
saying, "it doesn't matter, we're going to find a way to keep playing anyway."  
And one other thing, I think Amanda deserves credit for that, too, because the
way a kid responds to being injured and unable to play has a resounding affect
on her teammates. And for Amanda to not whine and be in a cave and not feeling
sorry for herself is remarkable, and she is a remarkable young lady.  
  
Q. Sherri, can you preview Purdue for us?  
COACH COALE: They're good. I wanted to be focused on what we wanted to do. I
saw 8 or 10 possessions, at the most, but I watched them earlier in the year,
watched them while their point guard was out and thought they were very good
in her absence.  
They can all score, they have great size, Sharon Versyp has done a great job
with them. I think offensively their rhythm is their key, and intangibly what
makes them special. And the reason they're alive in the Elite 8 is because
they're really a team, they're really together and you can feel that and we'll
have our hands full.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Oklahoma  70  
Pitt - 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Berenato, Shavonte Zellous and Xenia
Stewart. Coach?  
COACH BERENATO: Congratulations to the University of Oklahoma. They have a
great team and obviously it was a great environment to play in. Little kids
dream of that, playing in an environment like that, but usually their dreams
are when it's their home court and it's their environment.  
But it was an opportunity for our ladies to come out and perform and to see
what we were made of. I think Oklahoma was the better team tonight. I just
want to congratulate Sherri Coale and her team and congratulate the fans of
Oklahoma, because you guys really did a great job.  
So I want to thank the NCAA and everybody here on the host committee and
everybody that worked with this tournament. Personally, I know what it takes
to run a tournament of this magnitude, and it's just a lot of work for years
in advance. I can't wait until we host next year, can't wait until the
Peterson Event Center is covered with blue and gold and we're home.  
I just want to say thank you to Shavonte Zellous and Xenia Stewart, two of the
most wonderful athletes that a coach could have the joy of coaching. They have
been wonderful representatives of the University of Pittsburgh, both on and
off the court, and they always have a home at the University, and I wish them
both luck.  
I think Shavonte will be a No. 1 draft pick and I told Xenia don't be
surprised if her name doesn't get called. They're class individuals, both on
and off the court, and even forget basketball and I know that's why we're
here, but really for me we're here because we're educators, and we're here
because of the game of life.  
I think that this team, they've been led by these two young ladies and we've
gone further than anyone thought possible. In the first game we played Texas
A&M, and in the first few minutes we lost our point guard, and honest to God I
don't know if we thought we would win 15 games, but we never changed our goal.  
And for us to get to the Sweet 16 and for Xenia to take over as a point guard
and go point guard by committee, this team has done a great job. Shavonte,
when things were rough, she put the team on her back. They've been like
sisters, we're going to miss them dearly, and it's a tribute to the University
of Pittsburgh and our community.  
  
Q. Both of you, can you talk about leaving this program better than when you
found it?  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: It feels great. We're so honored that we helped rebuild the
program, and we wish the University the best, even though we won't be there
next year and wish them the best of things to come.  
XENIA STEWART: We're proud of the progress that we have done at the
University. We've worked hard to get to where we were at and we're happy to be
there. We set a standard and we're happy to be role models, not only to our
teammates but also future ladies that we work with through our volunteerism,
and we were proud to play for Agnus and her staff and the University of
Pittsburgh.  
  
Q. Shavonte, early in the second half you hit a three, got it within 9 and
the -- on the next possession Oklahoma was scrambling around, they beat the
shot clock with the 3. That was deflating? How big of a play do you think it
was in the game?  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: It was a big play, we had the shot clock going down and
Nyeshia hit a big shot for her team and got the crowd into it, and I think we
had a defensive let down and didn't communicate and didn't have our hands up
against her shot, so it was a big play for them and congrats to her and her
team.  
  
Q. Could you guys talk about the first half, they got a lot of perimeter
shots, was it just not getting out there or was it the goal coming in to not
have them make those shots and they just happened to? Talk about your
defense.  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: I think it was a communication let-down, we knew they were
going to get their shots to the perimeter, it's not like we were going to shut
them down completely, but we wanted to be there and contest them and disrupt
them, but they got the shots and knocked 'em down, did what they had to do.  
  
Q. As a member of a student body of the University of Pittsburgh, as a
member of our WPTS and calling many games, I want to thank you for a
tremendous season. Coach, Shavonte, how do you guys use this, where do you see
this taking you in the future?  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: I would like to see me to the WNBA and Xenia. If I don't see
that, I graduate from the University of Pittsburgh and I have a degree in
Criminal Justice, so if I don't pursue my dreams in basketball, I go on my
degree, but I plan on playing in the WNBA.  
XENIA STEWART: I think for me the WNBA possibly, but for me to have the
opportunity to play and have the media interview me and I have a degree in
Communications, so you might see me on ESPN talking to somebody. I have a
degree in Communications. I'm going to get in front of the camera one way or
the other.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the fatigue factor and being able to maintain a
defense against a strong interior program like Oklahoma's?  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: Can you repeat that?  
  
Q. The fatigue factor involved in trying to contain the Paris sisters and
the strong inside game and at the same time trying to maintain your own
outside perimeter game.  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: It's not fatigue, the Big East has -- almost all of the
schools in the Big East have an inside/outside game.  
We had a game plan, I feel like our defense was not focused, our communication
broke down and there were holes where there shouldn't have been, and I don't
think it was fatigue. We've been prepared through the regular season with the
teams we played, Connecticut, Notre Dame, Louisville, even Maryland, they had
the inside/outside game, so I don't think it was a fatigue factor.  
  
Q. Coach, you said yesterday that you enjoyed watching Whitney Hand play on
film, the way she carried herself, do you still feel that same way after her
performance? Talk about how big she was in the first half for them.  
COACH BERENATO: I'm not a sore loser, there is a reason why she was the rookie
of the year in our conference, I'm not a sore loser. I think she banged those
shots in early on and that set the tone of the game.  
We tried, we were doubling down and getting guard help on Courtney Paris and
we thought that was really going to be a bigger factor. And give her credit,
she knocked the shots down and that's what you have to do is knock shots down.  
It's funny because she is a freshman and sometimes freshmen have no fear. They
don't realize what's at stake and as kids get older, they start to realize the
magnitude of a game like this when they're juniors and seniors. My gosh, I've
got to make this shot, but freshmen just go out and play. I like her game, her
size, her athleticism. Yeah, if she wants to transfer you could send her my
way. (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. Coach, what are your goals after how far you guys have gotten in the
tournament? What are your goals for next year?  
COACH BERENATO: I just want to go to sleep tonight to be honest with you.
First of all, I want to say thank you guys for coming from Pitt Radio. It's
awesome.  
The one lady here had a question about fatigue factor, I thought you were
going to say the fatigue factor of going to Seattle and turning around a day
later after getting home and coming back here.  
I appreciate the students and my hometown supporters and Karen and Paul, so
thank you guys. You know, I can't look to next year, I think right now I
really believe in -- I don't know if any of you have a philosophy, but there
is a philosopher Epicurean, and his philosophy is eat, drink and be merry
because tomorrow you may die, and it means to live in the moment and take
every day for what it's worth.  
And I'm not about looking to next year, because I might not be here, tomorrow
I might have a heart attack and die. I'm going to enjoy this team and our team
will never be the same because Shavonte and Xenia will go on their own and
their own paths and they will have their own lives and the fabric of the team
will be different, but then we will have freshmen come in and be new and our
team will go on. And you have to then identify your goals for the new course.  
But right now I would say I want our student athletes to graduate from the
greatest university in the country, University of Pittsburgh, and be good
citizens and great people to their families and good citizens.  
  
Q. Agnus, did you see breakdowns in communications like Xenia thought, or
did they just hit shots that you thought they were going to have to give up?  
COACH BERENATO: In the beginning when they came out, our rotation wasn't
great, we tried to go "man," and then we were in a 2-3 and then in the very
beginning the transition got us, which was surprising but I didn't think they
could keep it at that pace and then they didn't, they slowed it down and we
went with the zone.  
And I thought they did a great job of rotating the basketball, they moved the
basketball well. When we had a breakdown, we would help the helper and then
someone else would have to help the helper and they made that extra path.
Kudos to them, that's what great teams do, make that extra pass and they just
passed, passed, passed.  
And those two 3s they made with the time running out were back breakers, and
you almost say, it was a destiny for them to get those. We played great "D"
for 29.5 seconds, but you have to play for a 30-second possession and they
nailed those two shots. I think that's the way the game went, to be honest
with you, give them credit.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congrats on a wonderful season.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Stringer has joined us, we would like an opening
statement.  
COACH STRINGER: I would say congrats on a season that allowed us to be here.
The most unlikeliest of teams, given how things started, but we did get
started and we had a tough schedule.  
This has been an extremely trying schedule for me, and it's been gratifying,
because ultimately we were able to see some of the things that we were
teaching began to take root and to that extent we began to put things
together. We're excited and happy that we got here, it's like the tortoise and
the hare, and it didn't matter how quickly you get something done, but that
you continue to trod along, and we did that.  
So here we are, in Oklahoma City regionals, which is a great region. If
nothing more than the tremendous support that the Oklahomans have always given
to basketball and to sports period. We're happy to be a part of that.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm curious from a coach's perspective, the general wisdom is that
there is going to be a lot of people wearing Oklahoma gear in the stands.  
What's it like coming in with the possibility of facing an arena like that
that's supposed to be a neutral site. Is that good or bad? What's the
potential there for a coach?  
COACH STRINGER: I asked him to verify Oklahoma's colors and they're red,
right? Good. When you look in the stands and you see the colors, that's great.
In our case, we have to continue to manage it's the Scarlet Knight red. But I
would rather play in a crowded arena than to get home and play in an empty
arena. It is what it is.  
I think our women's game is about growing the sport and trying to get as much
support in different areas of the country. So you might say it's a home
advantage, but just as easily had we been placed in the Trenton region, which
I imagine had we been the No. 1 seed we would have been able to do that and
others would have had to deal with the same thing.  
The guys have gotten to the point where they can take on neutral sites and
that's great, but the women's game is not quite there yet. I'm just happy to
be playing basketball now, period. And I'm sure that the team is. We're really
happy to be playing and we don't care if the game was in Iceland, we're just
happy to play.  
  
Q. Coach, you've seen the kids take hold of what you're teaching, and before
we came here you said that Monday was the first opportunity for them to see
exactly what you've been preaching. Has it been a slow process? Or was there a
moment? Was there something where you said "now they get it? Now they see it?"
  
COACH STRINGER: We had a "now you see it, now you don't" moment most of the
time. You didn't know who you were looking at. I think you remember a game
where we had Tennessee down by 20, lost the game. We've lost several games by
two or three points.  
We have sputtered, and had various players that would show up in one game but
not in another. So we were never able to have all five hitting on the same
cylinder at the same time. We believed, as has happened in years past, that we
would come together.  
Generally our teams begin to play what we call Scarlet Knight basketball, but
with so many freshmen, I don't know that they knew what Scarlet Knight
basketball was, because if you did, you would know you address defense first
and you would do it day in and day out in practice and always.  
Then you're looking for offensive execution. But we didn't do those things and
it had to do with us in a lukewarm way accepting any of the things that we
were trying to teach. But I think that it got really desperate after we lost
our game to DePaul.  
We picked it up with Notre Dame, and it was obvious we had lost way too many
games, far more than what we were used to losing and we were losing them by
two and three points. Some days I was upset and took the team out, as was the
case for Syracuse and didn't put the starters in. As I said to the team, if
you want to lose a game, I'll help you lose it. And that's what I did.  
To me it's not that we win or lose, but that we play the game in a certain
way, because I've come to understand that it has to be played in a certain way
in order to win at a championship level.  
When we began to embrace the small things that make the big difference, that
is defense, rebounding, taking care of the ball better, recognizing time,
situation, and score, and that we would do anything as long as we won as a
team, it was important.  
I think that everybody felt so bad that we began to look at ourselves and to
see what could we do and how can we be a better team? Because no one enjoyed
losing.  
We were too many individuals without realizing it, perhaps. But when you get
desperate, you start to reach for a raft, and I just remember the moment for
me was when prior to our Seton Hall game, they had had a meeting and they had
a cheer that said "trust. We're all we have!"  
And it was important that we did understand that because prior to that, we
probably thought as individuals each person can do their own thing and we can
pull it out. But I thought they got really scared. And I came to be the bearer
of bad messages.  
So I don't know that they took what I had to say as seriously as they did when
they began to read, you know, in the paper -- you know how they do the
Internet and all those other things, and they began to realize they were in
trouble and we needed to step it up. From that point forward they have never
looked back.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH STRINGER: It has to do with youth. Even though we are split between
upper classmen, we have as many freshmen as we have upper classmen and we
needed leadership to win.  
  
Q. You see any similarities between the way that you play and the way that
Purdue plays?  
COACH STRINGER: Actually a lot of similarities. I think Purdue is aggressive
defensively. They push the ball down the floor and they have a lot of sets
that are similar, and Coach Versyp has done an outstanding job.  
And I remember her being a great player at Purdue and she does a great job of
motivating her players to play at the highest level. And I'm sure that it's
her own pride having been with Indiana basketball, they're playing at Purdue,
she now has a player or two that have been at Indiana, and of course the
Purdue fans give great support to their team.  
Offensively as well as defensively I see a lot of things that are similar, so
it's not going to be easy, but, yes, we are similar, they do take care of the
ball.  
  
Q. Coach, your team has played very well in the last few games. You've been
talking about playing hard against Connecticut and smart, but you didn't play
particularly smart against Louisville, but you played hard.  
Are you concerned, even though you guys have gone forward that the
inconsistencies that have dogged you all year might be lurking this weekend?  
COACH STRINGER: Well, I wish you hadn't said that, but you always have to know
that. It's almost like if you get burned once, you get nervous when you get
near the stove, even though you did pretty good before.  
Obviously that's always possible. But I'm hoping that we remember -- I have a
feeling that I didn't think we would play consistent long enough for us to
know that this is the way we play. When you play a certain way, as soon as you
start to veer off that path, you can correct yourself quickly and you know,
oh, we're in trouble, let's stop.  
I shared that in the Louisville game, I thought we played hard but we didn't
play smart. We did play smart and hard in Connecticut, but we needed
consistent play from people who had played consistently. For example, Kia had
a spectacular game. And if we had the play from everybody else playing the way
they can play, the outcome could have been different.  
Right now we need consistency, and it was important that I knew they felt a
certain way after our win. I was asking them what was the best game they had
played. It was interesting, it was going to be important to me that we didn't
say, you know, maybe a game, maybe five or six, seven games ago where we may
have scored -- they as individuals scored 10, 25 points.  
It was important that they knew they had understood their roles, and I think
that was one of the key issues, is that we didn't understand our roles.  
So when I asked that question, for example, one of them said their best game
was against Auburn, and I said you didn't score as much as you might have
scored, but she began to embrace the parts of the game that are necessary to
her role in functioning as a point guard, because the point guard's role is
never to be the outstanding scorer as such -- if it happens it does, but she
distributed the ball, it was obvious she was calm, she recognized time
situations and she almost had a triple-double because she took good shots, she
always rebounded and she was looking to make things go.  
It was important that I heard that. And from each of them, because they then
talked about the complete game, I bet if I had asked that same question maybe
two weeks into the season, they would have looked at their own individual game
where they may have scored big points but not realize that they had played
their roles.  
We now recognize our role. What's important is that we have amnesia about all
those other bad games we played and like what we saw and try to seek that out
again.  
  
Q. Talk about building the offense from the defense. Is that what happens in
the first couple of rounds?  
COACH STRINGER: We've always believed in our defense creating offense. We
have, as a rule, been confident with our ability to put pressure on opposing
teams and to get ourselves 10, 12 points on any given night.  
We have been down by 18 and come back and wiped that deficit out in about four
minutes. We are confident we can get that done. It requires a tremendous
amount of hard work, but, unfortunately, we also play a game, so we're halfway
going through it, and we look up and we're down by 20 and we have 8 minutes to
go. So we get into this hurry up mode, let's go into our press.  
But we've come just 20 seconds too late, you know? But that's always just been
a key part of our game. But I will say that in the last three or four games,
the press has not been what it has been before. It's not given us at least 10%
of our offense.  
We have executed better, and I'm happy about that, because I don't think that
the press -- the press has not lost -- we have not lost it and it hasn't left
us, but we're executing better and we're getting better shots, more settled in
terms of who is taking the shots. And when the wall is going inside to Kia she
is comfortable.  
She'll see a double when she can make the pass out. She's not trying to rush
it. Epiphanny in some games had to score 25, she is not a selfish player, she
just had to take the shots because nobody else was taking them. It caused us
to be disruptive in our offense and it caused everybody else to stand around,
there was no movement.  
If you look at the Maryland game, that's exactly what was going on. But
everyone has now collectively bought into the fact that they have got to be
offensively effective, each person there has got to do their part, no more or
less.  
So offensively they're all looking when they touch it, they're looking to see
is this me? Can I get this done? And that's important because now it looks as
though no one is under pressure, they're just, you know, they're under
pressure to execute and find the best possible person.  
So I do feel better. I would have liked for us to be able to have been
clicking two weeks ago, that would have been good because I think then we
would know our rhythm.  
I was telling the team the first time that I slept in the same way that I have
always was about two weeks ago. I can't remember the game, but it was a
satisfying win. It was the way that it was played, it wasn't about the score.
I just felt good because I knew that once we embraced that, we knew what it
meant to make good passes.  
You know, some of the strange things, when we're executing, for me to hear
them say, "that was a nice pass" "nice flow, look at the execution" that's
really Greek, had been Greek to this team before. But now they're appreciating
good passes and movement. When you appreciate the game the way it has to be
played then, you know that we'll be okay. We'll be okay in the future in terms
of at least ball movement.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your comments.  
  
(Players enter the room.)  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by our student athletes Kia Vaughn, Brittany
Ray and Epiphanny Prince.  
  
Q. Kia, after four straight Sweet 16s, is this old hat or is there still
something special about this? If so, how does it distinguish itself from the
previous three?  
KIA VAUGHN: It's always special, every year you get to go and attend, because
you know that it's getting smaller and smaller within the great teams. So
we're one of 16.  
This year it's different because I'm a senior, obviously. So we have to go out
and play hard and have fun.  
  
Q. Brittany, Coach keeps on saying you are the unlikeliest of teams and it's
a surprise you are here. Do you feel that way?  
BRITTANY RAY: Uh-uh. I mean, coming from where we did in the beginning of the
season, I can see why she said that. I don't know, it's like a repeat of
freshman year, she said we were the most unlikely team to get to the national
championship, you know?  
It's just been, you know, an up and down season, but I'm fortunate to be in
this position right now because, you know, we've improved so much as a team,
not only on the court but off the court.  
We have become so close-knit and I think that has translated on the court, and
I'm proud that we've gotten this far and I hope we can continue to go further.  
EPIPHANNY PRINCE: I think she said that because of where we came from, from
the beginning of the season and how we improved so much. I think that we knew
if we continued to work hard, then we would be able to get to this point.  
  
Q. Kia, was there a moment in the year where you thought you weren't even
get to the NCAA tournament let alone the Sweet 16?  
KIA VAUGHN: Yeah, definitely. I think throughout the middle of the season,
Coach Stringer kept saying we are not going to get invited, which to me, being
a senior, was like a dagger in my heart.  
I kept asking myself, what could we do? What else are we capable of doing, how
many more games do we need? Everything counted. No matter what, I wanted to
get here and we are.  
So no more celebrating, we have to deal with the business at hand because
we're a team that belongs here.  
  
Q. Kia, you guys had the home court advantage the first few rounds, now
you're coming to a situation, especially when you get through this round and
probably into the next round, you won't have a home court edge. How much of a
difference does that make to you as a player?  
KIA VAUGHN: Home court, first year, it's never been done with us, so it's
nothing new to us being somewhere else, having the opponents being home and
being a higher seed. It comes with mental toughness, and I believe our coach
prepares us well enough that our mind-set is to play the game of basketball
and focus on where we are and make every place a home away from home.  
  
Q. Do you see similarities in the way that you guys play and the way that
Purdue plays?  
BRITTANY RAY: I think we both take great pride in our defense and we like to
run the ball. They run the ball a little bit more than we do, but I think they
like to play a low-post game and then the outside game, and I do see
similarities there.  
  
Q. Epiphanny, the fact that you guys scored 80 in your last game, does that
take a load off of you offensively, knowing that you don't have to do
everything by yourself, knowing that your teammates are chipping and scoring
too?  
EPIPHANNY PRINCE: I think the last couple of games my teammates have been
stepping up and taking shots and giving the team a lot more, so, yeah.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. Best of luck to you tomorrow evening.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your comments?  
COACH VERSYP: We need to get out on the court and shoot around and then we
will be focused for tomorrow night.  
  
Q. What have you seen from Rutgers as of late that's led them to make this
surge?  
COACH VERSYP: I think they're playing very, very good basketball. They've
always been a great defensive team but I think they're clicking on offense
now.  
They have a system that they play but they have players that can make plays
and Prince and Vaughn and Ray is shooting exceptionally well.  
I think they're continuing to build confidence and for them to be able to play
at home was good for them and got momentum going and they had to beat some
tough opponents.  
  
Q. Coach, sounds like from the advance ticket sales that this is going to be
a highly attended tournament. It also sounds like there will be folks that are
OU folks in the stands. I know you don't have to concern yourself with that
the first game. Can you talk about having an arena that is heavily attended in
the regional, and maybe on the flip side is there any concern for a team in a
regional?  
COACH VERSYP: I think it's a huge advantage. I think you saw that around the
country. People said there were upsets. If you think Rutgers was an upset with
Auburn, Michigan State beating Duke on the home court 6 or 7,000 fans. It's
great for women's basketball but there is a home court advantage with that
when you have so many fans that are obviously cheering against you or for you.  
But everybody knows it is what it is. This is women's basketball and this is
NCAA tournament time. But I think if you're used to playing in front of big
crowds, and you're playing, you know, to battle for a chance to get to the
Elite Eight or the Final Four, you have to be mentally tough at this point.  
  
Q. When you were a player at Purdue, Coach Stringer was the Iowa coach. What
do you remember about her Iowa teams? Are you seeing a lot of that when you
watch Rutgers now?  
COACH VERSYP: Coach Stringer is obviously one of the greatest coaches in
women's basketball and has done so much for our sport. As players, you never
think you're going to be able to coach against people that coached against
you.  
She is an amazing person, done an amazing job, she has great point guards, has
great defensive teams. If my memory serves me, I don't know if I remember that
so many years ago, but she is a coach who knows what she wants. She has an
incredible system and she brings in players that do it justice.  
Her and the Rutgers team are playing great basketball right now and we have so
much respect for them.  
  
Q. Coach, Rutgers is known for their defense, they like to hold opponents
under 60. What is it about that defense that's so tough to score against?  
COACH VERSYP: I think they want to slow it down quite a bit. They like to be
in the half-court offense and use the 30-second shot clock, and that will
limit opponents to get fast breaks and a lot of points. I think that is a big
part of it.  
They can press you intently and it's aggressive. But I think they like to
control the tempo and they have held people under 60, and we have done a very
good job on our defense as well, so I think it's going to be a great defensive
battle.  
  
Q. You said that Rutgers is playing very good basketball right now. When you
scout, do you look at the earlier games? Do you look at anything they've done
prior to this period?  
COACH VERSYP: Absolutely. You go back to January, February, then obviously the
games that they've been playing. I think everybody -- you can't be playing
great basketball year-round, maybe UCONN, but we've had major injuries, and
you want to be playing great basketball in February and March because that's
when it matters.  
Even Coach Stringer said it's not where you were, it's where you are going.
And I think we've done the same thing. For them, you go back and see how they
played against the Big East in January and February and see their tournament
run in the Big East tournament as well, and you can just tell when players are
getting out there and playing with confidence and things are just clickin'.  
  
Q. Is that the only March difference, the confidence? Or can you sense that
there was some sort of change?  
COACH VERSYP: I think -- you know, I can't sense their team, I can only speak
of my team. It's a mental aspect, a confidence aspect, it's playing together,
going into second and third gear and I think that's what most coaches feel at
this time but, again, I can't speak for them, I can only talk about what I've
seen and what I've read.  
  
Q. Coach, the Big 10 has been taking a lot of hits nationally this year, but
the league has three teams in the Sweet 16. Your thoughts on the league
getting some credibility back?  
COACH VERSYP: I hope it does get a lot of credibility. I had someone say to me
"I didn't think they were this strong until now," so people didn't respect us,
we had to prove it.  
Now having three of our Big 10 teams in it's going to show that we are a young
league, and getting three in, hopefully people will start recognizing that we
are a power league. Hopefully we're not 5th and 6th in that power league after
this year.  
But, you know, we have to continue to worry about ourselves and do the right
things and hopefully those things will take care of themselves. But when you
have new, young coaches in a young league, and we can do it this year, what
we've done so far, I think it will make an impact in the future and hopefully
people will recognize us a little bit more.  
  
Q. Coach, I think it's a vogue thing on the east to say Purdue hasn't seen
this kind of defense. What would be the thing that you would say that Rutgers
hasn't seen that your team offers?  
COACH VERSYP: I would say our defense. You know, we've been ranked nationally
in the top 20 for our field goal percentage defense and we've kept teams with
56 points, 57 points, so we kinda do the same thing, we play a different
style.  
We've played Big East, ACC and different styles, and we try to do that
especially at Purdue. Our nonconference schedule we play one of the toughest
schedules in the country, and that's to prepare our players for the national
scene, just not the Big 10.  
So I think our defense and our style of sharing the basketball and having
great balanced scoring -- we don't have one go-to player, we have a lot of
balanced scoring.  
  
Q. It sounds like this is going to come down to who controls the tempo, just
to hear you talk and Coach Stringer talking.  
COACH VERSYP: Absolutely, that's going to be a big key. They know we like to
run in transition as much as we can. Last week, playing against UNC, we had to
control the tempo because they wanted to run more than we do, and here we've
got to push that a little bit but that stems with our defense.  
We have to defend and get the board so we can run, but I know it will be a
defensive battle, but I think both programs and both point guards are going to
have to really -- it's in their hands to control that.  
  
Q. FahKara had the nine turnovers, do you break that down in film or are you
confident she won't too it again?  
COACH VERSYP: No, I say a lot to her. Halftime or the time-out. She and I get
very close. But she is the key, she is our energy, our leader, our focus, our
defensive stopper.  
She brings so much to the table that a lot is on her shoulders and she plays
-- her and Lindsay play harder than anybody. She has to calm down and settle
down at times. So there is definitely -- she gets an earful whether it's a
time-out or halftime, where I can have more time to discuss things.  
She is going to make turnovers, we talk about "bad" turnovers, or if there is
such a thing as "good" turnovers, but if somebody picks her pocket and scores,
if it's kicked out-of-bounds, we can set up our defense and we have a lot of
confidence in our defense.  
  
Q. Coach, you told us you were the underdog, why?  
COACH VERSYP: Nobody talks about Purdue, no one thought we would be very good
a couple of years ago and we went to the Elite Eight.  
We don't have the stress, the pressure, we can relax and our kids have a quiet
confidence about them, they're determined. But I don't see a lot of stuff
about Purdue, so it's great.  
  
Q. Was it like that when you were a player?  
COACH VERSYP: Um, no, Purdue was in a major national scene and been there for
a long time, all in the '90s and the 2000s, I think it's media markets, a lot
of different things.  
But we're still one of the top 10 winningest programs in the country. It's
just continuing to have that respect and we're in the Big 10, I think that's
part of it. They always talk about the Big East and the ACC and doing the
things we did this year.  
I hope people will start recognizing the Big 10, now we have Ohio State, IU,
Iowa, Michigan, so many stepping up to the plate. We always talk about you
have to earn everything. Just because there is a name on your jersey doesn't
mean that much. We're playing for the people that played before us.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your comments.  
  
(Players enter the room.)  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by our student athletes, FahKara Malone and
Lindsay Hylton.  
Questions?  
  
Q. FahKara, Coach said she feels like you guys are the underdog. Are you
trying to take that mentality into this weekend?  
FAHKARA MALONE: Yeah, I think so. I think it's less pressure if you go in
there feeling like it's you against the world and to go out there and have fun
together and bond together closer. It's worked for us on the road a lot this
year. She tries to keep that going through the tournament.  
  
Q. Lindsay, do you know Kia from USA basketball? If so, give us a story and
tell us what it's going to be like going against her?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I love Kia, she is a great person. I played with her
for two years, in New Mexico City and in Russia, she is a great friend, it was
a great experience.  
She is very physical and I do know she is a great player. I'm excited to see
her and see how she's been and to catch up. She is a great friend. When I tore
my ACL, she was there to help me and I think it will be an interesting match-
up.  
  
Q. What is it about Rutgers that makes them so good?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I think they're athletic, big, long. Their presence of
being so athletic and large is that they're intimidating. If we play our style
of basketball and execute the game plan, we should be great.  
  
Q. Lindsay and then FahKara. When you look at Rutgers, do you see
similarities at least in mentality, what they try to do and what you guys try
to do?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: Yeah, I think they like to slow things down in certain
situations in a game and we like to do the same thing, we're not a fast-paced
team. There are times to run and times to slow down and execute your offense.
It's a balance of who is going to execute and take care of the ball, we're
both well coached.  
FAHKARA MALONE: Like Lindsay said, they do a good job of controlling the
tempo. They don't look rushed very much in the half-court, so our defense is
going to have to be huge and pressure them as much as we can.  
When they do a fast break, they're efficient at it and their pressing does a
good job for them when they're behind, which is what we try to do sometimes,
so there are a lot of similarities so it will be a battle of wills and who can
execute.  
  
Q. FahKara, when you look at that backcourt, what do you think are the
biggest challenges for you? The keys?  
FAHKARA MALONE: The keys for me are rebounding. They have two stocky guards
that are extremely strong and they do a great job on the boards, and for us to
be successful we have to box out.  
For most of the games, especially against North Carolina, it's the post
players that do a great job of crashing as does their backcourt. They don't
get too far out of control and we have to do a lot of pressure defense and a
lot of boxing out.  
  
Q. For both of you. Do you think your transition game is something that you
can utilize as a strength tomorrow night?  
FAHKARA MALONE: Absolutely. Coach has been stretching that, trying to get out
on the open court but being smart when we do it. Against North Carolina we got
out of control at the beginning, but second half we ran what we wanted to and
slowed it down when we needed to.  
We're very good in the open court in transition. Hopefully we can use that to
our advantage.  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I think it's a matter of knowing when to run, when not
to. Like FahKara said, at times we've been really good and other times we've
been out of control and taking care of the ball and slowing it down when we
have to and other times capitalizing, whether it's a turnover or a fast break.  
  
Q. When you get to this point, do you know the back stories of the teams
that you're facing? Do you read about them, do you know that Rutgers has been
anything in particular this year?  
FAHKARA MALONE: I don't know much about Rutgers, I know they've had an up and
down season, similar to what we've had. What I know is that I've seen them in
the national championship in the Final Four, and I want to be able to push my
team forward in that situation, knowing that they've been here as well as we
have, so we have the experience level that we both have is going to be big in
this situation.  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: Same thing. (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. Lindsay, in the year you were having a free-throw shooting slump, how do
you bring yourself out of it? Do you shoot 100 each day or -- FahKara says no,
but --  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: FahKara! Coach tells us certain weeks when she wants us
to shoot free-throws, to get there and shoot a couple hundred during the week.
Once you miss a couple, it's what makes me go down and you're thinking about
it too much, it's a confidence thing.  
Toward the end I've been able to step up and hit free-throws for the team, and
I think that's building my confidence. Hopefully it won't become an issue here
and in the future. But I was the only one that missed free-throws in the last
game.  
  
Q. FahKara, after you have a nine turnover game like you had Monday night,
what's that conversation like with Coach?  
FAHKARA MALONE: You know, it was weird because I got on the bus and Coach gave
me a hug and said "great game," so I don't know. Against a team like North
Carolina, I don't expect anything less from myself.  
I mean, the game is so fast tempo and that kind of atmosphere, it kinda
happens, even though some were just knocked off my foot, I don't know what
happened there. But I know I have to do a lot better job going against Rutgers
because of the way they play.  
With North Carolina you get so many different possessions that it doesn't seem
as big, but against Rutgers you may only get half of those. Taking care of the
ball is going to be huge for me as much as controlling the tempo for my team.  
  
Q. You talked about experience earlier. Y'all have five 5th-year seniors?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: No, three.  
  
Q. What kind of a difference does that make? What do 5th year seniors
bring?  
FAHKARA MALONE: A lot of stories. They bring experience because they've been
in the tournament almost every year they've been here, so they can tell us how
it is, and they can show us different ways to handle different situations.  
I know a big thing, not only from those five seniors but from the fact that we
have three juniors as well, our starting lineup has all been to the Elite
Eight and that's huge for us. Knowing that we've been here with all these
people helps us to be more confident in what we're doing.  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I think not only confidence, just helping out the
younger classmen and helping them through this situation because it's all new
to them. So helping them through it and teaching them.  
Sometimes they have the nerves and may not have a great game, but we're here
to talk to them and help them to just play their style of basketball.  
  
Q. Lindsay, the ticket sales for this thing are going through the roof right
now. As players, would you rather play in front of a crowd even though they
may be rooting against you? Or would you rather have a more neutral setting?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I actually like to play in front of fans no matter who
they are rooting for. A dead atmosphere is not good and it lulls us to sleep.
We've played in situations like that before.  
Having fans, you want to hush 'em up and you want to play better. Having the
fans is great, no matter what.  
FAHKARA MALONE: Like Lindsay said, it's nice because even against fans that
aren't going for you, you just get that shot and that quiets them for the next
two minutes or something. So it's exciting whether they're cheering for you or
against you.  
  
Q. FahKara, your coach, she seems to have a little bit of a chip that you're
the underdog because everybody keeps on talking about Rutgers and you don't
get the same media attention. Do you feel that way? Do you feel that the Big
10 doesn't get credibility, that people talk about Rutgers and not you?  
FAHKARA MALONE: I think so, she brings that to our attention because we don't
focus on the media or anything like that because one day they're for you and
one day they're not.  
We try to focus on ourselves and what we're doing. A lot of times I feel like
the other team gets more credit than we do, but I know it helps Coach and she
feeds off the rest of us to go out there and want to prove ourselves every day
to everybody.  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I think just like she said, it's fuel to our fire.
We'll get some media information and she'll show it to us and use it as
motivation. Nobody thought of us last week, so -- and here we are. Anything
can happen. Even though we have the higher seed, that doesn't mean anything.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you for your comments. Best of luck to you
tomorrow night.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Coale from Oklahoma, your opening
thoughts?  
COACH COALE: Thank you so much, thrilled to be back in Oklahoma City. Thrilled
to be still competing in the NCAA tournament and excited about everything
except that weather we have outside!  
  
Q. Coach, I was wondering if you could talk about Pitt's size on the inside
and how obviously you have size with Courtney, but talk about that match-up
unfolding.  
COACH COALE: I think it's interesting that you asked me that question first
because we just passed by the Pitt team stretching in the hallway, seriously,
they're huge!  
You watch 'em on film and you see that they have interior size, but walkin'
past 'em in the hallway caught my attention. They're powerful, obviously they
play in a tremendous conference, so they're accustomed to facing big, powerful
centers, they know how to own the paint and guard their area and attack and
score there.  
We play in a great league as well, and we've faced some great centers as well,
so it won't be necessarily anything different from what we've seen, but they
are big.  
  
Q. Can you give us an update on Amanda. Can you talk about the challenges
that Shavonte poses to you?  
COACH COALE: Amanda is day-to-day, we will go through shooting today, as much
as we can limit her no nongame activity. The more extensive she can be in game
time activity.  
Shavonte is as good as any guard in the country. The greatest player
comparison would be Andrea Riley, she has a nice pull-up jumper, and she gets
to the pro line, if she is not number one in the country for attempts, she is
right there, averages around 10 free-throws a game, so a real conundrum for
you defensively to figure out how to contain and contest her.  
  
Q. Obviously Whitney is back, but I wanted to ask you about the fact that
when a player goes out of the lineup and say out for three or four games and
then comes back, maybe disruption is not the right word, but how does the team
go through replacing the player and playing without her and then she comes
back and you have to reacclimate.  
COACH COALE: You have to continue to manufacture rhythm, and that's incredibly
important at this time of the year. If you think about what Nyeshia Stevenson
has been asked to do, move into the starting lineup after having an effective
season in the role of the sixth man, she shared the award of the sixth man
with Melissa Jones in the Big 12 conference, move a kid to a starting role, we
need you to make threes, run the lanes, use your speed to get to the rim, but
it feels different. It just feels different.  
It's one of those subtleties about the game. So we asked her to move into a
starting role, and then when Whitney comes back we move her back into the six-
man role, and she gets accustomed to that, and Amanda goes out and we put her
right back into the starting lineup again.  
So there has been an assembly line of rhythm creation going on during our
practices, and Nyeshia deserves credit for the way she has stayed mentally
tough through it all. Whitney deserves credit for being the master of her own
confidence, her own state of mind.  
It is not an easy thing to be a true freshman, break your finger, come back in
and be asked to pick up where you left off. I think what we saw from Whitney
was a kid trying to make up for the games she missed all at once. Everything
went too fast, every cut, every shot, every use of screen, even every
defensive dig step, that was an over exaggeration of everything.  
Because of the minutes she has been able to log in the past three or four
games, she has played back into a nice rhythm and that's great news for us.  
  
Q. Sherri, I wanted to ask you about a couple of bench players who have
improved their play with injured players, and that's Vining and
Roethlisberger.  
COACH COALE: Absolutely, Jenny came in and anchored us from behind the 3-point
line at the close of season and in the Big 12 tournament as well. So I think
that confidence she gained in those minutes, very important minutes in big-
time games make us tougher here at tournament time.  
And I think Carlee's readiness, which stems from great, great practice to be
able to step in and give what you say we needed in Amanda's absence, we need
her size and length, that softened us at the 4 spot, even though Amanda
typically plays a three.  
As we brought and moved Amanda down, when we lost her, we lost a 4 as well, so
Carlee and Jenny continue to play big roles there, and I think their
performance tomorrow night will be critical.  
  
Q. Sherri, you talked about the kids being able to sleep in their beds an
extra night. Does it feel any different that you are playing so close to home
at this point in the tournament?  
COACH COALE: It feels a little bit different today because we just got her,
but the thing about it, it doesn't matter where you are, and to a great extent
it doesn't matter as much who you are playing as it does can you be the best
you can be? That's the whole sense of the NCAA tournament.  
If you can continue to call forth your continued play in the tournament,
that's the reason we're all here is because we have done that. I don't think
it matters where you do that. As soon as we take the floor, it will feel like
the Sweet 16 and we will know what is required of us.  
  
Q. Sherri, these crowds the next few games, if they are as big as they look
like they could be, you guys could shatter records for a regional. What would
that mean to you to see that possibly happening in Oklahoma City and in
Oklahoma?  
COACH COALE: Well, I hope you're right. I haven't seen any projections, so I
don't know what the attendance expectations are. I know what they are
internally. But it would be incredibly rewarding.  
And I speak for a moment as the president of the WBCA and not necessarily just
as the head coach at the University of Oklahoma when I say one of our
missions, maybe the center most, is to continue to grow this game in terms of
exposure and attendance, and at the top of that list would be student athlete
experience.  
When a student athlete wins the right to play in the NCAA tournament, and
especially earns the right to compete in the Sweet 16, you should feel it in
your bones. I watched the games on television this morning, and I felt sad for
those teams to have to compete in an environment where it doesn't feel like
the NCAA tournament.  
Hopefully the people of Oklahoma will fill up the Ford Center Sunday and
Tuesday. And for all of the student athletes competing at this site, they will
have the ultra competitive experience.  
  
Q. Sherri, talk about the second half you guys had against Tech and what you
hope will propel you into this game?  
COACH COALE: I felt like we got lost in every possession of the second half
and I thought that was the difference. So much at this stage in the game is
being lost in the moment.  
I think forgetting about trying to win and focussing on the play at hand is
important. I felt like in the first half we started off great and missed a few
shots. It sucked the life out of us and we looked around and start thinking,
oh no, what if we don't do this, what if this happens? Uh-Oh.  
And fortunately we could shut those up and talk about it at halftime, and I
thought Danielle's leadership, she and Whitney together, their body language,
their facial expressions, and the way they led their team was just fantastic.  
And we hung on to the lead and still missed shots down the stretch, shots
we're going to have to make Sunday night in order to advance, but I liked the
way we played together, the way we competed.  
  
Q. For those of us who don't get to see Courtney play all the time or hardly
ever live, talk about the things she does really well, how would you describe
her as a player? She has good size and whatnot, but what are the things she
exceeds at and makes her such a tough match-up?  
COACH COALE: Gifted hands, I always start there, she can catch anything. She
is a tremendous rebounder partly because she has the gift of touch and she can
tip it to herself and come up with it. Agile, graceful for a kid her size and
unbelievably strong and powerful.  
She is relentless, and if you commit to blocking her out as many teams have
done throughout this season and the previous three as well, many times we have
seen opponents to not even having the player responsible for Courtney try to
rebound, just guard her, keep her from getting to the rim.  
Even when you do that it, becomes a difficult thing to sustain because she
wears you out. She is so relentless in her pursuit of the basketball, and I
think that's what makes her most dangerous.  
  
Q. Sherri, tomorrow is going to be quite a day for Oklahoma University
basketball, your game in Oklahoma City, Jeff's squad in the regional squad for
a right to the Final Four, can you remember a day like this?  
COACH COALE: I don't know if it gets better than that, you might have to ask
Joe that question, we thought our men were fabulous last night, dismantled a
Syracuse team.  
We would like to be a little more focused on Pitt at the moment. They will be
playing U of Carolina, but that's why you have TiVo, we'll go home and watch
it later.  
  
Q. Sherri, maybe you can put your WBCA hat back on. It seems remarkable in
the men's tournament if somebody was playing an hour away from home, the other
team will be raising holy heck about that. And in the women's tournament there
have been some teams lose on another team's court. The fact about growing the
game and everybody kinda goes ahead and does it and there is no complaining,
is that a remarkable thing about the players and coaches, that they just say,
okay, this is what we got to do and they do it?  
COACH COALE: Well, remarkable, yes. I think -- I think first of all you have
to step back and understand from a big, open perspective what our mission is,
what we're trying to accomplish.  
We want a fantastic atmosphere for our student athletes, these young women
deserve that. At the same time we're trying to grow the game and increase
attendance, we're trying to televise games, we have a lot of objectives that
are trying to be accomplished.  
Here is what you need to look at, though. When you look at our tournament,
yes, people could be hollerin', if you will, about the fact that Duke had to
go to Michigan State and they got upset there. Well, you know what? Notre Dame
had to play in South Bend and they got beat there, too.  
The list almost evened itself out, and I think this is where the public makes
a case that's not realistic is if there are 15,000 people screaming in an
arena, it might become home court advantage.  
Sometimes they don't necessarily present themselves that way, so it's not as
if that particular scenario, the one that we hope happens tomorrow night, it's
not as if that is the case everywhere you go. But I think the important part,
Wendell, is coaches and student athletes are striving to have not a
competitive, equitable NCAA tournament, but we're striving to improve our
game.  
And you have to have parity, and it's a gingerly fence that you stride upon in
terms of building that. What we have seen this year is a lot of stuff we
haven't seen before, look at the upsets, home court or not, and that's not
really the issue. There were more new faces, more new teams going deeper in
the tournament this year than I can remember. That is a positive reflection on
the growth of our sport.  
  
Q. Sherri, talk about Shavonte and the problems she poses for you guys.  
COACH COALE: She's really good. Really good. I like her game, I like the way
she not only gets the production from herself and expects the production of
herself, but the way she involves her teammates with her.  
I think that makes her incredibly dangerous and she is not surrounded by four
guys that watch her play, she is surrounded by four guys that play with her,
which is why Pitt is in the Sweet 16. I think it's her ability to get to the
rim that gives you some problems, and I don't know that we've seen a kid
elevate on a jump shot quite the way she does.  
She is a good-sized guard, and when she stops on a dime and jumps up, she is
over you and you have to bring help that has size. She is a total package,
particularly offensively, and she competes on both ends of the floor, but
offensively she is a problem.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your comments. Good luck
tomorrow.  
  
(Players enter the room.)  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Danielle Robinson and Courtney Paris,
Whitney Hand will be here momentarily. Questions for you're student athletes?  
  
Q. Danielle, talk about you guys playing so close to home, sleeping in your
own beds, does it feel different being at this point in the NCAA and being in
the comforts of home?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: We're definitely excited to be in the City, but then again
it's like being on the road, because we're not sleeping in our own beds, we're
in a hotel, but we have the comfort of having tons of our fans in the stands,
and I think that's what makes this section so different.  
  
Q. Courtney, if you are able to, can you go through the season in segments a
little bit, preconference, conference, the postseason and chart the team's
progress along the way?  
COURTNEY PARIS: Oh my gosh. Well, I think -- this is going to be general, but
we started off pretty well. Our defense, I know startin' off we had a little
bit of defensive pride issues, and I think we've improved on that as the
season has gone on.  
Had some hard games up front, lost to UNC at home by 1, had that Connecticut
game, learned a lot about ourselves there. I don't know, we just keep trying
to get better every day.  
  
Q. Whitney, what was it like having the injury, sitting out and then coming
back? Was it as much a mental challenge as getting healthy and getting your
hand healed to come back?  
WHITNEY HAND: I think so. Anytime you're out of the season, it's more
frustrating and you're chomping at the bit to get back.  
At the same time, it was good for me personally to get things back in
perspective. I think for everybody we just -- I mean, we have all grown
together these last couple of weeks through the injuries, and we had many
injuries and having to fight through those mentally and getting over that made
us stronger as a whole.  
  
Q. Courtney and Danielle, talk a little bit about how important the bench
play is going to be this weekend.  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think that's real important and it's been our X-factor,
Jenny has been knocking down shots and Carlee had two really good games. We're
going to need that.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Especially in this game, it's going to be great for us, for
Nyeshia to hit shots.  
  
Q. Whitney, Coach said when you did come back, it was like you wanted to get
all of those games back at once. Was that the feeling? It was tough to get
back into the rhythm that you were playing in before?  
WHITNEY HAND: Yeah. The first couple of games were terrible, and I think it
was just because I was going so fast and trying to speed things up, and it was
the Big 12 tournament plus not playing for two weeks and the adrenaline, so it
was obvious that I was inexperienced in that. But I'm glad we are here now and
it's a new start.  
  
Q. Danielle, talk about Shavonte Zellous, and Coach Coale compared her to
Andrea Riley, is that what you would say?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I think she has a great shot like Andrea Riley, she is a
great player, been through it multiple times, and she is a leader for her and
they feed off of her, so I think her demeanor and the way she plays definitely
sparks their team.  
  
Q. Danielle, the Noble Center, you are probably excited about the men's
performance last night, are you going to get to watch the North Carolina game
tomorrow?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: We get back like four from somewhere and get to watch the
game. Definitely excited, they played extremely well last night and we're
proud of 'em and ready to join 'em.  
  
Q. Courtney, you obviously are one of the more dominant inside players in
the country. Can you talk about Pitt's size and whether or not you like
matching on them, 6-5, 6-6, and 6-1, do you like matching up against players
like that?  
COURTNEY PARIS: Definitely not going to have a choice tomorrow. We were
walking by 'em in the hall and they're bigger and taller than I thought they
were, but we have that size in our league, Kansas has a really tall girl so
we're used to that stuff.  
  
Q. Whitney, you're sitin' up there with a couple of cagey veterans, a year
ago you were in high school and now you're sitting in a press conference in
the Sweet 16, what does that feel like?  
WHITNEY HAND: It's weird, my mom called me last night and she was cryin', and
she was -- I remember we were -- don't quote me on that, please --  
THE MODERATOR: It's a little late!  
WHITNEY HAND: My sisters were sad that Kansas State lost out because they are
huge fans, and I remember -- all of us remember -- it was weird because I
didn't make a bracket this year, and she was getting emotional and it was a
little weird. (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. Danielle, how does this team play a 40-minute game in the postseason? You
had two first halves you would like to have back in the tournament and two
fantastic second halves, but what can you guys do to turn it on from the
start?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: It's more mental than anything. From the beginning you have
to mentally focus and prepare. Our coaches do a great job scouting the team,
it's all about us making the decision to come out there and get a good jump.  
  
Q. Danielle, is it a distraction playing this close to home?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I don't think so at all. It's great that our families get
to come out and be here to support us, along with the thousands of fans that
are going to come out. I think we are excited about the opportunity that we
have to play so close to home.  
  
Q. Courtney, you guys talked about wanting to get back here because of the
fans and after the way you went out in the Big 12. Talk about that.  
COURTNEY PARIS: That was last year, we wanted to get back here. I think we
have great fans, not just our fans but women's basketball fans in general, and
it will be cool to play in front of them and it's great that we have this
opportunity.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much and good luck tomorrow night.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Coach Berenato from Pittsburgh,
congratulations on a great season. Your opening comments?  
COACH BERENATO: On behalf of the University of Pittsburgh, we are excited to
be here. It's great to make the Sweet 16 the second year in a row. It's
something that a lot of people are surprised about but we aren't.  
We feel that we have a really good team, a team that really doesn't have any
stars. We are just a well-balanced program. I just want to thank everyone here
in Oklahoma as well as we just came from -- where did we come from, Seattle,
right? Yeah, Seattle. And the University of Washington. The NCAA committee and
all the schools and the host communities. They've been great.  
Our host, Caroline, has been wonderful, so to whoever picked here, and she has
been a blessing for us and we had great soul food last night, we treated her,
it was definitely out of her realm, but we like doing different things. We are
excited about the game tomorrow night and excited about being here and we
appreciate all of you being here.  
  
Q. Coach, Shavonte was lightly recruited out of high school. Why the heck
was she so lightly recruited and what did you guys see in here that put you on
to her?  
COACH BERENATO: My associate head coach Jeff Williams is the one who found out
about her. He saw her and he has a great eye for talent. He can look and he
has great vision.  
He just said this kid was going to be special. She was a great track athlete,
M.V.P. of her track team for four years in a row. He had been in touch with
her and said we have to go see this kid. So we saw her in open gym and we took
a chance, but you have to remember that we only had six wins when I got to
Pitt, they had three wins, so we doubled it, but it was a whopping six wins.  
We told her she could come and make the program and develop the program and
she was into it. She was like, "how many games did you win?" And I said "six."  
But it's not like, for us, anyone -- my eighth grade daughter could have
helped me. We had to get recruits, it was in the spring, we were starting a
new year and we needed people to take some scholarships.  
We love her personality and she has a smile the size of California, so we
thought we would like her.  
  
Q. Agnus, I guess by this point you're used to playing on the road almost in
these games. Would you talk about coming to Oklahoma City to play Oklahoma?  
COACH BERENATO: I mean, you know, we knew we were -- you have to go on the
road if you're not hosting, so we knew we were going on the road and the
thought of being close wasn't even a possibility for us. We just -- I really
thought we were going to go back to New Mexico, that's where we went last
year, Albuquerque, I never thought about Seattle, but when it came on the
board -- and honestly we couldn't see it, you couldn't see where you were
going.  
When we found out it was Seattle, it was like, okay, fine, and then where do
you go from there, Oklahoma. Okay, fine. And my team has done exceptionally
well because the Seattle trip was a six-and-a-half hour flight out and it's a
3-hour time difference. Then we flew back home and the kids went to classes.  
And then to come here, I missed geography in school and I thought it was an
hour flight, it was almost three hours. We had a charter, it was three hours,
and it was like "are you kidding me?" It has been rough.  
When you look at other teams, they've had home seeds or been up the road
apiece and they've come back home. Honestly, it's all part of the NCAA, but it
makes it exciting and special. We handle whatever we're given, and I think
that's what you do in life.  
Basketball is just like the game of life, and businessmen and businesswomen,
we travel all the time. We travel to California to see a two-hour basketball
game of a 17 year old and get on the red eye to come back home, so why not do
it to get into the Sweet 16?  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the match-up between Pepper Wilson and Courtney
Paris.  
COACH BERENATO: Obviously Courtney Paris is an All-American and averaging 16
and 14, and Courtney has a twin sister that's her side kick and she is playing
at home. Pepper Wilson is a freshman and she doesn't have a sister that's a
side kick, so what is there to talk about?  
I think that Courtney is really good. I like Pepper, she is a freshman, she is
learning, getting better every single game. She has played in the rugged, Big
East conference and played against some of the best talent in the nation, Tina
Charles, Candice Bingham, Tina Vaughn are some of the best in the nation.  
She hasn't played against Courtney Paris, but I don't think it's a Courtney
Paris show, it's her team against our team.  
  
Q. Coach, as you've looked at Oklahoma, what do you see Whitney Hand, how
she fits in and the things she brings to the table for Oklahoma?  
COACH BERENATO: I think Whitney is a great player and she adds a lot to their
team and she gives them the balance of the outside threat.  
When you listen to these games, and I saw the game with Georgia Tech and they
talked about she was all that, and I guess she was a rookie in her conference,
rookie of the year, and she was shooting well and the game before she hurt her
hand. She was like after that 4 for 16 and by a lot of people's standards,
that's not so bad. She cracked it open against Georgia Tech, and I think she
allows them to have an inside/outside threat, and any good basketball team has
that.  
So as a freshman, she has stepped up and Whitney looks like a kid that enjoys
the game. I've only seen her on video, but I like watching her play because
she has fun, smiles, I think that's really nice, and she has a hell of a shot.  
  
Q. Coach, when you've dealt with a player going out four or five games as a
starter, I think people don't understand what happens to -- because you bring
somebody else in and that person was a reserve and somebody takes their place.
Can you talk about in general when a team loses a starter, they adjust and
then that starter comes back, how disruptive that can be in general?  
COACH BERENATO: Well, I don't know that it's disruptive, I just think it's
probably -- you went a couple of nights without dessert, and all of the sudden
you got dessert again. It's kind of like you're in time-out, maybe. I don't
look at it in a negative way.  
Things happen for a reason. I feel like maybe there was a reason her being
out. I know it killed her, it probably killed Sherri Coale, but maybe the rest
of the team was like, hey, we need this kid. And I think what happens to group
dynamics, you're right in that they continued to build and grow, but
unfortunately the person that's injured is on the sideline.  
So they're kind of feeling a little left out and they're not in on all the
little jokes, and do you know what I'm saying? They can't be, every time the
coach gets mad, "get on the line and run" and the kids are like, what, your
feet aren't broke? Because there are group dynamics like that. I'm just
sayin'.  
So the people that are working hard are like "you're so lucky" and she's like,
"you're kidin' me!"  
It's almost like the co-worker that is sick, you're like, yeah, right,
whatever, but you really need them. You need them to come back in, and your
team has to move on, but the coach has to do a great job in the balance of
reintegrating that person within the system, because women have feelings and
those feelings get in the way.  
  
Q. Coach, I think you and Gary Blair went to the same media school by the
way.  
COACH BERENATO: I love Gary Blair.  
  
Q. He comes here for games.  
COACH BERENATO: Gary Blair, we have vacationed before, without family and
stuff. It's like on "You Tube," know what I'm saying? I can tell you a really
funny story about Gary Blair.  
  
Q. My question was going to be about the guard match-ups, because you have
veteran talented guards, Oklahoma's guards are more youthful. Talk about the
match-up and how you see that playing into tomorrow.  
COACH BERENATO: I think that D-Rob is an awesome player and she makes Oklahoma
go. She loves the transition game and pushed it into the paint. She likes to
penetrate and kick, or if she gets into the paint, she is going to create
things.  
At the same time, Xenia Stewart for us is so focused and driven, and she has
size that maybe can come back, like D-Rob has to offer, the key for us is to
limit her explosiveness in the paint.  
And I think Shavonte Zellous is playing at the top of her game, she is an All-
American. My sports information person, Mindy, told me she has scored more
points in the NCAA in the regional or the first and second round than any
other person in the NCAA. She doesn't even know that, you know what I'm
saying?  
It's like she plays because she loves the game. She really enjoys our team.
It's not about her, she'll do whatever the team needs her to do. That's how I
look at the guards from Oklahoma. I think their team is good as well as Hand.  
She'll do the same thing, she likes that 3-point shot, she is going to hangout
there and shoot that, but if they need something else from her, I think she'll
do it. I think they're going to be a great match-up.  
  
Q. In these first two games you talked about the tempo of the game and how
you guys would like to speed it up. Do you feel the same way going into this
game? Or is this a different theme athletically? How do you see the pace and
the tempo going?  
COACH BERENATO: Paul, it's great you're here, so to my Pittsburgh people, we
give you a special shout out! How about this weather, it's worse than home!
We're not happy about that you guys -- no, I'm just kidding.  
I think the tempo is going to be really important but you know me well enough,
Paul, to know that we are who we are. I am who I am, I'm not going to change.
Somebody might tell me to change, and I'm like okay for a second, and then I
go back to who I am.  
Both teams like to push, play up-tempo, push in transition, we're both
aggressive defensive teams, whether it's man-to-man or a combination of zones
and man-to-man and I think that's -- when you get to the Sweet 16 and you get
to this level, I don't think anyone is changing the way they're playing
because the way you play got you here, so why are you going to change?  
You've got to go with it and you're going to try to adjust to what Oklahoma
might do or Oklahoma might make adjustments to what we do, but at the same
time to change tempo, no, because that's not what got us here.  
  
Q. Are they similar to anyone that you played in the Big East? Do they
remind you of anyone?  
COACH BERENATO: You know, that's like when my kid asks me to tell her about
patterns, I don't know. I don't think like that. I don't know, you know? I
just think in the Big East we're the best conference in the country. Bottom
line. We play against everything. Running teams, against slow-down Villanova
teams, against inside/out teams, Louisville made it to the Elite 8, we have
four teams in the Sweet 16 and we have one that has advanced.  
So I would say, sure we're playing against someone like that, like I'm trying
to think -- no one is like Connecticut, they're really good. We play some
teams from out here, we played Texas A&M, we lost by 2 possessions, we played
Maryland, beat them by 30, here in the Sweet 16. We've played a lot of teams
that are here, Louisville twice.  
We've played Rutgers, beat Rutgers there, that was a tough environment and I
will say that the Big East has prepared us for our environment. I think that's
one thing that's important, you know.  
You go to Connecticut and it's sold out, whether it's 11,000 or 17,000, you go
to "The Rack," which is Rutgers, which was in the top-three toughest places to
play in the nation, and we were able to get a win there in a hostile crowd.
Louisville had 12,000 people. Of course, all for Louisville!  
We played Gonzaga and Montana with their home crowds, but my 28 people were
really loud! We brought the house down. It was awesome! So I don't know, but I
think every team in the Big East has good guards, people coming in off the
bench, that's why I think we're productive and that's why we have four teams
left.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your comments.  
COACH BERENATO: Thank you to all of you. On behalf of the University of
Pittsburgh but also for our game and unless you guys take your time and your
time is the most valuable thing you have, unless you take your time to write
about women's basketball, our game won't grow and our game is an awesome game.
So thank you very much for being here.  
  
(The players enter the room.)  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by our student athletes from Pittsburgh.  
  
Q. Shavonte, I was asking Coach about your recruitment, and I was curious if
you might be willing to reflect a little bit. You're on this four-year
journey, not done with it, but when you think back on it, can you talk about
your development as a player, lightly recruited and now where you are in your
senior season?  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: I would say my freshman year was a long year. As you know, I
didn't play due to the transition of high school to college. But I think I
learned, and I had to learn really quick. I think my maturity level has grown
from my freshman year to now.  
I think my success comes within my teammates. I think they're being here with
me for all four of my years has helped me. Xenia helped keep me on track, and
I think the coaches have done a great job with that, too.  
And it was a matter of me getting into the gym, working on my game day in, day
out. And Coach Shea, who is now at the University of Connecticut, helped me,
too, when I was working out over the summer, and she helped guide me into
doing things the right way.  
  
Q. Shavonte, it seems like you guys are playing a string of road games. Talk
about what it's been like in the tournament and when you expect facing
Oklahoma so close to their campus?  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: From a team standpoint, we're used to it. Coming to the Big
East we had to travel to UCONN, Rutgers, Louisville, so traveling is not a big
thing for us, we enjoy traveling, to be honest.  
We're well prepared, we come into the game with confidence and we know
Oklahoma is a great team and they have a great post player Courtney Paris, and
she has a great supporting cast. We're just glad to play. That's it.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the match-up that you guys are going to be facing
tomorrow? You obviously have experience and talent at guard. Oklahma is more
on the youthful, talented at guard. Talk about the match-up of guards in this
game tomorrow.  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: I think the match-up is going to be something to watch. Both
players get to the free-throw line, very active on the defensive end, there
will be a lot of pressure, so I think it's going to be a good match-up for
everyone to see.  
A lot of explosiveness, a lot of quickness, a lot of leadership and key play
among the guards in the perimeter and trying to get the post into the game as
well. It's all going to be something to watch.  
  
Q. Xenia, when you've watched film to get ready for Oklahoma, what have you
seen from Whitney Hand and what does she bring to the table for Oklahoma that
makes her a good player?  
XENIA STEWART: Whitney has a very good shot, we got to know where she's at.
From the videos we watched we can't let her get a shot off. But I feel as
though she can't get the ball without the point guard penetrating and drawing
in the defense, so if we can know where she is at all times, we can limit her
touches.  
We're not saying we are going to shut her down completely, and she is wanting
to score, but we're going to try to disrupt her a little bit in her game.  
  
Q. Shayla, talk about the prospect of playing -- sounds like it's going to
be a packed crowd, but chances are good it's going to be people wearing
Crimson not Pitt colors. Can you talk about that?  
SHAYLA SCOTT: I think Washington helped us prepare, playing both Gonzaga and
being in that environment, when you have a lot of people rooting against you
helps you to stay together as a team, helps you be calm and listen to your
coaches.  
We're well prepared for that and we've played at Louisville and Connecticut,
where a lot of fans aren't rooting for you, and I think that's helped us to
become prepared.  
  
Q. Shavonte, could you talk about your men's team and y'all are here. Do you
have much contact with them? Are you watching? Are they watching you? Talk
about that.  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: I don't know if Shayla wants me to say that, but she keeps
in contact with the men's team pretty good. (Chuckles.) But we keep in contact
with them every blue moon, they're focused on trying to make it to the Final
Four and we're trying to focus on getting to the Elite 8, so there is not that
much contact besides Shayla, but that's about it.  
THE MODERATOR: Shayla, did you want to follow up?  
SHAYLA SCOTT: My boyfriend is Gilbert Brown, so I talk to him about the game,
give him pointers, and they're always in the background being loud, and
they're screaming, but we're all in the same position and it's exciting to
both be fighting for a national championship.  
  
Q. Shayla, for a long time Pitt's men's team has been growing in popularity
and y'all have been doing the same thing. Has that been cool to be a part of,
as they've grown and gotten attention, or are you trying to aspire to the same
level that they have?  
SHAYLA SCOTT: We have come so far, they had six wins when I came here, it's an
enjoyable thing. We have media people coming to interview us, our games are on
TV now, Shavonte being an All-American is exciting and getting into the
tournament three years in a row, it's great.  
I'm just happy that we have made the program as successful, and
congratulations to our men's team, who are doing well this week. We're happy
for them as well. But I think mostly our fan base has grown due to our success
and I feel like we're getting to the level that they are at.  
  
Q. Shayla, follow up on the women versus men deal. If there was a men's team
playing Oklahoma -- like if the Oklahoma men were playing here in Oklahoma
City and it was the Pitt men, they would be screaming and hollering about the
home court advantage, this is terrible, there were a lot of teams that end up
-- Duke gets beat on Michigan State's court. How do you guys approach it
mentally to say, hey, it doesn't matter, we've got to go out and play. I know
the Big East prepares you, but this is supposed to be a neutral tournament and
a lot of folks end up playing on a home court, how do you deal with that?  
SHAYLA SCOTT: We just try to go out and play our game. We like a lot of people
rooting against us and we're like, hey, why not? We want to go out there and
upset them. You know what I mean? They're close to home and we want to be
like, you know, we can play in this environment and we can take care of
business.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, best of luck to you tomorrow.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Vanderbilt  61  
Auburn - 54

  
THE MODERATOR: Nell Fortner from Auburn, DeWanna Bonner and Whitney Boddie,
comments, Coach?  
COACH FORTNER: Well, I thought Vanderbilt played outstanding defense and kept
us from getting into any kind of rhythm offensively.  
And it was a long day for us offensively and they shot the three-ball so well
today. Hard to beat a team when they're shooting threes that well. I thought
Vanderbilt was very good today.  
  
Q. Nell, in addition to their 3-point shooting, y'all didn't make any, was
there something they were doing?  
COACH FORTNER: They smothered Allie all day, she was our best 3-point shooter,
and DeWanna, she shoots the three, and they didn't get any nice looks anyway.  
I thought they did a good job taking that away, even though we're not a huge
3-point shooting team, we normally get to the free-throw line a little more
than we did today and we just didn't seem to get the calls in that regard.  
Normally when we're penetrating and gettin' to the hole, we're usually picking
up some fouls, but -- I thought that hurt us, too, no threes and then not
getting to the free-throw line as much as we normally do.  
  
Q. DeWanna, building on what Coach Fortner said, what were the things you
saw them doing to you tonight that made it difficult for you to get into a
rhythm?  
DeWANNA BONNER: They just smothered you while you were on the court and they
played good team defense.  
  
Q. Whitney, usually you're the one penetrating and getting things going,
were they playing a funky zone stopping you from getting in there?  
WHITNEY BODDIE: They were playing a triangle and two on some and the zone on
the others, and I'm not taking a lot of 3-point shots and they were trying to
stop DeWanna. My man was sagging on her.  
And usually I'm trying to penetrate and create things, but the way they were
playing defense, it's more sagging, so they kind of dare you to take the shot
because if you penetrate, they're sagging on you.  
  
Q. Nell, seems like you guys were within three points and Vandy went wide up
on 3-pointers.  
COACH FORTNER: It was just a defensive breakdown. We were trying to switch on
screens, and we just got a little messed up there, so, yeah, that was very --
it was like a dagger.  
Because when we got it to three, if we could have made a nice stop, that would
have been nice and come back down and try to tie it or cut it to 1, but we
weren't switching on the screens and it just didn't happen.  
  
Q. How hard is it not to be disappointed? You've still got obviously more
season.  
COACH FORTNER: Well, it hurts right now, nobody likes to lose. We haven't lost
very much this year, obviously, but it is disappointing, and when the prize is
as big as the one was today, it's even more disappointing.  
Or it hurts a little more, but you know what? We understand what lies ahead
and we have to take it and learn from it and use it as we move forward. We'll
get over it, move on just like we do with the wins. You deal with it, you
either enjoy it or you deal with it, and then you move on and then it's on to
what lies ahead.  
  
Q. DeWanna, like Coach said, you're disappointed right now, but how
important is the next two weeks for you guys?  
DeWANNA BONNER: Once we figure out what's next, we can't worry about this
loss, can't let anything dictate us. We have to just go back, find out who we
play and prepare.  
  
Q. Nell, Christine Wirth kept getting open for those threes, and she hit a
lot. Were you trying to do something on her that wasn't working or how did
that go down?  
COACH FORTNER: There wasn't anything -- we weren't trying to run any kind of
special defense for her. They were just -- I think that was more
miscommunication. It was maybe a long offensive rebound that we didn't get out
and recover to her a couple of times, and that hurt us with the threes.  
The rebounds were long and we were all sucked into the paint trying to go to
the boards, and then they kicked it out and knocked down another three.  
  
Q. I'm sorry if you addressed this, Nell, but can you talk about Wirth in
terms of -- she just seemed to make all kinds of plays you might not see on
the scoreboard, like tipping the rebounds out, she made the steal in the
end.  
COACH FORTNER: I thought she played very desirable basketball today. She seems
to be one of those -- maybe she's a senior and this is her last runthrough, I
thought she was better today than I've seen her on film and when we played 'em
in Nashville.  
Maybe she stepped up a little more because Tuomi is hurt and she knows she has
to do a little more. To me, it seemed like that's how she played today.  
  
Q. You tried to up your offense in the second half, but how tough is
Vanderbilt to come back on?  
WHITNEY BODDIE: They're really tough. They're efficient with their offense,
they pound you, pound you and you think you've got them stopped, and then at
the end of the shot clock they make a three.  
It's hard to come back on a team like this. They're mechanical and the way
they do things. We tried to step up and make place, I guess, but...  
  
Q. Nell, obviously every game is different, but what is it about Vanderbilt
over the last couple of years that has made it hard for you guys to get over
the hill?  
COACH FORTNER: I wish I knew. I think it's the defense they play. It's always
a low-scoring game when we play them, and it's hard to get your points,
whether it's a triangle and two, box and one, they do a lot of things that
keep you out of a good offensive rhythm.  
I think Melanie does a good job with shutting down certain players on a team,
you know, whatever the defense that they play is, they focus on taking players
out of their game. You know, we just haven't been able to break through that
defense.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Vanderbilt  61  
Auburn - 54

  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations to Vanderbilt a 61-54 winner today, we have
Melanie Balcomb and student athletes, Jennifer Risper and Christine Wirth,
both members of the all-tournament team, Christina Wirth M.V.P. of the all-
tournament team. Coach?  
COACH BALCOMB: First of all, sorry for my hair, I apologize. I'm just really
proud of the way our kids fought through the whole tournament, but I'm really
proud of the execution of a game plan. That's not easy to do, and having kids
believe in what our game plan was and execute it as well as they did today. It
was awesome to watch as a coach.  
The two seniors next to me, I can't wait to play again. We've got a while
before NCAAs, but I think we're ready to do some great things and I'm excited
at how we reacted all game today, with our body language, our confidence and
making big plays. When we needed them.  
  
Q. Melanie, you guys have beaten them twice this season, only one other team
was able to beat 'em, period. What do you guys know that nobody else can
figure out?  
COACH BALCOMB: We know we can't play 'em straight up, they've got great
players. You have to do different things to get them out of their flow on
offense, disrupt their offense and limit touches to their shooters, and then
you have to fight on the boards.  
You have to rebound as well as keep them under control in transition. They're
the fastest team up and down the court in transition that I've ever coached
against, and we tried to limit those transition buckets.  
  
Q. Melanie, how many different defenses did you use against them tonight, I
counted triangle, box, some kind of basic matches --  
COACH BALCOMB: No, we actually didn't. We worked on a lot of different things
and we've used a lot of things during the tournament, but today we used two
different defenses.  
  
Q. Which were?  
COACH BALCOMB: We did use three, that's right.  
  
Q. I was close.  
COACH BALCOMB: We worked on about six. We used some triangle against 'em, as
well as some man and some -- I don't want to give out all our secrets, we've
got games to play.  
  
Q. We know about your M.V.P. and all-tournament players, but can you talk
about the unsung heroes of your team?  
COACH BALCOMB: Yeah, when I was up here the other day, Jen liked when I talked
about when one door closes on Hannah, and hopefully we will get her back, but
one door opens, and somebody else gets an opportunity.  
I just think Tia Gibbs has made the most of this opportunity, and we've gone
to a small lineup and moved Jen to the post and brought Tia in and she has
played a lot. And I think she has been tough in our defenses as well as
hitting big shots for us, big plays.  
But as a whole, everybody has stepped up and given us something. She stands
out the most because she has taken the most advantage of the minutes, from not
playing a lot to playing a lot.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
JENNIFER RISPER: They helped prepare us for the game. A lot of players didn't
get in tonight, but they helped to prepare us play the game.  
  
Q. You missed your first eight shots to start out, and Tia hit one to take
it to six to three after about five minutes. Were you relieved at that
point?  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: We got off to a slow start, but I guess, you know, 6 points
is not too much of a deficit to come back from, and so we said, you're fine,
we've just got to go out there and relax and our shots will fall.  
As soon as we scored, the game was basically almost tied, it wasn't a big
deficit, so we knew we were fine.  
  
Q. Jennifer, you had Bonner, was there anything that you were doing that she
seemed to be out of it tonight?  
JENNIFER RISPER: Just defense, that's all.  
  
Q. Melanie, Nell said she thought Christine may have played her most
inspired or best game that she had seen on tape this year or at your place.
Your thoughts on her overall game and Christine's comments?  
COACH BALCOMB: Yeah, Tina was big-time tonight. And I mean that in the
confidence level that she carried for her team and for herself. I think what
was so awesome about Tina is she was so relaxed and not just tonight, but the
entire tournament.  
I felt good about her being relaxed and it helped her teammates be relaxed and
she had a lot of trust in her teammates. Like Jen said, we had a lot of
teammates step up and work hard, and it built her trust in her teammates. When
she needed to step up, she wanted the ball at all the big times, but she
defended the post player on the other team every single game.  
If that doesn't wear you out, Tina is undersized to begin with, with no help
on the side and helping on the defensive end was the amazing part of it.  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: It was a nice comment. If you look at the stats, I didn't
shoot well at all, to be honest. I did hit some shots and my teammates found
me a few threes at clutch times in the game, but it was a complete team
effort.  
A lot of times I take a lot of the shots, and I remember one time early on in
the season Coach talking to me and saying, you're being selfish if you don't
take those shots. A lot of people say you're selfish if you shoot 20 times a
game, but she told me for the team to be successful, that's what I needed to
do.  
And when my shots aren't falling, I'm going to keep takein' them, and it was a
great team effort. I couldn't be more proud of our team.  
  
Q. Christine could you talk about the steal there at the end and how you saw
that play unfold?  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: I turned it over so I was the last one down the floor, and I
saw Smalley about to make a skip pass, and I tried to get it to Meredith
Marsh, she is an amazing free-throw shooter, but I saw it and I took it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Allison Hightower](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19291)

### [Courtney Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19311)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Vanderbilt  61  
LSU - 47

  
THE MODERATOR: Representing LSU is Coach Chancellor, Courtney Jones and
Allison Hightower.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I want to give Vandy credit, they played well tonight. They
have a lot of heart, they played tough, they did a great job.  
LSU uncharacteristically -- this was not LSU today. We did not play like we
have been playing for the last seven games. Turned the ball over, 18 points
off second-chance turnovers. The thing I can't get over, I watched the
Tennessee/Auburn game, and I'm not saying it's bad, but the officials have
grown in love with the offensive foul. It ain't but one offensive foul after
another!  
If I was paying good money to watch a game, I would want to see a little
offense, and all the games I see today offensive foul, lord! That didn't have
anything to do with our losing tonight, Vandy played!  
We turned the ball over too much, didn't rebound the ball, they had a lot of
heart down at the end. Questions?  
  
Q. What did you feel happened in the last 7 minutes? You were tied at 8:07
and after that it was all them.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: We had a breakdown in defense. We let Wirth get a wide-open
three, in the last eight minutes they shot a -- got one offensive rebound
after another and they did a great job of executing in that eight minutes, and
then we couldn't score. And because we couldn't score that affected our
ability to defend.  
  
Q. Allison, can you talk about what they did against you defensively tonight
that gave you problems?  
ALLISON HIGHTOWER: I thought they did a really good job on defense. They were
playing me box-and-one, face guarding me the whole time, playing the zone on
the rest of the team.  
  
Q. Coach, we talked about upsets in this tournament, and this time it's 1
versus 2 tomorrow, can you talk about how that's shaped up? Are you
surprised?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Yeah, I really was. I thought there would be more upsets in
this tournament than there have been. Even though I thought Auburn was
dominant today, and Vandy in the last eight minutes was really outstanding.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about where you feel you guys are as far as the NCAA
tournament goes and where you think you'll be seeded?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: We won 6 out of our last 7 and 13 out of something, and
we've been playing really good up until the last eight minutes of this game. I
wouldn't want to think that's going to hurt us, because I think Vandy will --
I really thought they played really good.  
And this small lineup for them has been outstanding and the coach has done a
great job with their kids in this tournament, I'll give 'em credit for that.  
  
Q. How did you feel about Tia tonight?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought she was fine, it was just -- we were thankful she
didn't have other problems. She was fine. Hard to have 20 turnovers, give up
13 offensive rebounds and beat a good team.  
Defensively they were really good. That's one thing I don't think they get
enough credit for, they play really good defense and don't get enough credit
for it.  
  
Q. Courtney, did you feel like you guys, the supporting cast gave Allison
enough support tonight when she struggled a little bit?  
COURTNEY JONES: Sometimes we did try to get her open, but it was hard.
Sometimes they would switch on the screens and she wasn't open. You're going
to have games like that and we just needed to step up.  
  
Q. Allie, do you feel like this loss is going to affect the confidence of
the team going into the tournament?  
ALLISON HIGHTOWER: I feel like we have time to prepare, get back and practice,
get back to the basics and do the things that we need to do to come out in the
tournament and compete.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought their seniors were outstanding. I thought Risper
and Wirth took over the game and were pretty good tonight, certainly. Thank
you very much, I appreciate it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, thanks.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2009

  

### [Alyssia Brewer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19306)

### [Pat Summitt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14068)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Auburn  78  
Tennessee - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: Presenting Tennessee is Coach Pat Summitt and student athletes
Angie Bjorklund and Alice Brewer. Coach?  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously we went in at halftime feeling pretty good about what
we had done and just our defensive scheme overall.  
The wheels fell off the second half. I thought we really, at times, we just
didn't defend. They had their way with us in transition and off the bounce
they obviously stepped up and DeWanna Bonner was terrific. And I knew they
would probably have a good talkin' to at halftime and come back out, because
they're a team -- they're so aggressive when they're in their transition game.  
They didn't have to set up that much in the second half. We did a good job
first half, I thought, of making them have to at least go against our defense
in the half-court more. So that hurt us, but they obviously had three people
that had double figures, you got Bonner with 26, Hobbs with 16 and Boddie with
19. Obviously we did not score well.  
I thought our guards really struggled. Certainly not getting to the free-
throw line, we were 7 of 11, they were 23 of 27. But we just, you know, a lot
of it was I thought we weren't as aggressive to the paint as we needed to be,
and I think fatigue set in on us probably. That's more mental than anything,
but we just didn't compete the second half, really disappointed in how we
played in the second half.  
  
Q. Coach, what are your general thoughts on Shekinna's performance tonight?
I know you usually expect a lot out of her, looked like she had difficulties
in the second half, what were your thoughts on how she did for you tonight?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, you take Angie and you take Shekinna, and they're just
two very important pieces of what we want to do offensively and defensively
and they combined 10 of 38.  
You know, it's hard to keep your offense where it needs to be, you know,
Stricklen was 3 of 19. So players have bad shooting nights, and obviously
let's give Auburn some credit. I thought their defense, they extended better
and just defended better in the second half especially.  
But as far as that goes, we didn't score well inside, either. It's hard for us
to win if we're not having balance offensively.  
  
Q. Pat, there were just under 3 minutes to go and you were demonstrative and
angry in the huddle, 3 minutes to go, was that anything --  
COACH SUMMITT: I just didn't want us to quit playing. I don't care if there
are 3 minutes left to go, it's still a teaching moment. We caved in, we gave
in in the second half, you know, and we didn't bring the same intensity.  
That's a time to -- that's a teaching opportunity to say we've got to hang in
here. I was trying to -- I said, let's try to cut it to 10, because I never
want a team to quit, I want 'em to compete for 40 minutes, and that's just
exactly why I went in the huddle and did what I did, because this team has to
learn to compete all the time.  
  
Q. Pat, when Boddie penetrated the second half, you want to comment on the
help?  
COACH SUMMITT: I didn't see any help, it's hard to comment on something you
didn't see, Bob. But, seriously, I thought -- we just let 'em go right. We
didn't force 'em left, we talked about forcing them left, we didn't give any
help.  
We had opportunities to take a number of charges, but they put us -- you got
to give 'em credit, they put us on our heels in the second half because they
turned -- you know, they turned the pressure up by putting us in that
situation.  
I mean, they were just dribble driving and attacking the paint and the rim and
we didn't step up and do what we needed to do, which was to have a sense of
urgency to defend and force 'em left and to take charges.  
  
Q. Pat, heading into the Florida game, facing them the second time you said
that game would be a chance to see where you're at. Same could be said with
Auburn, so how would you answer that question? Where would you say you guys
are at?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think we're at the crossroads, we've got to decide who we
are, are we going to be a 40-minute team, are we going to commit to our
defense for 40 minutes. And we've got to make shots!  
We got in the paint and missed so many layups. We've got to be more efficient
on the offensive end and, you know, that would help us tremendously from a
confidence standpoint. And obviously, you know, as we move into the NCAA
tournament. We've got to be better.  
We've got to be better on the offensive end and we've got to be really stingy
on the defensive end. And when you're not making shots, you've got to make
stops. If you don't, it can get real ugly.  
  
Q. Pat, did you see anything in this tournament that makes you feel better
about this team, going into the NCAA tournament?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I thought the fact that, you know, the way we competed
against Florida when they came back to make their run, I was really pleased.
We did some good things, you know, and by no means am I giving up on this
team. We're young, we've got a lot of skilled players. We've just got to learn
a lot about how to invest in every possession.  
We've got time to practice and they're going to get better. So from that
standpoint, that game, yes, the way we started tonight was very, very good. I
was disappointed in the second half. The team is disappointed. We were not
happy with how we played, but we played a team tonight that was just better
than us in the second half. And it was obvious that they were the more
aggressive team and the more skilled team.  
  
Q. Pat, could you talk about your view as to whether Auburn should be a No.
1 seed?  
COACH SUMMITT: You know, I haven't really looked that closely at it, but I
think if they win here, if they win out, then they've got a great shot at the
No. 1 seed. And they may get it anyway, but I think definitely if they win, it
says a lot for 'em.  
  
Q. Alyssia, talk about the way the team responded in the first half. After
Kelley went down, you guys seemed to play aggressively and with a lot of
determination in the first half.  
ALYSSIA BREWER: Definitely. We saw a player go down and we never want to see
that, and we knew that we had to come together and replace what Kelley would
give us and we did that in the first half, but we lacked it in the second
half.  
These past couple of days we were doing great, but in the second half we kinda
folded.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Auburn  78  
Tennessee - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: Auburn with a 78-58 win over Tennessee today, and representing
Auburn is Coach Nell Fortner, could you start off with some comments?  
COACH FORTNER: I thought it was an outstanding effort for us in the second
half, and it took us 20 minutes to get our feet under us and figure out the
flow of the game, but very proud of the effort in the second half.  
We were fully aware that you go through Tennessee to get to a championship,
and that's what we had to do tonight. I felt like in the 20 minutes of the
second half we understood that and played much better basketball. Proud of
them.  
  
Q. To both of you, what did Coach say to you at the half?  
DeWANNA BONNER: That's a secret!  
COACH FORTNER: I'm going to bottle that up and sell it.  
  
Q. What do y'all do differently in the second half?  
COACH FORTNER: Easy!  
DeWANNA BONNER: What she said to us in the second half, basically they were
outrebounding us, that was the focus, they got 10 offensive rebounds, and it's
an easy 2 points for them, so that took us out of our game and we couldn't get
into it.  
I'm sorry, what was the second part?  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
DeWANNA BONNER: We got into our running game and stepped up in the second
half. I think we just stepped up.  
WHITNEY BODDIE: Well, she told me to play with more composure. I had a few
plays out there where I got rattled a little bit, a little frustrated.  
Sometimes you have a great player like DeWanna, you can stand around and she
can shoot from half-court and you don't have to do much, but we didn't worry
about the name on the front of the jersey and just played, be more aggressive.  
  
Q. I think you have to go all the way back to the 1980s to see where
Tennessee has lost a game by this much, two games to the same team. What does
that say about your team and your program right now?  
COACH FORTNER: I think it says that these kids are pretty good players,
they're a really good team. You know, they play with a lot of heart and a lot
of passion.  
You know, Tennessee is a measuring stick for everybody, and I think that we
measured up pretty well this year against 'em.  
It feels good but, you know, we're building our program at Auburn, and we feel
good about the direction we're going and these kids right here are the reason
we're doing what we're doing, plus two other seniors that came in with them,
so very proud of them.  
  
Q. Nell, do you feel like you now have earned the No. 1 seed?  
COACH FORTNER: I'm not the committee, and I don't even -- I have no idea. I
don't know. All we want to do is win the next game, you know, and we've been
that way all season long, just win the next game, do the -- win the next game.  
And we have another game in this tournament and that's what we want to do, win
the next game. That's all I can think about. I don't have any idea what the
committee -- how they decide that.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
COACH FORTNER: Do I think we're a No. 1 seed? Yeah, I do.  
  
Q. Whitney, your Coach wanted you to play with more poise, but in the second
half you seemed more aggressive trying to create things, and in the first half
you were standing around. What was going on?  
WHITNEY BODDIE: I was a little more passive in the first half. I tried to let
the game come to me instead of making things happen, and Coach Fortner talked
about being a playmaker.  
And the girls were in the locker room talking about making plays, and that's
what I tried to do, you go backdoor and you can't sit back on your heels and
force you to do certain things, but using their aggression against us -- they
were using their aggression against us.  
  
Q. Were you concerned because Auburn had such a big win against Tennessee
that maybe there might be a let-down and Tennessee might be more fired up?  
DeWANNA BONNER: No.  
COACH FORTNER: I wasn't concerned that we would have a let down. Again, we
have a tremendous amount of respect for that program, for that team, for those
players. So there was going to be no let down whatsoever.  
And at this point in time in the season there is no way you would ever
overlook anybody, no matter what happened earlier in the season. No, I thought
Tennessee was -- you know, they have pretty much a home court advantage every
time they play this, the SEC tournament because they have so many great fans.  
I thought we just -- I thought the second half was just the difference in the
game, we got our running game going and that made the difference.  
  
Q. Did you do anything specifically to shutdown Stricklen?  
COACH FORTNER: Whitney is a good defender, I thought we had good pressure on
her most of the night. We didn't do anything special.  
We were trying to take care of their inside game because Kelley Cain has been
playing really well and their post players, you've got nice post players over
there, so we were not more concerned, probably a bigger concern about that,
taking away the inside game, and I thought we did a nice job on Stricklen. We
have good perimeter defenders.  
  
Q. For the players, whenever you're playing Tennessee, it's almost like
playing a road game sometimes. Do you guys feed off of that, especially at the
second half when you were making your run?  
DeWANNA BONNER: No, we knew it was going to be like that when we came in.
Every game we've been here they played because they have the home court
advantage with all their fans.  
But our fans were awesome tonight, you could hear them as loud as the
Tennessee fans, but we kind of fed off our fans and Tennessee fans and Coach
Fortner and our bench and we got the energy where we could. We just came out
and played.  
  
Q. You mentioned Ruthie talking to you before the game.  
COACH FORTNER: Ruthie has become a special member of our team. She is a former
player that has a special connection with this group. We appreciate her effort
to come in and watch us play. She lives in Sacramento, and she made a great
effort to get here.  
She has a great time spending time with them and she has such great wisdom,
and when she speaks, you can't help but listen. She is funny, too, she is
hilarious, the kids draw a lot from her and we appreciate her being here.  
  
Q. DeWanna, you guys were locked down on offense the first 8 or 9 points in
the first half, seemed like they were in a man-to-man being aggressive, why
weren't you able to get good shots?  
DeWANNA BONNER: We couldn't get our offense going, but the best thing for that
is to attack the basket. You can't run no plays because they take you out of
it, because they've got great ball pressure and off the ball play, wherever
you go, they go.  
But I think we did a great job staying in the game, gave ourselves a chance at
halftime. We were only down by 5 and we came back and kind of got the counters
to them and that's what happened in the second half.  
  
Q. Talk about getting into the championship game and how close you guys are
to making all those goals come true.  
COACH FORTNER: Well, we're excited about it. This is the first time we've been
in it since this staff has been at Auburn, and so it's a definite goal this
season, so we're excited to have an opportunity to play for a championship. I
don't know what else I can say about that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Vanderbilt  61  
LSU - 47

  
THE MODERATOR: Vanderbilt with a 61-47 win tonight, representing the team is
Coach Melanie Balcomb, and Jence Rhoads and Christine Wirth. Coach?  
COACH BALCOMB: I think we did a much better job in the second half getting to
the rim and offensive rebounding and attacking.  
I thought they had a tremendous game plan, took our two shooters out of it,
sagged and gave us fits in the first half defensively. I thought the other
thing was picking up full court and pressing, I thought we did a great job
picking up the pressure and creating tempo so we could get them in transition
and start to wear them down.  
  
Q. For most of the game, up until about 8 minutes left in the second half,
it was close all the way, tied at 40-40 with about 8 minutes to go, what
changed? ) That was the question.  
COACH BALCOMB: I felt the pressure. The pressure in the backcourt, it gave us
an opportunity to create transition points and turnover and steals and getting
us more in transition.  
And from that point on, I thought we got better looks wearing them down,
making them work hard every possession for more than just half-court as well
as pushing the basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, Allison Hightower scored 22 against you guys last time and 23 last
night, she didn't have a very good game. Can you talk about what you did to
hold her in check.  
COACH BALCOMB: We put Mooney and Gibbs on her and kept rotating them. They did
a great job of knowing where she was and pressured her and challenged every
shot. I just thought we did a really good job knowing where she was and
limiting her touches.  
  
Q. We've heard about young teams in the tournament, and Vanderbilt is not
considered one, but on a stretch tonight you had two freshman on the floor for
a while. Can you talk about that?  
COACH BALCOMB: That alley-oop play we're going to have to put in. I just felt
-- I said this this afternoon to somebody, I felt like somebody new was going
to step up and was going to have to step up tonight, and I don't know why, but
it was the two freshman and it was the two freshman.  
Jence Rhoads was more aggressive going to the basket, she took more shots.
Those three stepped up and got out of their box and their comfort zone and
created a mismatch, trying to guard Jordan in the post, it gave us a post
presence we needed, trying to guard Jence off the dribble when they focused so
much on Risper and Meredith.  
  
Q. Coach, there was a lot of talk coming into the tournament about the
parity in the league this year. We've only had two underdogs per se. Can you
comment on -- we have the 1 versus the 2 now, and how this is shaping up?  
COACH BALCOMB: It's really weird because I thought the same thing, from top to
bottom this league, anybody could beat anybody this year, and I thought that
happened.  
Going into this, we've always -- when we've gotten to the final or won it,
we've always been an underdog and a lower seed. To me, this is the highest
seed we've ever had and the first time I remember 1 and 2 since I've been in
it for 7 years that have gotten to it in the final. Usually there are upsets.
It surprised me.  
  
Q. Christina, 3-points, started the 27-1 run to finish it. What did y'all
feel going into that stretch when you pulled away?  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: I just -- I don't know, it was an amazing three, and I think
that right there we just decided every time-out we kept saying 40-40, it was
0-0, and it's going to come down to who wants it more.  
And those last 7 minutes we had people step up on every single play on offense
and defense, Jordan grabbed a few huge rebounds. It was a battle, both teams
were pretty tired toward the end, but we just kept fighting and we didn't stop
for 40 minutes, so it came down to hustle plays and attacking the basket. We
never stopped attacking.  
  
Q. Jence, same question.  
JENCE RHOADS: I think our defense and our pressure made us more comfortable on
offense, too. We were able to get some easy baskets and just attack without
having all five people. We had numbers every time and we were more comfortable
in what we were doing and we were able to pull ahead.  
  
Q. For the players, could you talk about -- your Coach talked about the
freshmen stepping up, but you do have an experienced team and I think it
showed tonight. Talk about why that's going to be important tomorrow night,
especially in a setting like this.  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: It's the championship game and we're excited about it. You
know, Auburn is an experienced team, too, so I don't think that one team has
an advantage in that category, but it's great when you have experienced
players on the floor to keep you relaxed.  
That's what I was trying to do today when it was close, to say we're fine,
calm down, there is a time and a place we need to get everyone riled up. There
is a time and place to relax and play our game.  
You know, it's nice because last year we were a young team and this year we do
have experience, so hopefully we can take advantage of that. We have played
Auburn, we're familiar with each other, so the experience factor will be --
you may have to find new ways to score, different ways to get the job done,
and we will be okay doing that.  
JENCE RHOADS: It will be important to keep our composure. We all look to our
seniors, and obviously Meredith as the more experienced -- and the more
experienced players because they've all played in a championship game. We'll
be looking to them for advice and to lead us as we play tomorrow.  
  
Q. You're still processing this game, but talk about Auburn and how it's
more about stopping Bonner, but obviously that's a handful, too.  
COACH BALCOMB: I thought I was done! I checked out! I apologize. Tomorrow,
Auburn. Yes, I didn't watch the second half tonight, I watched the first half.
We just have to play tremendous team defense.  
Bonner is very, very good as we know, but the supporting cast is very good,
too. It's not like you can take one player out and the rest of the kids are
just young. They're very experienced, all upper classmen and this is a game
that is going to come down to who wants it more, and I think who plays harder.  
Both teams know each other very well, both teams will have a great game plan
ready to go. The shortness and the time is not going to matter, we'll both be
ready, it will be a good game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Vanderbilt  69  
Georgia - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Danielle Taylor, 6 points, 6 rebounds and 2
assists. Also Angel Robinson, career high 29 points, 16 rebounds. 29 is the
most scored by a Georgia player this year. Coach, if you will open with
comments.  
COACH LANDERS: So the bottom line in terms of our inability to win a game is
that we didn't defend the two things that Vandy does and needs to do very well
to win. We didn't defend very well the three. They put up 26 of those.  
And we didn't defend very well the drive, they got the ball into the paint off
the dribble. Far too much. They got the close shots off the dribble that they
needed to compliment the threes that they got.  
And then the last ten minutes of the game we were very ineffective in
rebounding the basketball after they missed, as much as anything. That really
hurt us and may have cost us the chance to win, because I remember a few
possessions where we actually had defended well and taken the shot clock down
to the end and they shot and got the ball back. I remember a couple of things
like that.  
We didn't defend the dribble, didn't defend the three with any consistency. We
defended it, that's the thing, we defended it, basically did what we needed to
do about 80% of the time. That 20% of the time it looked like we mentally just
collapsed. We were standing with no intent or no sense of urgency about
defending those two things.  
  
Q. Coach, I seem to recall a couple of three and four-shot possessions they
had. Were you surprised you actually outrebounded them?  
COACH LANDERS: Yeah, I was surprised when I saw the final number that we
outrebounded them as a team. You know, the thing is, the number that counts
for them is 16, the 16 offensive boards.  
But, yes, I was surprised that we outrebounded, not at all surprised that they
got 16 offensive boards because we didn't box out. Not at all. Nor did we
proceed to hustle. We got outhustled.  
  
Q. Actually, did you think Ashley would be such a focal point of the offense
and --  
COACH LANDERS: I supported both, but not to the extent of either. We suspected
we would have an advantage in size with the inside game, maybe not great, but
an advantage. So we certainly wanted to go there and try to exploit it, see
how they -- how they would attempt to defend the low post.  
Angel was very, very good and her team was very, very good with getting their
basketball there. You know, we suspected that they would try to take Ashley
out.  
A lot of people have done that, they've tried to do it before, and tonight
rather than fighting it, as we have with other teams, we decided that we would
go with Angela Puleo in a certain number of sets that she was comfortable with
that she would run the offense. And that was a real big problem.  
  
Q. Coach, I want your perspective about how different Vanderbilt is without
Tuomi in the post.  
COACH LANDERS: They're not a lot different, really. Tuomi is probably going to
have more of a post-up presence, but once either of them have the ball four or
five feet away from the basket, they're similar. They're going to attack you
with the dribble and they're going to be good offensive rebounders.  
Today I thought where we just got our tail kicked was their guards
outrebounded our guards on the offensive end. I think their guards got nine or
ten of their offensive rebounds, which I'm not surprised that that happened
altogether.  
  
Q. Angel, it seemed like you guys were down 10 at half, you came back and
got close several times in the second half and they came back with a
possession and scored.  
When you expend that kind of energy on the floor, is it hard when you don't
get the lead to come back like that?  
ANGEL ROBINSON: We knew we had to step it up and make a few changes. We were
down by, I believe, 14 going into the second half. We knew we had to have the
energy like we had against Kentucky, and apparently we started slacking a
little bit when we got real close.  
Vandy fought to come back and take advantage of it. They outhustled us. We
didn't get out on 3-point shooters, that was a huge thing. Once they started
shooting those threes, they had two or three shooters on the floor at all
times, so we didn't do a good job of recognizing that.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
DANIELLE TAYLOR: A couple of times we got close, and one of their big shooters
would put down the three, we just weren't aware.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
COACH LANDERS: I don't know. I rather suspect that we're at the table, but
oftentimes these things come down to how conference tournaments go, upsets,
and those kinds of things, so I really don't know and I haven't studied it a
great deal lately. I shouldn't comment on it.  
It wasn't the reason for me that we came out here. You know, I thought we had
an excellent chance if we played well to win this tournament, so I really
haven't thought about the other deal very much.  
  
Q. Danielle, along the same lines, a couple of days before the selection,
what's that time period going to be like for you until you guys get a verdict
on that?  
DANIELLE TAYLOR: Like Coach said, we don't know, we sit and hope that we do
get in.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, ladies.

### [Shawn Goff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19282)

### [Renee Ladner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18026)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Auburn  71  
Ole Miss - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Ole Miss and Shawn Goff, who recorded a career
high 25 points, 10 rebound, a double-double.  
Coach, if you would start with an opening comment.  
RENEE LADNER: I'm extremely proud of the way my team played today. You know,
we've been down before and sometimes didn't fight back, but there was no
question today that we were going to fight with everything we had to the end
of the game.  
Twice we closed it to within three and had we made a big play, I think we
would have had a shot at beating the Number 1 team in the conference.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about the difficulties from playing from so far behind
against a team like Auburn?  
RENEE LADNER: Wow, there is nothing easy about playing Auburn at any time
whether you're close or behind. You know, I just think they're a team when
they put their foot on you, they can continue to do that because they have
weapons at five positions.  
Today their All-American stepped up, she played All-American -- in an All-
American status today, All-Conference, everything. I thought they contested
Bonner, and she still did an outstanding job and that's what players do in
that situation.  
It's always a dig but we were fighting and we were tired and we kept fighting
and that shows a lot about our team.  
  
Q. Shawn, your thoughts?  
SHAWN GOFF: I just think we realized that we had to stop doing what we were
doing because we were hurting ourselves, so we had to play smarter on offense
and get stops.  
  
Q. Coach, I know it's difficult to reflect immediately after a game, but
Shawn showed today why she has been such a strong player for you throughout
her career. Can you just talk about how she kinda carried you guys?  
RENEE LADNER: She absolutely did. She played as a senior, as an All-Conference
player, she was preseason pick and she had a subpar year at times, today she
played consistently and as Shawn Goff can play.  
We knew that Bianca was going to be shut down, and that either works on your
psyche one way or the other and she stepped up today and showed the player
that she could be or the player that she actually is.  
  
Q. You mentioned about Bianca. What did you see from that defensively, they
were paying attention to her wherever she was on the court and how did that
affect what you guys wanted to do on the offensive end?  
RENEE LADNER: It affected us at the beginning of the game because we were
shaky. We knew they were going to stick somebody on her like a piece of
Velcro, for the most part that's what they did.  
Everybody is going to take away your leading scorer, or try to. She fought
with it for a while, and when Shawn was making big shoots, she had the
tendency to relax, thinking she didn't have to carry the load, at times, or so
it appears.  
It's a scout, and the first name at the top of your list on points is the very
person that they're going to try to pick up. Auburn did an outstanding job on
us all day long. They're big, they're wide -- we gave them fits in man-to-man
and they had to change to zone, and that's because our guards kept dribble
penetrating.  
We finished our shots, we were going to be leading them. We could not finish
shots. But anytime your leading scorer is shutdown or struggling, everybody is
looking around the room trying to figure out who is going to make the next
play and on this particular day it was Shawn Goff.  
  
Q. Renee, they had fouls at the end of the game --  
RENEE LADNER: Flagrant fouls.  
  
Q. Any thoughts on how many they had to give?  
RENEE LADNER: Yeah, speaking of that. I thought there were some calls that we
didn't get. I'm not sure we really got many in the course of the game. I
thought they were very physical, I thought there were times they were over our
backs.  
I know in particular when DeWanna Bonner went in, one of the things that broke
our back early in the second half, she goes in, she shoots it and they give
her a free-throw. We're smaller, we have to back people up and we have to get
them over our back for us to get a call sometimes, but I'm not sure that was
evenly distributed, but we played through it. We still fought through it.  
  
Q. Shawn, can you reflect -- again, I know it's difficult, but to have such
a great game and your final one.  
SHAWN GOFF: I wanted to play as hard as I could and you don't want to go into
what can be your senior game and know that you didn't play hard for the team,
so that's what I tried to do.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2009

  

### [Sharon Fanning-Otis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16876)

### [Robin Porter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19293)

### [Alexis Rack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19264)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

LSU  63  
Mississippi State - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: Now joined by Mississippi State, Coach Fanning, Alexis Rack,
who had 14 points tonight and then Robin Porter who had 10 points, Coach?  
COACH FANNING: I was pleased with our intensity, we sort of got in a hole. I
feel like our intensity and our focus early on wasn't where it needed to be.
But I was proud of the way we competed.  
I don't know that we could hold that for a 40-minute period, but we were
trying to make things happen. When you see another team -- I've said this all
year long, if you see another team shooting layups, getting offensive boards
or just good looks that are uncontested shots, which we saw -- and I don't
think our individual team defense is what it needs to be.  
In the second half they shoot -- which I just really saw 61%, they shoot 51%
from the field, that's something we have taken a great deal of pride in the
majority of this season, trying to keep people under 40%.  
I don't feel like we're executing the way we have to execute in a half-court
game. LSU is an improved basketball team. They had some young kids, and
initially they took some hits, but they've played well lately and they played
with a lot of energy today, so I think you have to give credit to their team
relative to coming out, ready to be.  
Hopefully we learn from each and every game we've played this season. And, you
know, we were fortunate enough to have beaten them two times during the
regular season, and of course one was a tough loss at their place for them in
terms of a last-second shot. And I felt like some of our best basketball was
played when we played at our place.  
We have to understand as a team -- as a team we need maturity and focus,
regardless of what time you go to bed, regardless of the scenario, you come
ready to go.  
And hopefully we learned from this and hopefully we have another opportunity
in the NCAA tournament to reach our potential because we have new players
going through some things for the first time, and I know that every game is a
learning situation for us, so hopefully we will have that opportunity.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Allison Hightower and how difficult she was to guard
tonight?  
COACH FANNING: Hightower can go. I don't think I've seen in the women's game,
I haven't seen a prettier shot. They just float in, float in and go left. I
think she has tried to take a younger team that they have and really carry
them.  
There has been a lot of learning that's taken place, and that's taken patience
and determination on her part and she is an excellent leader for them. She
wants the ball to take it down the floor and in the half-court game to be able
to find the shot. She has helped them in many ways.  
You know when you finish with 23 points and you have a positive assist
turnover, offensive rebounds, you have played the amount of time she has, I
think that speaks highly for her endurance, for her focus, for her toughness.  
And it's definitely made a difference in their basketball team, they are
leadership. And, of course, her abilities.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about the start that you guys had tonight in terms of
the past three or four games, the first half hasn't been that strong as the
second half. Has there been a constant in the last three or four games that
has been a cause for the slow starts?  
ALEXIS RACK: We -- I feel that we came up short. Guess we just -- we just
didn't find a way to get out of the hole.  
ROBIN PORTER: We weren't focused. We need to focus and have intensity, and our
focus is just not there in the first half, we have to find it.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
COACH FANNING: I felt like last night when we started the game, from a focus
standpoint, we had the right energy. And as you look at how the team was
practicing, I've said this all year long, we have some depth to this team and
we have experience with this team.  
But some of the experience that we talked about in the beginning of the year
has been in and out due to injuries, or else not here at all because of
injuries. Some of the key players -- so, therefore, even with that, the depth
is a key to it.  
There are several new players that are doing a lot of things for the first
time. At least one, and I would say there is more, that didn't know there
would be four games this week until they were told, that's just a learning
process.  
So when the lights go on in a different way, there is a learning curve there.
We talked at the beginning of the season about toughness and focus and talked
about playing together, and the little things, communication that needs to
take place out there.  
The thing that I do believe is that our team is getting better. I think other
teams get better as well and this team is competitive -- this league is as
competitive as it's ever been, top to bottom.  
So hopefully the lessons that are learned, we'll continue to improve as well
and get this next opportunity and then we'll have that focus and better
performance. We have a week now to get ready to continue to get better as a
basketball team. And I'm really asking these returning players, two of these
young ladies sitting right here, that we want to step up.  
I think Robin played better today. She has not been playing as well, and I
don't know if that's been being tighter or whatever, but I think she -- I had
complimented her this last week relative to the warrior that she has been, and
what she has given and either she's got to relax to do it or I'm going to take
her out of the starting lineup. She stepped up, was confident, looking for
shots and making some things happen.  
Alexis last night, I thought she was a real key, being tough and not hitting
the points early, but in the second half the ability to defend as she did and
make things happen and show focus, and that's a sign of maturity and that's
what this team needs.  
They need the leadership out there to be able to make decisions quick and read
and react together. And hopefully we learn from this and we have a week to
improve next week and you'll see us in postseason play a better basketball
team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, ladies.

### [Amanda Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18040)

### [Marshae Dotson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16875)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Tennessee  71  
Florida - 67

  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Florida, Coach Amanda Butler, Marshae Dotson with 20
points, 6 rebounds, 5 steals. Sha Brooks had 22 points. Coach, if you will
start with opening comments?  
COACH BUTLER: Obviously we're disappointed in the way we played the first
half. Tennessee is exceptionally well coached, they're very talented, and you
can't put yourself in a position versing this team in a program -- with a
program like that, you can't put yourself in the position that we did in the
first half. And it's going to be miraculous to be able to come back from that,
but we weren't too far from miraculous because of our fight.  
I was very proud of our second half effort. I think we had opportunities, just
got to be okay with Tennessee in losing, a lot of people have, but that's not
this team. They battled and fought and weren't going to go down easily. And
obviously we won the second half but the ballgame is two halves.  
  
Q. Sha, you were obviously hurting in the first half after Kelley Cain fell
on you. Looked like something was wrong with your neck. Can you tell us what
the injury was and how much it did bother you?  
SHA BROOKS: She fell on my neck, and I just had to get over that. The coach
said we have a ballgame to play. I did kind of let it take me out of my game,
but I'm fine right now.  
  
Q. What was the difference from a Tennessee perspective in the way they
played tonight and the way they played against you in Gainsville?  
COACH BUTLER: Um, you know, they're a team and a coaching staff, that it
doesn't make any difference what the make-up is of the team, they're going to
continue to get better.  
And this is the time of the year that Tennessee seems to play their best
basketball, which is absolutely a credit to Pat and why she continues to reset
all the records she does.  
But Angie Bjorklund played a fantastic ballgame and did a great job leading
the team and coming off a night last night where she didn't score a point but
we knew that wasn't going to happen again.  
I don't think there was any one thing in particular, it's hard to look at it,
analyze the Tennessee perspective. We didn't play two halves of basketball
tonight, but when we were in Gainesville we did.  
  
Q. Sha said it bothered her, the injury, what do you think about that? Did
you think about maybe taking her out of the game completely in the first half
because she wasn't shooting the way she normally does?  
COACH BUTLER: There was no question that Sha was going to play in the ballgame
and that's not because of a decision that I made, but that's because how
competitive and tough Sha is.  
Our game was very physical tonight, and these two guys battled. Marshae seems
like she gets fouled on every single play. There is going to be bumps and
bruises and falling down and sometimes somebody lands on your head and
sometimes they land on your neck, and that's one of the things that makes
these two so special is they do get back up and keep fighting.  
I think Sha displayed tremendous toughness and she might have missed a few
shots but I don't think her neck had anything to do with it. I think Tennessee
defense might have a little bit to do with it as well, and I don't think
anybody on our team, certainly not our coaching staff, had any less confidence
in her because she got a little shook up in the ballgame.  
  
Q. Marshae, could you talk about defending Kelley Cain. It looks like her
presence inside, she draws so much attention it opened things up for Bjorklund
on the outside.  
MARSHAE DOTSON: We had to stay low on her, planning to play baseline on her to
help out with our guards, but I guess they kind of got held up in helping us
and get her some free shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

## March 6, 2009

  

### [Whitney Boddie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19281)

### [DeWanna Bonner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16847)

### [Nell Fortner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13860)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Auburn  71  
Ole Miss - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Auburn, who recorded a 71-65 win over the Ole
Miss Rebels, they advance to play the winner of Tennessee/Florida tomorrow
night in the semi finals.  
We're joined by Coach Nell Fortner, DeWanna Bonner had 32 points and 13
rebounds, a double-double. Whitney Boddie, 15 points, 7 rebounds. We'll begin
and ask for an opening comment and then we'll take your questions.  
NELL FORTNER: I'm just really -- you know, this is the first time that we've
played in the semi finals of the SEC tournament since we've been at Auburn.
I'm really proud of this team for having that opportunity.  
I thought today's game was a tremendous show of great passion and heart from
this team. There is no easy game in the SEC tournament, doesn't matter what
day you play on, what game it is, there is no easy game. Doesn't matter what
your seed is, there are always going to be close games.  
I think we saw a great example last night with Mississippi State and South
Carolina, there is no lead that's safe and you have to play hard for forty
minutes. I'm proud of the team for doing that.  
THE MODERATOR: I will mention DeWanna became the Auburn career scoring leader
in today's game with 32 points, so congratulations. Questions?  
  
Q. DeWanna, you were pretty hot a couple of times in the first half, you
were fouled a couple of times in the first half and you got up shaking your
arm, what happened there?  
DeWANNA BONNER: They were hard fouls, I bounced up, I missed my first couple
of free-throws, so I let it get to my head, but the second time I got up and
knocked 'em down.  
  
Q. Nell, can you talk about having the luxury of putting the ball in these
two's hands?  
NELL FORTNER: It is a luxury, there is no doubt about it, couple of
Lamborghinis right there. I have tremendous confidence in 'em.  
That's one of the neatest things, to walk into a gym and know you're going to
play a game and have such tremendous confidence in your team. These two
players have been with me, starting every game they've played at Auburn, so
the confidence and the trust that has been built between us is really a nice
thing to have in coaching.  
It's one of those unique, fun things in coaching. But they're big-time players
and big-time players make big-time plays, and they did that tonight.  
  
Q. For the players, first game, top seed, did you guys feel -- how much
responsibility did you feel on your shoulders? To kind of step up, especially
late in the game when they were making runs?  
DeWANNA BONNER: It was no pressure, I just feel like it was another SEC game.
It's tough, I mean, no matter if you are playing the 12 seed, anybody can be
beaten on any given day so we had no pressure.  
We just wanted to come out here and prove to -- Coach said, go out and prove
yourself that you are the Number 1 seed, so I think we played hard and played
hard for forty minutes.  
  
Q. Whitney, your thoughts?  
WHITNEY BODDIE: Like she said, no pressure. We wanted to come out and
establish ourselves. We're playing for a lot, a championship, and this game
was a good test and you're -- it's not really pressure, it's coming out and
taking care of business and you want to get tested. It prepares you for the
future.  
  
Q. For Nell or the players, talk about keeping Thomas from getting on track
today.  
NELL FORTNER: That was the plan. It was to absolutely smother her as best we
could, and I thought we did a nice job of it. She had 31 last night.  
She's a player that can change a whole game in about two minutes, so you
cannot let her get on track. The shots that she hit, one shot in the first
half and we made it a tough shot, at the free-throw, but she had some clean
looks in the second half, and we were just fortunate that she wasn't really
"hot" today like she was yesterday.  
She is a tremendous shooter, tremendous shooter and it really makes a huge
difference for their team. I thought our game plan was very good on her and I
thought it was executed well by the team.  
  
Q. Whitney, did you want to talk about the defensive game plan against
Bianca?  
WHITNEY BODDIE: I wasn't assigned to guarding her, but I did get switched out
to her in the zone a little bit. She is sneaky. You don't think she is going
to shoot it, but she kinda chills and boom, in your face. You have to play her
tight and you have to take your hat off to Sherell, she played her tight.  
  
Q. DeWanna, talk about your scoring.  
NELL FORTNER: It's a tremendous honor, to be able to be up there with the top
scorers, I'm excited, but I'm not focused on it, ready to play the next game
and keep adding to those points.  
  
Q. Whitney, can you talk about the last shot with 26 seconds left? It was
kind of your play.  
WHITNEY BODDIE: I don't remember, but --  
  
Q. You guys were up by 5, 20 seconds left.  
WHITNEY BODDIE: I was just trying to make a play, they were kind of pressuring
me and I was trying to make a play. It went in.  
  
Q. DeWanna, in the first half you had some scoring and rebounds, can you
talk about stepping it up defensively and rebounding?  
DeWANNA BONNER: That's something that we stressed every day in practice is
rebounding. When Reneisha went out, she brought in Chantel and I knew I had to
help her out. You don't know what to think when a team comes hard at you. A
team comes hard at you, you have to hit the boards and I rebounded to give us
some fast breaks.  
  
Q. Nell, y'all had a 6-point lead with 6:19 left, they cut it all the way to
three. Is there something that happened there during that time?  
NELL FORTNER: I think we got a little winded and we had a little difficulty
finishing things out really on both ends of the floor at that time point. I
mean, I really attributed it to that.  
I just think we were winded. But we just hung so tough and that was the neat
thing. I never thought -- you know, I hesitated on calling timeouts because I
have tremendous confidence in them. I know they know what to do. That's one of
the neat things about coaching this bunch right now.  
So they needed to catch their breath again, and I knew it would be okay, but
it was just a matter of letting them catch their breath. We hung tough. Bottom
line is we just really hung tough.  
  
Q. Nell, you talked about getting your bench involved before the tournament,
were you disappointed with the performance of the bench?  
NELL FORTNER: I'm not going to say I was disappointed. You know, we definitely
need great effort from our bench so I can rest my starters during the game. I
know that that will come.  
We're young on the bench, so we've got to -- at least they got their feet wet
today, but I'm not disappointed. I understand how the process works and it's a
big deal, you know, first time playing in the SEC tournament and I know
tomorrow will be better for them.  
  
Q. Nell, you had a discussion with the official after the hard fouls on
DeWanna. Is that your way of protecting her?  
NELL FORTNER: Wouldn't you protect her? I'm going to do that with any of my
players. I just really thought they were incredibly hard.  
There is hard fouls, there are times you're going to go in there and you're
going to foul, but that was two in a row. That was really what bothered me and
it was back-to-back, two times down the floor. That's pretty tough to watch as
a coach when your players are gettin' it like that. I was just trying to make
a point.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Tennessee  71  
Florida - 67

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Tennessee who recorded a 71-67 win over
Florida, they will meet Auburn tomorrow night in the semifinal at 5:30. We're
joined by head coach, Pat Summitt, Angie Bjorklund, who tied a season high
with six three-pointers, 25 points, four rebounds and Shekinna Stricklen 18
points and three rebounds. Coach?  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously we knew this was going to be a battle. Having played
them earlier in the season, we felt like we had to do a much better job of
getting paint points.  
And obviously in that game at Florida, we went to the free-throw line eight
times and they went 29 times. So that was, for me, looking at the tape, I
thought we've got to be a lot more aggressive, we've got to go inside more,
we've got to find a way to get to the free-throw line.  
And obviously tonight we got 14 out of 21. We shot the ball better when we got
there, but at least we put a lot of pressure on the defense. They did the same
to us at the other end of the floor with their dribble drives, and obviously
playing off the dribble as well as they did.  
Dotson and Brooks were terrific. Overall we played 'em tough, but they just
come at you so hard off the bounce and we were -- fortunately no one else
really went off on us in that situation. So this is a big win for our team.  
It obviously gives us a chance to play against Auburn, and they've been the
best team in the league pretty much every night, night in and night out, so a
real challenge for us. We'll get in cold whirl pools and then we'll go home
and hopefully get to bed and get some rest.  
  
Q. Coach, last night you talked about how you were concerned about the
players being laid back in terms of their approach to the first half and their
approach to Alabama. Tonight looking at the first half, was the -- second
half, was there a case of being laid back or was that just a good team coming
at you?  
COACH SUMMITT: No, I don't think we were laid back at the time. We may have
missed some defensive assignments and had some turnovers, but I think they
were focused and Angie and Shekinna did a great job with the guard play.  
I thought getting the ball inside was a tougher challenge for us. Obviously
Alex was 0 for 2, Kelley Cain is 4 for 4, but she needs a lot more touches and
Florida did a really good job of trying to take away our inside game. And we
had a lot better looks from the outside than we did from the paint.  
  
Q. Shekinna, I wondered if you'd been knocked down that many times in a
game, and can you go over your various injuries and how you feel after the
game?  
SHEKINNA STRICKLEN: I think every game I get knocked down and I just got to
stay tough and get back up. My body is sore, I'm hurting, and I'll get in the
whirl pool and get ready for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, Angie's performance tonight, game high 25 points, none last night,
talk about her effort.  
COACH SUMMITT: I don't know that we could have won without her playing at that
level. Obviously she moved much better without the basketball tonight.  
So much of having great guard play and great shooters like Angie and Shekinna
tonight, they got to constantly be working and trying to figure out how they
can come off a screen. And I thought tonight she was so much better in that
aspect of the game than last night.  
Low energy last night, I don't know why, just watching the tape, I don't know
why, I felt like she didn't have the same pep in her step that she did
tonight. I think this team was very focused and they wanted to win this game,
and that's why I think she played the way she played and she was a big-time
player tonight.  
  
Q. Angie, just to touch on what Pat said, your mind set, you can be a
prolific scorer, last night no points and coming out tonight?  
ANGIE BJORKLUND: You have to take it one day at a time. I couldn't let last
night's 0 for 7 affect tonight. And it's a new game, new day, and I just had
to work a lot harder to get open shots. And I thought our inside presence with
Kelley and Alyssia and Alicia opened things up for me on the outside.  
  
Q. Talk about what it was like in that second half to withstand the pressure
they were putting on you and the challenge that it presented.  
ANGIE BJORKLUND: They put a whole lot of pressure and, you know, we were
expecting that and our guards needed to do a better job of playing composed
under that pressure, and we'll probably see that in the future.  
And we can learn from that to set and use screens and gettin' open and, you
know, bringing the ball down the court, you know, against the pressure.  
  
Q. Coach, in Auburn you're facing a team that's veteran and the girls have
been together for a long time, opposite of what you face. What are the
qualities that you face and what does a team like that bring to the table in
terms of veterans that have been there before?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think when you play a veteran team, you're playing a team
that obviously they have a good feel for each other. They obviously -- I think
this Auburn team has great rhythm on offense, they defend well.  
You know, I think it's going to be a real challenge for us and we know that
just because they've got great inside/out and they can play off the bounce
really well.  
I haven't watched them that much because you're living one game to the next in
terms of video and trying to figure out your next opponent, what you want to
do. But certainly we'll start that and invest in our scouting from tonight on,
and we have to have a lot of composure against them because when you play a
veteran team, they're going to have composure and come after us.  
And we got to stand up and take care of the basketball and run what we want to
run, both offensively and defensively, and just play to our strengths.  
  
Q. Have any concern such a tough game tonight might have taken too much out
of you to come back and play one of the country's best teams tomorrow?  
COACH SUMMITT: Auburn played -- they played their starters a lot of minutes
and, yes, we've had two games, which obviously we've had to fight in both of
'em.  
But I think now it's more of what's in your head and your heart, you know?
You've got to be mentally strong and not give in, and you've got to have the
heart and desire to go play every possession.  
Playing them, if we could get a win, it would be great for this young team and
that would mean that obviously we would move toward a championship. There is a
lot invested for Auburn, there is a lot for Tennessee.  
All we're going to do is come in and hopefully we're going to play hard and
we're going to play, you know, with a great competitive desire.  
  
Q. Pat, a follow-up on injuries, Kelley seemed to be limping more noticeably
tonight than she has in a while. What do you think her condition might be for
tomorrow, any idea?  
COACH SUMMITT: I don't know. But I would anticipate Kelley will be ready to
play. Tonight she could been in longer, but I took her out and I wanted to go
with a little bit more mobility in our defense in the paint. But she was good
to go if I needed her.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you, ladies.

### [Van Chancellor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18047)

### [Allison Hightower](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19291)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

LSU  63  
Mississippi State - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by LSU, have a brief statement on the sophomore
guard Latear Eason was taken to Baptist Spring Hill Hospital for x-rays
following a collision at the 5:33 mark. In the first half, she stated she had
severe neck pain, but no loss of body movement. We are awaiting the results of
the x-rays at this time.  
We're joined by LSU head coach Van Chancellor, Allison Hightower, and LaSondra
Barrett. Coach?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought tonight it was a crazy win for us. This was a
difficult match-up for us. They're long, they're lean, they do a lot of things
and they already beat us twice. And we lose Eason, and our kids jumped in
there, we found a way to win.  
I can't say enough for Hightower, I don't think there is any kid that has done
for her team than Allison Hightower.  
Any questions? I'm spent, staying up till 11:00 is hard on an old man.  
  
Q. There were nightmares --  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Yeah, nightmares of the game in Baton Rouge when she made
it, and I told 'em not to back up off of her. When she got to the free-throw
line, I felt good about her.  
She has been a 75% free-throw shooter, she is a freshman, but I thought if she
made the first one, she would make the second, and we went up five. I thought
that Hightower and I could squeeze it out then.  
  
Q. You talked on the teleconference earlier this week about Allison and her
stepping up. It really looked like she put the team on her back and carried
you guys to the next round tonight. Talk about what she did.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: When your coach calls every play at the end of the game for
you, you ought to carry it on your back. No, I'm kidin' you. She got the ball,
we screamed for her, they just didn't have an answer for her.  
She played unbelievably well tonight. I thought in the first half she came in
here and wanted it so bad, she tried too hard. She got in foul trouble and
that was a blessing in disguise.  
We held on for a while and that allowed us to rest her, and she was 10 for 17,
three rebounds. She is the real thing. If we were advertising Coca-Cola,
Allison Hightower was Coca-Cola.  
  
Q. Allison, a comment on your victory?  
ALLISON HIGHTOWER: We got the victory, we have to play well against Vandy
tomorrow night and get ready for them.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: That's about as much as she has said all year, quiet girl.  
  
Q. LaSondra, what are you going to do for the semifinals?  
LaSONDRA BARRETT: Prepare and rest and do what we need to win, do what the
coaches tell us.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Is that about it tonight?  
  
Q. I'm going to ask you about Mississippi State. Do you think they're a
tournament team?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: There is no doubt in my mind they're an NCAA tournament
team. I tell you how to successfully diet, if it tastes good, spit it out.  
And let me tell you about the NCAA, throw all the resumes out, and say who do
I not want to play in the NCAA playoffs, I'm telling you right now the
Mississippi State Lady Bull Dogs, I've had enough, I don't want to play them
for another year.  
Yes, they're one of the 33 best teams out there. And I don't do this -- I
didn't do this when I was on TV, I don't spout for the SEC unless I believe in
it, I'm not going to tell you something just to say it. I think Mississippi
State won a game last night, played a team that I hope is hanging tough, but I
think we're pretty hot right now. That's the problem -- oh, forget it, I'm
just glad we won. Thank you very much. Let's go, women.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Vanderbilt  69  
Georgia - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Vanderbilt, who was a 69-61 winner over
Georgia. They advance to tomorrow night's game against the winner of
Mississippi State and LSU.  
We're joined by head coach Melanie Balcomb, along with Jennifer Risper and
Christina Wirth. Christina Wirth had 23 points and 7 rebounds. Jennifer had 11
points and 7 rebounds. This is the 14th time Christina Wirth has led her team
in scoring. Coach?  
COACH BALCOMB: I feel really good about our effort tonight, and I felt really
good about the way we came out ready to play. They cut me off and started
running out the door, which is always a good sign because I like to talk.  
I didn't have to motivate 'em, they were ready to play. They came out, ran
out, and I thought that was huge. The lead we got, and then the rest of the
game there were times we started playing not to lose, and then they turned it
right back up where they needed to be.  
I thought we made great adjustments. As the game went on, they were extremely
coachable and loved the intensity for forty minutes.  
  
Q. Coach, did you realize that your team set an SEC tournament record for
the fewest turnovers in a game?  
COACH BALCOMB: No, but, hey! We were a little excited about our assist to
turnover ratio in the locker room, but we did not know it was a record. Thank
you, Carol.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the high level of play that you guys showed the entire
game? For anybody.  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: Like Coach said, we came out firing on all cylinders, making
stops. We came ready to play today. Obviously Georgia is a great team and it
wasn't an easy game, but we're having to learn to play a different lineup
without Hannah. And people are playing hard because what Hannah brought was
rebounding and hustle and all those things.  
So I think we're having to raise the level of our game because we want to make
up for her because she is a great player and teammate. I was proud of our
efforts. As Coach said, we played hard.  
  
Q. Jennifer, your thoughts?  
JENNIFER RISPER: I guess I agree with Coach and Tina, I was like, what?  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: She is really smart --  
JENNIFER RISPER: I am. It's hard to play a team three times in a row in a
season. You kinda get used to the players you're playing against, but I think
we knew the personnel and who we were playing and who we had to stop.  
We had a hard time stopping Angel, obviously she did an awesome job at 29
points, but like Tina said, we stuck together, played hard, pretty positive
today.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the defensive plan you had for Ashley Houts?
Looked like you fronted her a lot, kept the ball out of her hands. She didn't
score until two minutes left in the game.  
COACH BALCOMB: I think Ashley is a tremendous player. I think she brings so
much to that team. One of the things she does is runs the show. She controls
the tempo, controls how they run the thing.  
I know from working on offense with our team a lot, you want to be in a flow.
So what we wanted to do was not just take out Ashley Houts, we knew we
couldn't guard the size inside, we had to take them out of their flow. And if
you disrupt Ashley Houts, then you disrupt Georgia. That was really what the
goal was and the plan was.  
  
Q. Coach, you got outrebounded, but it looks like you got to a lot of key
loose balls and the rebounds were deceptive.  
COACH BALCOMB: I looked at that and I was surprised. I thought we outrebounded
them and we didn't. We wanted hustle plays and when you got -- you have to
decide how you look at things.  
If you want to be taken -- you want to be the victim and say, oh, they're big
and they're going to jump over us, or you want to be quicker and get
underneath and keep your feet moving, they can be an advantage.  
Right now that's our advantage, we're going to run around and hustle and we
made some huge hustle plays. Especially, I remember one play in the second
half where Tina and Ris got a hustle play and kicked to Meredith and she got a
wide-open three. They made a few of those plays.  
We know each other so well, sometimes those are the best times to get these
3-point shots, and that gave us looks we wouldn't have had in the offense.  
  
Q. Players, Coach mentioned in the opening statement that you were playing
not to lose in the second half. You had the lead the entire second half, a
couple times they got within 1. Did you step up in intensity when they got
within 1? Both times you came back with a basket the next possession. Did you
sense that and raise your level of play?  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: I definitely think we raised the level of our intensity.
Coach told us not to have that mentality, play to lose. Right away we came
down, and like Coach said, we dished to Meredith and she hit a big shot and we
came down and got another stop, so we definitely raised our level of intensity
in the last minute.  
JENNIFER RISPER: I think that -- we got back to what got us here in the first
place, and that was attacking. When they started attacking, we started getting
passive and passing up things or settling for outside shots.  
We didn't pen -- we, in the first half, penetrated well and we got those good
shots, and we have had in situations like this, and it's always a learning
experience. So when we are in situations like this, we use that experience.
And I think it's like you said, when they did come back, we just came back.  
  
Q. Coach, without Hannah in the lineup, how have things changed and are
there different players with different responsibilities now, or are you trying
to keep doing the things you were doing?  
COACH BALCOMB: The biggest change is Jen is now the smallest post player in
the country now, permanently. What is needed -- when Hannah went out, we
worked on a small guard lineup where we could work with a small guard lineup
and take the dribble and go inside out, because we didn't have the height to
begin with, and Hannah was an undersized post player.  
Now the difference is we have the same look and we need to get better at that
second look. I think we've worked really hard on it. I can't thank enough
players, we have Ashley Bridge working in the post all, kinds of players doing
different things for the team.  
Tia Gibbs has stepped up a great deal. Now that Jen Risper goes into the post,
now you need a guard to step up and give us good minutes.  
Tia jumps in there and fills that spot. And when a door closes on a player
that you don't want to close on them, that door opens up for another player.
And we have people willing to go in there and do everything we need them to do
and being unselfish about doing it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2009

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [La'Keisha Sutton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19265)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Mississippi State  49  
South Carolina - 39

  
THE MODERATOR: Now joined by South Carolina, Coach Dawn Staley and Lakeisha
Sutton, she had 9 points and 5 assists in tonight's game. We will open it up
for questions.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about how nice I guess it was to start out with the
18-0 lead, and at that point did you tell your team anything? You know, just
continue on or what?  
COACH STALEY: Yeah, yeah, at that point we were hitting shots, and obviously
we wanted to open up as big of a lead as possible, because we knew we couldn't
shoot that way the entire game. We knew they weren't going to shoot that way
the entire game.  
You just have to ride it until it stops. We knew it stopped, just didn't think
it would come that abruptly.  
  
Q. Was it something that Mississippi State did on defense? Or was it just
something else?  
COACH STALEY: No, I mean, I think for the most part we struggled to score the
basketball. To come out and score 18 points in the first 12 minutes, 8 minutes
of the game, that was kind of a foreign thing for us.  
For us, we had people scoring that didn't score all night for us that scored
throughout the year, and you want that, because I wanted us to share the ball
and we wanted people to shoot open shots and we got on a roll.  
Mississippi State were missing easy shots and we knew they would have some
kind of a run at us, we just didn't have enough bodies to sustain, and
rebounding the basketball. We lost the game off rebounds, to be quite honest.  
  
Q. Lakeisha, talk about the second half, the shots weren't falling, talk
about when they started hitting shots.  
LAKEISHA SUTTON: The second half our shots weren't falling, but we kept
shooting, trying to get the ball to the shooters and we kept trying to get the
ball in but it wasn't falling.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

## March 5, 2009

  

### [Matthew Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18056)

### [Eleia Roddy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19259)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Georgia  82  
Kentucky - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Eleia Roddy.  
COACH MITCHELL: I want to say the girls played an awfully good game, played
extremely hard, played offensively, particularly the second half. They play
like that, I think they have a great chance to go deep in this tournament.
They did a good job today.  
Very disappointed in this game, we came down here with the intention of
winning this tournament. Our team practiced hard and worked hard to prepare
for the game and fought hard in the first half. I was proud of that.  
And we were able to get a 9-point lead, and then it just unraveled on us. So
that was certainly disappointing, but we will try to regroup and if there is
more basketball to play for us, we will take this game, try to learn from it
and try to improve upon it.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned that things unraveled, what did they do or what did
you guys stop doing?  
COACH MITCHELL: I thought we stopped guarding dribble penetration. I thought
they really started taking it to the basket on us.  
Even when we built the 9-point lead, I thought we were playing very good
offense, but I was concerned, I thought they were scoring a little bit too
easily in the second half. I just thought that their guards really turned it
on.  
I thought Christy Marshall was able to make a big difference in this game and
made fantastic, fantastic plays.  
  
Q. Coach, they were making their shots right and left in the second half,
was that frustrating?  
ELEIA RODDY: It was very frustrating, but I give 'em credit. You feel like
you're playing hard and they just hit shots every time, it's frustrating. When
a team is hot there is not much you can do about it but just keep trying to go
at 'em.  
  
Q. Eleia, can you talk about how you felt going into the locker room? Were
you feeling confident at that point?  
ELEIA RODDY: We were feeling very confident, and we wanted to take the
momentum into the second half, and I think that's what we did. We had the
momentum in the second half and we wanted to nail the hammer on them and pull
away. That was our attitude.  
  
Q. You guys did come out and scored the first four or five possessions in
the second half, did you feel it was a continuation of the way you ended the
first half?  
COACH MITCHELL: I was very pleased with the way we ended the first half
because I didn't think we played our best basketball, but I did think we were
working really hard and fighting really hard and able to make some hustle
plays.  
I felt really good going into halftime because I felt we could make a couple
of adjustments and cash in some momentum. So when we came out with a hot
start, I was feeling good about our team, and then it's just -- inexplicably
they had a drop in energy level and defensively was the most curious thing as
a coach, that's been our hallmark all year, that's been our side of our team.  
That's probably the most productive defensive team that we've been able to
have at Kentucky this year, and for them to put on that kind of a performance
is certainly a testament to how good they are, but I just thought we didn't
play anywhere close to the kind of defense we needed to play and that we have
been playing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

## March 5, 2009

  

### [Wendell Hudson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19262)

### [Ericka Russell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19263)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Tennessee  68  
Alabama - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: Continuing with the University of Alabama, we have Coach
Wendell Hudson, Varisia Raffington. Varisia scored 11 points, Ericka 18 points
and 4 rebounds. Coach?  
COACH HUDSON: I thought both teams played offensively hard. The difference in
the basketball game of course was baskets in the paint.  
Tennessee did a great job in the second half getting the ball up on the rim
and we did not do a very good job in the second half of keeping them off the
boards, but I thought they played awfully hard, as they normally would do, and
we didn't have great offense.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the first half, played Tennessee very tough, and your
thoughts going into the locker room. In the second half what you thought the
difference was down the stretch.  
COACH HUDSON: In the first half I thought one of the difference was we made
shots, in the first half, and I think that always gives you a chance to win a
basketball game.  
Second half we talked about it at halftime, about coming out and we needed to
come out strong. And we came out with a good effort, but we didn't make the
shots, had some good looks, but didn't make the shots. And Tennessee was on a
roll, and once they started making shots, it was the difference in the
basketball game.  
  
Q. In the second half, Coach, they extended their defense and they're so
long, is that what takes away from the parameter? You guys shot 21% in the
second half from the three. Talk about their length outside.  
COACH HUDSON: Of course, they're -- with the perimeter play that they have out
there, they're long and lean, 6-2, 6-3, makes a big difference in shooting the
basketball. That affected us some.  
And we got the ball in the paint, and they're long and lean inside and they're
long and lean everywhere, so it makes a difference. It's what you get used to
in practice every day and get used to shooting over. That doesn't take
anything away from the shooting of Tennessee.  
  
Q. You guys came out in the second half and had a lead, talk about how
excited and up you guys were about that.  
ERICKA RUSSELL: We were excited, we played with energy and intensity in the
first half. We had nothing to lose and we wanted to come out and play hard.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the season and where you guys go from here, as far as
the off season, what you've learned that year.  
COACH HUDSON: Learned you got to make baskets, especially at the right time.
No, I already knew that.  
I think what this team did that year and what we wanted to accomplish this
year was to play hard, learn how to play hard and do it on both ends of the
court. I think our effort was good at times as far as playing hard. Now we got
to make plays.  
Good players make plays and good players make all of us coaches better coaches
and that's the difference. There were times when Tennessee might not have made
exactly the right play, but they had a playmaker step up and make a play and
that's what we got to learn how to do and make plays and help these young
ladies from the standpoint of recruiting, get some other playmakers in here to
help them play.  
  
Q. Talk about the season, you guys were losing games, but it seems like you
were playing with effort. How hard was it to keep up the intensity every
day?  
ERICKA RUSSELL: It gets hard, we kept encouraging each other, nobody likes to
lose. We went into every game with a different attitude, playing positive,
thinking that we can take this one and we were just taking it one game at a
time.  
We have to get to the point where we can finish the game. Once we get there, I
think that we'll be a definite SEC contender when it comes down to it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you all.

## March 5, 2009

  

### [Ashley Houts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18037)

### [Andy Landers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13868)

### [Angel Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18059)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Georgia  82  
Kentucky - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Georgia, victory over Kentucky 62-84,
joined by Ashley Houts and Angel Robinson.  
Double double, 10 rebounds, 12 points, we'll ask Coach Landers for an opening
comment.  
COACH LANDERS: I'm just proud of our team. I thought we did some things very,
very well. I also think that we didn't do some things very well at all. I'm
proud of 'em because they fought through and overcame the things that we
weren't doing particularly well.  
I'm particularly proud that we were down and fought back strong, quick and
hard. We made a run that was fueled by good defensive play and good offensive
play, we made stops, we took the ball down the floor, cashed 'em in and went
down 6 or 7 but we weren't there very long.  
We made the stops and forced turnovers and we got the ball and were able to
make some offensive plays and then we just kept going, built on it. I think
that one of the things we're starting to learn is that we can play much better
tired or when they think they're tired, but they believed more than they
believed that they could during the regular season. We finished some games
very well.  
  
Q. Early in the second half, Ashley it looked like you hit your head at one
point and went down, so if you could describe what happened there. And Coach,
you said she hasn't come out of a game in a while, were you concerned there?  
COACH LANDERS: No, because she got hit in the head. If it had been her leg or
ankle or shoulder, I would have been concerned, but when I seen her rubbing
her head, I thought we would be okay.  
  
Q. Ashley?  
ASHLEY HOUTS: It was a very physical game and if I can recall correctly, I
think I just took an elbow from Christy Marshall, who pulled a board, and she
came down and hit me in the head, but it's part of the game and you just have
to go with it.  
  
Q. Coach, when Kentucky made that run in the first half, you seemed
frustrated and they took the lead there at the half. Talk about what you
talked to the team about at halftime and how you came out the second half.  
COACH LANDERS: What I talked to the team about and what was frustrating was
how we put 'em on the free-throw line, a third of their points they had at the
free-throw line. They had 12 rebounds, offensive rebounds by halftime.  
The very things that we didn't want to do or some of the very things, and
things that were important that we didn't want to do, we had 13 turnovers.
Then we shot the ball 52%. But we turned it over enough and we were giving
them second opportunities enough, or they earned second opportunities enough
to stay in the game and that was the frustrating piece.  
Seemed like there was a second part of the question. The second half --  
  
Q. What you did to come back off the frustrating first half.  
COACH LANDERS: I sat down for about the first 5 minutes of the second half
because we started the second half, you know, we looked like Mo, Larry and
Curly. They scored the first shot off the offensive set that we practiced and
we didn't even know where to find anyone.  
Then we come down and turn the ball over and they go in and lay it up. It was
-- you know, it was kinda horrible sitting there watching it. So I just sat
down. It was kind of offensively, we let it run through our system and waiting
for a time-out to see what they wanted to do about it.  
  
Q. Ashley, you guys have gone through adversity this season. Did those
experiences help when you guys were going through the first half and the
beginning of the second that you could fight back?  
ASHLEY HOUTS: Yeah, definitely I think that we've had a lot of ups and downs.
And here in the past few games we've really been able to play hard and had
hustle plays and, you know, just everybody playing hard.  
That's when you have the best time and that's when you do good things, when
you're out there playing hard together. I think that has prepared us for times
when we think we're tired or we think -- things aren't going our way and we
fight back, and that's something that has built our confidence.  
  
Q. Angel, you were 6 for 7, and the team as a whole shot 64%, only one
player didn't shoot 50%, and I won't mention her name right now. Just talk
about how you guys shot today and what do you account for the 55% shooting?  
ANGEL ROBINSON: I'm trying to get my mind around this, I'm excited about
winning the game. I'm sorry about the question, I'm just -- that huge turn-
around that we had in the game, it was totally amazing because I looked up at
the scoreboard, and it's to the point now where you've got to play hard or get
off the floor.  
I was thinking, I don't want to end up falling short no more, taking it game
by game, we have Vandy tomorrow and I'm just...  
  
Q. Angel, Coach said that you guys are learning to play better when you're
tired. Do you see that as well?  
ANGEL ROBINSON: Yeah, you play better when you're tired. If you're too
energetic, you probably make a mistake and you have second thoughts about what
you're going to do.  
I think we put the ball -- we didn't think about being tired at all. We can't
afford that. Can't afford to let that happen. Other teams, they are going to
see it and they are going to try to outrun us or outplay us and we're not
going to let that happen.  
  
Q. What about your NCAA tournament hopes? Now that you've won, where do you
think you stand?  
COACH LANDERS: I think we've got another wonderful opportunity tomorrow with
Vandy. I don't think it is important for us to evaluate it on a minute-by-
minute basis.  
I think what's important is, really, we're in the SEC tournament and trust me,
I know, our team can't think about vanilla and chocolate, you know, two
choices, so we don't want 'em thinking about the NCAA.  
This is where we are and this is a big deal and this is a wonderful
opportunity and that's all they need to be concerned about. We play a team
tomorrow night that we split with, we played 'em very well at our place and
they played us very well at their place.  
We played 'em very well, I thought had a reasonably good chance to win the
game in Nashville and here we go again. If we can win that, then we get to
hang around and play a third day. When we're playing good, we're having fun.  
Now everything that happened out there tonight wasn't a whole lot of fun for
me, and I'm sure it wasn't for them because I tend to share what's not fun for
me, I tend to share it with them. We want to do as much winning as we can do
right here, right now.  
  
Q. Ashley, you did come out for a minute, what was that all about?  
COACH LANDERS: Can I answer?  
  
Q. Sure.  
COACH LANDERS: I made a bad decision. I went soft for about 30 seconds. And I
don't do that very much. The reason I took her out was obviously, you know,
going to play tomorrow, give her rest, but the reason I put her right back in
is I didn't think through that decision. I let my heart get in the way of my
brain.  
Once I looked out there and realized I had taken her out of the press and foul
situation, she's easily the most confident free-throw shooter that we have.
And in that kind of a situation, all of a sudden I put a freshman out there in
her place, I didn't want to do that to the freshman and I didn't want to do
that to our basketball team.  
  
Q. I think the team shot 73% in the second half, they all weren't layups,
that's an awfully good shooting percentage. And then you talk about getting
tired, but it seems like you still shot well.  
COACH LANDERS: Our kids executed very, very well. First, there's three pieces
to this. One, they made plays. And that's something that coaching doesn't have
a whole lot to do with. They knocked balls down on the defensive end, those
are players making plays.  
And they made plays, and that's when we -- what we weren't doing earlier, we
were not making plays. The offense was not working, and I think what the
players have to understand is that the offense doesn't work if the players
don't work.  
So the second thing that happened, we executed, players make plays, teams run
plays. We execute very well as a team and we ran our stuff very well as a
team. And the end result in that was Puleo got shots that she shoots, Christy
got shoots that Christy shoots.  
And the bottom line is everybody is getting shots out of our offense and
they're all on today, so the percentage is really, really good.  
  
Q. Coach, you had four players in double figures, but Meredith seemed to
give you guys a spark.  
COACH LANDERS: She sure did. Heck, it's been a long-time coming. That 'ol
rookie, we needed her tonight. I just felt like, you know, her help
defensively with Pooh, who was getting fingers on balls on top of this all,
Pooh was getting her fingers on the ball and Meredith kinda got the press.  
She and Ashley got the press jump started and Christy kicked in, and all of
the sudden we turned it around with the press. Then she made two very nice
drives and a great choice to shoot a three. She was really very good, very
good. So I thought her play right there defensively and offensively was
instrumental in changing the momentum of the game.  
But you know, I gotta tell you, because it wasn't something that everybody on
our team did. Puleo probably got more deflections than anybody. She did a nice
job today. That's something that we need for everybody to do a better job of.  
There she is with four steals. That's -- and she didn't press the first half.
She didn't get shots the first half. She got some opportunities the second
half and cashed 'em in, so it was a good day for her, too.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, thank you, ladies. Congratulations.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Mississippi State  49  
South Carolina - 39

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Mississippi State, they won 49-39 over South
Carolina, will play LSU tomorrow night in the quarter final round.  
We're joined by Coach Fanning, Alexis Rack and Tysheka Grimes. Coach?  
COACH FANNING: We dug a hole but we kept digging to get out of it. Initially I
was concerned about our energy and our focus relative to execution, in terms
of guarding, penetration and Black-outs, taking care of the basketball. And
our shot selection.  
Very aggressively we got to them in one of our early time-outs and then we
felt like we were playing better together and shots didn't fall. And at that
point we said keep taking good shots, they will fall, but defensively that's
how you have to get back in. We got some energy and once that first shot went
down, we were on our way.  
Halftime we had offensive rebounds and we ended up outrebounding them. I'm
concerned about the turnovers we had, because some of those were mistakes we
did to ourselves. You have to take care of the basketball. We found a way to
win, we have one game under our belt in terms of jitters.  
And you have a lot of players on the team that this is their first experience
in an SEC tournament, and hopefully we learned from it, better learn, better
learn, understand the execution, the importance of teamwork. The second half
we said we felt like what could break -- really a lot of things, but just to
get the ball in the paint. You have to defend and get the rebounds in order to
run and get transition buckets.  
We need to get the ball in the paint, get to the free-throw line, we need to
make 'em, but we did get there enough and made enough to come away with a big
win so I'm very, very proud of that effort.  
  
Q. When South Carolina opened on that 18-0 run, what was going through your
head? Was it like a nightmare? What was it like going through that?  
ALEXIS RACK: Just getting the stop and getting points up there. We were
focussing on three stops. Clearly we didn't get enough stops, but as soon as
we got the stop, we started focussing on the offensive and got our momentum
going.  
TYSHEKA GRIMES: We just had to work hard, very hard to get our rhythm going
and we just had to work hard on defense. Once our shots started falling then,
you know -- our defense was there, then our shots started falling so they went
hand-in-hand.  
  
Q. Alexis, when Coach was talking about turnovers, what do you guys need to
do to correct that?  
ALEXIS RACK: Be smarter with the ball and more focused than we came in today,
and just find the open, man. Don't hold the ball too long, just relax. I think
we need to be stronger with the ball.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys are 2-0 against LSU, you guys are playing LSU tomorrow
night, what's it feel like going into the game tomorrow night?  
COACH FANNING: After you've beaten a team, then hopefully you understand --
the first game with them from both standpoints was like us in the first half
as far as not scoring and it was a defensive battle. But it's a new season. We
found a way to win at their place. At our place we did better with execution,
but they've grown as a team and we've grown as a team.  
Right now what we have to do is take the lessons that we've learned, and
regardless of whether it's LSU, regardless of how many times you've played
'em, whether you've won or lost the game, you have to play your best
basketball at this time of the year. You have to outwork your opponent, you
have to have energy and focus and you want to have fun so you have to relax.
And you have to play the game hard.  
With us, trying to be composed and trying to make better decisions with the
basketball, correct some of these statistics, so as I've said, it's more
inwardly, what do we do and how can we do that better.  
Regardless of your opponent, you have to adjust to what they do offensively
and defensively, but I think it's a whole new season right now. Hopefully the
success we've had this whole season carries over to tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you do on defense? You held Carolina in the second half,
what switch do you make?  
COACH FANNING: We switched man-to-man match-up, and we tried to switch up,
some. I thought we played harder on the basketball.  
There were a couple of possessions where they got the ball to the rim, but for
the most part, we contested shots better, blocked shots, rebounded the ball
better, did a better job containing them and didn't let 'em get to the free-
throw line quite as much.  
They do a great job getting the ball to the rim, so we tried to switch
defenses. And where they popped and overloaded, we had to match that, and I
felt like our team played really hard and played better together.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you tell your players when it's 18-nothing,
psychologically, tell 'em not to look at the scoreboard and just play?  
COACH FANNING: The first time we weren't guarding hard. You see a team getting
layups, and we're not defending, this is on the ball, off the ball, period.  
We tried to make that point relative to playing -- whether it was man, no
matter what we had to guard. After we got past that point, it seemed like they
had regrouped and were playing better defensively -- we were playing better
defensively. We had some stops, we had things that didn't go in, great looks,
initially we weren't setting good screens, but you have to give credit to
South Carolina and they played awfully hard. They changed their defense,
they're good athletes, they're quick, so we just didn't get it done, period.  
But I felt like as we got going and gained confidence after one or two buckets
and then was able to get a run going in the first half and made it a ballgame,
I felt like we were relaxed, focused and had the confidence that we needed to
play a lot better in the second half.  
I thought Alexis stepped up in the second half, maintained composure, she
hadn't scored by halftime as much and didn't have the looks, but I thought
they showed patience and maturity and I thought we showed toughness.  
Ty came off the bench early on and she wasn't under control. She went back in
the basketball game, her toughness was apparent and her control was better.
Whether it was defense, rebounding, big buckets, getting to the free-throw
line, these two young ladies did that.  
In the second half, teammates fed off of that, Chanel gets a couple of blocks,
we got transition buckets, this team is going to be good when it's a team,
when it's everybody. It's not going to be one person, and we have to be able
to see -- like Alexis said, you have to be seeing the open people and attack
it, and I thought we did a much better job the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: I know it's late, thank you, ladies, for joining us.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Ole Miss  65  
Arkansas - 60

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Tom Collen and Ceira Rickets, who recorded her
fourth double-double, Whitney Jones her fifth double-double.  
Coach?  
COACH COLLEN: I think it's hard. We're extremely disappointed on a couple of
fronts. We're disappointed that we -- I know a lot of people in Little Rock
and in the state of Arkansas put forth a great deal of effort to host this
tournament down here three times, and at some point in time we would really
like to be able to reward them.  
We hope we get another opportunity, but we would like to really be able to
reward them with a first round win and try to advance and drive interest in
Arkansas women's basketball and give back to that community.  
So first of all, I want to make sure that all of those people out there, and
there are many, many people, I want to make sure they know we really, really
appreciate everything they've done to bring this tournament here, and we feel
like to some degree we let them down a little bit. That's kind of painful.  
It's painful to lose. You know, I want to try to look at it from an optimistic
perspective, since I've only been at Arkansas for two years. I can tell you
we've made a lot of progress since last year. Went from the 11th seed to the
8th seed. Going from a game, really, we got blown out last year in the first
round to a game where we competed right down to the wire. Clearly there has
been a lot of progress. We understand that and we know that, but the bottom
line is losing is painful.  
It's just as painful this year as it was last year. At some point in time
we've got to understand that we don't want to experience that pain. That's
what you got to do to grow a program. We're going to keep working hard, grow
the program.  
I thought our effort was good tonight. I feel like these two young ladies
sitting here, one on her way out, one that just arrived, I think they played
their hearts out. I think for the most part I'm not satisfied with our kids'
effort. I think we failed to execute throughout the course of the game and it
cost us the game, and that's frustrating from a coach's perspective.  
But we're going back to the drawing board and we're going to keep working hard
and this program is going to be rebuilt, and rebuilt the right way. And
hopefully we will have an opportunity to come down here to Alltell again and
we will get an opportunity to win a championship here. We just need the fans
to stick with us.  
  
Q. Tom, you had plenty of chances there at the end, but a lot of turnovers
down the stretch really hurt ya.  
COACH COLLEN: I think we clearly got into a rush. You know, I heard -- and I
repeated this to my team, Geno Auriemma made a comment during his last game
with Rutgers, I have one of the best teams in the country.  
Their greatest strength is they can come down and make a pass and score
quickly on almost every possession. It's one of the greatest strengths of this
team. And one of the greatest weaknesses is they think they can come down and
make a pass and score every possession.  
I think that's true of us right now. When we're in a rhythm, a good tempo, I
think we can come down and make plays, but I really believe that sometimes we
come down and rush just a little bit and we try to make plays without slowing
down and executing.  
And I agree, I think there were two or three times when we had some momentum
going our way, we got some stops, they missed some free-throws and we came
down and we rushed. We'll get better at that. A lot of people that made those
passes are young kids who were just trying to make things happen.  
So the good news is they're young kids that want to make plays. The bad news
is they have to slow down a little bit and learn to get into a rhythm and
learn how important every possession is when you get into a game like this.  
  
Q. It just seemed like you guys could never get all five on the court on the
same page at the same time. Did it feel that way to you guys? I guess just how
frustrating was that if that was the case? Ceira?  
CEIRA RICKETTS: Yeah, it was frustrating that we couldn't get all the players
on the same page at once, but I think we tried hard to do that, you know. It's
going to take us time to get all of our players to work as a team on defense
as well as offense.  
WHITNEY JONES: I felt like we weren't on the same page. When we are on the
same page, we are a good team. Defensively we weren't communicating that well
all the time and that played a big part in it.  
  
Q. What did you guys think about the atmosphere?  
COACH COLLEN: I thought the atmosphere was terrific. I think that crowd so
badly wanted to stand up and cheer over a period of time, you know, and we
gave them moments when they stepped up.  
I think they were difference-makers, and they could have been, but we didn't
give 'em enough moments. I don't know what it's like in the first round game.
I think it was a tough time for us to draw a big crowd at noon, people are at
work, kids are in school.  
We're in the middle of the boys' and girls' high school state tournament. I
think to get the crowd that we got this first round, and I don't know how it
compares, but I thought the crowd was terrific, I was very happy with it.  
  
Q. Ceira?  
CEIRA RICKETTS: I thought the crowd was good, I like playing in front of big
crowds, not used to having a big crowd on my high school team, but I thought
it was a nice crowd. I enjoyed playing in front of them.  
WHITNEY JONES: I felt like we had a good crowd, we had a lot of support. The
fans stayed with us whether we made good plays or bad plays.  
  
Q. Ole Miss' Bianca Thomas is dangerous in spurts, and Whitney and Bianca
were going back and forth. Can you talk about going back and forth with that
and the tempo that was set?  
COACH COLLEN: Well, Bianca obviously had a great night, you know? She had a
bad shooting night when we played her up in Fayetteville, we gave her a shot
and she couldn't hit.  
Tonight she made some shots when we were right there contesting her and she
made open shots. But it wasn't any one person probably that gave up all her
shots. We spent a lot of time switching screens. So it seemed like four or
five times we were there ready to guard her and she shot it in our face, but
we were spaced a couple of feet away from her.  
I think collectively we understood that we were supposed to guard her tight,
but I think it was four or five different players that in the moment got
switched out on her and thought they were there where they were supposed to
be, and she buried the shot in our face. To her credit the kid scored 31
points, and she wasn't wide open on everything.  
I thought she did a great job. Clearly our breakdown was when we did have
different people matched up on her, we didn't get on her tight enough so she
could step up and shoot the three.  
  
Q. And Whitney, the second half?  
WHITNEY JONES: Bianca is a good player. She made the big plays at the right
time. I tried to step up for my team and make the big plays, also.  
  
Q. Whitney, I know it would have meant a lot for you to get the win. How
frustrating was it to come so close and not be able to get a win?  
WHITNEY JONES: Very frustrating, I felt like we prepared really good for them
during practice throughout the week. I thought we were going to win it. I
think we all believed we could win it, but they made their plays and we didn't
get the win.  
  
Q. Whitney, I guess NIT is a possibility if you guys want to keep playing?  
WHITNEY JONES: Yeah, we want to keep playing. I'm not ready to stop playing,
me and Ayana are seniors and we're going to try to prepare for NIT.  
COACH COLLEN: We would be very excited if we get the opportunity to play in
the NIT, whether it's home or away. We would love to play at home if the
opportunity is there, but if not, this team has proven they can play on the
road, and as long as we're invited that's the important thing.  
I think we have a lot of things to play for. I don't want these two seniors to
go out with a bitter taste in their mouth, and we clearly understand unless we
win the NIT championship they may go out with a loss, but I want them to go
out on a higher note than what this felt like. For all the young players, they
simply -- this was their first opportunity -- we had six new kids.  
This was the first time where they came into an arena where they check your
bags at security, and the media cameras are in their face, and they get put
into the locker room after the games and aren't allowed to leave. There were a
lot of new things that they had to experience, and this is what postseason
play is like, like an NCAA game or NIT game.  
We're going to have another opportunity, and we need to take advantage of that
and embrace it because that's how you grow programs. We would be thrilled.  
  
Q. Is it kind of an ideal team for that, Whitney and your older players want
to play in it and you have younger players that would benefit?  
COACH COLLEN: I think so, and I've had teams before where half the team didn't
want to play and half the team was seniors, and I don't think that's the case.
The one thing I've never doubted in Whitney Jones and Ayana Brereton was their
dedication to the team and to Arkansas.  
I believe them when they say they want to play. Right now our freshmen may be
disappointed but they'll be jumping at the bit to get back out on to the
floor, and we've got to get them some experience.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Tennessee  68  
Alabama - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Tennessee, who won over Alabama 68-49, and will
advance to the quarterfinals against Florida at 6:30.  
We're joined by Coach Summitt, Shekinna Stricklen and Kelley Cain, Coach?  
COACH SUMMITT: I thought the first half was a constant struggle for us, but I
have to give a lot of credit to Alabama. I thought they did some good things
and obviously Russell had her way. She was 6 for 13, just didn't do a good job
of defending, I thought, in the second half.  
After our halftime, just trying to get them to understand to get our team to
really commit to defending, we wanted to obviously extend and defend the
three-ball and play better defense one-on-one, and that's been a challenge for
us at times.  
I thought we got a lot better in the second half. We played well together,
Shekinna did a great job in her decision making and became more aggressive at
both ends of the floor, exactly what we needed from her.  
I thought we got good play off the bench from Briana, and it was important for
us to have balance in our minutes and she did a good job, played 22 minutes,
so hopefully that will help us as we move forward to our game tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: Shekinna had 16 points, 6 rebounds and tied a career high with
7 assists. Kelley Cain had 12 points, 6 rebounds and 10 blocks, breaking a
record set by Candace Parker.  
COACH SUMMITT: Kelley Cain was struggling a little bit, but pleased with her
progress, and her toughness has been the key for us, and the pain.  
And then to have Brewer step up and play the way she played, we've been
waiting a long time to see that, so glad to see Alicia come to play in the
paint as well.  
  
Q. Pat, first half you're losing to the worst team in the league, what was
it like in your locker room?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, obviously we didn't want to lose the basketball game, and
we talked about what we had to do. We had to take care of the basketball. We
had to have a different sense of urgency.  
Sometimes this team is far too laid back for my liking, because I don't think
playing basketball at any time should be anything casual. And as a coaching
staff we challenged them, we had to step up and do a better job taking care of
the basketball.  
We had to make sure that we didn't give up anymore three's, and we defended.
They do a great job off the bounce. I thought our defense inspired our
offense. We had a lot of good stops, and I thought that's when Shekinna really
got out and pushed tempo for us and we attacked the rim.  
I liked the fact that Kelley Cain knows where she needs to play to her
strengths and she did that, and she had help tonight certainly with Alyssia,
and we got to rest Alex a little bit so that was good. I mean, I was mindful
of tomorrow we have to play another game, but first things first, we had to
win this one.  
  
Q. For Shekinna, first of all, because you've been the top scorer on this
team, were you particularly challenged at all at the half to assume more of a
role in terms of the scoring and building on that, maybe looking back in the
first half, did you feel that you were pushing in any way during the first
half because you were back here playing in Arkansas, or was that a factor in
your mind?  
SHEKINNA STRICKLEN: Like I've been telling people, I've come back home. It's
not about me, it's not about me. If I'm going to show up and have a good game,
it's about the team and us playing together and winning.  
The first half I felt like I was laid back and wasn't pushing the ball, and
the defense went up. And just the second half, it was something totally
different, intensity was higher and our defense picked up and everyone was
just fired up and we just got it going the second half.  
  
Q. Kelley, based on what Coach was saying, were you feeling more discomfort
than usual tonight? And if so, how did you play through it?  
KELLEY CAIN: I had the mentality that I wanted to fight for my team, and Coach
said the last thing we wanted to do was go home tomorrow. And we definitely
took that to heart and she was right and we played much better the second
half.  
  
Q. Kelley, will it be any harder on your knee to have to play games on
successive days in this tournament? You haven't had to do that, or is that not
a factor?  
KELLEY CAIN: That's definitely a factor. We have hard practices after games,
so I think I can handle it.  
  
Q. Coach, Kelley may be one of the nicest Lady Vols you've had on that team,
but she is starting to develop a swagger out there. Is that a welcome sight
for you to see out of somebody that is 6-6?  
COACH SUMMITT: She's not that nice! No, I think Kelley, when she first got to
Tennessee, obviously very soft spoken and her game was not as impressive as it
is now.  
I think the staff has done a great job of challenging our post game and there
is a toughness to it now. Kelley has a toughness. You know, she takes a lot of
licks in the paint. She draws attention from more than one player at a time,
and a lot of times she is caught in double teams.  
I just like her fight and I just like the development of her game. Tonight I
don't think it's going to do with her knees. I think she was having a little
trouble breathing. But she kept breathing.  
  
Q. Glory seemed to play much more in control than she has in the past, is
that a welcome sight to you?  
COACH SUMMITT: Anytime Glory is playing with exposure and playing with good
decisions, and anytime she does that, it adds to our depth and we can go with
three bigs, which is not uncommon for us right now.  
And I thought Glory had tremendous exposure and did a great job on the
defensive end and, again, on the offensive end I liked her reads and her
decision making.  
  
Q. Coach, now that this game is done, you can concentrate on Florida. You
said after the game there you were as upset as you could be after the game
because of the refereeing and the way the girls played.  
COACH SUMMITT: That's true. My memory of that game, we would get a lead, we've
got momentum and then we don't close out the game. I know -- everyone was
upset, our staff and our players, and they have a great team, but, you know,
if you have an opportunity, you've got to seize that opportunity at that
moment in time and we didn't.  
We couldn't make shots, didn't make shots, turned the ball over, didn't
rebound. We played probably the worst in the last, probably, six, seven
minutes of that game.  
The good thing is that we have a chance tomorrow to see where we are. We play
this team again on a neutral floor instead of on their home court.  
  
Q. Pat, post season play, the tournament is a second chance for your team.
Did you expect the team to have more of a sense of urgency, maybe come out
playing with more passion, playing smarter in the first half?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think you have to understand this, John. Yes, I was
disappointed that we didn't come out and dictate, but this Alabama team, you
have to understand that they have great quickness, and they're very good off
the dribble. You combine that with us not defending the three-ball, which was
very costly.  
You know, I think with this team sometimes we get off to slow starts.
Obviously it can cost us against most teams. Tonight we managed to pull
together at halftime and thought they came out with just a different
commitment and a different focus. But that's part of the youth.  
I don't know how you fast forward it, but I always go back and think -- and
would I rather have talent or experience? And I would rather have talent. But
right now they should be a little more experienced than they play sometimes
early.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you, Coach, thank you, ladies.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Ole Miss  65  
Arkansas - 60

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the winner of today's first game, Ole Miss
65-60 over Arkansas. We are joined by Coach Ladner, and Bianca Thomas and
Shantell Black.  
Coach?  
COACH LADNER: First of all, I'm extremely proud of my players. I didn't think
we came into favorable conditions, we had to come into Arkansas and play
Arkansas in what is their home court. That's always a disadvantage. But most
importantly, I just believed in our kids and they competed for forty minutes,
they played hard.  
We were imperfect a lot of times, but for the most part we found a way to make
a big play when we needed them.  
THE MODERATOR: Bianca Thomas set a new career high, 31 points today. With that
we'll take questions.  
  
Q. Question for Coach. What are your thoughts initially looking at the
rebound numbers, you mentioned it was an imperfect game, that's one of the
areas where it was. How frustrated are you when you look at that?  
COACH LADNER: That's never in the plan. When you put things on the board, you
always think you're going to outrebound the team. Arkansas is very quick, they
get to the rim in a hurry. I'm never happy when we get outrebounded, but I'll
take it today.  
  
Q. Coach and Bianca, could you talk about Bianca's day and what she was able
to do to hit the three's early?  
COACH LADNER: Well, you know, we could talk about Bianca's year, she has
gotten better as the year has trudged on She has made big plays along the way
and today she had this look on her face that she wanted the ball and in
critical situations, so we put a lot of merit in Bianca Thompson's play and we
ran a lot of things to her and she came through for us.  
BIANCA THOMAS: Today, the teammates were making screens, and I was coming off
of them and knocking down the shot, it was just a total team effort.  
  
Q. Renee, Arkansas never looked like they got in sync or at least for chunks
of the game. How much of that do you think was due to you guys going to the
zone in the first half? And could you talk about the different ways that you
guys were able to get Bianca open?  
COACH LADNER: Okay. Yeah, I thought our zone really shut down the three and
they began looking around. We came into the game knowing that Ricketts didn't
want to particularly shoot the three, she would set a lot of screens. We
started out in "man" and that lasted about one minute.  
We knew when we went to the zone we were going to cover their shooters. And at
different times there were four, so we asked our kids to step it up a notch
and make sure their slides were in the right place with a high-handed position
to keep them from getting looks. As a coach, you want to make the shooters
move and the drivers shoot outside and our kids followed the game plan.  
Now a couple of times the middle of the floor got open, but you've got to give
us something. And we were determined today, or made it a point of emphasis not
to give up the three.  
Question about Bianca? We ran her off of every screen possible. As of late,
she has been able to create shots. And when we could penetrate, they couldn't
guard Shantell and Kayla Melson. If they held off Bianca, she was going to
knock down a three, so we tried to keep her on the ball side of the floor.
Those were our two points of emphasis there.  
  
Q. As much as Bianca did today, the turnovers in the second half were
lopsided. Can you talk about that and how that helped you on the other end of
the floor?  
COACH LADNER: Again, I thought the zone affected Arkansas and they hurried
shots, rushed shots, forced shots and we did get some turnovers early on.  
On the flip side, I turned the ball over -- we turned the ball over three
times in a row when I thought we were making a true run and we had a time-out
and a little talk about that. So turnovers hurt them, I think we scored 22
points off of their turnovers, and that is probably the biggest difference in
the game.  
  
Q. At the end of the game, Bianca, maybe it was 60 -- y'all had a 3-point
play, did you try to miss the free-throw? Was that the -- on the back of the
rim?  
BIANCA THOMAS: I never try to miss -- I don't know what was going on today,
but I couldn't make a free-throw.  
  
Q. But after that free-throw, y'all hit the ones in the last 20 or so
seconds.  
COACH LADNER: Not by design. We are the cardiac kids. Things get down to the
wire, sometimes we go hay wire. We always know that Bianca is the leading
free-throw shooter in the league, and we feel confident with her up there. And
when she misses one, our guys get big and we look over at the bench and we go,
goodness, hope that doesn't happen again, and we hope she can make the one or
we let her try it again.  
She shoots 60%, we want 90%, but we're still going to put it in her hands. We
believe in her and those things don't happen very often.  
  
Q. I believe that was you, Shantell, that threw the ball up in the air at
the buzzer. Can you talk about what's going through your mind? How much
emotion did you guys put into this game?  
SHANTELL BLACK: We put a lot of emotion coming into this game. We were
focused, ready to play. And just to get a win under our belt and succeed to
the next round was great. It was a great feeling.  
  
Q. Let's talk about Auburn and Bianca's points against them, 29 I think it
was, 31 tonight.  
COACH LADNER: You know, what do I need to say about Auburn? One of the best
teams in the country, best team in our league. We played them very well at
their place. We will have to be above and beyond the call tomorrow. We will
have to regroup in a hurry, and they have to guard the big three for the most
part, get bodies on them and Alli Smalley, we have all the weapons.  
At their place, we played 'em to the end and just did not make some shots down
the stretch. We would like to make the game ugly, we can play well like that.
We would like to be able to compete with them for forty minutes, just keep,
you know, chipping away, chipping away trying to find a way.  
You have to get a stop on this defensive end of the floor and then you have to
find a way to put the ball in the hole. I feel confident in my players
offensively. We'll just have to really watch Bonner because she is explosive.
We will have to take transition away. I think she is one of the best guards in
the country in our conference and they have a pure shooter.  
We've played them before and we've faced a lot of contests like this one. This
is the SEC Tournament. You give it your best effort for forty minutes, we have
to compete with everything that we have.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Congratulations. Ole Miss plays Auburn
tomorrow at noon.
