_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  

Missouri  83  
Marquette - 79

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and have an opening statement by Coach Williams
and then take questions for the Marquette student-athletes.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Congratulations to Missouri and Coach Anderson. Well deserving
of the victory. Played a great game. I think that they're one of the best
teams in the country. And I think that they proved that today.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. If you guys can just talk about when you fell behind 16 you couldn't buy
a basket, you were able to keep it close somewhat with free throws, just talk
about those last 12 minutes of the first half offensively and what was the key
to falling behind.  
JEREL McNEAL: I think just we went through a spurt there throughout the game
where we weren't playing very well defensively and we were turning the ball
over a little too much early on in the first half which led to them getting a
run doing what they do best, get out in transition and getting easy layups and
things like that. But a lot of problems were stemming from our offense just
because we weren't getting the looks, we were taking quick bad shots which
were leading to easy points for them in transition.  
  
Q. Wesley, talk about the way you guys were able to get to the basket there
in the second half and really turn the game around with getting in the lane
and getting to the free throw line.  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: We know that Missouri, they like to pressure. And we felt
confident, we faced presses, we faced pressure the whole year and we felt
confident that if we got past that first wave then we were going to be
attacking big head on and they play so spread out and we play spread out so
when we get into the middle and then in and out we have one of us three
attacking one of their four or five men.  
So that was our game plan and we were able to execute it a lot in the second
half mainly because we were getting stops. Like he said, they were able to a
make that run because we were basically giving them the ball and they did what
they do best.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the confusion and what's been going through your
mind at the end of the game the last couple seconds with the conference here
and no one really knew what was going on with the clock and all that stuff.  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I don't know. I don't think I had any thoughts. I was just
kind of replaying in my head, I guess, how we got down to that point. All the
technicalities, I mean that's not our job. That's not what we do. I think
Coach Buzz was doing a great job trying to get the ref's attention and to
point out that you know whatever he saw and whatever you guys saw, but as far
as us players, I don't think we were consumed with that at all. I know I
wasn't.  
  
Q. For any of the players, how much did you know about Kim English coming in
the game and were you at all surprised at the offense that he was able to
provide in the first half?  
DOMINIC JAMES: We knew that he was one of the best shooters on the floor.
Obviously we didn't want to give him any open looks, but he got it going
early. And it gave him a little bit more confidence. That's all in the
scouting report and usually we stick to that. And we allowed him to get way
too many open shots. And just like any great shooter, they're going to knock
them down. He definitely gave them a boost off the bench much and gave them
that spark that they needed.  
  
Q. Jerel, you were the guy that fouled Tiller there on that last play. Were
you surprised that he needed to come out of the game with that injury and just
what were your thoughts on that whole process there?  
JEREL McNEAL: I wasn't surprised. I don't think he was -- he's the -- I don't
think he's the greatest free throw shooter. That's one of the technicalities
about the game, if you, if you are somewhat hurt, faking hurt, or whatever it
is, you can lay on the ground and then your trainer could come out and
basically get a sub for him. And it's happened on many occasions, I seen it
done before, so it wasn't a big surprise to me.  
  
Q. Talk about your decision to play tonight and what the process was like?
Did you practice for the first time yesterday or where were you at?  
DOMINIC JAMES: The rehabilitation process has been great. We got a great
training staff and they have been completely honest with me throughout the
process and I've been completely honest with them. That's the great thing
about the people that I'm surrounded by. They do a great job, all around the
board.  
I went to coach to let him know that I felt I could play. And I knew I could
help the team. He just asked me if I was ready and if I felt confident that I
can go out there and play my game and he told me to, the negative parts that
can go, you know and obviously I felt like I could help in the positive. So we
went, we discussed it a lot, you know, and at the end of the day we felt that
we all came together and thought I should play, so.  
  
Q. Dominic, you mentioned that you thought you could help the team. How do
you feel like you played today and how does the foot feel right now?  
DOMINIC JAMES: The main thing Maurice Acker, he's done an excellent job of
running the ball club. If could I just get in there for couple minutes and
just allow him to get a little bit of rest, I felt like I could do that. And
it came down to him at the end game and he deserved to be in the game at the
end of the game. He did an excellent job in that run when we got back in.  
I felt like I played decent. Obviously I couldn't be as aggressive as I wanted
to be, but I think I played solid defensively, but the game was never about
me. It was about us, just like it's always been.  
  
Q. Jerel, talk about the way you guys came back in the second half, was it
frustrating not to have a real chance any time in the last 19 to 25 seconds
there because Missouri kind of held the ball and then you had the turnover
with the five seconds left on the baseline there. Not to really have a chance
on the offensive end to win it.  
JEREL McNEAL: Yeah, I mean, yeah. In a way it is. It was tough just never
being able to get the ball back in our possession actually get a shot to
either tie or go up on the game. But at the same time in the situation where
we were in where the game was tied, all we needed was a stop and we didn't, we
didn't do a good enough job at to get that stop and get the ball back in that
situation.  
  
Q. Can you walk us through the traveling call and what your job was on that
play and just sort of what you saw from your vantage point.  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: When Zar was taking the ball out?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: Is that what he called?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It wasn't a travel.  
  
Q. They said he stepped over the line.  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: It definitely didn't look, it really didn't look like that to
me. I was actually, before you asked me that question trying to replay what
the possession was. And we just had cutters, we knew that they were going to
try to switch and Lazar was able to run the baseline and my job was to come
down the wing. And I mean I was fairly open, but he made the play to Jerel and
I guess he stepped over the line or shuffled his feet or whatever, whatever
the official called. And that's what I saw from my point. I didn't see any,
any, any bad play there, but I'm not the one with the whistle.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, gentlemen. We'll take questions for Coach
Williams.  
  
Q. Can you take us through that last series there with Tiller and the free
throws and everything. What was being explained to you and what did you see
from your advantage point?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Nothing was ever explained to me. I had to call timeout to get
an explanation. The thing that I was asking for was for them to check the
clock because I thought that the clock ran some, just a little, after the
whistle. And so I used a timeout after failing to get their attention so that
they could review the play and assess the clock situation.  
  
Q. Can you just talk a little bit about the comeback you guys made and what
it took to get back in this game.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I thought we were much more in character in the second half
offensively and defensively than we were in the first half. We didn't get --
we started the game the right way, I thought that the first two media timeouts
we did a pretty good job defensively. And I thought we flowed well
offensively.  
And then over the last 12 minutes as you asked earlier, we were completely out
of sorts on both ends. And then in the second half we out scored them every
media timeout, except for the last one. And that gave us a chance. But I
thought that how we played in the second half in regards to defensively and
offensively we were much more in character.  
  
Q. Tell us what you were trying to get on the inbounds play and how it
looked to you?  
COACH WILLIAMS: The one with five seconds left?  
  
Q. Right.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, it was 79-79, their ball. They called timeout. Ran the
clock down. We fouled them. I called timeout to officially get the officials'
attention to check the clock. And then once he made the second shot, did he
make the second one? Was it 81, it was 81-79, is that correct? They sub
English in for Tiller and English made two free throws, so it was 71-79, five
and a half seconds left. They adjusted the clock 1.1 seconds. We didn't have
to have a three, and five and a half seconds, relatively speaking, is not a
complete potential bad shot, and I thought that what we had designed would
have given us our best chance.  
And then they said that Lazar stepped on the line. Obviously I didn't have the
perspective to be able to see that, so then it became their ball. We had to
foul immediately. And so that changed the game. That changed the game. But
five and a half seconds is, you can potentially get a decent shot attempt.  
  
Q. Coach Williams, talk about Jerel's big game tonight, how much he played
into that comeback.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think Jerel and Wes in the second half were out standing. It
was good to see him back, to be honest with you. They haven't played their
absolute best over the last few days or over the last few games, not because
of their effort, their effort has always been there, but I thought that both
of them today were hitting on all cylinders, particularly in the second half.
And that's what gave us a chance in the end was their ability to score baskets
and/or get fouled and capitalize at the free throw line. So that gave us a
chance in the second half.  
  
Q. Obviously everybody in the stands was really upset after the sub English
in and especially when they tried to put Tiller right back into the game. What
was your perspective of all that?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I really wasn't paying attention, I was just trying to make
sure that our team knew what was going on from in relation to time and score
and what we needed to do. I just, I'm paid to coach our team and that's all I
really try to worry about, try to be accountable for that. So I don't know.  
  
Q. What was your assessment of Nic's play today, he played I think four
minutes in the second half did you feel like you were flowing better without
him in there?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, you know, in some regards I thought that we flowed
better. Just because over the last seven games he hasn't been playing. And I
wanted him, as I told you last night, above all else, I wanted him to finish
his career in a uniform. Regardless of the result of today's game, I wanted
him to have closure in regards to his basketball career at Marquette. And so
for him to be able to play the 13 minutes that he played, I do agree with what
Nic said, I think that him being able to spell Mo in a pace of a game that's
as quick as that one was, I think that it was very beneficial and I thought he
did a good job.  
  
Q. In this being the seniors' final game, if you could comment on all of
their careers at this point and especially if you could comment on Dwight's
performance today as well.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't know that there's a whole lot of things that you can
talk about after a game such as this. And so we spent however long the NCAA
allows, we just prayed. And I think that the thing that we prayed most about
or that I prayed most about was the blessing that they have been to our
institution and that they have been to our program. And not just specifically
as players, but what they have meant to our program as people.  
And one of the things that I said about Dwight, nobody ever mentioned Dwight
Burke for four straight years. They mentioned Rel, Wes, and Nic. And for him
to carry on and be the teammate and the friend that he is to those other three
guys, I think speaks absolute volumes about him. And I thought how he played
in the 24 minutes he had 10 rebounds, five offensive, five defensive. That was
particularly in the second half, we were able to get some second shot
opportunities, didn't necessarily always make them, but that was in part to
Dwight. And I don't know that, I think that we'll always be able to recruit
guy that is can dribble, pass, and shoot, but I don't know that collectively
the class that these four guys have meant, on the floor, off the floor,
academically, they have been arguably as a group the best ambassadors of our
institution over the last four years, whether they were players of our team or
not.  
  
Q. Coach Williams, you were obviously upset at the end of the game was most
of that about the clock or was there some other things going on there?  
COACH WILLIAMS: No, I don't know if I was upset. I had lost my voice and that
typically happens. And I thought that going eight feet out on the court would
potentially get somebody's attention and when it didn't I called timeout. And
then there on the, when Maurice shot his three, and it went out of bounds,
they immediately checked the clock then. So they didn't have to, nobody had to
use a timeout. And so the thing I was trying to get those, the officials to
explain to me was was the clock exactly where it needed to be. When it went
from 4.4 I call a timeout it goes to 5.5. Maurice shoots, and then they have
a, they check the monitor again and it goes from .9 to I think it was 1.2.  
So I was just wanting to make sure, because, again, I think that time and
score is most important in those situations as it relates to your team knowing
what they need to do. Do we need to foul, do we need a three, do we need a
two, so that was all I was trying to do and I had lost my voice and they
weren't able to hear me.  
  
Q. I don't know that you guys got other than the one long three there I
think that was the only shot you guys were able to get off in the last couple
minutes, disheartening that you weren't able to get a couple more shots up
over those last few possessions?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I can back track a little bit, I know that the last possession
we scored was when Rel was fouled. And I know three possessions before that is
when Rel hit the three. So the possessions in between I'm not exactly sure
what happened. I haven't gotten a box or a whatever, a game score, so I don't,
did we turn it over?  
  
Q. There was a shot clock violation in there. There was the not being able
to get the ball inbounds.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, shot clock violation, I remember that.  
  
Q. Not being able to get the ball inbounded with five seconds.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah, that's tough. That's part of it. That's part of
it.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  

Xavier  60  
Wisconsin - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and have an opening statement from Coach Ryan
and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH RYAN: I'd just like to say how proud I am of our guys, the effort, the
grittiness, especially on defense, not just tonight but all year. What they
have accomplished after we hit a rough stretch early in the Big-10 to be in
the big dance and to last a couple days, that's pretty exciting.  
But it's also, it makes a huge statement for the type of guys we have. We
might have been a little short in some areas and not necessarily height, but
just some areas of the game of basketball that we didn't particularly function
well in during the year, that came back to bite us a little bit here.  
But the fact that they were gritty enough and tough enough to be able to get
to play a couple more games and represent the University of Wisconsin, I'm
extremely proud of them, especially the seniors.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. If you guys can just talk about Xavier half court defense and how tough
it was to score against them .  
TREVON HUGHES: They long and athletic. They challenge every shot we had. We
had to alter our shots. It made it a little difficult trying to get our shot
off. They're very quick, so they collapse in the lane when we get in our
driving position.  
  
Q. Trevon Hughes, I guess along those lines, sure, Xavier is a good
defensive team, but until the first couple minutes of the second half you guys
were doing a pretty good job of penetrating and stuff. What changed after you
guys got that seven-point lead? What was different in terms of either how you
guys were attacking or how they were defending you?  
TREVON HUGHES: I want to say they went on a 5-0 run, gave them momentum and
they took the momentum from us and they never looked back from there. At the
same time we have to take care of the ball a little bit better. Even though we
had seven turnovers, but that's second chances that we don't get at the
basket.  
  
Q. Marcus, talk about Xavier's size and just how they limited your chances
to get offensive rebounds.  
MARCUS LANDRY: They're big. They do a good job of really grabbing the rebounds
and it helps that they're very athletic also. They just -- they did a good job
really being on the boards. I think they out-rebounded us by seven. And it was
kind of difficult to get on an offensive glass, but as a player, you just have
to have a desire to go after every ball regardless of size of the team.  
  
Q. Xavier kind of thought maybe they wore you guys down a little bit. I
guess I'm wondering just your thoughts on that . Do you think that defensively
they were able to wear you guys down a little bit?  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: Yeah, well, we just got away from ourselves. We -- shots
didn't go down and it ended up being an 11-point game because of free throws
at the end. Really, they out-rebounded us by seven. But that was -- we missed
a lot of shots and they do a great job of checking out.  
They are coached very well. The players are very disciplined on their box outs
and that also made it tough for the offensive rebounds. And I don't know if
they really -- both teams were in the same position, second game and two,
three days, so whatever it was. So I don't think it was anything that had to
do with our legs, really. I think both teams were tired and playing their
hearts out.  
  
Q. Could you guys just kind of reflect on the season and how you view what
this team was able to accomplish.  
MARCUS LANDRY: After losing six in a row and finishing the way we did, just to
get into the NCAA tournament was great. I never heard of any other team that
has done that. And we went on a stretch where we lost six in a row and we
still made the NCAA tournament. So we got a chance to live to fight another
day after those six losses. And to get in the tournament, it was a great
accomplishment for our team. We can always wish that we would have -- well, we
wish that we were still playing, but that's not the case right now. But we can
always look back and say we could have done this better or we could have done
that better, but we're pretty happy just to get in and it was -- we had it in
our hearts to just go out there and fight.  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: Just so proud to be part of this team and battle through a
lot of tough times throughout the year and just kept on fighting back. We
bounced back from a six-game losing streak, and made a run and got our name
called on selection Sunday, and we were proud of the fact that we did that.
And then to come out and make a little noise here in Boise was a lot of fun
and something I'll never forget. And I'll never forget the coaches for all
they have done for me and all my teammates. I just got so many people to thank
and just so proud to wear this jersey.  
  
Q. Marcus, toward the end of the first half I think maybe the final three
and a half minutes of the first half, in the first three minutes of the second
half, you guys were running some pretty good offense and having some success
scoring. Can you talk about that stretch of the game and maybe what was the
key at that point?  
MARCUS LANDRY: We were really executing. Trevon was finding his way into the
lane, kicking it out. Guys were making plays. And we were listening to the
coaches doing what they wanted us to do and it worked. That was the outcome
between those few minutes.  
It worked for us at the time.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, guys. We'll take questions for Coach
Ryan.  
  
Q. Sean Miller talked about one of the changes he made in the second half
was to crowd Hughes and Landry a little bit more. Can you just talk about how
after your initial success in the first half that kind of worked on those two
players in your offense?  
COACH RYAN: Trevon still got shots. Marcus still got shots. I think if you
take a look at it, Jason Bohannon, if they didn't squeeze him a little bit, he
didn't shoot it particularly well. And really, no matter what the case, we
needed to be getting to the free throw line early in that second half more
than what we did. And by not making good pump fakes or kicking the ball out if
we didn't have a shot.  
You can make all the changes you want as a coach, the things that I saw were
simply execution on a finish, using the ball fakes, if somebody's closing out
on you, you got to pump fake, those are the things where we actually could
have taken a much bigger advantage of and we didn't.  
  
Q. You just look, outside of Marcus, your shooting, the rest of the team was
8-42. Pretty uncharacteristic. What were you trying to do to get someone
going? Did you do any kind of strategy change to try to get someone who could
put the ball in the basket for you?  
COACH RYAN: Well, other than burning incense and doing a couple dances over
there on the sideline, you know, this has happened to us a few times. The two
starting guards, when they can get decent looks -- now the percentages go down
as we're taking quick shots at the end playing from behind. Two or three of
those shots are shots maybe that you're not normally going to take. But you
put yourself in that position and you live with it.  
Streaky, they have been like that all year, when shots are going down we could
beat anybody. Defensively, if you really think about where they are physically
and where we were physically, to do what we did defensively, I thought our
guys did a great job.  
We put ourselves in position on the defensive end to be able to be on the
left-hand side. Offensively, it wasn't because of turnovers, it wasn't because
-- it was basically because of being a little too quick with the trigger and
times not using good pump fakes. With some of the guys it's experience, but
with the two guards, they have been through a lot, they have been -- you know
somebody asked me on the way in, hey, why did they make you guys play the
early game? Why did you -- you guys played the late game on Friday and you do
this, you do that.  
Hey, again, guys got to be ready to play. It doesn't matter. We had a bunch of
guys with double digit minutes and so did they. So it's a whole different
story if guys knock down just a few shots. If we just shoot 35 percent we hold
them under 40, and in those kind of games you're supposed to be able to get it
done, but watching games this year, other teams play, other conferences, I've
seen games like this where defensively a team plays really well, they don't
have anybody that's knocking down shots, and you come up on the short end. I'm
sure it will, it's happened in the past and it will happen in the future.  
  
Q. Despite your offensive struggles it was still a three point game with
about four, four and a half minutes left. I'm curious your thoughts on your
offense from that point in the game and whether you liked the kind of shots
you were getting at that stage?  
COACH RYAN: Well, J-Bo had some good looks. Marcus a couple around the basket.
He finished on some. But in order to beat a team like that you're going to
have to be much more efficient. Then when you're playing from behind, it gets,
you know, unless you've ever been in the arena, and know what it's like, you
do, it's everything speeds up a little bit and some guys handle that a little
better than others. And we have had some times where guys stepped up in there
and made some big shots and meaning shots playing from behind putting in
position, just like we did against Florida State. This afternoon it didn't
happen.  
  
Q. When you look back on the season I know Marcus kind of touched on it a
little bit about losing six in a row and still hearing your name called on
Selection Sunday, is there anything in particular that you're going to
remember about this year that stands out in your mind?  
COACH RYAN: I've been through so many, it never gets old, but a lot of grit
with this group. Knowing that we were going to be a little rough around some
edges, based on what we had back, we needed some help. And the fact that
Keaton Nankivil has taken two charges in the last two games, next year people
better look out. Because he has become a defensive player. And when Jon Leuer
gets stronger, by next year -- you see a coach is already thinking -- I don't
think Trevon and J-Bo next year are going to have shooting nights like this.
Just things that you got to learn.  
Some things that -- so when I look back I just keep, a coach, he looks back
and says, man, the seniors, they were great, a hundred wins. How would you
like to be a graduating college student and have 25 wins a year under your
belt and had a chance to play in some pretty good venues. That's not all bad.  
So everybody wants to be the last team standing. But the fact that we got a
chance to -- and rightfully so we were in the NCAA tournament. You can't take
the RPI, the strength of schedule, the way we finished, I didn't hear a whole
lot of question about that from people who were intelligent about basketball.
We were never really in that conversation.  
Some of the games that you let get away, if you can learn how to manage that a
little bit better on the court, and I always say watch us grow next year. We
can get something out of this trip here. That's for sure.  
  
Q. Subpar offensive stretches have happened so much. In the middle portion
of the second half, did you sense some frustration from an maybe some quick
shots or people trying to do too much?  
COACH RYAN: When I lack at other teams and you look at box scores, yesterday,
in every game at some point or another the announcers going, they have gone
seven minutes without a bucket. And I'm thinking to myself, man, I know it --
either it's happening more and more to a lot of teams, or they're just talking
about it more because you get the running scores and they have quicker
information that announcers use and everything. But you have to avoid those if
you want to be consistent. But if a player gets frustrated, I can't get inside
their head and push a button and say, okay, you don't get frustrated.  
You just have to play through that and because the other teams have those
spells too. Xavier's had them, every team that's playing, every team that has
played. But overall percentage wise, that is, that's a struggle, some of it as
I said came from, you drop from 30 some percent to 20 some percent when you're
forcing shots at the end. But, well, then don't get behind. And you'll shoot a
better percentage.  
  
Q. Just talk about the role both benches played. They had three guys come in
and get 20 points and some big rebounds and make some big impact plays and you
never got that contribution. How difficult was that?  
COACH RYAN: Well we're always looking for something from the bench. But
defense first and then rebounding and then play making and sometimes your
bench brings in scoring because of your rotation, sometimes your bench brings
in defense, sometimes your bench brings in power for rebounding. In different
years there's different ways you go about it.  
Last year Bohannon was coming in off the bench and he would add some offensive
spark. Tim Jarmusz, you know, he's not a bad shooter at all. He can knock it
down. He's, he can add some offense. Keaton, he didn't shoot it obviously as
well as he did against Florida State, but it was like his freshman year,
basically, and he and Leuer and Jarmusz and Jordan Taylor and Rob who just
played a little bit, but those guys, they seemed in the locker room, like they
can't wait to get back, go to work, and get ready for next year.  
  
Q. You mentioned on two occasions that you came up short in a few areas this
year. Could you elaborate a little bit on what you mean by that?  
COACH RYAN: Well, I thought defensively even though our numbers show we were a
really good defensive team. Again, that's based on guys buying in and working
at things. But I thought we could have been even better. On rotation, on
taking charges, on -- it's not like the way you guys started the press
conference about Xavier on the offensive rebounds, you must have had a
different stat sheet than I have. I think we had seven, they had seven. With
that team, to keep them to seven when they got three on one possession and I
pulled both our bigs on that, just figuring they might have been a little
tired, so other than that one possession, they had four offensive rebounds.
And that's a team that's really good on the glass.  
But that's an area -- but towards the end of the year we were getting better
in that area. And then shooting percentage wise with just being so
inconsistent percentage wise. And tonight was -- we have had two or three of
those where between the two guards they didn't shoot a very high percentage.
But we played 30 some games. Coaches are always looking at how the ones that
got away. Like the fishermen. They don't care about all the nice fish that
they catch, they always think about the big ones that got off the hook because
they want to go you know defeated. Well we all want to go you know defeated
and catch them all. But we don't get to do that.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Xavier's ability to get to the line down that
stretch that and ability to get those what would be three point plays?  
COACH RYAN: Well again when you're playing from behind a lot of those free
throws came when we were trying to get a strip, get a turnover, trying to go
after the ball in a way to create an opportunity for us. A couple of those
reaches. But that's, you know, what happens. Again, you play from behind, the
other team's going to get more free throws if that's what you have to go to.  
And we're not -- we're not a long, athletic type team to press and jump and
run and do those types of things. We have guys that work hard on defense, but
some teams are better at pressuring than others.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.  
COACH RYAN: Sure.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  

Xavier  60  
Wisconsin - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started and have an opening statement by Coach Miller
and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH MILLER: We obviously beat a very good team today in Wisconsin. The
respect that we have for their coach, Bo Ryan, and his staff and the Big-10
Conference and what they stand for, Wisconsin, is really immense. And for us
to be able to beat that type of team and program, it makes us obviously feel
very good.  
Today's game was very much, it was very much about who we are as a team.
Terrific half court defense that can wear you down. We do it with depth, we do
it with size. I thought some of the guys off the bench, Kenny Frease and Jamel
McLean in particular came in the game and really made a difference. They not
only played but they changed the outcome in our favor. Any time you can have
depth, it's clearly to your advantage.  
Also thought a key moment in today's win was we started the second half in a
really tough way. We missed some layups, missed a free throw, allowed them to
get a quick lead on us. And once again, the resiliency of our team, we were
able to respond from that key moment and even the game back up as opposed to
playing behind the whole second half, which is very hard to do against
Wisconsin.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. B.J., you guys were down by seven points and you came out of a timeout
and went on a 10-0 run. What happened in that timeout? What did Coach tell you
and was that the turning point for you?  
B.J. RAYMOND: Well, it's a thing that we do all the time. We have been there
before. Last year we were down to Georgia by 10 points at the half and we just
needed to calm down and do what we do. We came out and we focused on the right
end of the floor, on the defensive end of the floor, and that's what got us
back in the game.  
  
Q. Wondering if one of you players can be more specific about that stretch
there, because it seemed like it was the turning point in the game. What did
you do specifically on defense that made things so tough for Wisconsin? They
went on a nine-minute run without scoring a bucket there.  
DERRICK BROWN: Well, defense, that's our identity. We're not going to score 90
points and outshoot people. And we realize that we didn't want this to be B.J.
and C.J.'s last game. And collectively as a group we came out and we gave it
all we had on the defensive end. Because that's where our identity is.  
  
Q. Derrick, you didn't allow an offensive rebound in the second half until
there was about a minute left in the game. Can you just talk about the
significance of your rebounding today and keeping them from getting any second
chance points?  
DERRICK BROWN: Like I said, Coach puts us in a position where we do it every
day. If we give up offensive rebounds to the other team, it's going to be a
problem with him. And we just wanted to give it all we had, especially on the
defensive end. And defense rebounding is part of defense.  
So I think we did a pretty good job in that area. We should have got a couple
more offensive rebounds as Coach pointed out, but at the end of the day I
think we did a decent job on keeping them off the glass.  
  
Q. Trevon Hughes was hurting you guys, getting to the foul line and beating
you to the basket. What change did you make to keep him off the line? What did
you guys do differently?  
DANTE JACKSON: I think our ball pressure, me and Terrell's ball pressure,
helped a little bit and then the guys who were jumping the ball screens did a
good job also. Our defense is set so we can help each other and I think we
just started helping each other a little bit better.  
  
Q. B.J., you had three points in the first half and then really picked it
up, I thought, in the start of that run there. What were you looking to do in
the second half?  
B.J. RAYMOND: Well, I always get myself in trouble when I try to force things,
and I try to force the action. I just wanted to make sure that I let the game
come to me, but also be aggressive at the same time.  
Also, when we got down a little bit, as being a senior and leader of the team,
sometimes you got to take it upon your shoulders to get one bucket. Because
sometimes the other teammates on the team need to just see one go in. And from
that point on everything will be okay.  
  
Q. B.J., you guys haven't won a game by a score this low in output since
November. Talk a little bit about what this says for you guys going forward in
the tournament in that you were able to win a real grinder tonight.  
B.J. RAYMOND: It means a lot. But Wisconsin is a great defensive team as well.
And they did a good job of defending us and we did a good job of defending
them. We just wanted to make sure today that we were who we were. We played
fast, but also we played on the right side of the ball, which is our defense.
We didn't want to just turn it into just try to rush it up the floor and shoot
the first shot we got.  
  
Q. B.J., can you talk about the guys that Coach mentioned who came off the
bench and changed the game and what it means to have younger players make that
kind of an impact.  
B.J. RAYMOND: It means a lot. I say this all the time, but there's a time in
the season where freshman become sophomores and sophomores become juniors and
juniors become seniors. And it's that time of the season where all the games
and all the practices and everything that Coach has said to us in the past, it
comes into play.  
And Ken Frease tonight, he hadn't been playing his best basketball, but I said
to him before the game, You know, this is a time where everybody's watching.
And this is the time where you need to be at your best. And I think he
responded in a great way today. And Jamel McLean, you know he's a monster,
he's a freak athlete and he showed the nation what he had today.  
  
Q. For Derrick or B.J., just your thoughts about being back in the Sweet
16.  
DERRICK BROWN: It feels good. Real good. It's a total team effort, like I
said. We're a family. We care about each other. Probably more than a lot of
different teams out there because it's off the court, on the court. But being
at the Sweet 16, that's something that you can't -- everybody can't say.  
B.J. RAYMOND: I'd like to second that. We worked so hard. It's just so good to
see our hard work come to pass. In the summer we stay around all summer and we
just work on our weaknesses and try to make them better. And it's just so good
to see the practices, the hard times, the tears, the scratches, the blood, the
time that Coach is yelling at us, just to see that it is all for a good cause.
It just makes us put our faith in Coach a lot higher.  
COACH MILLER: I would just say that Dante Jackson, a lot was made coming into
this tournament about our inexperience at the point guard. In large part we
went to the Sweet 16 today because of his efforts. He had a terrific game on
both sides of the ball and also against Portland State. And to me, Terrell and
Dante combined this weekend to allow us to advance. They did an absolutely
terrific job at the point guard position.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll congratulate Xavier student-athletes, thank
them and excuse them and take questions for Coach Miller.  
  
Q. Same question that I asked the guys: What happened in that timeout right
before the 10-0 run? Can you kind of go through that?  
COACH MILLER: Yeah, I think sometimes timeouts are made almost like a coach
changes completely what he's doing or it's something that I say that triggers
it. And 90 percent of the time it's just everyone taking a deep breath, going
back out on the court and really trying to play the style of basketball that
we practice, make sure that we're in tune with the things that are going to
allow us to be successful.  
We didn't change a whole lot as much as when we went back out on the court,
guys made plays, we defended like they said, and we didn't lose faith in what
got us here. And that is hard-nosed, tough, man-to-man defense, and trying to
be as unselfish as we can on offense. Like I mentioned, two or three of the
best shots we got all game happened in that first three minutes, we just
missed them. We missed a dunk, we missed two long putts.  
And I was very proud of our team in terms of being able to go from that
timeout and forget about what just happened and move on, the next play, as
opposed to worrying about what we just did wrong. And that's what we did well
in that timeout more than going to a different defense or running a different
play.  
  
Q. Wisconsin is a tough matchup especially on one day's break. Going to the
Sweet 16, how satisfying is it to go there by beating a team like Wisconsin
that requires you to play the way that you did today?  
COACH MILLER: Like I said, we give Wisconsin's program and their coach and
their staff tremendous credit. We knew that we would have to play a great game
to advance. But in this tournament, make no mistake, whoever is on that line
above or below you is going to be a very good team. That's the great part
about the NCAA tournament. Everybody earns their way into it and it happened
most of the time through six months worth of work.  
They have some very good seniors, very experienced team, and an excellent
program. But for us to advance to the Sweet 16, it's clearly more about our
performance today than it really was whether we had played Florida State or
Wisconsin.  
  
Q. What did you stress to your guys yesterday in playing a team with the
style that plays like Wisconsin?  
COACH MILLER: Knowing that a lot of possessions are going to go towards the
end of the clock, both when we're on defense and also when we're on offense,
that's unavoidable.  
You really look at the score with ten minutes in the half or eight minutes
left in the first half and I don't know if it was single digits, but it felt
that way. The thing we really tried to emphasize is, That's okay. It's going
to be that type of game.  
One thing that we rely on a lot is our schedule. I really believe St. Louis in
our own conference plays similar to Wisconsin, very disciplined, tough-minded,
half court basketball. Same thing with Miami. Charlie Coles is an excellent
coach, we play them every year, they make you earn it at the end of the
possessions and we reminded our team that we have been in against styles like
that and it requires a lot of tough-mindedness and patience. And I also want
to emphasize that we scored more points in transition than you realize today.  
That's the other thing we emphasized, that when we had the opportunity to be
that, a team that was looking for transition baskets, not play Wisconsin
basketball, and just rely exclusively on our half court, which they're great
at, we're certainly not going to be nearly as good.  
  
Q. Your players talked about increasing their effort on the defensive end in
the second half. But what kind of adjustments did you make? What did you try
to do after seeing them for a half?  
COACH MILLER: Two parts: We tried to crowd the court more on Trevon Hughes.
He's really a physical guard. I didn't realize how he could get to the basket.
And he is strong and tough. Tried to use the other four players to make it
harder for him to get to the basket, as opposed to just letting the player on
our team that was guarding him be on an island.  
And the second one is Landry, he's a handful in and around the basket and
tried to provide that player with a little bit more of a crowded court as
opposed to letting him just play one-on-one against our post player. And as
the game wore on in the second half, our team did a better job of doing both
of those things.  
  
Q. You talk about defending those two guys, but really, you didn't let
anyone else from Wisconsin hurt you. How important was that and what was the
key to that happening?  
COACH MILLER: They're really good at driving the pass. They're really good at
when the ball goes to the low post, that if you crowd them too much, they make
you pay with threes. We did a real good job defending the ball other than
Trevon Hughes and Landry at times. As they get by you on the dribble, that
really leads to open threes and being able to get our defense set where the
guy on the ball defended the ball the right way, that puts more pressure on
Wisconsin to score. And you can't do that unless you have depth. You can wear
yourself out if you don't.  
And I go back to our bench, Terrell Holloway, Brad Redford, Jamel McLean and
Ken Frease in particular inside, those four players off our bench, we have
counted on them all year. Did an excellent job at both ends and allowed us, I
think, to wear Wisconsin down a little bit in the second half.  
  
Q. It's just fresh in the books, but Pitt won, so that's who you're facing.
Do you have any thoughts about going against your alma mater?  
COACH MILLER: I really don't because, number one, this is really about our
team and our players. It's about C.J. and B.J. having an opportunity to
continue to play and move past the Sweet 16. And regardless of who we play, we
know every level you jump it becomes increasingly difficult, more difficult
because the teams that are still alive are even better and stronger deeper.
And clearly, I always have one eye on them because they're such a terrific
program, more so than when I went to school there.  
  
Q. What's your feeling about this team as you head into the Sweet 16,
differences From last year?  
COACH MILLER: Well, we had a unique team on offense last year. We had a fifth-
year senior, Drew Lavender, a dynamic little guard who could get his own shot
and really was great at the end of the shot clock. We had an experienced front
court player, Josh Duncan, who was a nightmare for the other team, because he
was our best 3-point shooter. And we had Stanley Burrell, who had one of the
best defensive seasons that we have ever seen a player have and he too is in
his fifth year. Those three guys could really lead us.  
This year the torch has been passed to B.J., C.J., and Derrick, and I think
they're different as a group than last year.  
We're bigger, we're more physical, we have to really be good on defense to
win. Last year we could cut little corners on defense and still be okay. This
year that has to be in place for us to advance. And I would say that's the big
difference.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, Coach.  
COACH MILLER: Thank you.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  

Missouri  83  
Marquette - 79

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get an opening statement from Coach Anderson
and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, first, we give some credit to Marquette. What a game.
You wanted an up-tempo game, you got an up-tempo game. A lot of energy, a lot
of activity. I'm really, really proud of our guys, especially these seniors
here sitting next to me. I thought they led the way and even when some
adversity took place. We had a lead in the first half and Marquette -- Buzz
has done an awesome job with those guys. They would not go away. They been
there before and you could tell the experience of their basketball team.  
But I heard -- we're down -- I think four points we were down, like a minute
or something to go and I heard one of our guys made the statement, We have
been here before, fellows. And when he said that, that told me our guys are
going to buckle down and make some plays. And I thought we made some plays
going down the stretch against a very good Marquette team.  
I been to Boise, this is my fourth time, and I guess I'm finally getting a
chance to advance, so I guess the fourth time is the charm.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Considering all the free throws that Marquette made, Leo, did you see
something? Was it fitting that you guys actually won it at the free throw
line?  
LEO LYONS: What's the question?  
  
Q. Considering all the free throws Marquette hit, was it somehow fitting for
you guys to win it at the free throw line?  
LEO LYONS: Yeah, we was missing them early. It was tough for us. And they were
making all theirs. So we had to buckle down on defense. And come crunch time
that's when we really got to make them and I think we stepped up and made
them.  
  
Q. The players, all three of you, comment on Kim English coming off the
bench. I mean, he looked confident. Was he? And did you have the confidence in
him?  
LEO LYONS: I told you the other day can't nobody shake Kim English's
confidence. And he had seen, he had that look in his eye that he had seen
before. He had a nice release and it was going in for him and he didn't stop.
He knocked down some shots for us. I think jump-started us. We were playing a
little timid in the beginning.  
MATT LAWRENCE: I think the score was 17-11 we were losing, next thing I look
up and we're up 22-17. So I think he might have gone on an 11-0 run himself.  
But it was remarkable, and we have been waiting this season because of our
bench. And Kim English comes in like that and it just sparks all the rest of
us. And then you see the starters go back in and pick it up another level and
have a little bit of a lead going into the half. And so I think Kim English
was very instrumental for us.  
DeMARRE CARROLL: He's one of those guys that his confidence is so high. And
Kim English came off the bench, not only came in, our whole bench stepped up.
Keith got a big charge at the right time and it kind of woke up the starters,
because we came out a little sluggish. And it shows you the beauty of our
team.  
You can't key on one guy. You got to respect everybody on our team. You just
can't key in on me, Matt and Leo. You got to respect everyone on our team. And
that's beauty of our team.  
  
Q. Matt, just one more thing on Kim. With 5.5 seconds left he comes in the
game, it looked like he was very happy to come in the game. Did you guys get a
look at the dynamic on the bench? Was he in Coach's face saying, It's me, it's
me? How did that work and comment on that.  
MATT LAWRENCE: I saw him and I knew right when I looked at him that if he was
-- if Coach chose him, he was going to knock them down. You can't -- this guy
can miss three, four, five shots in a row and he is still the guy that you
want to come off the bench and knock down those free throws.  
And I never seen a freshman with so much confidence and you saw it tonight.
This guy's playing in a NCAA tournament trying to go to the Sweet 16 as a
freshman. And he goes out there and hits two free throws with five seconds
left in the game to basically win the game. I think that's pretty remarkable.
And everyone should take a take a look at that and see how unbelievable a
player he is.  
  
Q. DeMarre and Leo, in the first half their defense obviously was keying on
you guys, I think you only had about eight points. How nice was it to have the
other guys step up and do some of the scoring for you?  
LEO LYONS: That's something that we have done before. A lot of teams try to
pack their defense in and stop us from scoring on the inside. But we got great
shooters on outside. So every time they dumped it off, I was finding people
like Matt and Kim. So just trying to stop us ain't going to stop our team
because we're a full team.  
DeMARRE CARROLL: That's the beauty of our team. You just can't key in on one
guy. Everybody can put the ball in the basket and everybody can contribute in
their own way. And you know, it opened up a lot of things for me and Leo in
the second half and luckily Kim English and Matt and the rest of our team was
knocking down shots, because it opened up a lot for me and Leo in the second
half.  
  
Q. Could each of guys just comment on Memphis, that's your next opponent.  
DeMARRE CARROLL: Memphis Tigers, they're a great team. They're a defensive
team, kind of like ourselves. So it's going to be a defensive slug match. But
hopefully we can turn our defense up another notch, because I don't think
nobody in the country plays the way we play. And hopefully we can get fatigue
to set in in the next game.  
But Memphis, they're a great team. They got a lot of athletes and we got a lot
of athletes. So I think it's going to be a good game.  
MATT LAWRENCE: I think it's pretty remarkable that they were able to lose so
much scoring and so much leadership from their team last year that went to the
National Championship game and to come back and make it to the Sweet 16 the
next year. That shows you how good their young players are. And they're a team
that prides themself on defense and they're a very good defensive basketball
team, but so do we. And we'll see if they can get up and down the floor with
us.  
LEO LYONS: I know they got a lot of long, lengthy guys like we do and I think
they match up very well with us. I think it's going to be a great game. I know
they like to play a fast pace just like we do. And we're going to see which
one can pick it up and get the wear and tear at the end of the game.  
  
Q. For any of the players, just wondering who is going to take credit for
that comment when you're down four, you guys have been here before to kind of
settle down everybody.  
LEO LYONS: That was Zaire Taylor that said that. He said that on a dead ball
and he called everybody in the huddle and he said it out loud. He made sure
everybody heard it. And Coach was right, that did spark our team. At the end
we realized that we had to get a stop.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about the way this game ended, just between the injury
and the free throws and the crowd getting upset and their coach getting upset.
Just seemed like kind of a crazy last minute. Talk about the scene out there
that last minute.  
MATT LAWRENCE: It was pretty crazy. There was a lot of things going on out
there. J.T., and he has a little hand injury, but it's been bothering him a
little bit, and I think he landed on his wrist.  
And you got guys, freshman, coming to step up and make that -- make free
throws. So it was a pretty weird ending. And I thought it was like someone
said earlier, a little ironic that we were able to win the game on the free
throw line after Marquette had basically lived at the free throw line the
whole game.  
So, yeah, I can hardly remember it now. Just happy that we were able to win
the game.  
  
Q. This is your first NCAA tournament and after Marquette made that big run
in the second half it really showed a lot of composure for you guys to keep it
together. How were you able to do that?  
DeMARRE CARROLL: I have to give credit to our coaching staff. Coach told us
before we even came in this tournament that none of ya'll ever been to a NCAA
tournament, so y'all just follow me and I'll lead you all the right way. And I
think he's been leading us the right way ever since.  
MATT LAWRENCE: I would like to give a little credit to Marquette for not going
away. They had a huge shot there at the end of the first half that kind of
gave them some momentum. They used that in the second half and just never went
away. I was just happy our leadership and ownership stepped up there at the
end of the game.  
  
Q. Leo, go back to that about one minute left when Zaire said that. Where
were your heads then? Were you a little down? What did you sort of feel like
the mood was?  
LEO LYONS: Seemed like the mood in the huddle was that everyone was pretty
tired. And after that dead ball, you could see everybody was on their knees
and everybody had a little shock in their face because they punched us at the
end.  
And when he said that, we just thought about where we came from, I know I did.
I thought about all the up and downs we have been through and all the hard
work that we put in. And you forget about being tired and all you got to do is
bring your team in together and everybody will do anything and go above limits
to get a stop.  
  
Q. Leo, talk about they scored almost all of their points by driving to the
basket, getting to the free throw line and trouble that gave you guys and then
also a little bit about the way you played down the stretch and getting those
points you guys needed.  
LEO LYONS: Marquette, I would say with confidence, that they're a team that we
probably ever saw before this whole year. They got five guys on the floor that
can all dribble and can all attack and it's all fast with the ball. And it
took us a while to figure them out. They were attacking us and getting to the
line a little bit.  
But I think at the end we kind of buckled down and tried to stop the drives
and you could just see the key of the game at the end just knocking down some
free throws after they made all theirs.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you, guys. Congratulations. And we'll take
questions for Coach Anderson.  
  
Q. Can you just go through the thought process on when you put Kim in and
was Kim trying to volunteer for the job on the free throws at the end?  
COACH ANDERSON: Oh, yeah. He was sitting there and I always look at the bench,
because J.T. was, I thought he was pretty hurt, being on the floor there. And
Kim English, he just gave me that look, not only him, I thought Marcus was the
same way. And sometimes you just have that feeling. And he went up because he
shot the ball well.  
I visited with our coaches and once they said it, I said, Okay, we'll put him
in there and he goes in and he did what he did in the game. He had a
phenomenal game today.  
  
Q. All the talk about the free throws and everything, but you've talked
about this team priding itself on the defense all year long. Can you talk
about the shot clock violation and how big that possession was.  
COACH ANDERSON: I thought it was huge. I thought that was huge in defending
that so we had an opportunity to come back down and get a score.  
I always talk about our defense. Especially going down to crunch time. I think
it's important, it's very important for our guys to really step up to the
plate and make plays.  
I think the statement that Zaire made, we got to get some, we have been here
before, for the most part he was saying it's time to buckle down and let's
play defense how we're capable of playing it.  
I thought that, well, in that game you could see they were attacking us, but
they were really killing us on the second shots. I thought we didn't get back
and get the rebounds. But the wear and tear was very evident in that game.  
I thought a big play in this game was when McNeal goes to the free throw line
and he misses one and he makes one, which ties it up. Now we got the ball
going down the stretch. That's different than when you're tied up as opposed
to one down.  
And of course, J.T. was able to go ahead and make a play. And not only that we
come back and we make a stop, but they have a traveling violation -- um, Leo
goes to the free throw line, makes some free throws. So we did the things we
needed to do to get the win.  
  
Q. If you could take us through the situation on J.T.'s foul. Did he say he
couldn't shoot them? Did you guys determine he was too hurt to shoot them? And
then talk about putting him in, trying to put him in two seconds later and
refs wouldn't let him in, take us through that.  
COACH ANDERSON: It was obvious he was hurt. The guy laid there for a while. He
was holding his hand the whole time. And so, you got to make a decision
whether you're going to leave him out there to shoot the free throws or he's
injured, and he was.  
I asked him personally, Are you hurt? He said, Yeah, Coach, I'm hurt. And once
he came over and sat down, okay, he is that kind of guy. Hey, Coach, I want to
go back in. Of course, we tried it and it didn't work. But he was hurt.  
  
Q. Could you describe the extent of his injury.  
COACH ANDERSON: Pardon me?  
  
Q. Can you describe his injury.  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, if you watch him, he's been wearing a pad. And I thought
that he got fouled pretty hard. I don't know if everybody was watching, he got
fouled pretty hard. And he's already, I mean -- this has been going on all
year long and it's one you just keep banging, banging on his wrist.  
  
Q. Tell us what happened to his wrist during the course of the year. Was it
a sprain or broken?  
COACH ANDERSON: It was a bad sprain early in the year. So he's been playing
injured. I mean, that's -- that tells you the makeup of this kid.  
  
Q. Do you consider free throw percentage or anything like that when deciding
who to put in? I guess Kim English has a lower free throw percentage than some
of the other guys that you had available.  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, I did. I had that thought. But I also had the instinct,
the intuitiveness to say, Hey, this guy's been on a roll today. I think he's
feeling it.  
And last, we played on Friday, he made four in a row. So with freshmen you
never know when he's hot -- when it's hot, it's hot.  
  
Q. What was your read on the team with about a minute left? I don't know if
it was exactly Zaire's words that brought them back, but did you feel like, as
Leo was describing, that they were kind of drooping a little?  
COACH ANDERSON: I thought they were a little. Well, you could say because they
had a nice lead. But I told our guys that Marquette was going to make a great
run and they did, they made a great run. And when you can knock free throws
down like they can knock them down, you're going to always be a game and you
got the guards that can attack.  
But I did not see any panic in our guys. That's the key. They may have been
tired, but they did not panic. So I saw that look I've been seeing all year
long. It's kind of like, We have been here, done that. But it was great to
hear somebody say it. Because it's not -- it was not only for those guys that
were out on the floor, it was for the guys on the bench too and you can just
see, it lifted up our guys.  
  
Q. Talk about the play that you had to basically win the game with Tiller
going down as a clear out. What did you see and why did you think that play
would be successful?  
COACH ANDERSON: I thought all during the game that J.T. was getting to the
basket. He was getting to the basket and coming off there strong. And Leo
presents a big, a tough matchup for a lot of people. So we wanted to isolate,
we wanted to try to take the last shot, take as much time off the clock as we
could.  
And so you saw the isolation where J.T. came off the screen. And one thing
about J.T., when he goes full speed, he's going to the rack. I thought he was
going to make the shot, to tell you the truth. But it gave him an opportunity
to make a play.  
And that's what's the beauty of our basketball team. Leo makes plays going
down the stretch, Matt Lawrence makes plays going down the stretch, Kim
English making free throws, DeMarre Carroll makes big plays defensively. We
come up with the basketball to keep -- to keep us in it.  
So guys continue to make super plays for us going down the stretch and it was
J.T.'s time. So I put him in that position and he made a play.  
  
Q. Going back to English a little bit, I think at the end of the first half
he had 28 points in his first 17 minutes of NCAA tournament play. Just talk
about a freshman coming in and doing what he had done through that first game
and a half of the NCAA tournament?  
COACH ANDERSON: Maybe the tournament is his breakout. He's been playing -- he
had some games where he played well. But I think that the thing I like about
him, he's doing other things other than just shooting the basketball. But he's
playing with a whole lot of confidence right now, and our guys know that.  
Friday night he played, I thought he played really well. He had tonight in six
minutes, this guy had 15 points. I always talk about quality minutes and I
hear people talk about, you know, playing for Missouri you play 27 minutes, 24
minutes a game, 27 minutes, for us is the equivalent of 40 minutes for
somebody else. There's quality minutes and there's quantity of minutes. A lot
of people just like quantity of minutes. I like quality minutes.  
You look at his stat line and this guy it's unbelievable what he did tonight,
17 points in 12 minutes.  
  
Q. Obviously Kim English's going to be remembered for things he did well, or
at least one of his shots. I saw you were yelling at him a little bit. Did you
have to just talk to him about not trying to play over his head a little
bit?  
COACH ANDERSON: Every now and then I have to remind him of that. But I think
that's the confidence of a guy that can score and shoot the basketball. He
never thinks he's going to take a bad shot. He never does. And I always
encourage our guys to take good shots.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the specifics of the rule change that allowed you to
put Kim in, how that works in the college rules.  
COACH ANDERSON: The guy was -- J.T. was hurt. And so he was hurt in terms of
not shooting the free throw, and so you are allowed to bring somebody else in
to shoot the free throws. And of course, the rule is that when once he's out,
got to stay out until play starts. That's the rule.  
  
Q. Talk about Marquette's ability to get to the basket. Seemed look they
scored most of their points either driving or at the free throw line and the
challenge that they presented to you there.  
COACH ANDERSON: They did. Dribble penetration is the hardest thing to cover
and they not only did that to us, they have done that to a lot of teams. I
thought going down the stretch we got out of position a lot. We wanted to
pressure, but we didn't want to give them the lanes.  
And I thought Matthews did a tremendous job of really starting to attack them.
I thought that McNeal at times, he really did a good job of attacking us. But
that's what they do. I think they have shot 200 more free throws than their
opponents. So that's what they do.  
Our defense did a good job. They shoot 38 percent, so only, without putting
them on the line, I think it's a different ball game.  
But you got to credit Marquette. That's what they do. They have been winning
like that all year long. And I got to give a shout out to Dominic James. I
mean, the courage that he has to come out and to try to play to help his team,
and he almost pulled it off. I think just his presence there really helped
energize them in the second half. And that tells you what kind of kid he is.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, Coach. Congratulations.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and take questions for the student-athletes of
Wisconsin.  
  
Q. This is for anyone who wants to answer the question. Talk about last
night, the game got over about 10:15, obviously a very exciting deal. What did
you guys do last night? How easy was it to get to bed and how rested are you
guys going to be going into tomorrow?  
MARCUS LANDRY: It wasn't easy getting to bed, I tell you that. But it was a
great game. Guys really came out there to play. Just a great feeling. We are
going to ride on that. We're going to go and practice today and really work on
what we need to work on for this next game.  
  
Q. Marcus, Joe, I'm not sure what at this stage what you know of Xavier, but
can you talk a little bit about their front court and some of the challenges
that they present.  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: We don't know a whole lot. Seen them play on TV quite a bit.
They have had a great year. They're very talented. Very athletic and strong.  
It was interesting to see them in person yesterday, to see how big they really
are. And they really attack the glass like comparable to like a Michigan
State, I would say. But it's hard to compare teams, but we'll learn a lot more
here in the next less than 24 hours even, in the next few hours, I guess, and
be as prepared as we can be in a short time. Our coaches always do a great
job, so we'll have wide open ears and ready to learn.  
MARCUS LANDRY: Same thing. We don't know too much about them, but it was good
that we got a chance to watch them play yesterday before our game kind of to
see what they were. They're a very big team. So like he said, you kind of
compare them to Michigan State. I know they're going to be all over the glass,
just like those guys.  
So we have to be prepared and ready. We'll learn more about the team within
less than 24 hours here in the next hour or so and even tomorrow morning.  
  
Q. For Marcus and Trevon Hughes, Marcus, you grew up in Wisconsin. Can you
just talk about the state of basketball in Wisconsin given that you and
Marquette are both here. And then Trevon Hughes, I guess growing up so far
away, did you have any idea Wisconsin basketball throughout the state was such
a big deal?  
MARCUS LANDRY: Well, Wisconsin basketball has really been on the rise. Growing
up I didn't know too much about Marquette or Wisconsin. I really didn't get
into it until I saw myself developing as a player. But it's really been on the
rise. Only thing I know about it was the bugs.  
So it's just been a great experience to watch the teams grow over the years.
And some of the guys that came out of Marquette and Wisconsin, to watch those
guys play on beyond college basketball has been great.  
TREVON HUGHES: Coming from New York, I had never heard of Wisconsin or
Milwaukee. So therefore, Wisconsin, Marquette didn't exist in my head. I was
just all about the Big East schools. But I went to military school in
Wisconsin, I started getting recruited by Marquette and Wisconsin. And just
the talent level that's in Wisconsin is just -- it's great. Like people don't
like take it for granted any more that Wisconsin basketball is just for big
guys that's slow.  
But we can play. We shown people that we can play with any team out there and
it's good basketball. We are out here and Marquette is out here and they're
playing great without their point guard.  
  
Q. Trevon Hughes, the two programs, Marquette and Wisconsin, seem to play a
very different style of basketball. One is a smaller private school, other is
a bigger public school. As somebody that's recruited by both of them, do they
kind of really present a nice contrast for you in terms of what you want?  
TREVON HUGHES: I would say so. Marquette tried to recruit me, talking about
they going to be in the Big East and I'm going to be close to home, but that
didn't matter because Bo Ryan is from the East Coast, he made it out here. He
done a good job in the D-III level, in the Division I level. So he recruited
me.  
I liked the coaching staff, the team, the team that was here before me and my
teammates that's here prior. And that's like what drew me here because it's
such a nice group of guys and I wanted to be here. They made me feel like
family, so that's why I came.  
  
Q. Being from New York there's a stereotype of how the game is played there.
And it seems like it's the antithesis of how it is at Wisconsin. Was there any
trepidation of going to a system like that where it's a slower pace?  
TREVON HUGHES: No. But Coach always beat it in my head that don't try to make
the great play, make the good play. Coming out of high school I was pretty
flashy, always wanted to make the crowd say, Ooh and ah. But with kind of a
steady pace, it's more of a team game and when we need to, he let us play.  
  
Q. Joe, I know seeding kind of goes out the window at this point, but when
you guys found out that you were a 12 seed, did it give you a little more
incentive or did you come into the tournament with a little more chip on your
shoulder getting that seed?  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: I don't know if necessarily due to the fact that they gave us
a 12 seed. I think we were just pleased to be in the tournament given only 19
wins.  
But like I said, we thought we built up a good enough resume to be in. But I
think that you just need to find a chip on your shoulder other than being a 12
seed.  
There's 65 great teams in the tournament. You got to find other ways to have a
chip on your shoulder and we just were upset with a few -- the way a few games
went this year and that was enough motivation there itself. So the 12 seed
didn't really have a whole lot to do with it, but we just go out and play the
same way we do any night.  
  
Q. You guys are here so often, this is the 11th straight year and once you
get to the tournament, you have a habit of staying and making it a few rounds.
How much of that comes from the experience?  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: I think a lot -- it helps a lot. But this team, you saw a guy
in Jordan Taylor who made his first appearance in a NCAA game. Jon Leuer, I
don't know how much they played last year, but the first real significant
playing time in a NCAA tournament. So there's these guys next to me are
experienced along with a couple others, but just the kind of the way the
system goes.  
And this team is just doing a great job, as have other teams in the past here
at Wisconsin, it's just the way the system works and it's working its course
right now and doing a good job.  
  
Q. John or Marcus, can you talk about the length of the timeouts and what
you guys do as players? Does it disrupt your rhythm at all? Does Coach Ryan
have enough to say during those timeouts?  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: Is it longer?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: Okay. It seemed a lot longer. Yeah.  
MARCUS LANDRY: Go ahead, John, I mean Joe.  
(Laughter.)  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: Well, yeah. I mean our -- he has so many rules, I mean, he
just had to pour his water into a cup. And so we can't have our managers on
the bench much, so we have some of our red shirt players who aren't going to
be able to play in these games, they sit our chairs down, so that they're not
used to that. So maybe that takes up the extra 30 seconds because it really
didn't seem any different. But maybe because they're not so used to doing
that, they're a little slow with that.  
We were joking today at breakfast about I almost fell down because the chair
wasn't behind me. Right where it usually is because of the managers. So maybe
that took up the time. Because it really didn't seem any different. I didn't
feel any different.  
MARCUS LANDRY: Well, I guess we just get more rest. I guess that's a good
thing. I don't know, it gives you longer time to recover and just go out there
and be ready. I mean, it's great for guys that play a lot of minutes to have
the extra minute or so or whatever how much time it is.  
  
Q. I know you guys don't know a lot about Xavier, but do you think the Mid
Major label is appropriate for them?  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: No. They're good. I don't know, I don't think the players are
-- I don't even know who is the judge of judging Mid Majors. I think when you
see Gonzaga, when you see Xavier, those type of teams and those teams come to
mind, I don't see them as Mid Major. They may use that title as a chip on
their shoulder and that's great for them, but they have earned the respect of
the nation as far as the players and coaches, media.  
They're a great team and I don't know if Mid Major is being disrespectful
even, I don't even know where to go with this, but they're such a great team,
they can play with anybody. I think that's the best way to put it.  
  
Q. Trevon Hughes, you talked about trying to make the flashy play. How long
did it take you to get over that and how often were you in Coach Ryan's
doghouse for that?  
TREVON HUGHES: It took me a whole year, my freshman year, you know. I spent a
lot of time sitting next to him. So it took me, I want to say just a year. But
my second year I kind of got the ropes as coming in as a guard and had to make
the good play. If I didn't make the good play, guess where I was at? Right
next to him again.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thanks, gentlemen. We'll take questions for Coach
Ryan.  
  
Q. Coach, Trevon Hughes was just up there and talked about coming from New
York he tried to make a lot of flashy plays and you told him just to make the
good play. How long did it take for your message to sink in with him and how
difficult was that process?  
COACH RYAN: Well, here's my reasoning, and it's not a theory, it's obviously
based on a lot of facts and observation: If you try to make good plays as
compared to trying to make great plays. Great plays work about one out of
every four or five times. Good plays will work three out of four, four out of
five times. So on passes, make the good pass, doesn't have to be the great
pass. And I learned that from my high school coach, because that was one of
the reasons he kept me on the team was because I could deliver the ball to the
scorers and that was after being the leading scorer in bitty league, by the
way.  
So he took the scoring away from me and said, Okay, you're the guy that's
going to play D and pass the ball and distribute the ball. So I made a behind
the back pass one game as a sophomore and he pulled me aside and he said, You
know, it's a good thing that pass got through. And I said, Well, you know,
that was the best way I could get the ball to him, Coach. Coach, he says, No,
no, I know, I know, but for your sake you're lucky it got through or you're
fortunate that it got through.  
So he would let me do some things through the legs or because Bob Cousy was
the guy that I always tried to copy, and it's kind of nice being on the Bob
Cousy Award Committee right now because I just always pictured him playing.
And every day I would go to the playground and try to do what he did.  
But I can see as a coach if a person's out there trying to be flashy and it's
not getting done, then you say, Don't be flashy. The key is, if you can make
it happen, then results are still what it's all about.  
So I've been after Trevon on things like that for a long time and he's
improved. There's no question about it. And I think he understands, especially
when at practice we chart points per possession and if you're turning the ball
over, you can't get a point on that possession, the statistics tend to go
against you. But he's learning. Not quite there yet.  
  
Q. When you see or read or hear that your team isn't as, quote, "athletic"
as some of the other teams you play, how do you interpret that? What does that
mean to you?   
COACH RYAN: I've been asked that a lot over the years and not just in Division
I, Division III also. Athleticism, a race car driver, good eye-hand
coordination, that's athleticism. Being able to jump high is athleticism.
Being able to hit a 98 mile an hour fast ball is athleticism. So it all
depends on how you want to describe the individual function of being an
athlete. There's a lot of different things that make people an athlete.  
So if people are looking -- if I have a bunch of guys who have good eye-hand
coordination, who anticipate well, who have good court awareness, all those
things are athletic traits. I think some people get very limited in their
scope when they think of athleticism as only speed in a sprint or high jumping
or long jumping as far as events or skills are concerned.  
So I really don't buy that we're not athletic, because I think in order to
play college basketball, period, to be on the floor, especially in an
environment like this, the NCAA tournament, you have to have athletes. It's
just people measure athletes a little differently.  
  
Q. Can you give your thoughts on Sean Miller and what he's been able to do
with the Xavier program?  
COACH RYAN: Yeah, I was waiting for somebody to ask me about Sean. Did he tell
you about nine years old being in Madison? We dressed him up in a Superman
contest at what I call -- I got a chance, the coach that I worked with, Bill
Cofield, we were talking about ways of getting kids to the field house in
Madison, stimulate interest in basketball. And you know, being an East Coast
guy myself and thinking that the basketball program needed a little promoting
and selling tickets and trying to be -- since marketing and economics was my
major, so we had this Roundball For Youth night.  
And I got a chance to get some people, we had Crazy George come in, anybody
remember Crazy George? Did all the ball handling, could spin 47 balls at the
same time. I'm exaggerating. And we had Tanya Crevier, who was the best
woman's ball handler, because I was very sensitive to making sure we covered
everything in the Roundball For Youth night. And we invited kids, we had an
inter-squad scrimmage, but I felt we needed one more ingredient. We needed a
kid, we needed somebody a little more entertainment.  
And I called up John Miller, and knew about Sean and these different things
that he had done as a nine year old. We bring Sean Miller into the field house
in Madison -- I still have people that come up to me and say, Oh, I remember
that night in the field house when you had this person and that person and we
had Stretch Gregory and Claude Gregory, Wes Matthews, Larry Petty, Joe
Chrnelich, Danny Hastings, a bunch of those guys at Wisconsin at that time and
had a good scrimmage, but afterwards all the kids got a chance to bring their
basketball down on the court after Crazy George, Tanya, and Sean Miller did
their thing.  
Well, we put together one of the other assistants, his wife had made a
Superman costume, put it on Sean. So Sean had this cape flying behind him with
the tights on, and I have video. (Laughter.)  
And I sent Sean a copy of this. And it was the most fun I think I've -- just
see the smile on the kids, the kids had a great time. And Sean and his dad
were there and he did some ball handling and some shooting and did some
things. And it was very well received. And that's how I first met Sean Miller.  
And then, of course, he coached at Madison with Stu a little bit and I
followed him as a guard. And you know, being from Pennsylvania, when you're at
Chester all the teams in the western part of the state they all think that
they're the best and the teams on the east think they're the best Lower
Merion, Coachfield, Chester, and then Beaver Falls and Shendley and the rest
of them on the other side of the state. So I had a chance to follow his teams.
Coach Miller's a very, very good coach. Both of them. So that's how I know
Sean and it's, he's just, he's a basketball junkie like I am. I mean just,
that's what we, that's in our blood. My dad didn't coach high school, but he
coached kids. So I kind of knew where he was always coming from.  
And we kind of played the same position and so probably more than what you
expected. But there it is. And if you ever, if anybody needs a $29.99 for a
copy of the video from me. Roundball for Youth night.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. How would you define a Wisconsin player? And if you had a guy out there
say who was a McDonald's All-American, a great talent who wanted to come play
for you, but didn't meet whatever criteria you have for bringing guys in,
would you say ever say, son, you're a great player, but we just, you wouldn't
fit what we try to do here?  
COACH RYAN: Well, we check players out first. And there's and it just because
we don't happen to get a lot of those types of players, I think that, you
know, in our society there are things that nobody ever wants to talk about but
are facts. The national attention that are given to X number of programs in
this country automatically, whether it's a commercial for a soft beverage and
they got one team's fans jumping up-and-down in the stands; or they got a
commercial about rivalries and dropping suitcases and picking it up for the
other one; or there are things that you fight at a Wisconsin in recruiting
where we don't get the national freebies. That's what I call them. In
marketing and exposure and everything else.  
But we're still a part of the game and we still think we can get players that
can play and we still think we can compete. And I've never turned away
somebody who said, hey, I really want to be at your school, but I only want to
stay one year. I mean, I don't know of too many people that have done that.  
But the guys that we, we have to have a connection. Academically, it is very,
very difficult at Wisconsin. Every coach tells you that, but I'll tell you
right now talk to a lot of coaches, and when I tell them the things that are
required they go, really? Yeah, there aren't any shortcuts at Wisconsin.  
So sometimes in the recruiting maybe your field that you get to select from
isn't the same, but when you say what type of person? Do they play hard? Are
they passionate about the game? Are they coachable? Are they respectful? Are
they studious? Do they have a direction, do they have a vision of trying to be
a better person and to make things better for others. I know that sound
idealistic, but all those things tend to make for some pretty good players in
what we do.  
And we have had obviously very good players. Players drafted in the first
round and players that have played overseas and players that are very
successful in business and other areas.  
But to say -- it kills me inside -- not kills me, because it just, I think
it's hilarious, oh, he gets the guys that fit his system. And I always say,
well if taking good shots, taking care of the ball, playing solid defense is a
system, well why doesn't everybody else have the same system? They do. It's
just, we are who we are, just like Xavier is who they are and Florida State's
who they are. And, but I always find that amusing when people say, he gets the
players to fit his system. And I have never been in a clinic and heard
somebody ever talk about a different system than what we have been preaching.  
  
Q. You talked about growing basketball in the state of Wisconsin, with that
story, can you talk about the state of basketball in your state? I know four
teams had winning record, you and Marquette are both in the second round of
the tournament, for people outside of the state, can you just talk about the
state of basketball within Wisconsin?  
COACH RYAN: It's very good. When I first got to Wisconsin in the '70s, a lot
of the high school coaches were coaching 2003, three sports. And we were
starting basketball camps and the Roundball For Youth nights and things like
that and it just seemed -- I'm not saying it wasn't good, I'm not saying it
was bad, I'm not saying or anything other than I know that it, with McGuire in
Milwaukee, that Marquette had that certain flare and, but let's face it, in
the '70s how many teams were making the NCAA tournament, how much exposure was
there on TV compared to now.  
And the other thing was, you know, the most notoriety other than in the '70s
than Marquette was the Eau Claire teams that were going to Kansas City. And
playing in the NAIA -- Ken Anderson was the coach -- and then other Division
III NAIA level teams were developing in the state of Wisconsin, which brought
national championships to the state, one school won four down in the southwest
corner of Wisconsin. Platteville.  
And, let's see, a few years ago, I don't know if you are aware of that, and
then Stevens Point won a couple and Whitewater won a couple and some other
teams got to the finals and things like that. And that got a little bit of
exposure, but as far as the Division I teams, all of a sudden -- the AAU
programs in Wisconsin for the most part they are run very well, they have
given opportunities to kids that did not have opportunities before. So the
development of the AAU programs in Wisconsin, 90 some percent very up front,
very you can deal with them, you can talk to people, can you say this is how,
this is what I expect, this -- don't call me about this, don't call me about
that. I don't want to hear this.  
And they listen because I don't deal with that stuff. And nobody tries to sell
me a player. And I'm sure it's the same way with the other programs.  
But high school basketball got better, because coaches were becoming, going to
more clinic, when I first started going to a clinic was in the early '70s BS,
and it was at Valley Forge, Bob Knight was one of the clinicians and I
remember the impact that had on me. And more and more coaches started doing
more and more things with a lot of factors, but one, there were very good
college programs in the state and not just on the scholarship level, and you
were having teams Green Bay, UWM, getting into the tournament besides
Marquette and Wisconsin.  
And all those things were good for basketball. So it's a combination of a lot
of things, but it's really been a lot of fun to come from the Philly area and
go into Wisconsin in the '70s and to, for 30 some years be around what's
happened in Wisconsin and be a small part of that. That's a lot of fun. It's,
basketball in Wisconsin's pretty good. I know a lot of people don't know that
much about it, but it's pretty good.  
  
Q. Players from what they have seen of Xavier so far compared it to Michigan
State in the way that they attack the glass. Do you agree with that and what's
your assessment of Xavier from what you've seen so far?  
COACH RYAN: Our players said they were like Michigan State? I think because
one of the assistants said that. And our guys listen. So, yeah I mean they
are, they're out rebounding teams by what? Eight, nine, ten, somewhere in
there. And they're long and bouncy and aggressive. And they have numbers.  
So that tends to be like a Michigan State, because you try to look at certain
things and say, okay, what does this team have, this team has depth. What does
this team have, this team has size. This team has quickness, this team has
great outside shooters.  
So one of the things that's been mentioned, obviously, is that Xavier's very,
very tough on the glass. And that would be a great comparison to say they're
like Michigan State.  
  
Q. I apologize if you've been asked about this before, but with Wisconsin
and Marquette at the same regional, did, do you ever recruit the same
players?  
COACH RYAN: Sure, it happens. Recruit the same players at a lot of schools in
the Big-10 that they recruit. Marquette, DePaul, Iowa State, there's other
leagues also that recruit Wisconsin, we recruit other states, other schools
recruit our state. We recruit against Green Bay and Milwaukee too because
sometimes there's a player that can play right away or maybe feels they can
play right away, that may be at one of those schools that, which Green Bay and
Milwaukee are pretty good at, maybe not every year, but Marquette's not the
only school that you recruit against in Wisconsin.  
  
Q. With the two schools seem to play in pretty distinctly different styles
of basketball. Does either, do you feel like that that gives kids an, I guess,
a good, a clear choice in what they're looking for?  
COACH RYAN: Well, I think that kids are smart. The kids we want are the kids
that are looking for the best education, the best environment, the best --
there's so many more things other than styles of basketball that a young man
-- what did you choose a college for? Well I would hope that it was an
intelligent decision about the environment and what's offered and what majors
and everything else.  
So it isn't just about a style of basketball that a young man or a young woman
chooses a college. That insults their intelligence. So we are who we are, they
are who they are, and Green Bay does what they do and Milwaukee does what they
do and people choose a school.  
I don't know if style of play is going to be the thing that is the most
important thing in a young man's mind. Because if you can get a layup and you
play at Wisconsin, you're going to get a layup. If you can get a layup at
Green Bay, you get the layup. You get a good shot. I haven't seen any of the
four programs not try to take good shots. And hopefully they're there to get a
Wisconsin degree. The ones that are playing for me. That's all I care about.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you, coach.  
COACH RYAN: All right.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and take questions for the Xavier student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Jason, did you guys watch the game last night? And were you rooting
either way for Wisconsin or Portland State or Florida State to win?  
JASON LOVE: After our game we stayed here and watched the first half, and as
far as who we were going to play, we are just excited to make it past the
first round and be here and we're part of the last 32 left and we're able to
play another day.  
  
Q. B.J., what do you know about Wisconsin? Talk about them a little bit and
what you've seen from what you've studied so far.  
B.J. RAYMOND: We know that they're a great team. We know they like to walk the
ball up. They're a very defensive- minded team. They're similar to St. Louis
and Miami, Ohio team with the way they play defense and the way they walk the
ball up.  
They have a great junior point guard and they have Landry on the inside who is
a tough -- he's tough to handle. It's just a good team. They're from the
Big-10 and they have a lot of confidence right now.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, talk about the schedule that you played and it's
pretty ambitious and the challenge that it gave you and did you like playing
that type of a schedule .  
JASON LOVE: Oh, our goal this year was much like last year was to play the
toughest schedule to put us in the best position to get a good seed in the
tournament. We feel as though we got really good players and we were confident
going into each game this year and we weren't intimidated at all by anybody we
played. It really prepared us for the tournament game that we're about to play
tomorrow and yesterday. I think that it definitely put us in a great position
as far as seeding and just being ready to compete against teams, upper echelon
teams of the NCAA.  
  
Q. B.J., we're going to hear again that a lot of the teams that Wisconsin
plays are more athletic than Wisconsin. Wisconsin is not as athletic. I don't
really know what that means. Do you know what that means when they say a team
is not as athletic as another team?  
B.J. RAYMOND: No, we don't really listen to things like that. We know at
Xavier we just try to focus on the things that we do best. We just try to come
out and play hard every night and make sure that we're ready to play from the
get-go. We don't want to get punched in the mouth and we just want to make
sure that we play the whole 40 minutes of the game, and just whoever wins at
the end of the game, you know, just make sure that we played our best.  
  
Q. You guys talk about the extended timeouts what it means to you guys. How
does Coach treat them? Does he talk the whole time, does he give you some time
to yourself?  
B.J. RAYMOND: Well, I know for me the air's a little bit thinner up here. I
appreciate the longer timeouts and things like that. But you have a short
window of time to get used to a team and they throw little wrinkles at you,
and the coaches during the game they make adjustments. And it's important for
us during that time to just sharpen up and see how the game's going and just
try to get it tilted in our favor a little bit.  
  
Q. For B.J., can you just reflect on the last four years and where this
program's gone in that time?  
B.J. RAYMOND: Yes, you know, one thing that has never changed is the way we
play defense here. Coach Miller is always trying to make sure that all of the
schemes and things are the same and that's why I can credit to myself become a
becoming a better defender. And that's the one thing that's always hold true
for our team is that when we come out and we play to our ability, we do it on
the defensive end of the floor.  
Then also Coach has never ducked anybody. We have played some of the toughest
games and some of the toughest opponents that we were able to. For that, it's
made us and our coach and our system and our school it's got us out there a
little bit. And in the tournament the way we do things, from scouting reports
to going over personnel, we haven't changed that from day one and now that
helps us during tournament time.  
  
Q. B.J., I know the team really shies away from any notion that you're a Mid
Major. Do you still carry a little bit of a chip that you're not a -- you
don't come from a football conference and does that in some way make its way
into the program?  
B.J. RAYMOND: Yes, of course. We always have a chip on our shoulder. But we
always do that at Xavier. We always try to play our best and try to win every
game.  
Of course sometimes when you play different schools who have bigger names and
things like that people might say it's a big game but every game at Xavier for
us, we feel like it's a big game. And we go out and try to win every game and
sometimes we do and sometimes we don't.  
But we know that for the most part we just try to play hard and we try to
leave it all out on the floor every day. It doesn't matter what conference
we're in or what, we just try to come out and play.  
  
Q. Derrick, B.J. talked about his assessment of Wisconsin, talk about what
you think, what your assessment is, what you've seen so far from tapes .  
DERRICK BROWN: They're a real good team. They're very well coached. I think
that's the strength of their team, very well coached, disciplined, they don't
take bad shots. And it's going to be a war, but I feel like we're ready and
prepared.  
  
Q. Derrick, how important is physical strength in your program?  
DERRICK BROWN: I feel like it's very important. It's important in every
program, but we got a pretty good weight coach in a guy name Chris Rounds, he
does a pretty good job with us and I think he prepares us in basketball
strength. It's different types of strengths. I don't think it came down to us
bench pressing, you know, a thousand times, we would be the best. But he puts
us in a good position where we have the ability to go out there and compete
against the best teams in the country.  
  
Q. Follow-up on a question that was just asked, you know, the fact that
you're not from a football conference. Is it an attitude or a history or
tradition that allows Xavier to supercede that and kind of like a Gonzaga and
rise above any questions about the conference you're in or the program not
being with the Ohio State's, so to speak.  
B.J. RAYMOND: Me personally I don't necessarily know, no disrespect, but I
don't know what football has to do with basketball. Basketball, we simply
recruit to the best of our system. I never have known of any school that
needed a football team to be a good basketball team. We just focus on playing
good basketball at Xavier. And just making sure that we have the right players
that fit our system and they want to play basketball to the best of their
ability.  
DERRICK BROWN: We can't control what conference we play in either, you know.
It's not like it's a flip of the coin, we're in the conference and that's what
we have to deal with. We play against the best teams in the country too. So we
don't try to shy away from teams, I don't think. Coach puts us in the best
position to win games.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, gentlemen. We'll take questions for Coach
Miller.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you got your coaching start at Wisconsin back in the early
'90s, I wonder if you could reflect on that time starting off at Wisconsin and
now how you feel about going up against Bo Ryan's team tomorrow?  
COACH MILLER: Yeah, Wisconsin is a very meaningful place for me. That's where
I got my start. If I wasn't hired by Stu Jackson then, who knows where I would
have gone out of college. But Stu Jackson gave me my first opportunity and I'm
forever grateful for him and the staff that I was a part of in my first year
as a college coach, included Stan Van Gundy, who remains one of my closest
friends, Ray McCallum, who is really a terrific coach. And I learned so much
not only at the University of Wisconsin by that staff, but Big-10 basketball,
what it means and the passion that the fans have for their universities. And
it was -- I couldn't have had a better start or first year for me and that
allowed me to get other opportunities.  
  
Q. I was wondering how you handle these longer timeouts. Do you ever run out
of things to say?  
COACH MILLER: It is different. It's something that when you're in the
tournament in previous years that you're more ready for. It really knocks you
off guard when it is your first time because they are a lot longer. But it
really, to me, helps the quality of play. Players in mid March have been
through so many games that the longer timeouts really allow the team to be
fresher and you don't have to sub to get your players breaks as much in the
tournament, those timeouts really take care of that for you.  
  
Q. A lot has been made about the 12th seed that Wisconsin has. When you were
watching the game last night what is your assessment of the team and what you
guys are going to need to do tomorrow?  
COACH MILLER: Well, once you get past the first round, or if you're not one of
the top two seeds, even in the first round, it really comes down to who plays
better on a given day.  
There's not a lot of separation between teams. I'm sure Wisconsin, Big-10
tested, a perennial power, a team that's been in tournaments before, I look at
their senior class and what they have accomplished in their four years and
it's amazing.  
So to play that team tomorrow, we look at it as out of the 32 or 33 games we
played this year, among the most difficult tests. And really it should be. The
Sweet 16 is on the line.  
But Bo Ryan is somebody that any young coach has to admire. I'm one of them.
What he's done at the University of Wisconsin, his system, his style, the way
he recruits, the toughness that his team displays, year-in, year-out, as faces
change, their identity remains the same. It's very admirable and a lot of the
things that he does with their program we try to do at Xavier.  
So we're really looking forward to a great game and I hope it is a great game.
We're going to have to play among our best to advance.  
  
Q. You talked about one of the toughest games you'll have to play, you've
played a very ambitious schedule and that's been kind of one of the stamps
you've put on this program. Just talk about your scheduling philosophy, who
will you play, who won't you play and how do you determine how you fill out
your non-conference?  
COACH MILLER: We want to play a very, very challenging schedule. Two reasons:
One, we want to prepare ourselves to have the best opportunity to win our
regular season conference championship. And it's amazing when you go through
tough Novembers and Decembers how your team is more prepared for the rigors of
conference play.  
Number two, and it's the obvious one, it gives us an opportunity to qualify
for an at-large berth in the tournament to improve our seed, to get those
marquee wins that I think the Selection Committee has very honestly stepped to
the forefront and said you have to have this to be a part of the tournament.  
I go back, Missouri's here with us, it seems like three years ago we played in
the San Juan Shootout, but in that tournament you had Southern California, you
had Chattanooga, you had Virginia Tech, Memphis and Missouri. Those three
teams we beat. And in large part we achieved our number four seed by
challenging ourselves to play in that tournament.  
It's always fun to talk about in March, but the reason you don't do it or not
everybody does is there's not a lot of room for error when the season begins.
I mean, you could clearly lose a couple tough games and it's not like you have
a four- or a six-week hiatus and then the season begins after Christmas.  
For us even the two games we played before Christmas, which I think ruined
everybody's Christmas in our program, Butler and Duke, we lost, but I'm very
confident in saying because we played both of those teams we were better after
Christmas having gone through it.  
  
Q. Xavier's obviously not one of the BCS football conferences, where do you
see Xavier in the kind of the college basketball universe right now?  
COACH MILLER: Here's the thing: College basketball is not college football.
That's A-No. 1. There's a distinct difference. When you look at Memphis last
year being in the National Championship game and you look at what this
tournament means, one of the reasons it's so special is on any given weekend
any team in this tournament can beat the opposition. And that's what make it's
so special.  
But for us, we try to compete to be among the best with who we are. And we
control the Atlantic 10 Conference, that's the conference we're a part of. And
Dayton advancing, Temple being in this tournament, some of the great teams of
the past, UMass, Temple, some of our teams, Xavier, been in the Elite 8 two
times in the last six years speaks for itself. But we try to be the best at
who we are.  
And what happens in the fall when you're at Xavier you could cheer for any
college football team. We're about college basketball and we have all the
support in the world that we need to be the best we can be and that's all you
can ask as a player and as a coach.  
  
Q. When you recruit, do you have any trepidation about going head to head
with the Big East or Big-10 schools?  
COACH MILLER: No. It's a little bit like non-conference scheduling. We're not
going to win every one of those battles, but for us to be a team that can
advance year-in, year-out in this tournament and get the seed of three and
four, which we have had the last two years, you got to have great quality
players and depth, a balance in classes and that really starts and ends with
recruiting. So we try to recruit the best players that we can get, and
sometimes we fall short, but our attempt is always to put a team together that
can advance in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Wisconsin's been to 11 straight NCAA tournaments. As a coach that's been
to four straight, can you put into context what that means?  
COACH MILLER: It puts Wisconsin probably in the top 10 percent or 20 percent
of college basketball programs. We have gone to eight of the last nine years
at Xavier. And I think we have tremendous pride in that, in the tradition that
we built. But for Bo Ryan to do that and him to follow on the heels of Coach
Bennett, they really have done just an incredible job building their program.
And what all coaches hope is that you can do it year-in, year-out, that
consistency.  
And that's really what we try to do at Xavier, to be back here next year, to
have the opportunity to advance as the faces change in your program. The NCAA
tournament almost comes to realize the identity that you have as a program.
And Bo Ryan and what Wisconsin has done is incredible.  
  
Q. To follow-up on the scheduling thing, is there anyone you won't play? Do
you only do home and homes, do you do a two for one? How do you pick which
battles you choose?  
COACH MILLER: Being that we play Duke in the Meadowlands, I don't know if you
realize this, I think they have won 18 years in a row there or Coach K's, I
think it's his favorite place other than Cameron Indoor Stadium, would
probably back up the fact that we're just looking for great opportunities.  
And certainly we want to play teams that will play us at home. And we now have
that ability.  
On a neutral court, we try to play the best teams and programs in the country.
I think for you as a coach to recruit the best players that you can get and to
continue to build your program, if that's what you shy away from, then you
really are caught in the middle.  
You have to be able to play great teams and in different arenas to be able to,
I think, elevate who you are. And that's what we try to do. And we're not
always going to win every one of them, but I think the philosophy is sound and
trying to be that team that can advance in this tournament.  
  
Q. In your experience how does it, how do you think a team reacts when it
wins a game like Wisconsin won last night?  
COACH MILLER: Meaning an overtime game?  
  
Q. Yeah. Coming from behind, winning, hitting a couple of tough clutch shots
and winning that kind of game.  
COACH MILLER: Well, it's kind of funny, at half time we left and one of the
themes of half time around the country was Wisconsin can't come back. The game
was over.  
And as evidenced by what they did in the second half, it speaks volumes about
their style and their toughness and you really have to beat them. They will
not beat themselves.  
So I think they play pretty much every game like they played last night. They
have been in 16 or 20 of those type of games this year. They're battle tested.
And I'll tell you this: We have been in a lot of tough games as well, a lot of
the teams that remain in the tournament, a team like LSU, Duke, and you look
around, even here in Boise, Missouri, Memphis, those are teams that we played
as well and being battle tested really helps you.  
  
Q. Is this a typical Xavier team for you balanced on offense, tough on
defense?  
COACH MILLER: It is. We don't have the experience in the back court that we
have had recently, but those guys, Dante Jackson and Terrell Holloway have
just done an outstanding job of filling in for the departure of Drew Lavender
and really allowing this team to have success.  
One of the identities of our program is that the oldest players, the seniors
have really had great senior years and have led us. If you followed us last
year Drew Lavender, Stanley Burrell and Josh Duncan were the story line of our
tournament. And this year that torch has been passed to B. J. Raymond C.J.
Anderson and Derrick Brown. And when you think about our first round game,
those three guys really had a lot to do with us advancing, and they're going
to have to play real well tomorrow for us to advance.  
  
Q. From your ties to Wisconsin, do you still recruit up there and just talk
about with Wisconsin and Marquette here, the state of Wisconsin basketball
even Green Bay and Milwaukee had winning seasons?  
COACH MILLER: The state of Wisconsin, when I was there, which is many years
ago, it has really flourished with providing talent. Some of I know the best
players, both at Marquette and Wisconsin come from in state. That's always
healthy.  
When you look at our program, the state of Ohio, I think in our starting five
Dante Jackson, B.J. Raymond, C.J. Anderson and Derrick Brown are all from the
state of Ohio. And that really helps make the place you're at special when you
can go with that in state talent. But you could tell that their state is
plentiful. We would like to carve a niche in that state, but there's not a lot
of room.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.  
COACH MILLER: Thank you.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started and take questions for the Missouri student-
athletes.  
  
Q. J.T., every one of your games when we talk about tempo being important
and all that, Marquette basically said we can't allow yourselves to be sucked
into playing their pace for 40 minutes. How do you go about forcing a team to
speed up the tempo and forcing them to play at your pace?  
J.T. TILLER: Just on the defensive end we have to pressure the ball and try to
get them out of their offensive groove. On the offensive end we got to push
the ball at them and not let them set up their defense.  
  
Q. Leo, you talked a lot about how much you've changed and how much you
matured at Missouri. But I'm hoping you could talk more about this and about
your relationship with coach and how it's grown over the time.  
LEO LYONS: Just from the beginning when I got here my position on this team
was totally different. Before I was trying to learn this offense and learn
this system on defense and now I'm a leader and I'm a captain. So I mean, I
can't slip up and I always have to be on top of my game to make sure the rest
of the guys and the other captains are on top of their game too.  
  
Q. J.T., building off the previous question, suppose you aren't able to
necessarily speed the pace up against Marquette. How central is that idea of
40 fastest minutes of basketball to your guys' playing philosophy. Do you need
to play at that speed to be successful?  
J.T. TILLER: Not at all. We love to play up-tempo, but at the same time the
way we practice we're just ready for any style of play that's thrown our way.
So if they want to slow us down and play a high court game, we're ready for
that. If they want to speed tempo up and play that type of game, we're
definitely ready for that.  
  
Q. J.T. and Leo, talk a little about the leadership that DeMarre has
provided and how important he's been to this team this year.  
LEO LYONS: As far as energy goes these two guys on the side of me is probably
the heart of our team. DeMarre does it with his vocals. And J.T. goes out
there and plays as hard as he can. They call DeMarre the Junkyard Dog for a
reason. He works as hard as he can out there and J.T. does the same. So when
you sit there and watch them doing that, all you want to do is follow.  
  
Q. DeMarre, you guys always talk about defense and I know Coach likes that,
but do you think you guys get enough credit for your offense?  
DeMARRE CARROLL: To a certain point we do. But we're a defensive team. When
people see us, we want to be recognized as a defensive team. Mostly, either
our offense comes off of our defense, off steals and transition and easy put
backs. So I think we get great credit for our offense, but we just want people
to recognize us as a tenacious defensive team.  
  
Q. For J.T. and DeMarre, have you seen tapes of the old Arkansas teams and I
wonder if you had, how close you think your defense approximates theirs.  
J.T. TILLER: Yeah, we watch couple of times on the Arkansas like at the
beginning of the season, just to see that style of play that Coach wants us to
get to. I believe that we're getting close to that style of play and the way
they used to play back then. Just because of our intensity, our defensive
hustle and way we go after the ball on defense.  
DeMARRE CARROLL: Yeah, I seen tape, I was a ball boy, I was there, you know.
But when I look at it I kind of compare it to, J.T. and Zaire, kind of to
Clint McDaniel and Corey Bell, like a small version of Clint McDaniel and
Corey, who was two tenacious defensive players. And whenever you had to go
against them it was going to be a long night.  
So you know if you got two guys at the front of your defense like J.T. and
Zaire, it makes it easy for myself and Leo and the rest of the team to feed
off their energy.  
  
Q. J.T., particularly, I understand you guys have an altitude trainer, a
machine that approximates 10,000 feet above sea level. Does it make a
difference or do you even notice it?  
J.T. TILLER: We just go out there and play our game. If there's altitude
difference up here, we just take it with a grain of salt and try to get
through it. That's where our depth comes in. So I'm happy with that because
with all these people that we have, we really don't have to depend on any
machine.  
  
Q. But do you have the machine? You've had it for three years. I mean, did
you notice a difference?  
J.T. TILLER: I just go out there and play. You really can't ask me that
because two minutes into the game I'm going to be tired anyway. I'm going out
there and playing and getting tired like I usually do.  
  
Q. For Leo and DeMarre, can you guys contrast your style of plays and how
you guys complement each other.  
LEO LYONS: We always pride ourselves on being a good tandem down there. And it
seems like this whole year, you could probably stop one of us with a double
team, but it's probably impossible to stop both of us. And we feed off each
other a lot. We score off each other a lot.  
I know if he's shooting, I can crash the glass and we get an opportunity, and
we try to use our size and quickness to our advantage because we got a lot of
bigger guys guarding us. So we try to attack more off the dribble and create
for our teammates, if not for ourselves.  
  
Q. DeMarre, can you give us a sense of what Coach is like during a timeout
and especially during these extended timeouts, sort of run out of stuff to say
during the NCAA tournament timeouts?  
DeMARRE CARROLL: Not really. Coach, he can talk all day, but he just tries to
-- he really tries to motivate us and try to keep us calm. Because he knew we
were nervous -- most coaches, you know, we come out like we did the first half
and they will be all hollering and all that. But he knew we were nervous, he
knew we never been here before, and he approached it way different than he
would have like in the Big-12 season. So give credit to him, he changed his
coaching style and that just shows you how great of a coach he is.  
  
Q. Leo and DeMarre, yesterday you're playing against a 7-footer and you
talked about having the advantage in quickness. Can you talk about now going
against a guy like Hayward who likes to play maybe a little bit more like both
of you guys do.  
LEO LYONS: I watched Hayward, he's a pretty good player. He's a great shooter.
Right now I would say we would try to use our length instead of our quickness
and try to use our length to get more rebounds and length to finish on the
inside and to defend him as well so he doesn't get as many of his shots off.
So length would be our strength tomorrow.  
  
Q. All three of you have been around long enough, can you kind of take me
through the process of sitting back and having to maybe bite your tongue when
you weren't the leaders of this ball club and take me through the process of
now that you have taken ownership of the team.  
DeMARRE CARROLL: My approach when I first got here was sitting out a season
and then coming and playing the next season, you already had guys like Stefhon
Hannah and Jason Horton who was our leaders and I kind of took a step back
because, one, I was scared how they were going to look at me like I'm the
coach's nephew and I'm trying to step into a role already. So I kind of bit my
tongue, me personally.  
But this year, you know, the freshmen, they kind of told me, We need you to
lead. You're a big part of our team. We need you to step up. And ever since
then I just tried to step up verbally and I go out there and lead by example.  
LEO LYONS: I think the reason we struggled back then was because of the
leadership, not to blame those guys or anything like that, but now we have a
better understanding. And a lot of those guys were fresh just like we was into
the new system and they were still learning. But now we got guys that's been
here for three years, that's been working this system and we know it like the
back of our hand. So it's easy for us to go out and lead and be captains.  
J.T. TILLER: I just think that being the youngest, I definitely had to take a
step back and just see how the job should be done. The first two years kind of
got a glimpse of it every now and then of how you should be a leader, but now
this year definitely following Matt, Little Mike, Leo and DeMarre, you know
what it takes to be that captain and what you got to do on and off the court.
So I guess back then it was just taking a step back, but now I'm definitely
learning from these guys.  
  
Q. This one's for DeMarre. With all the success you guys have had running
the full court press over the last few years, are you surprised at all that
more teams don't use the same type of style?  
DeMARRE CARROLL: Well, I'm not surprised because this style, it's a lot of
freedom, and you got it takes a lot of dedication and a lot of 6 a.m.'s in the
morning and all that. But I think that we just paid the price and I think that
it was real great to be able to play this type of style, to be able to have
this type of freedom to be able to just play to our basketball ability.  
I'm not surprised that many teams -- many teams they just like to play a chess
match, you score and you run your offense, and we run our offense. But we like
to make it an organized chaos.  
  
Q. For all three players, forgive an old question, but what is the learning
curve like on the system, the defensive system, the playing that organized
chaos? How tough is it to learn? What's the hardest part about it?  
J.T. TILLER: The learning curve, you have to pick it up pretty quick. Coach
says you can learn it in an hour, in a day, in a month, you know, and the
faster you're able to pick it up, that's who is going to be on the court.  
But the learning curve, it's fairly quick. The hardest part is just knowing
where to be on the court in this organized chaos because you don't know what
the other person is going to do. So you got to learn how to read your
teammates and everything like that. So I think that's the hardest part.  
LEO LYONS: The hardest part to me would be like those second and third
efforts. You're used to seeing guys who make one hard effort on defense. But
with us we feed off each other, you might have to make five efforts in one
defensive play and we go all out. Some guys, you know, on the other teams and
things like that can pace theirselves, can play the whole game, but we can't
do that.  
The learning is just going out there and playing as hard as you can and a lot
of people don't know how to do that and it take a long time to learn how to do
that.  
DeMARRE CARROLL: I think the hardest part is to be able to read off each
other. And I really think the two hardest people in the press is J.T. and
Zaire because I'm at the point of -- and I just run and I jump and they have
to read off me. So it just shows their intelligence to know basketball. So I
just think the hardest part is to read off each other.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thanks, gentlemen. We'll take questions for Coach
Anderson.  
  
Q. Coach, every game it seems like we talk about tempo and that being
important to your team. But how do you force another team, what goes into
making them play your style?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think if any team comes into a game you want to play the way
you're capable of playing. I think for us it's about our defense. And that's
what we always talk about with our basketball team. If you talk to any of our
players, they know we're going to hang our hats on defense, make our defense
with the pressure that we try to apply and disrupting what other people want
to do. We're going to attack you on defense, and not only that we're going to
try to attack you on offense as well.  
So it's kind of like a double-edged sword. We're going to take you on the
offensive end and defensive end. We're going to make you work and -- but I
think that more than anything else I think we can make adjustments and I think
you saw that yesterday. A team that played us a zone, kind of slowed us down a
little bit. And we didn't make shots and so we weren't able to really -- but I
still thought our defense was pretty good.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the challenges that DeMarre's had to overcome to
become the player that he is and how that's sort of impacted the player that
he has become?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think when he came out of high school -- of course, he's
been in winning programs in high school, he won a couple of state
championships. And then I think when he went to Vanderbilt, I think that as a
freshman you got to progress and you got to mature and grow and I thought they
had him in a certain role that he was playing. And of course, I've been
knowing him all my life, so I knew the player he wanted to be.  
And so I think that probably after transferring, I think the biggest year for
him was that year sitting out. I think he got a chance to really work out with
us and just to see how up-tempo basketball, not only that, how he can have an
impact on our program. I thought he was a proven player in the SEC. And so,
coming into the Big-12 I just thought that year sitting out was going to be
huge for him.  
And obviously the last year was probably a downer for him because of the
things that took place, some away from the court. But I think on the court he
got injured, but I think that his true character showed even from that
situation because him hurt, playing hurt and it just showed me what type of
mentality, the toughness that he has and I thought that he helped our
basketball team continue to compete.  
So with that being said, DeMarre, I think, coming in this year, this summer, I
thought he really, really worked extremely hard to expand his perimeter game,
not forgetting who he was, which is always remind him, you're the Junkyard
Dog, you got to do that. But I thought he expanded his game, putting in many,
many nights shooting in the gym. And he's brought that confidence into this
season.  
  
Q. Mike, the Cornell coach said maybe that the thing about your team that's
underappreciated is the way you play offense, the way you don't turn the ball
over and are pretty efficient. Maybe just sort of generalize what your
offensive philosophy is and why you think it's worked so much better this year
than the last couple.  
COACH ANDERSON: I think if you look at our team, we're a team that runs and
executes. So we can push the ball down the floor and I want our guys to take
good shots. And those are some shots this they take every single day in
practice, the things that we work on. So I think with the way we play, it's a
motion offense, where all five guys touch the basketball. I think versatility
is a strength of ours. Our guards -- our forwards can become guards. Our
guards can become forwards. And so when you got that, offensive scheme, and I
think what you want to do is put guys in position where they can have success.
And I think that's why you see Leo a lot of times, he's probably one of the, I
think, leading guys getting to the free throw line, because he's a hard
matchup and I think basketball to me is about advantage, disadvantage. But I
think that we value the basketball. Meaning that we take good shots more than
anything else.  
But I think it's because we're an attacking team. So you'll see us with our
defense, I think it spearheads all of it because you get a lot of easy
opportunities. So that's why you start seeing the percentage go up. There have
been some halves where we have shot probably almost 65 to 70 percent. And a
lot of those are easy opportunities where we attack the basket, where fatigue
has come in, because of our defense. I still think our defense is a big key to
what we do. But I think that offensively we take pride in taking care of the
basketball.  
  
Q. Kind of following up on my last question, Coach Williams and Marquette's
players said similar to what a lot of people have said before playing you, we
can't allow yourselves to get sucked into playing that tempo the entire game.
But it seems a lot easier said than done. It seems they know they're not, they
can't do it going in, but you guys have been able to force other teams to do
that. Why do you think that is?  
COACH ANDERSON: Well I think when you work on playing against a pressure team
you want to attack. I think you want to attack. And so there are going to be
opportunities and even with us there's some give and take. There's a big risk
in terms of pressuring and getting after people because you're going to give
them some easy opportunities every now and then they're going to have some
open shots.  
But I think as the game goes on those shots that you were making or shooting
early on, you're going to continue to take them, and they're not going. And
why is that? I think that's where the affect of our defense has come in. Your
legs. I mean those shots are open, but they're not open.  
  
Q. The full court press is kind of what you grew up with and what you use
and you used it successfully, but not many other people use it. Why do you
think that is?  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, I think that you know, we give our guys a lot of freedom
to make decisions. I think that's what our defense is all about is putting
guys in position to make decisions.  
And I don't know why other guys don't do it. I think you see teams playing
more up-tempo basketball, but in terms of pressing and getting after it, a lot
of people think pressing is maybe putting a guy on the ball and trapping one
time, they throw it out and you're going down the floor.  
I think we probably take it another level. We may trap another time and we may
trap three or more times before you get to across half court. But that's what
we do. And I put guys in position to make decisions. And with that being said,
that's letting them take control. I think most coaches want to be in total
control. But I let our guys make decisions.  
  
Q. The other day you were talking a lot about character and responsibility
on your team and I wanted to go back to last season when you suspended the
players. Did you see any possible downside to that in your own situation given
that the record wasn't that great and things just weren't going that
wonderfully for the program.  
COACH ANDERSON: No, I never gave that even a thought. I thought what I was --
when I made that decision I made that decision without even having to question
myself. And the reason I say that is because of who I am. And I was hired to
do a job. I was hired to come in and win ball games, I know that. I also was
hired to, I guess, to clean a culture or to have a brand of basketball to get
kids educated, get kids to become productive citizens once they leave.
Graduate kids. So no, it was never in my mind a -- I knew I was doing the
right thing. There's no question about it.  
  
Q. What's the maybe the biggest misconception about the organized chaos that
you use defensively?  
COACH ANDERSON: Well people think we're just hully gully, whatever you want to
call it, I don't know. I mean, you guys probably got all the acronyms. You got
all the things of what it is.  
I think it's a thing of beauty. I think the uglier the game, the better it is
for us. But I think if you look at what is taking place with our basketball
team, and it was just like that in the '90s with Arkansas it was like that
with my teams at UAB. We're probably one of the more efficient, most efficient
teams. Especially offensively as he alluded to. Because we just want to
disrupt what you want to do.  
It's easy to back up half court and just let you do what you want to do and
then we come and do the same thing. Well, that's not what I want to do. I want
to play, make you make plays. Not only that, I want you to play other guys
that you -- most guys are going to play six, seven guys, that's what they're
going to play.  
So I, you know, I enjoy it. I'm one of the few I guess that do and hopefully
we can continue to have some success doing it. But I think that we're not just
a feast or famine and I think that's what people sometimes don't forget. And
what I mean by that, we don't just feast and famine on just turning people
over, we play good defense. Our defense is probably the best in the half
court. And I thought that you could, you saw that last night. It wasn't about
stealing the basketball, and I think that's the hardest thing is to get our
guys to understand, it's just not about stealing the basketball.  
And I think we have come a long ways this year to the point where we can make
adjustments as the game goes on. And I think that we're probably one of the
most disciplined teams you're going to see. Especially offensively.  
  
Q. You talked about your team still making progress with the system. Have
they reached the old standard of 40 minutes of hell and how close does this
system approximate what you used to see at Arkansas?  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, I tell what you, we're doing it a lot better. We're
progressing in the right direction, we're not totally where I would like to
be, but, and understandably, we got seven new guys that never played at this
level. So you're trying to implement them and just trying to put all that
together. But I can't say that I think that the seniors, Tiller, Zaire Taylor,
whose come in and been a tremendous impact, guys like Keith Ramsey, they were
recruited to play this way and I think they have helped us progress a lot
quicker.  
And with freshmen they're going to be up-and-down and our freshmen have had
moments. Yesterday Kim English had some great moment, I thought Marcus Denmon
played well yesterday, so we have got more pieces that are really starting to
step up for us and what better time than right now.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about your scheduling policy. How do you go about
filling your non-conference schedule? Are you looking for home and homes games
against higher opponents, is there anyone you will or won't play, just talk
about that a little bit?  
COACH ANDERSON: We'll play anybody home and home. We certainly will. And of
course we have got the Pac-10, Big-12 Challenge. I think that's been helpful
in scheduling. We play some SEC teams. And we have got some people that want
to play, some don't want to play, but it's been a chore to schedule. But
hopefully with the success we have had, TV can come in and help us because I
think our team is an entertaining team. I think people enjoy watching our team
play.  
  
Q. Does your philosophy change at all with as your program gets better? When
you first maybe took over at Missouri did you have the same philosophy or now
are you trying to schedule better games to get better seeds and that kind of
thing?  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, I thought our schedule this year, I thought it was
pretty good. I think that the biggest key about when you schedule, you got to
win games. I mean, you hear a lot of guys complaining that, hey, my schedule's
this or the schedule is that, it's tough and RPI and all that. I don't care,
you got to win games. I think that's the bottom line.  
And so I think we got to, we had a very competitive schedule and as time goes
on and it will get more even more competitive. I thought our league was really
good and I think people are seeing that. It was really really good. It was not
just a clearcut favorite in our league. And I think that as tournament play
continues and unfold, I think the nation will get a chance to see the Big-12
was not as down as everyone thought it was.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you coach.  
COACH ANDERSON: All right. Thanks.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started and take questions for the student-athletes
of Marquette.  
  
Q. Maurice and Wesley, you saw yesterday probably some of the pressing that
Missouri did against Cornell. You guys are going to be handling a lot of the
ball-handling duties at the guard position. How are you guys going to combat
the press tomorrow?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I think playing in the Big East gave us an advantage over a
lot of teams we have been pressed before, we have against Louisville, who was
number one ranked team in the country and we did a great job against that.  
We're just going to have to do what we do. We're going to have to move the
ball, be smart with it, but be aggressive at the same time. I think the reason
why they cause a lot of turnovers is because people are being tentative and
that's not our style of play. We got to be aggressive, but we got to be smart
at the same time.  
MAURICE ACKER: Yeah, just go off of Wesley, just pretty much basically being
smart and aggressive. Again, we done been through like some of the toughest
traps in the nation or whatever, so we got some experience with that. So
basically come out and do what we do.  
  
Q. Wesley and Lazar, if a coach came to you when they were recruiting you
and said, Yeah, we want you to come and play 24 or 25 minutes a game, would
you go with that coach?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I don't know. I think that a lot more would have to go into
that than just talking about minutes. How are you going to play those 24 or 25
minutes? How is the institution? How is the program? Are you winning?  
I think a lot goes into choosing a program than just how many minutes you're
going to play.  
LAZAR HAYWARD: I go off of what Wesley said a little bit. I think also the
style of the team's play. The type of character guys that are on the team also
as long as -- the institution and the type of the coach that they have.  
  
Q. To follow that up, obviously that's the case at Missouri. And other
people have said that most high quality recruits would tend to hesitate before
going into a system like that. So that's the point of the discussion. Can you
address it from that point?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: In that case, Missouri, they got nine high major players.
They are very active on both ends of the court, offensively and defensively.
They like to move, play quick, play fast, so you're not going to be able to do
that for 40 minutes. It doesn't matter who you are, you're not going to be
able to do that at the highest level for 40 minutes.  
So in that sense if you like that type of tempo, that type of style, that type
of pace, then 25, 26 minutes is not bad at all.  
  
Q. Wesley, talk about the state of basketball in Wisconsin? We saw Wisconsin
last night. Obviously you guys are having a great season. Just having grown up
in the state, what the state of basketball is like in Wisconsin .  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I think it's growing. I think that has a lot to do with the
foundation that the players have set before us at both Marquette, Wisconsin, I
mean, even Green Bay, UW- Milwaukee, and the recruiting from the coaches. The
coaches have been doing a great job getting people all over the country to
come to their program, their institution and play. So I think it goes hand in
hand with the players developing and the coaches expanding outside of their
region.  
  
Q. Going back to the other question, Wesley, I think you just said, if I
heard you correctly, that no matter who you are, you can't play 40 minutes at
Missouri's pace, but you, Jerel, Lazar each played 37, 38 and 39 minutes last
game. Do you anticipate the rotations to be a little bit different against the
Tigers than on Sunday?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: For us?  
  
Q. Yeah, for you three.  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: You can't be at your 100 percent best for 40 minutes. I don't
know, Lazar gets tired, I get tired, Jerel gets tired. There's points where
we're not at a hundred percent. And I don't know what they're doing at
Missouri, if they're a hundred percent and they can do that for 40 minutes. I
don't know how our rotation is going to be. We're not going to try to play at
that pace. That's their style. We're going to do what we do.  
If we can score quick we're going to score quick. If not, we're going to try
to guard and move the ball and that's where we're at our best.  
  
Q. Lazar, talk about playing against Lyons and Carroll tomorrow, they're
forwards kind of like you that step away from the basket a little bit more. Do
you feel like your game is similar to what you've seen out of them?  
LAZAR HAYWARD: Definitely. They're both kind of like face up four men and
they're both very, very talented, very athletic. It will be a good matchup for
myself and also Dwight. And you know, we matchup pretty much in the Big East
against guys like that all the time. So it's not nothing we're used to, but
those two are definitely some great players.  
  
Q. Talk about being tired sometimes during the game, what do these extra
long timeouts, how do they help you and what do you guys do in those extra
minutes that you have sitting there? Coaches aren't used to talking that
long.  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: They feel good. Just catching a breath, you know. Coach never
talks to us that long in a timeout because we're a veteran group, we're a
mature group. We know when we're messing up, we know when we're playing the
game the right way. So he doesn't have to say too much to us.  
So most of the time it's just what we see on the court, what Lazar sees, what
Mo sees, what I see, what Jerel sees, what Nic sees and we just keep talking
to each other and just keep getting each other going and for the most part
we're just catching our breath.  
  
Q. For any of the three of you. Your coach has been big on numbers. What are
some of the numbers that he's put forth for you guys in terms of what Missouri
does?  
MAURICE ACKER: He's been breaking it down for us as far as like when they
score in the offense like they normally score in the first 10 seconds or the
second 10 seconds or whatever. So basically we got to make sure we get back in
transition and matchup well, but that's when we're at our best.  
  
Q. What's it been like to be in your shoes the last three weeks since James
went out?  
MAURICE ACKER: It's been tough, but at the same time I'm thankful to be in
this position. Stepping into the shoes of Dominic James, he's been playing --
he's been having a great year or whatever. But it's been a tough transition
coming from playing 12 minutes a game to playing 30 to 35 minutes a game. But
every game I just got to get better each game.  
  
Q. Maurice and Wesley, you guys were talking about having to play
aggressive, but not playing at Missouri's pace. Where is that line and how do
you go about doing that exactly?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: We're a great team in transition. We're great when we get
stops, we can run, we can attack a press, when we can make two, play one and
pass out of it. So if we have a lane, we're going. We have done that all year.
And that's where we're at our best.  
But if we don't have that lane, that's when they're at their best when they're
scrambling from behind to try to back tip, matchup. I mean, they're a high-
energy defensive team. So we can't just attack it right away because after we
break the press if we don't have a lane, that's when we're at -- when they're
at their best.  
So we just got to play smart because we know where they like to trap in
certain spots on the court, and just -- and share the ball. And I think we'll
be all right.  
  
Q. Wesley, we can see Dominic James on the bench during the game. Toward the
end of the game he was basically eating a towel when the points were getting
close against Utah State. What's he like at timeout? Is he helping you guys,
is he trying to help coach or show you what he sees from the bench?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: He's animated, he's doing all of that. He's doing everything
but playing on the court for us. He's telling us what he sees, he's coaching,
he's giving plays to coach, he's cheerleading. Nic's doing everything for us
and we're definitely grateful for that because he could have went a completely
different route about it and pouted and just been upset and felt sorry for
himself. And instead he's pulling for us like he's playing.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thanks, guys. We'll have Coach Williams here
shortly. We'll take questions for Coach Williams.  
  
Q. Coach Williams, can you talk about facing Lyons and Carroll, and the
similarities maybe in their games and what Lazar does for you guys?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think Lazar's a really good player. I don't know that he
compares to Carroll or to Lyons. I think the combination of those two guys is
really difficult to defend. I think that's why they have had the success that
they have had this year is it is partly due to their style of play. But I
don't think that they get enough credit for how efficient they are offensively
and how good they are in the half court, rarely ever take a bad shot. They
will take the first quick shot, first good shot that they can take, that may
end up being quick, it may not.  
But both of those guys can score with their back to the basket, both of those
guys can bring it in transition, and both of those guys, no matter where they
catch it, can face you up and they're really hard to guard off the bounce. So
the combination of the two, maybe sometimes you see a team with one of those
guys, but when you see a team with two of those guys, it makes it really hard
to defend both of them.  
  
Q. You talked about maybe the in-depth preparation it took to get ready for
Utah State with all their set plays and now you're facing a team that's really
a contrast of that. Can you just speak to kind of the difficulty in packing
all that into basically one day.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think it's the same struggle that the other 32 coaches are
probably dealing with on Saturday and Sunday in the second-round games. I
think that you have to depend a lot on your assistants that have been assigned
that since selection Sunday. Both of our guys have done a great job with that
in preparation for Missouri and I think that we have been accountable for the
last 26 hours in regards to our preparation for Missouri. And it's still a
long time until game time. So we have got to continue to work.  
But you're right, I think that it's a delicate balance and a fine line to
determine how much to expound upon your next opponent and how much you have to
spend on what it is that you know you have to do as a coach in order to have a
chance for success against that opponent. So I think it's a combination of the
two, but I don't think that there's any way, if you were to be honest, that
you can get around the fact that it is difficult and in a short turnaround, to
prepare for a team as talented as Missouri is.  
  
Q. Coach, a bunch of the clips that we read about you the words "career
suicide" keep coming up. And so I guess what I was wondering is when you
decided to leave New Orleans, did you think you were committing career
suicide? And also, realistically, how long did you think it would take to get
to the point where you're at right now in the tournament coaching a team?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I'm sure there was a lot of documentation out there about a
lot of different things as it relates to my career. I don't know that I've
ever said since I left New Orleans that I felt like it was career suicide. The
writer of the article may have said that, and they're obviously entitled to
their opinion. But I have never, if you research my career path, and you
figure out where I started and where I am today, there's no way that you could
potentially possibly in your wildest dreams project that I would be sitting
here in this position.  
I've always had the same response. And in any of those articles that you've
read if they quoted me, the thing that I've always said is it's only by God's
grace that I've had an opportunity to be the head coach at Marquette. But I
also tell you this, it was only by God's grace that when I was 21 I had an
opportunity to make $400 a month as an assistant at the University of Texas at
Arlington. And I mean this without my ego speaking, I'm just as grateful that
I had chance to be an assistant at UTA as I am to be the head coach at
Marquette. And that's because I believe it's all been in God's plan.  
And for me to sit up here and think that I had the world figured out and that
I was going to leave New Orleans after being a head coach at 33 and then nine
and a half months later be the head coach at a Big East program, in the best
league in the country, and then 346 days later to be able to answer this
question from you, that would be way too much of me to think that I'm smart
enough to figure that out.  
I've just been blessed from start to finish. I don't know when it will end,
but I think life is very fragile and I think this business is really hard to
get any job, much less a good job. So I'm extremely thankful just to be where
I'm at.  
  
Q. Coach Williams, if you could talk a little bit about how difficult of a
job that Maurice Acker has to have to go from playing so few minutes to really
running a team and replacing an integral part of your team like Dominic was?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think it's a difficult adjustment no matter what. I think
like I said two days ago, the timing of the injury is probably as critical as
anything else because there was only 10 days left in the regular season. So
for you to go from a situation where you were only playing spot minutes to
having to play minutes that were absolutely critical for us just to have a
chance not to get blown out of the gym, I think Mo's been accountable in every
sort of way, every day since Nic has been hurt.  
But the thing that I would say is the same thing that I tell those guys when
we start individual workouts in the fall, if you want to be at Marquette, I
want to coach you. If you don't want to be at Marquette, I don't want to coach
you. But if you are here, I'm going to coach you. So whether you're a good
player or bad player or a role player or a starter, I'm going to coach you the
same way. And I think that I've coached Mo the same way when he was playing 7
minutes as I've coached him since he's played such a larger role since Nic has
been hurt. And I think that he's responded every day in a much better way and
I think that as he's responded better, it's allowed our team to respond
better.  
  
Q. Is Louisville the team that you would say most closely resembles Missouri
in terms of the depth they're trapping and pressing style defensively?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We talked about that last night, trying to think about who we
have played that we can comparatively speak to as we introduce Missouri to our
team. I don't know that there are two teams diametrically opposed more so in
the country than Utah State to Missouri. And there was no team to compare Utah
State to. But we had five days to prepare for them, so we had enough time to
explain it all to them.  
When you start talking about Missouri, obviously with the short turnaround,
the best team we could come up with was Louisville. Missouri's got nine high
major players, they play ten guys, nine of them are all going to have a chance
to play for money at some point in their career. And I think that within how
they play it is somewhat similar to Missouri -- or excuse me, to Louisville.
But Louisville would press different sorts of presses and then typically
speaking would go back to a zone. And then when the ball, when you were in the
half court and they were in the zone, when the ball went to the post, then
they became man. So you could potentially within one possession go against
three types of defenses.  
Missouri is typically some sort of pressure and they rotate what they do, but
typically speaking they go back to man, albeit they switch a lot of different
screens. So but, yes, to compare I think it's mostly to Louisville other than
anybody else.  
  
Q. How did being an assistant under Dale Layer help you become a head coach
and what's it like having the roles reversed with him now?  
COACH WILLIAMS: If he wasn't the best human being I ever known in my life, I
think it would probably be a struggle for the roles to be reversed. There's
been absolutely no friction in the transition or the role reversal. I think
the best thing that I learned from Coach Layer in the four years that I worked
for him is how to be accountable as a man and how to be the husband and father
that God intends for me to be.  
And I think from a coaching perspective, the thing that I probably learned
best from him is I thought that in game decisions he was as good as any that I
had been around up until that point in my career.  
I thought he made slight adjustments during the game that always gave our
teams chances for success because he has a keen eye for how we can make subtle
adjustments that will benefit our team in a great way. And I think that's
probably what I learned from him from a coaching perspective most. But the
thing that had the largest impact on my life is what he taught me as a person.  
  
Q. Do you recall how far back your fascination with numbers and precision
goes and do you sort of understand where it comes from?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, I really -- I mean this in a genuine way, I haven't
meant for my association with numbers to spark such a storm from the Boise
media. And I also understand that I started that on my own. So I'll continue
to handle it until such time as we leave Boise.  
But the thing that I would say is I probably am not as completely consumed
with numbers as you think. But I do believe that numbers always tell a story.
And it's easy to skew numbers to make them tell the story that you want it to
say.  
But I don't know that I necessarily know when it started. I am a precise
person. And I am a precise person in our profession. So it probably has
created some of the obsessive- compulsiveness that I have with it. But
everybody around me pretty much understands it, so they kind of leave me alone
and I try not to inflict it completely on them.  
  
Q. There aren't a whole lot of teams out there that run a full court press
all the time. Kind of seems like the ones that do make a name for themselves
and are fairly successful at it. Do you think there's a reason that more teams
don't do that?  
COACH WILLIAMS: That's a really good question. I think in order to play the
way that Missouri plays you have to have really good players and you have to
have a lot of them. And you know, like I said earlier, I think they have nine
high major players. And the way they play they can run guys at you in a myriad
of ways, their maneuverability within their personnel is really, really
strong. And then within how they play it only enhances their personnel,
because of how many possessions they have in a game.  
While other teams don't do it or more teams don't do it, why that is, I'm not
sure what the right answer would be to that.  
  
Q. Coach Williams, can you talk about the state of basketball in Wisconsin?
Seems to have become a basketball hotbed and if you think playing in the Big
East has helped Marquette separate.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, obviously I wasn't employed at Marquette prior to their
inclusion into the Big East, but I would say that the Big East is, in my
opinion, the best league in the country. So any time you can separate yourself
with the best, whether that be with a league or a coach or players, I think
that always benefits your institution and benefits your program.  
The one thing that I would say about Wisconsin high school basketball is
there's really, really, really, really, really, really good coaches that spend
a lot of time studying the game, the coaching clinics, and in Wisconsin are
well attended. Coaches from all across the state come to practices and I'm
sure they go to Coach Ryan's practices, Coach Jeter's practices at UWM.  
So I think per capita as far as the number of Division I institutions in the
state as it relates to the size, when you look at as the state's programs from
a high school perspective have continued to get better, I think it just helps
everybody. It helps the four year schools, not necessarily Division I, UW-
Platteville was ranked either in the top-3 in Division III all year long and
so I think there's a lot of good basketball in the state that's players and
coaches.  
  
Q. When Wesley was up here he basically said it's not possible to play your
best at Missouri's pace for 40 minutes. How important is it not to get sucked
into playing Missouri's pace and given that you have so many guys that play so
many minutes do you have to manage substitutions differently in this game?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't know that I -- I think that the guys will probably
play the same minutes that they have been playing combined. I may sub them at
different times for shorter periods of time. But I agree with what Wesley had
to say. I think if you try to play the way that Missouri wants to you play,
Missouri will win. And I really don't think that necessarily about their style
of play, but you can't completely play their style and negate your style.
Whatever that style may be.  
That's not necessarily Marquette. When they played Xavier earlier in the year
at A & M, at Kansas State, at Nebraska, you know, those teams didn't
completely sell out to playing their style. And I think when you play a style,
similar to the earlier question, when you play a style like that, and you just
say, hey, this is what we'll just do what you do, you're probably not going to
have success.  
  
Q. It seems like since Dominic got hurt he's really kept an active role with
your team. How might he help your guards deal with Missouri's pressure
tomorrow?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, I think that he's helped us in a lot of different ways.
He's very intuitive as a player, but I think that he's even, he has even more
wisdom as a person, despite his age.  
He's been through a lot in his career. But he's also been through a lot in his
personal life. And I think that he's continued to progress into the player
that we always hoped and dreamed that he would be. And I think that he's
continued to along that same path as a person. And I think that the
combination of those two have helped us not only in games, but in practices as
well.  
Their pressure is unlike any other that we faced although it's somewhat
comparable to Louisville, but they just keep coming at you and they keep
coming at you. So as best he can, he'll help us as much as he can.  
  
Q. A follow-up about Maurice. He said that when he had to take over and you
guys had the four game skid, he didn't say, well, it was, who you played, you
were playing four of the best teams in the country, he said that he felt it
was on him and that because he was the new guy in there. How did you manage
that? That can crush a young player.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I managed it the same way I manage him and the other 11 guys
on our team every day. It wasn't him. It was me.  
It's always on me. When we win it's because they're really good players. And
when we lose it's because I haven't figured out the perfect way to give them a
chance for success.  
So despite who we were playing or where we were playing, injury is a part of
sport. And I think that the reason that Mo would answer the question the way
that he did is that shows his character and how much he cares about his
teammates and how much he cares about our program.  
  
Q. I'm curious about your scheduling policy as far as non-conference goes.
Obviously with the Big East you're going to play a number of ranked teams that
will help you in RPI and stuff, what's your philosophy on filling out the non-
conference games on your schedule? Do you have who do you play home and homes
with, what do you try to do?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think your schedule should always reflect the personnel and
the classifications of the team that you're currently coaching. What I would
say is this: You need to play a schedule that best prepares you to give you a
chance to have success in your league. And that's my response whether I'm
coaching in the Big East or if I was coaching in the South League Conference.
Your preconference schedule should prepare you for what your conference
schedule is going to bring you and hopefully within your preparedness to play
in conference that that will trend towards you having a chance to play in post
season play.  
So obviously we play Wisconsin home and away every year, over the last several
years we have played in exempt events because of how the NCAA has changed the
ruling on when and where you can play an exempt event. So we'll continue along
that path and then the rest of the games that we play need to prepare our team
and the complexion of our team to play in the Big East.  
  
Q. Coach Williams, I was wondering how you manage these longer timeouts.
Seems like some guys have Leonard Hamilton last night sent his team out and
then realized that he had about another 20 seconds and pulled them back. How
have you managed the longer timeouts?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well I've had 92 people remind me in a positive way that the
timeouts were longer. That's probably been the best help that I've had.  
The other thing is I always try to get a drink of water now before I go talk
to my team because I know that my voice is going to give out during the
longest TV timeouts ever.  
I never coached in the NCAA tournament, so I'm not going to gripe about the
length of the timeout. And being that we were short in size and short as it
relates to depth, it's probably a benefit to us more so than anything else.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you, coach.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Thank you.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  

Marquette - 58  
Utah State - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and take a brief opening statement from Coach
Morrill and then go right to questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH MORRILL: Well, that was obviously an extremely tough loss. We gave
ourself a chance. We got up six and we missed some open shots, we turned it
over, we don't rebound a ball, all of those kind of things that can happen to
you. But we battled back in the second half and really gave ourselves a chance
to win. And as I told these guys, I can't be any prouder of a basketball team
than I am of this group, whether we would have lost or would have won that
game or the fact that we lost it.  
We made some adjustments at half and they came out and competed. I thought
Marquette really did a great job of getting to the free throw line and that
was probably the difference. We had a really hard time guarding their
quickness and strength. Even though our field goal percentage was pretty good,
you look at the free throws and that was probably the big stat. But we did
have a lot of chances. We had open shots and good looks and they didn't go
down.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Is it tough when you lose like this to not look at one shot or one play
or one moment that kind of a what if? Is it difficult not to do that?  
GARY WILKINSON: I think so. I think there's, as athletes and competitors, I
know for myself I look at things that I could have done differently. I don't
know if any of us hang it all upon ourselves and say, Oh, it is my fault this
happened or this or that and I hope none of us do. But there's obviously
things that you think back on and if I would have made this play or would have
been able to get to that ball or boxed out better on this, you think about
those things and I think that's part of being an athlete and part of being a
competitor. It just goes along with that.  
  
Q. If you could just talk about the last three you took, how did it feel,
was it a designed play, how did it set up? It could have tied it at that
point.  
GARY WILKINSON: It's a play that we have at the end of, you know, to get a
shot like that. It felt good coming off and it was right on. It was just
short. That's just the way the ball bounces, I suppose.  
  
Q. Jared, this is probably your first game fouling out for the year. Talk
about how you viewed the game after you fouled out. How big of a difference
that made.  
JARED QUAYLE: It was difficult. It was the first time I fouled out all year
long and I didn't even mean to foul him at the end. We just ran into each
other. I was just trying to get back to my man. Sitting on the bench and
watching the game it was hard because I wanted to be out there and I wanted to
be bringing the ball up the court and having that opportunity to win the game
or dishing it to somebody and having them hit the shot. It was difficult. I
can't do anything about it now, you know, I got to hope for another chance.  
  
Q. Talk about the first half, it seemed like you guys really struggled to
get any kind of rhythm going.  
TAI WESLEY: Yeah, we weren't really ready for their pressure, they were kind
of taking us out of offense. I think our defense was real good. It was right
where it needed to be. We kind of just needed to find our rhythm on offense
and we did that in the second half. So kind of just came out slow in the first
half offensively.  
  
Q. More detail please on the offense of the second half. You guys were
really able to get the ball deep in the post, you especially seemed to have
your way with their bigs in the second half. What were you doing differently
to get the ball inside?  
TAI WESLEY: We were running our plays that were designed to get touches in the
paint and that's what Coach talked to us about at half time. That we really
needed to, since they were pressuring us out so much that we needed to attack
inside. We needed to get paint touches from our post and that's what we really
focused on at half time and it worked for us.  
  
Q. Jared, as one of the smaller players on the court you actually led the
team in rebounding, what do you attribute your rebounding prowess to?  
JARED QUAYLE: I don't know. I just love going after the ball. I try to watch
where it's going to hit off the rim and then I just try to get myself into
position to be there and for me I'm fortunate the ball usually bounces my way
and I just jump up and grab it.  
  
Q. Gary, when Coach Williams was talking about when you guys took a six-
point lead with about five minutes to go that they tried to pick up the pace
and make the pace a bit faster. Could you sense that and what was your mindset
when you have a six-point lead with five minutes to go?  
GARY WILKINSON: I think our mindset was exactly the opposite. The tempo was a
huge part of this game. I think that when in the second half we controlled
tempo. When we got the six-point lead I thought we needed to stay consistent.
Do what we were doing. We did get sped up a little bit and we didn't, like
Coach said, we had a couple turnovers or whatever, didn't grab some loose
balls, some rebounds and that kind of changed the direction the game was
headed, but up to that point we did a great job of controlling the tempo and
that's the way it goes.  
  
Q. Talk about being down trying to stay patient when you guys were down 14
and working back into the game.  
TAI WESLEY: We knew we could play with Marquette, so we just needed to really
settle down. It really hurt us that we got down so much in the first half. We
wanted to come out and jump on them like we did against Nevada. But it didn't
really work out that way.  
We knew we could get back into the game. We battled back from deficits like
that before. So we just needed to be patient and grind it out.  
  
Q. Would you talk about how you think this experience today will help you
personally in the future and the team next year?  
TAI WESLEY: Yeah, the NCAA tournament is a big deal. It's our dream, it's our
goal starting off as little guys. And now I don't think I'm going to be so
big-eyed, so deer in the headlight kind of attitude. We got police driving in
front of us to come to the game. I mean, all the hype won't be there. I'll
know what I'm getting into and I think as a young team we all know what we're
getting into. So hopefully we can get back here next year.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll excuse these gentlemen and we'll take
questions to Coach Morrill.  
  
Q. Are you a stat guy? Coach Williams was up here and he was reeling off all
kinds of stats. How much do you pay attention to statistics and use it in
preparation?  
COACH MORRILL: Not like I've heard he does. I've been doing this a long time.
I pretty much coach with instinct and what -- you're always going to look at
some stats, but I think you can get overly wound up in statistics.  
You look at this game, it doesn't take a genius to figure out them getting to
the free throw line was huge and that we were stunned by their athleticism and
pressure initially in the game. We had a really hard time executing because
they were -- their quickness and strength and those kind of things.  
But once we kind of settled in and we just stayed on course and talked at half
time about that we were going to go out and have a chance to make this a
really good basketball game and that's what happened. It's really
disappointing that we get up six and don't capitalize. We had, gosh, we had
some great shots that didn't go down. And give them all the credit in the
world, we got to the free throw line, they shoot basically an air ball, might
have grazed the rim and rebound it. If we come up with that rebound, we come
down and turn it over. I mean, there's just a number of plays you can look at
that if they have a couple of those open threes go down, it's probably our
game.  
But they have got an experienced group, they got a group that's been through a
whole lot together, and they weren't going to fold under the pressure, they
were going to keep playing and they did a good job.  
  
Q. Tai's last statement and what you said initially that you guys may have
been stunned by them at first, do you think that was the story of the first
half?  
COACH MORRILL: Well, I think they did a great job. Their pressure and we were
having a hard time getting the ball into the areas that we normally get it
into and they were really bodying us out of the post. My experience in the
NCAA's is it's going to be physical. There's not oftentimes a game is called
very tight. And this game was not called very tight. It was, you were allowed
to be physical out there and, yeah, they're a good Big East team and I think
initially we haven't seen that kind of pressure in our league necessarily.  
But we adjusted and we got the game at a decent tempo and got right back in it
in the second half and there you go. It was a really good basketball game from
there on out.  
  
Q. Can you talk just a little bit about the play of Jared Quayle. Seemed
like he gave you guys the spark towards the end of the first half there and
then in the second half when you guys needed momentum he hit some big shots.  
COACH MORRILL: For a while he was the only one that could score. At half time
we had three guys who had scored and not near enough points, obviously.
Jared's a kind of a sneaky athlete. He's very vertical, he can go by you
better than you think he should. He has just has had a phenomenal year out of
junior college and obviously he's been a big part of the year we have had and
fortunately tonight he played very well.  
  
Q. Coach Morrill, you guys, like you said, you only had three guys score at
half time, you had three bench points in the game and that was on a last
second three-pointer by Jackson. How big a factor did the bench play in this
game, not being able to give you guys a real offensive lift off the bench?  
COACH MORRILL: I don't think they got much time. Stavon got some time, and the
nature of post season and tournament play and conference and then when you get
to the post season a lot of times your comfort level is with your guys who
have played the most minutes. And Stavon got some really good looks and got
more minutes under the circumstances, no one else got a lot of minutes, so I
don't think in fairness to them I can criticize our bench play at all.  
You know, for one thing, the time outs last about 10 to 15 minutes, so the
guys can rest. So you're going to keep your players out there longer. I don't
think Marquette had a lot of guys playing minutes either off their bench.  
  
Q. Along those lines, how badly did you need someone else besides those
three guys to score, whether it was a starter or off the bench that really
just opened things up? It seemed like they were able to key on those three
because no one else could hit the basket?  
COACH MORRILL: We just needed a couple baskets is all we needed. It wasn't
like we were down 20 and needed all this stuff, we just needed to make a
couple open shots when we were up. And they didn't go down. That's basketball.
So, yeah, it would have been nice had we made those, but we didn't.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about your plan of attack, how you guys were
able to get back from down 14 and take the lead?  
COACH MORRILL: Well, our whole year has been based around playing through our
posts. The only way we were going to have a chance to get back in the game was
to do just that. And it was either, you know, it was at least you knew that,
okay, we didn't start doing things that we can't do, we went with what got us
here. That was the whole plan of attack in the second half is to play through
Gary and Tai. And obviously Tai had a big second half and things started going
our way there for a while and we were in good shape with five minutes to go.
Just couldn't close it out. And that again is a credit to Marquette.  
  
Q. With 19, 20 seconds left you guys got the rebound on the missed free
throw. What was the play called, the defensive matchups that were you hoping
to take advantage of and it ended up with Gary's 3-pointer. Just in your
words.  
COACH MORRILL: We just run what we call a quick in that situation. You don't
have a lot of time, we're trying to get the ball up the floor and run a high
wheel option ball screen where Gary is the roll-up man and he got a decent
look, not a great look, but he got a decent look. And any time you're down to
the towards the end of the game, you have to -- I'm not a big believer in
letting them set their defense and all of that. We tried to fly the ball up
the court and got a decent look and it didn't go down.  
  
Q. When the game changed the first four or five minutes of the second half,
you came out, it seemed like, just wanting to move the ball much quicker, way
more aggressive than you had been. Specifically did you talk about that in the
locker room?  
COACH MORRILL: You know, it was all positive in the locker room. There was no
point, our guys knew that it had been a struggle and my whole point with them
was we were going to make it a game, we were going to have a chance to win
going down the stretch. We have had a lot of times like this this year that we
have rallied back and found a way to win games then.  
So yeah, I think the kids came out feeling like that they hadn't played as
well as they could and played much, much better. We shoot a high percentage.
Just too many fouls. Too many fouls and they kept scoring from the line. That
was the frustrating part.  
  
Q. Coach Morrill, with this post season and previous post seasons in the
past, what experience or new experiences will this team, this nucleus be able
to draw from this experience and bring it back next year?  
COACH MORRILL: Well, you know, there's no guarantees. I mean, what everybody
would like to say is that, Hey, okay, now we'll be back next year. And, you
know, but we're not a league that's getting five or six or seven bids. It's
very, very difficult to get here.  
We hope to have a good basketball team again next year, we have had a lot of
good basketball teams. But the last thing I want to do is act like we're
automatically going to be back in the NCAA tournament. That's crazy. That's
absurd.  
We'll start up again in October and see what we can do. But certainly post
season experience is positive and we have had a number of years where we have
went back to back, you know. And gosh, that will be our goal. We'll go see if
we can get that done. But the last thing I'm going to do is put too much
pressure on our kids. The nature of our ten years of post season and all of
that, they feel enough, they feel enough pressure without me applying
pressure.  
  
Q. Coach, you said something about being stunned by their athleticism and
their quickness at the beginning of the game. In the regular season you
probably didn't get to play very many teams with athletes like Marquette has.
I realize scheduling for the Utah's of the world isn't just call whoever you
want, but are you going to try and get maybe teams like Marquette one or two
on your regular season schedule so that you're not surprised when you see in
the NCAA tournament?  
COACH MORRILL: Yeah, and they're going to come back to Logan, right?
(Laughter.) Why are you laughing?  
Absolutely, we're going to try like hell. We're going to try like hell to get
those teams on our schedule. But it's got to be fair. It's got to be fair. I
mean, we'll play them on a neutral or play them on a TV game, but, you know,
what you're talking about is us going to their place and playing and that
ain't fair. So you know, we'll -- I would love to get more of those games on
our schedule. That would be great. We'll try.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you, Coach.  
COACH MORRILL: Thank you.

Marquette - 58  
Utah State - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Williams and
then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH WILLIAMS: As I said yesterday, I think Utah is the hardest team to
prepare for of any in my career as an assistant or as a head coach. Similar to
some of the things that I said yesterday, it's almost a little bit of a
mathematical problem. They average 72 points, they average 72 possessions, and
over the last 10 years in the 86 losses that they have had, 70 of those have
been with a score of less than 72.  
In the first half we had 18 stops out of 27 possessions. In the second half in
the first eight minutes we only had two stops, they had eight baskets. So it
was a tale of two halves. Obviously we were able to get consecutive stops in
the first half and not in the second half and that's why it turned into the
game that it did.  
But at the end of the day, they had 66 possessions and they scored 57 points.
And so we were able to limit their number of possessions and particularly in
the first half hold their field goal percentage down to a number that we could
at least give ourselves a chance for success. We're grateful for the victory,
Coach Morrill and his team they were a perfect example of their institution
and the way they competed and in their preparation.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions now for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Lazar, yesterday everybody talked about how this was going to be a
guard's game. You changed it. Did you expect to be able to do what you did?  
LAZAR HAYWARD: No, I don't think so. I just think it comes down to with the
confidence from my teammates and just being able to help those guys. I never
go into a game thinking I'm going to have a game like that. I just do what I'm
supposed to do and when things happen, they happen.  
  
Q. If you do happen to play Missouri, particularly without your point guard,
how dangerous a situation is that, given the way they play defense?  
LAZAR HAYWARD: I don't think it's any different than any other team we play.
You can never replace a Dominic James, but Maurice Acker does a great job
running our team and he's getting better day after day and he's getting better
each game. So of course, it's going to be a different look and it may be a
little bit difficult for our team, but it's not a hard adjustment.  
  
Q. Did you sense a change in Utah's intensity to start the second half as
compared to the way they played most of the first?  
JEREL McNEAL: I think for the most part in the second half they just came out
and any time you're down going into half time, I'm sure the coach got them
real revved up and ready to go in the second half. But more importantly the
thing that we didn't do that was effective for us in the first half was
guarding their actions and things like that and they came out and we weren't
getting after it on the defensive end like we needed to. We weren't getting
stops and that limited our easy baskets in transitions and things like that.
So that's the reason I think the swing came in the second half, more than just
them being ready to play.  
  
Q. Talk about attacking their zone and it seemed that there were stretches
especially when they came back in it that you guys were kind of just standing
around the perimeter, really couldn't get inside.  
JEREL McNEAL: I think the situation was where starting off just against them
our pace was bad going into the period. We weren't cutting hard, we weren't
hitting gaps and playing inside out like we needed to. Once we started doing
that we started to get a lot of looks that we usually get and a lot of shots
that we usually make. But a lot of them were falling too. It was just one of
those nights from the perimeter for our team.  
But I think we did a lot better job as the game went on, just doing a better
job keeping the up-tempo pace and hitting gaps and creating for others.  
  
Q. Your coach is like a human calculator breaking down numbers. How much of
that do you absorb and how does it help you when you're on the floor?  
JEREL McNEAL: It's something I got used to. He always every time we see him he
got some type of stat for you. So whether it be a time out off the court, on
the court, it's like he's like a number freak. And after awhile you get kind
of used to it. You expect to hear some type of stat, some of the stuff will be
just like, you know, you want to know how he actually gets these numbers and
things like that, you know.  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I think we're starting to absorb it even more. I know the
first time he started doing it, we would look at each other and smile like,
man, he's making these numbers up. (Laughter.)  
There ain't no way like off the top of his head he's calculating these
percentages, but they make a lot of sense. When he broke down Utah, they said
they average 72 points and the 72 possessions, and they're averaging just a
point a possession. So when you break stuff down like that and break down what
we need to do in order to prevent the outcome from happening, then it's
simple.  
We took to heart the game plan today where we wanted to get stops, consecutive
stops in a row, per TV time out. And we were able to do that a lot in the
first half like Jerel said, we got away from it a little bit in the second
half, but we were still able to fight and get this victory.  
  
Q. Talk about Lazar's game and it seemed like every time you guys got in
trouble he hit a big shot and you guys looked for him and he made a shot.  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: Lazar said he's doing what he's supposed to do. Lazar is a
big-time player. I still don't think that he gives or gets enough credit for
what he does with the opposing teams, which is fine for us. If you want to
play off Lazar, we'll pass it to him all the time and he'll keep doing what
he's doing. I think the two of us draw a lot of attention and Lazar, he's a
smart player. He's got a great basketball IQ. He knows how to get open, he
knows to get in the spots where we can find him. And then he does the rest of
it.  
JEREL McNEAL: Pretty much same thing Wesley just said. A situation where me
and him just draw so much attention, that's one of the things, that takes
pressure off us as well as getting us open looks when we draw attention and
Lazar is in the right spot we get him the ball and he's knocking down shots.
So that causes the defense to have to account for him a little bit more well
too and that allows more drive angles and things like that that start to open
up for us.  
  
Q. Coach said when you guys were in the Big East tournament you played three
of your first defensive halves in the first year. The first half, especially
the first 12, 13 minutes you guys really shut down Utah. What have you guys
changed lately or how have you really been able to tighten up the defense?  
JEREL McNEAL: I don't think we changed a lot. It was just more than anything
with this team, I think it's just a mindset. We're in a situation now where
we're understanding that for to us win games and to be successful we got to be
unbelievably a defensive team and that's not just a couple players, that's the
entire team and everybody got to cover for each other and things like that.  
But lately we have been working hard each and every day over the last couple
weeks just to get that defensive edge back. And I think it's here even though
we're still not perfect by any means, we still got a lot that we can get
better at that you're seeing a lot more stretches where we're shutting the
opponent down. But now the next step is to try to take away those stretches
where they're scoring too much on us too.  
  
Q. For Lazar, you drew that fifth foul on Jared Quayle with about a 1:45
left in the game. Were you aware of his foul situation and how big was that?  
LAZAR HAYWARD: I was definitely aware of his foul situation and the coaches
make sure we were all aware. When we had the ball they made sure we were
attacking. So it was definitely big for us in the outcome of the game. We got
the win, but you never know what may happen. We could have got going into an
overtime and he would have been out of the game, so we just always make sure
we're aware of certain situations and fouls and making sure we were attacking
the right way.  
  
Q. Talk about what it was like to play against Tai Wesley and the kind of
game he had against you guys. What made him difficult to stop?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I think he's difficult for anybody. He's a skilled big man
and he works hard. He knows the game well. He's a smart player. He uses his
body, his positioning, to just make it tougher for any defender. Then when you
try to help he's a good passer and he plays off his teammates very well. So I
think that's what gives him his success.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse Marquette's student-athletes and thank them and
congratulate them. And now we'll take questions for Coach Williams.  
  
Q. Can you explain what seems to be almost a borderline obsession with the
numbers where you learn this and how critical it is to sort of dictate how
your team's going to play.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I probably was a little overboard yesterday in my comments and
I know that I'm new to this forum. It's probably not quite as "Rainman" as you
think, but I do think this, I think when you're teaching 19- and 20- and
22-year-old young men the game, I think any statistical evidence that you can
give them to support your teaching, I think it gives them another perspective
on how to absorb and comprehend what you're saying.  
Just to holler and scream and say, Do this, do this, do this, I think
sometimes if you can show them in a different light how to execute and why the
execution is important, no matter whether that's on offense or defense, I
think that anybody, I think in any sphere, in any profession I think if
there's statistical evidence to back up what you believe to be true, I think
that it helps everybody better absorb.  
  
Q. On that note, is there a number on the stat sheet beside the final score
that explains why you won the game?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We don't -- we study the stats, but really we derive a lot
from the stat sheet.  
Similar to what the guys were saying, as it related specifically to Utah, I
thought that if we could get three consecutive stops per media time out we
would win the game.  
And in the second -- or in the first half we did that all but one media time
out. In the second half, we only did that once. The last eight possessions
that Utah had we stopped them five times. The three times that we didn't,
obviously it was the last shot of the game, the shot that No. 5 made, kind of
off the glass there when Coach Morrill called time out after he made it and
then the other time the previous possession we fouled Wesley.  
So I always look at rebounding because we're so size deficient, I always look
at free throw makes, and then I always look at field goal percentage. But I
don't mean this to enhance the first question, but I have a pretty good feel
for how many shots they have made. Whether -- I don't have to wait until the
end of the game to look at a stat sheet.  
  
Q. Coach Williams, given your ability to get to the lane this year, how
fitting was it that that ended up being one of the biggest keys to the game?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think that -- I appreciate you calling me "Coach Williams."
Not because I need my ego stroked, I think that just means that you respect
what you're doing and you have pride in your profession. That means a lot to
me.  
I think this: Like I said yesterday, it's not so much free throw makes in
relation to our guards it's free throw makes in relations to our team, because
we do not score many points from post feeds or points from the post. Lazar
scored a lot of points today, but I don't know that more than two baskets were
from the post. So any time we can get up in that 19 to 20 to 23 range, it
always gives us a chance. It doesn't ensure us success, but it gives us a
chance.  
I think for the first 17 weeks of the season we were ranked in the top three
and then it went to fourth and fifth and then since Dominic's injury we
haven't shot near as many free throws. And so for to us get back to where we
were doing that like we have been doing it earlier was key for us. It was
definitely important.  
  
Q. Coach, what are your thoughts on being the better seed and having to come
in here and play in front of such a big Utah crowd?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Oh, I was just -- when they announced us last Sunday I was
just thankful to see our name. I'm not -- I don't have a very good grasp of
geography, so I wasn't sure where Boise, Idaho was in relationship to Logan,
Utah. And then once I found that out, I think it's good for college
basketball. I don't know that anybody in this room or anybody in the TV media
or Internet media picked us to win. So maybe it was due in part to their
partial crowd, I don't know, but I think it's good. I wish we could host one
in Madison. And maybe we can try to get that figured out and we can go there.  
  
Q. You talked about your free throw discrepancy and how you like to shoot
more than the other team or make more than the other team shoots. Utah has
done that a lot this season as well, what played into it so that they only
shot 8 this season? Was it their aggressiveness or your defensive pressure?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think one of the reasons that Utah has had the success that
they have had is a lot of their shots where they get fouled come off actual
shots. We're a different team in relationship to how we get fouled. We
typically get fouled off penetration. They're a team that typically gets
fouled off shots. So that leads directly to free throws every single time. And
I think that when they shoot the percentage that they shoot and when they
shoot what they do from the free throw line, not percentage-wise, I know it's
really good, but when they shoot the volume of free throws that they do,
that's really hard to beat. That's really hard to beat. But I think that for
us to have a chance we definitely have to get to the free throw line, but ours
comes a little different than theirs. They manufacture their free throw
attempts in a different manner than we do.  
  
Q. It looked like you were having a lot of trouble getting past their zone
in the second half -- they played a lot more zone in the second half. Then
when you got down six about five minutes to go, it changed and you were able
to have success offensively from that point on. What did you do differently at
that point?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think it was similar to what Jerel had to say, I think that
our pace, we always talk about pace not just on offense but on defense. The
zones obviously tend to slow you down and to pull you down and I told our team
at half time I anticipated that they would play the entire half in zone. Not
to be a prophet, but I just thought that that's what they were going to try to
do to try to slow the game down and we did not attack it with pace, not off
the pass or off the bounce.  
And I thought that when we went on that stretch there where we started playing
better what happened was we got two consecutive stops for the first time in
the second half. And that trended towards us being able to play in transition
and so now the pace of what we're doing helps us and so the next time that we
didn't get a stop and they were in zone our pace had kind of picked up. So
it's pace not just off penetration, it's pace off the bounce.  
They were really good in the zone, they matchup really well out of their
slides, their slides are not unique to a lot of zones, what they are really
good at is bumping. They want to keep as many guys matched up as they can and
they do a great job bumping in their zone.  
  
Q. Coach Williams, I hate to ask you about the whole number thing again, but
where does that kind of stem from? Were you a math major or anything like
that?  
COACH WILLIAMS: No, I wasn't smart enough. I went to junior college out of
high school. I couldn't get into a four-year school.  
It comes probably from a lot of different things. My father has a Master's
Degree in chemistry and in mathematics and my grandfather quit school in the
third grade and he taught himself how to count and how to read. I spent a lot
of time growing up with my grandfather and I learned how to count and I taught
him how to multiply and divide using dollar bills. And so that's just kind of
how it started and there's some guys that I've hired on my staff that are more
"Rainman" than I am.  
And I think that we spend a lot of time when you watch tape of opponents, we
watched every team that Utah has played this year that was televised in some
sort of manner. But in that 18 games that I've watched them play against Utah,
not only do we watch it and study it, but we chart every single possession
that they have on offense and defense. So when they're on offense what play
did they run? Obviously they run a lot of play, within that play how did they
score? And within how they scored, who scored? And so when you break it down
is No. 5, is he a driver left or is he a driver right? You can always say well
he's lefts handed so he probably goes left. So we give our guys statistics on
this is what number 5 does. This is what 24 does. This is what 21 does. 21 is
getting two offensive rebounds per game 5.8 for the game, and he got two
offensive rebounds in the first half and that's why the first 12 or 13 minutes
we were doing a great job. And then he got two offensive rebounds in the last
six minutes of the first half, that breaks your back when a point guard gets
an offensive rebound. So it's a combination of growing up the way I grew up
and it's a combination of who I hired and how I like to teach in relationship
to supporting what I believe to be true from a statistical standpoint.  
  
Q. Coach Williams.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Thanks.  
  
Q. For the game you guys shot 36 percent from the field and 26 percent from
the three. Was that due to their defense or were you just off a little bit
tonight?  
COACH WILLIAMS: No, we always give credit to our opponent. I thought we were
okay in the first half I don't think we, I thought we were a little quick, at
times, on four different possessions, I thought we were too quick offensively.
And then in the second half we were too slow. And I don't mean slow in regards
to when we shot the ball, I mean slow in regards to our pace, like I said
earlier.  
The man first half with I think they probably ran four or five possessions of
zone and then exclusively for the most part except on missed shots or out of
bounds plays they were in zone the entire second half. And you could tell that
they have watched the six games that we played without Dominic because a lot
of teams have played us zone.  
And it was in large part to them, it was partly due to the fact that we had
poor pace in the second half, and when you have poor pace on offense it
typically trends towards you having poor pace on defense which normally means
you're getting the ball out of the basket. And those two combined normally
trend towards losing.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you, Coach.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Thank you.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  

Wisconsin  61  
Florida State - 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and have an opening statement from Coach
Hamilton and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH HAMILTON: I thought we got beat by a team tonight that stuck with their
game plan for 40 minutes on the offensive end. They did a very good job of
executing when the game was on the line. I thought that their experience
showed. They got -- we lost a couple of their shooters on some baseline cuts
and lost our defensive discipline. We have been accustomed to getting the
stops we had to have all year long and tonight we just came up a little short.  
You got to give Wisconsin credit. I thought they did a much better job
executing what they wanted to do offensively than we did our defensive schemes
that we have been accustomed to executing so well all year long.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For Toney, can you talk about, it looks like you had to work hard for
those 26 points tonight. Just talk about them, going out there and grinding
and how hard it was to get those 26 points tonight and score.  
TONEY DOUGLAS: I don't really think it was hard. I just pick and choose how
the defense was playing me. We missed some shots. During the game I started
hitting a couple. My teammates started hitting a couple and I just went from
there.  
  
Q. Toney, talk a little about tonight what Wisconsin was able to do in the
first eight minutes or so they held you without a shot. What were they doing
to keep you from getting some open looks?  
TONEY DOUGLAS: Honestly, that was the -- I don't think they did nothing like
that, to tell you the truth. I was just getting my teammates involved. But at
the end of the day, I'm going to do what have I to do. So that -- there you
go.  
  
Q. Your view of that last defensive situation where Hughes kind of hit the
spin around. Were you surprised that he put the shot up? Were you expecting
him to pass it off?  
TONEY DOUGLAS: Yeah, that was a tough shot he made. He was kind of off balance
and the ref said I fouled him, but which I don't know how, but he called the
foul. And that's what happened.  
  
Q. Chris, what was Wisconsin doing to kind of neutralize the rest of the
team? You're the only other guy on the group other than Toney that had double
digits. What do you think they were doing overall defensively to kind of keep
everybody else at bay?  
CHRIS SINGLETON: They focused all their attention on Toney and then we just
missed a couple shots. I think that we had good looks, everybody had good
looks, and we just missed a couple shots. They didn't do anything special.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you, guys. We'll excuse the student-athletes
and take questions for Coach Hamilton.  
  
Q. Solomon barely played in the second half. Was it just matchups or what
was that about?  
COACH HAMILTON: Yes, more than anything else it was matchups. We felt that
they went real small and they made it difficult for us to matchup with them
with their kind of a small forward type player that he had to defend that were
shooting threes. Obviously he was matched up with Landry and Landry, I think,
shoots something close to 37, 38 percent from 3-point range. They had four or
five guys shooting between 36 and 40 percent from 3-point range. They were
1-10 in the first half with those shots and they started hitting them in the
second half. And we thought that we would probably be better off with guys who
could defend them a little better from the perimeter. We knew going into the
game that that would probably be the challenge for us.  
We felt very fortunate the first half that they did not hit those shots as
well as they have been hitting them all year. The second half I thought they
did a much better job of connecting those shots and I think it probably made a
big difference in the game.  
  
Q. In the first half you had pretty even shot distribution, a lot of guys
involved with the offense. In the second half it was mostly Toney, but really,
just three guys getting shots in the second half in the overtime. Is that
something that Wisconsin took away from you or was that just the way your
offense flowed?  
COACH HAMILTON: Well, all year long we have been -- we have always had
different guys step up and contribute. Tonight Uche got in foul trouble, he
had two good looks and they didn't go down. Derwin Kitchen missed I think one
wide open three and four point blank layups. Luke Loucks missed a 2-point
blank layup. Deividas Dulkys, all his jump shots were wide open, they just
didn't go in. We had good looks, unfortunately they just didn't fall for us
tonight. And you have some of those nights where your looks just are not
falling.  
Not having Solomon on the floor and they kind of dictated that, we probably
could have gone and played some zone defense, but we decided not to because
they're such a good perimeter shooting team. I'm not real sure it's as much
what we didn't do as I just think that Wisconsin did a very good job of
executing and making shots that we had on the other end that didn't go down.  
Bohannon, I think went along the baseline there and three times and well,
twice, and hit wide -- he hit jump shots where he just did a great job of
sprinting along the baseline, catching it, and knocking down a tough three. A
lot of guys have difficulty doing that going full speed off a baseline screen,
catching it, turning and facing and knocking it down.  
And the other three that he hit it was fairly well contested. But that's what
an experienced player will do. And we couldn't, we didn't duplicate that on
the other end.  
But at the end of the day we still have a 3-point lead, with less then a
minute and something to go and that's where I thought that we lost our
defensive discipline. We -- I would like to have us stay solid and not gamble
and given them an opportunity to at least take a shot that was contested. We
lost our discipline, they made a layup, and it's a one point game now. And
then we got the rebound Deividas coming down the floor and he lost his balance
and stepped out of bounds. It's one of those games where we had a couple too
many mistakes there towards the end in order to be the team that's executing
and making the right plays when the game was on the line. You have to give
them credit for that.  
  
Q. Is there a stat from this game that really stands out in your eyes? Is
there a stat that you normally look to see how your team does? Is there one
stat that you rely on?  
COACH HAMILTON: Well, we very seldom allow people to go 7-14 from 3-point
range. Our defense has normally been pretty good in those situations and we
normally been able to get the stops. When we have had to have stops our
defense has been well built enough -- and I think we're 7th in the country in
field goal percentage defense. So that's why I said to their credit they did a
very good job of executing.  
And I think that we gave pretty good effort, but I think their execution and
their experience in those situations of knocking the shots down was a little
bit sharper than our defense was tonight.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about what you think Toney's legacy is going to be at
Florida State?  
COACH HAMILTON: Well, I think most people will look back and see that he was
first-team all-conference and the defensive Player of the Year and was just
about unanimous, two points short from, two votes short of being unanimous
all-conference. And probably runner up to Player of the Year. And he was
instrumental in having one of the best seasons that they have had in the
history of the school, going 25-10 and playing for ACC in the championship
game. I think all those things will be things that people will remember.  
But what I will remember most is those mornings that I would come to work
7:30, 8 o'clock and Toney would have already gotten 500 shots up in the gym.
And I would leave in the evening 7, 8 o'clock at night and he would be out
there running lines in the gym by himself, working on his conditioning. And
his dedication to working and getting in the weight room and always had a
bottle of water that he was carrying around to keep himself hydrated, always
working on his flexibility trying to make sure that his muscles were flexible
enough.  
And then the thing that though will stand out even to a tremendous extent is
his, he, along with Uche and Brian's ability to find ways to communicate with
the players when he was the leading scorer and they like him following his
lead, listen to what he had to say, and gave him the direction, because of the
experience that he's gone through.  
Each night before every game we have a scouting report meeting and we go over
our game plan and then he go back to the dorm and have another meeting with
his team at 11 o'clock each night and they would meet again under his
direction and talk about what players talk about and how they would try to get
ready for a game.  
But those things I think about are how I like his character and the unselfish
spirit. And one of the reporters asked him why didn't he take a shot earlier,
well Toney really, there are times in some of the biggest games we have had
where he would take very few shots in the first 10 or minutes or very few
shots in the beginning of the second half, he always tried to get his
teammates involved. And he would step up when he had to, realizing that he
couldn't win all the games by himself.  
We're young, we have six first year players we're depending on that need his
leadership and guidance. So that's what the legacy that I will remember that I
think that will, in my opinion, be as good, equal to the statistical
achievements that he displayed.  
  
Q. With so many young players heavy in the rotation for you guys, just
looking forward, what, how strong do you feel this group is going to be now
that they have had this experience with the success they have had this
experience at the NCAA tournament and you've got a lot of guys with a lot of
tall he went that have a lot of years ahead of them?  
COACH HAMILTON: Well I feel very good about the future of our program. I think
that each and everyone of them have made tremendous progress. Chris was -- I
mean he's capable of a double figure night, had 15 against Duke. Solomon I
think will be just as effective as the minutes he plays, he's got to get a
little stronger so he can become a little more physical. And he's a long,
lean, slim youngster that has a little difficulty holding his position down
low because he has such a high center of gravity. But I think he'll get 10 or
15 pounds heavier and with his shooting touch and the way he runs and jumps I
think he's going to get much better.  
I expect -- I think Xavier Gibson could potentially be one of the best players
that we've had at Florida State. I love Deividas Dulkys and his attitude and
competitive spirit. I think's great shooter but he was a little inconsistent
this year. Luke Loucks, tremendous ball handler, passer, gives a great
chemistry. Jordan DeMercy, great athlete, that gives us great defensive
presence.  
I just think that the future's very bright for our program I think we had a
great recruiting year, I expect some of those guys to come in and make equal
to the same kind of contribution that these guys made coming into this year. A
lot happens between your freshman and sophomore year. These teams, they have,
um, they, more than anything else I think they have gotten a taste of the
leadership that you got to have and then the chemistry that needs to exist on
a team in order for it to be successful.  
So I think they, I think they will return and keep things moving in the right
direction. I feel very good about the potential of this team. I'm excited
about working with them and I think that and I mean it tonight in our meeting
tonight with our coaches, um, they told the players how much fun it was to
coach them. And sometimes, you know, when you trying to demand the most out of
your players, and sometimes that's all, that's not always easy to do, to have
harmony and camaraderie when you're trying to get them to push themselves out
of their comfort zone to in order to improve.  
But we had really a lot of fun with these guys and they accepted the coaching,
they worked hard and without a whole lot of issues, so I'm expecting to have
another great year equal to this year next year.  
  
Q. Coming into next year with so many guys, do you expect to see an alpha
scorer like you had with Toney or do you see a more even distribution like
you're seeing underneath him right now, or do you think you're going to need
that one guy like you had with Toney to score?  
COACH HAMILTON: I think most teams that, that are successful normally have
even distributors on the offensive end. I expect us to have four or five guys
averaging double figures next year. Similar to the teams I've had, I had at
Miami. I think those type of teams are much more difficult to prepare for than
those teams that maybe have that one guy.  
Toney was just so talented that even though they knew he was the one guy that
would step up, people had a very difficult time stopping him. I don't know
whether we're going to have these guys as sophomores step up to where Toney
was as a senior, and he's a fifth year senior, so he had been around awhile.  
But I do feel that we'll have guys that are capable of having big games. And I
think that I'm encouraged by the potential that they have. I think they
understand this bunch will work as hard as they have to work to improve and
we'll have areas that we suggested. So I'm encouraged by that.  
But I think we'll be a team with, that you really won't know who is going to
have a big night. I do think we have guys that are capable of having big
nights.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.  
COACH HAMILTON: Thank you.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  

Missouri  78  
Cornell - 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Donahue to make an opening statement and then
take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH DONAHUE: Thank you. I thought that the game was probably lost for us in
the first half, where I thought we played extremely well defensively, took
care of the ball, and then shots that we normally make, we didn't. And all of
the things that you look for and what things we worked on, I thought in the
first half we did, except make shots. I think it's down four at that point, it
made it difficult. Then the second part is they make a great run to start the
second half. And I thought our defense let up at that point.  
But I said to myself, and I never mentioned to the guys, I thought if we could
hold our turnovers under 10, which I thought would be difficult, and limit
them to under 10 offensive rebounds, we did both those things. And I thought
it was basically a 10- to 12-point game for the most part. And honestly, we
got fouled at the end -- but I give Missouri credit. They're obviously a
terrific basketball team. I think the kid Lyons and Carroll are just terrific
basketball players, just terrific defenders, take care of the ball, great
experience. And I think that's what makes them special at this point.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Alex, talk about the trouble that Leo Lyons gave you guys inside. Seemed
like he was a problem throughout the game.  
ALEX TYLER: I think that he's a very talented player and he works really hard.
So he was working on not only getting position, but once we played pretty
well, he would throw up a shot and get his own rebound. He just kept going
after it. So I think that's what gave us a little bit of a problem.  
  
Q. For Ryan and Alex, can you just talk about the toll that the pressure
defense takes over the course of the game.  
RYAN WITTMAN: Obviously they play a lot of guys. But I thought we handled it
pretty well. Like Coach said, we only had nine turnovers. I think when we
broke and we were aggressive we got some easy baskets, but I think at times it
led to some quick shots. And it wasn't so much the turnovers that hurt us, but
them getting out in transition. They got some easy baskets in the second half
when they were making that big run. I thought maybe their press sped us up a
little bit, but I thought we handled it pretty well for the most part.  
ALEX TYLER: I think we did a pretty good job with it. We had a lot of passing
through all the pressure that they put on and I think that overall we did a
pretty good job. But like he said, it sped us up a little bit and took a
little quicker shots in the second half and it just went from there.  
  
Q. Ryan, coach was saying that you guys played really well in the first half
and maybe didn't get as much out of it as you should have. Did you feel like
going in the locker room that you didn't get what you could have out of that
half?  
RYAN WITTMAN: Definitely. All year long we shot the ball well and so it was
kind of disappointing to play a half like that and not knock the shots down.
But it was there, we were going out in the second half saying if we play that
same type of half and shoot the ball better, we're going to be in great shape.  
Obviously that didn't happen, they started making some plays in transition and
that's what cost us.  
  
Q. For both the players, does the loss like this put a damper on the season
at all when you've been back two times now and then the game gets away from
you in the second half here?  
RYAN WITTMAN: Doesn't necessarily put a damper on the season, it's extremely
difficult to win back to back championships in any conference. It's
disappointing in the fact that we know we could have played better, we could
have hit more shots and things might have turned out differently.  
Any time your season ends like this it's always difficult. Especially having
four seniors, it was their last game. It's always difficult when your season
ends like this, but we don't want to take anything away from what we
accomplished earlier in the year.  
ALEX TYLER: Exactly. We went through a lot this year. As a group I think we
matured so much throughout the course of the year. And a game like this, where
we felt like we could have won if we played better, it's definitely
disappointing, but none of our guys gave up, we all worked hard all season and
that's what we have done all year. So I think for winning back to back Ivy
League championships is still a great accomplishment.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you gentlemen. We'll take questions now for
Coach Donahue.  
  
Q. Mike Anderson said that even though you guys turned the ball over not
that much, he thought the difference in the game was the defense and the way
that it kind of sped you up and made you do some things in the second half. Is
that kind of how you saw it a little bit the second half?  
COACH DONAHUE: You know, I'll respectfully disagree. I think that, I thought
the pressure helped us get open shots. That's, to me, that's the underrated
thing with Mike's team is their offense. They don't turn the ball over. They
share the ball. No one does anything out of the ordinary where you say, wow,
what would a guy do there? Why did he do that? There is none of that.  
And I go back to the two bigs, they just have a great assist to turnover with
the big players. And they still can guard and they still can be physical, yet
they're a multi-task on the offensive end. It just makes it very difficult to
guard. And I thought that stretch where they took it to us was their offense.  
I know -- I just thought that -- and it's difficult to press us because we can
make shots and I just thought that allowed us to get open looks, where I think
we might have been, it might have been more difficult if they stayed with us
and guarded us straight up.  
I'm -- as I said, I was disappointed in shots that I thought we could make and
obviously a couple guys in particular just had bad days shooting. And it's
hard to get tired in an NCAA game. These timeouts are three minutes long and
you get an extra 30 and that's three minutes long, and I didn't sense fatigue
at all and we played a lot of guys and they played their guys about the same.
I thought they're underrated offensive basketball team. It doesn't jump out at
you, but they're an underrated offensive basketball team.  
  
Q. Some things obviously didn't go your way today, but yesterday you talked
a lot about wanting to play better than last year. How do you feel like the
game went in terms of that?  
COACH DONAHUE: Yeah, I thought that we played much better. And as I said, for
the most of the game I think it was a 10 to 12 point game with about three to
go and we got to take chances and we got to start fouling. And they're not a
great foul shooting team, but they made all their foul shots today.  
I think that was where, if we wanted to keep the game close and look like it
was, I think we could have kept it around 10. But that's not why you do this,
you try to win games. And I thought we played much better, there's a much
better sense of poise and confidence about us. Way different -- and I have
great aspirations for this team. All five of these starters are back, top
seven guys for the most part are back. For the -- obviously we're going to try
to win our league again, we're going to challenge ourselves in the preseason,
we're going to try to get to this stage again and we're going to try to win.
And I'm confident that we'll continue to grow as a program and a team and
we'll show better next year and try to advance.  
  
Q. You talked in the opening a little bit about Leo Lyons and the
challenges, how difficult is it really, it seemed like there's not a lot you
can do to defend that?  
COACH DONAHUE: You know, I just think he's as good as it gets in college
basketball. A senior like that, plays at a great pace, very skilled, yet
tough. When he misses his shot he has the ability to chase it down. He does it
against all competition. That's what makes him really good. I just think those
two kids are just so much better than everybody else in college basketball
because they're older and tougher and veteran-oriented and they buy into what
Coach Anderson is doing. That jumps out at me. All the other guys are good
basketball players. I think those two are just really special.  
  
Q. We're doing something with stats. The Marquette coach has been talking a
lot this week about statistics and breaking everything down. Is there one that
you really pay attention to, something you track very closely?  
COACH DONAHUE: Well, I think that depends on each team, to be honest with you.
What's important to you. For us we need to take care of the ball if we're
going to win. We can't make up with athleticism and length and size many
mistakes. So we got to take care of the ball, and obviously move the ball and
get shots for each other.  
So the assist to turnovers are a huge one for us. It may not be big for other
teams that can offensive rebound, can cause havoc on the defensive end. I go
back to this Missouri team again, their advantage is that they do both. They
cause havoc and they take care of the ball. And they assist. I mean that's the
thing that amazes me. But for us, that's something that's big for us.  
If I had a different type of team I would look at it differently, but that's a
huge stat for us and if you look at our team as a progression over the years,
that continually gets better as we do it. Same thing on the defensive end. We
want to limit teams in their ability to get assists and try to limit those
things and then obviously you try to, obviously, don't let them get as many
turnovers as you can get as well.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you, coach.  
COACH DONAHUE: Thank you.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  

Xavier  77  
Portland State - 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have an opening statement from Coach Bone and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH BONE: Well, I'm proud of the guys. I felt like we were extremely focused
and ready to go and we did the best job we could. I thought they left
everything on the court and we just happened to run into a very good Xavier
team, which we knew ahead of time, but they proved it tonight that there's a
reason why they're No. 4 seed. They were very difficult to stop on one end and
hard to get good shots off against on the other.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. If any of you guys can just talk about the overall effect that Xavier's
defense had throughout the course of the game. It wasn't necessarily forcing
turnovers, but just the wear and tear that they put on you guys, can you talk
about that?  
JAMIE JONES: I just thought Xavier was, they're a real solid team, they're big
and physical and I think they took us out of some stuff. But I think that we
just didn't have just the motivation at the end. I don't know. It was just
tough, a tough team, a good team.  
  
Q. Jeremiah, can you talk about you guys take that one-point lead and then
things kind of unraveled from there. Just talk about the letdown of the team,
you guys get your first lead and then you're kind of climbing uphill from
there.  
JEREMIAH DOMINGUEZ: Yeah, we had got the one-point lead and we had some --
after that we had two bad turnovers, one from myself and another. And once you
get -- and they went on a run, they went on a 10-0 run and then once we hit
that 10-0, it was just playing catchup ball from there. And playing against
Xavier, it's a tough team to come back from. They're just so solid on defense
and offensive side of the ball, so we put ourself in a hole and we couldn't
dig ourself out.  
  
Q. You guys have played a very tough schedule. How did these guys compare to
the Washingtons, the Gonzagas that you played against.  
ANDRE MURRAY: They're a very similar team. They're a very good rebounding team
just like Washington, like Washington, Baylor, like Gonzaga. So we have seen
this before and I feel like we should have been ready, but we had a little bit
a letdown throughout the game. So it was very similar to the teams we played
before.  
  
Q. Jeremiah, it's a bittersweet time for you, but you look back on your two
years here, and you got to be proud of what you guys have accomplished going
two straight NCAA tournaments.  
JEREMIAH DOMINGUEZ: Yeah, after transferring here I knew we had a chance to
have a great team. After those two years, I had the best experience of my life
and I was happy to transfer to Portland State. And I'm just happy that we got
here the past two years and it's all done now, but I had a great past two
years of my life and I'll always remember this.  
  
Q. Jeremiah, talk about what they did defensively to you in the second half.
You were held scoreless and they really paid a lot of attention to you.  
JEREMIAH DOMINGUEZ: Just them being solid. I know when I came up on the balls
they were trapping me the second half and they just made every shot difficult
for me to get off and it worked. So it was a good defense.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you, guys. We'll excuse the student-athletes and
take questions for Coach Bone.  
  
Q. When Andre Murray hit the three, cut the lead to seven at the end of the
first half momentum was kind of shifting, what did you tell your team at half
time?  
COACH BONE: Talked about the fact that if we could get the game to the eight-
minute mark where we were right in it, then I thought we had a great chance.
Because it felt like maybe the four seed in Xavier, like a lot of teams, might
tighten up a little bit and play not to lose. And it felt like we would
continue to play to win. But it didn't work.  
Xavier's very good. They came out right away and set the tone, kind of put us
in our place, and immediately outscored us and I don't know the stats, but it
seemed like about 11 or 12 to two or three. And they did a great job. Xavier's
a very good basketball club. So I don't want to take anything away from our
kids, the Portland State guys, but we ran into a very good team who played
well.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about how tough it is to pull an upset
in this tournament. People always talk about upsets and March madness for a
team from a small conference like yourself. What does it take and how hard is
it to win these games?  
COACH BONE: Well, I think you have to shoot the ball well. And we shot it
decent, but not like you have to do to pull off a win against a team the
caliber of Xavier and a team that's experienced as Xavier. They're not just
all of a sudden a four seed this year, I think it was last year they got to
the Elite 8. They have had a tremendous amount of success over the year, over
the years, and they didn't panic. We hit the shot, went up 25-24, and they
acted like it was, you know, nothing to them. They have been there before and
they played like it.  
I think it's difficult to get in the tournament as a 13 seed and pull an
upset. But it's been done before. We just didn't happen to do it today.  
  
Q. You guys played so hard last year against Kansas. I know you were really
proud of that team. Didn't look in the second half that you guys had much
energy. Was that due to something Xavier was doing or did you just feel like
your guys didn't have it?  
COACH BONE: I don't think I did a good job substituting guys. I probably kept
a few kids in longer than I should have and just really tried to milk it. The
timeouts are two and a half minutes long, the half time is 20 minutes long. So
I tried to use that in a way to really milk it with some of our key guys. But
I probably should have called a time out or two also early in the second half.
And I didn't do that.  
So that first 10 minutes of the second half was wasn't very good for me. I
probably should have done a better job personally. Maybe we would have had a
little more energy.  
  
Q. Are you a big statistics guy and are there any stats that are more
important than others to you when you look at your team and what you're trying
to do?  
COACH BONE: Rebounds are. Rebounds are very, very important. It's usually the
first thing I look at. And then getting to the free throw line. And
unfortunately those are probably the two areas that we were the weakest at
this evening. We got out rebounded 34-21 and they had 10 offensive boards to
our 4. And then on the free throw line, two of our better shooters, Andre
Murray and Jeremiah Dominguez, together went 2-8. And you add up a few of
those free throws and a few offensive boards that they got, not that it would
have been a one point game, but maybe it's a six or eight point game with
eight minutes to go, like I mentioned.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about your 3-point shooting and how well you guys have
done that this year and how you feel that you guys really shot the ball from
behind the arc tonight?  
COACH BONE: Well, we shot it decent. We shoot right about the percentage that
we did tonight, I think, 38 percent. What I didn't expect was them to shoot so
well. They came out and hit 6 out of 12 in the first half.  
And again, they played with a lot of poise, they seemed comfortable, when they
got a good look, they buried it. But that's kind of who we have been all year.
We shot 46 shots, 21 of them tonight were threes. And we made eight. Which is
right about like I said the percentage we usually shoot.  
  
Q. I know you probably haven't thought about it too much yet, but what do
you think this team's going to look like moving forward without Jeremiah
running the point any more?  
COACH BONE: It will look bigger.  
(Laughter.) At that position anyway. But we'll miss him. There's no doubt. The
kid is just a gamer and I wish I could have done something to help him get
better and more looks at the basket the second half.  
We did, we ran a couple specials for him, but -- in fact we ran a number of
them in the second half to try to get him a look. Xavier did a great job
defensively. We were running him off screens and throwing a couple little
wrinkles in of what we usually do, tweaking some things, and doggone it if
they weren't just there on the catch.  
And then like Jeremiah said, they did a very good job of guarding the on-balls
the second half. The first half that was our bread and butter. No matter what
we did, we ran on-balls and we had good success with him. And in the second
half they either switched it or they showed hard and trapped it, and we were
not able to overcome that to get him good shots.  
But looking to the future, we're going to miss Jeremiah a lot. The last two
years we have had 46 wins and two trips to the NCAA tournament and I don't
know I don't know if that would have been possible without him.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you, coach.  
COACH BONE: Thank you.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  

Wisconsin  61  
Florida State - 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and have an opening statement from Coach Ryan
and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH RYAN: Well, I realize the time, so I'll let the student-athletes get
their opportunity to answer any and all questions that you might have. Because
they performed so well tonight and stuck in there and hung tough when things
weren't going very well. So I'm very excited for them that they still get to
keep playing.  
And I'll let you guys ask them whatever you want to ask them.  
  
Q. Trevon Hughes, this is for you, you and Jordan were guarding Mr. Douglas
so actively tonight, and really working hard to defend him and just wondering
what it was like for you then to work so hard all that game and then hit that
shot at the end and what did that feel like?  
TREVON HUGHES: It was just throughout the whole game I wasn't myself. I was
making bonehead plays and Coach put me in with the ball in my hand at the end,
and it meant a lot. It meant he had trust in me to keep me on the floor and
put the ball in my hands. I owed it to my teammates, I didn't want this to be
the last game. I told myself, Attack, attack. If I got stopped, look for my
shooter J-Bo, if he was open, but I got the foul and the one.  
  
Q. Jason, kind of take us through that deep three that you had back in
regulation. I think the shot clock was winding down and Joe found you.  
JASON BOHANNON: We were working the shot clock looking for a good shot and we
ran ball screen and we kicked it back out to Joe and Joe pump faked and made
two dribbles. And I just kept moving, trying to find an open spot and if they
found me, great. If not, if we got a better shot, it was even greater.  
But Joe made a great play, pump faking, drawing two defenders and kicking it
out to me. I didn't even realize how far out I was. I was just catch and shoot
and just getting in rhythm.  
  
Q. Trevon Hughes, talk about what the plan was on that last play and sort of
what you saw and how that play developed.  
TREVON HUGHES: Basically come off the screen from my big man, either me or
J-Bo, and they left me open and they let me get it and they let me make a
play. Basically I got in the lane and did what I had to do and that's get the
W.  
  
Q. Joe and Marcus, talk about the way you guys battled back in the second
half after going down 12.  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: We had a good talk in the locker room before Coach came in
and then he came in and got us even more fired up to go out there and just
give it our all. It was 20 minutes that was guaranteed to us and nothing after
that. And we said, Hey, let's take advantage of those 20 minutes and on both
ends of the floor and every loose ball has got to be ours. If you got the
shot, shoot it. Knock them down. Smile, have fun. Go out there and just have a
ball.  
And man, we played with such emotion that we really willed ourselves to that
victory. And of course, you have to make shots and these two guys did a great
job of doing that. Other guys did. But no, it was a lot of heart and desire
out there and I'm just proud of -- proud to be part of this team.  
MARCUS LANDRY: Well, the whole game it was something that was really sticking
to me after the end of my sophomore year after losing to UNLV, I had a coaches
meeting with Coach and he told me something that's been sticking with me for a
long time, he said: It's half time, sophomore going into my junior year. And
time goes so fast and it is my fourth quarter here and I'm just trying to make
the best of it.  
I didn't have the best game, but my teammates really picked us up and we're a
team, we play together. And I just went out there with a desire to grab some
rebounds, do something to help this team. Because my guys, my teammates -- I
wasn't pleased with my performance in the beginning, but I just stuck it out
and tried to get over the hump and just grab some rebounds, do something. And
my teammates really came through. It was a big battle. They have a lot of big
guys down low, but we fought all the way through.  
  
Q. Jason, talk about just being able to put some of those shots out of your
mind. I think you had two air balls, but you also came back and drilled about
three or four of them in the last ten minutes of the game. Just a shooter's
mentality?  
JASON BOHANNON: Yeah, I didn't really let it bother me at all. They didn't
come off great. The ones that went in came off good and they felt good. As a
shooter you just got to keep shooting it and hope -- you know, it's all feel
and my teammates did a great job of finding me in rhythm. Trevon Hughes found
me and Joe did and Jordan had a great one on the baseline too. Right with him,
I went up, and they felt great going up.  
  
Q. Jason and Marcus, describe in a little bit of detail what the locker room
felt like at half time and if anybody said anything particularly memorable?  
JASON BOHANNON: Half time, we didn't play a great half of basketball. And we
came in and we knew we needed to start playing how we know how to play. Joe
was talking to us and told us we got to keep playing, they want to keep
playing, it's 0-0 right now. And Coach came in and said the same thing, he
said it's a new half of basketball and it's 0-0.  
And that was our mentality, keep working every possession, getting our points
every possession and holding them each and every possession. Because one
possession came down to be the difference in the game and that really paid off
with that mentality.  
MARCUS LANDRY: In the locker room it was great. I found myself coming into the
locker room thinking about what happened the first half. But Joe got up and
talked and said some things and it really got my spirits lifted. And he told
us, Hey, we got one more half to play, we got 20 minutes of basketball. It's
not over. And like they said, Coach came and said the same thing, you know,
0-0. He pointed out some things we needed to do better and we came out and
first five minutes we got off to a great start and the way we finished the
game was tremendous.  
  
Q. Joe or Marcus, talk a bit about watching Trevon Hughes make that big play
there at the end of the game and sort of stepping up in that situation.  
MARCUS LANDRY: Well, he got the ball and I was trying to find like a little
open spot because I kind of figured that my man would go and double him, which
he did. After he turned around and he like kind of did the spin, I saw J-Bo,
so I was like, Okay, he's getting ready to pass to J-Bo. And I know J-Bo is
going to put it up, but Trevon Hughes saw a little hole to the basket, drew
the contact and it went up. And all I was thinking was to try to get on the
glass and get a tip in if it doesn't go. But thank God we got the foul and the
one and it was a great play. He was really strong with the ball on that
particular play.  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: We have been through so many situations in practice, I'm sure
there was 8.3 seconds up there at some point this year and Coach said, Make a
play. And so it's -- we do those type of things. So guys are ready. Guys know
we got to get a shot up, don't settle for a step back jumper like they do in a
different league and just get to the rim, make a play. Players make plays. Put
the ball in Trevon's hand and he did a great job and I knew something good, I
just had a good feeling. I think everybody did. We were excited we got that
ball and Trevon did a great job.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We'll excuse the student-athletes and take questions for
Coach Ryan.  
COACH RYAN: Actually what Marcus said was he was due. Trevon was due.  
  
Q. What did your team do better offensively after half time?  
COACH RYAN: Let's go to -- take a look at those shots we had in the first
half, how wide open -- we were actually surprised that we had that many open
looks after either penetration, a kick, a skip pass. We actually had some
pretty good looks. So it's not -- you're not in a panic mode knowing that
defensively the guys are committed.  
They worked at it, a couple things early, that I'll tell you how ingrained our
guys are. We have been playing ball screens a certain way for the last 10
games, 12 games, because of certain reasons. But right away on the first
couple possessions they got two drives to the rim. So you noticed I subbed
immediately and then had to remind them, Guys -- just, you know, habits were
formed, we were doing things a certain way, but against these guys we have got
to do this, this and this. And then after that we made it a lot tougher for
them to get to the rim.  
But offensively for us, I thought we did pretty well. We didn't turn it over.
Couple shot clock things, but we weren't even trying to run the shot clock
down. We were trying to get good looks.  
The guys are actually lying. I only said one thing. My motivation at half time
was, Jon Leuer, you got to hit a couple shots here in the second half. Jon was
0-7 in the first half. So my half time talk didn't do any good at all. I'm
just kidding. Jon's a good kid. Jon's going to come out on Sunday and he's
going to knock some shots down. He'll be fine.  
  
Q. Talk about the six-game losing streak and all those close games. You had
so many close losses, did that play?  
COACH RYAN: We had some close wins too. We had some, if you check those scores
as you go down, everybody only wants to look at one side of the ledger. We won
a lot of games five or less points as a differential, which usually means two
possessions.  
  
Q. Did that play a role tonight, the fact that you've been in so many close
games?  
COACH RYAN: Absolutely. But, you know, in the Big-10 you're going to be in a
lot of those grinders. That was a grinder. Then there's probably going to be
more.  
  
Q. First off, great game, congratulations. You guys are down by one, nine
seconds, eight seconds, you're pushing the ball up the court. Can you walk me
through that last timeout.  
COACH RYAN: Yeah, what we do is there is one left. So we got it in. And what I
do is I always look right away if there's people in the paint because we're
going to push it. Sometimes teams get ahead or they relax and they spread out
defensively. But the way that they got back, Florida State got back, it was
okay, timeout. Then we'll have to run a half court play. In transition if
they're not in position we attack and then I'm the one calling the timeout.
They know our rules.  
And so, you know, J-Bo waited until -- or somebody, after the timeout was
called, and then he shot it again. He did the same thing at Ohio State a
couple years ago. I think it went in both times. He just wanted to practice.  
  
Q. Talk about what you wanted to do with that last play.  
COACH RYAN: Oh, that was the mindset on the timeout. Now, we got to play
again. It could be somebody from Xavier again. I can't -- I can't tell you
everything. But every coach knows and every player knows when he's out there
on the floor, somebody's going to make a play. If you have two guys out there
that can make a play, J-Bo got the ball in his hands and made the great pass
out to Jordan Taylor, who was wide open. That shot almost went down and then
we don't even have to worry about the overtime.  
But we have some guys that are capable of making plays and we either go flat,
we either go cross screens, we either -- there's a rub screen at the top,
depending upon what we have seen in the scouting report what other teams do,
and then they might change up. So then there's what we have in our mind to do,
Okay, if they don't do that, here's the counter. And we do situations; five
seconds on the clock, eight, ten, two seconds. You didn't hear about Devon
Harris telling everybody that's why he made that shot that game? Because we
practiced those last second situation, you probably didn't catch that.  
  
Q. Talk about what Keaton gave you tonight .  
COACH RYAN: He drew a charge. The guys were carrying him around on their
shoulders in the locker room. You know how long we have been trying to get
Keaton to take a charge? One of the coaches took him in the training room and
had him fall backwards, keep practicing falling backward on a mat. He never
took a charge in high school. Never took a charge. You can't play here and not
take a charge, not for me.  
He was tough. Knocked down some shots. Got some confidence going. I think he
was even talking to himself when he went down the court a couple times. Did
you see the lips moving? He wasn't trash talking, that's Keaton getting
himself going. We knew we had him ready then.  
  
Q. What did you do differently in the second half defensively to slow them
down? Because they were on fire in the first half.  
COACH RYAN: You know, to keep emphasizing about Douglas, to contain him, we
stopped giving up the easy ones around the rim. The one put-back where the guy
got the follow-up, dunked it, pulled himself up and smacked the back board,
they got a lot of momentum right after that happened and we had to cut into
that. That's when they kind of separated.  
So what we did was we tried not to let them get any of those kind of plays
that motivates the other team to play even harder and do even better and fire
them up. So I thought we did a good job in not giving them any of those
opportunities.  
  
Q. There was talk about being aggressive offensively, but on defense I know
Douglas had five turnovers, you guys scored 24 points off turnovers. Can you
talk about just that mentality of the defense, how well that worked for you
tonight?  
COACH RYAN: We didn't just come into this game and say, Okay, let's be
aggressive. You have to understand that. Are you from -- have you seen us
play?  
  
Q. I know about you.  
COACH RYAN: Okay. So we're trying not to give up easy stuff. It might look
like it some games, but we're trying not to. But the fact that we turned it
over only nine times against a very athletic team like that and the way they
were denying the ball and Douglas, Douglas is so tough defensively on Hughes
he really kind of took Trevon Hughes out of a lot of things. And fortunately
at the end he had at least one good one in him as far as finishing around the
rim.  
But defensively that's how we -- we do try to play that way all the time.
Helps when the ball goes in at the other end for us too. So 50 percent in the
second half, 60 percent in overtime, that makes a difference.  
  
Q. Trevon Hughes mentioned that he wasn't too impressed with how he played
tonight, but I noticed he still had 39 minutes, of course. Talk about how
important it is for him to be on the court and to lead the team.  
COACH RYAN: Well, because he has the experience. He's been in these
situations. And I've never had a young man play for me that didn't get better,
that didn't make himself better. Not talking about me, as the only motivator,
but trying to give direction, and Trevon Hughes at times has struggled getting
a lot of attention from the other team, maybe forcing something here or there.
But if I didn't think he could play, would he have played 39 minutes? No. So
we still believe in him. But we still have to keep teaching. I call it that. I
don't know what they call it.  
  
Q. I was noticing in the second half things were getting pretty physical
between Joe and 32, Alabi, forearms and things like that down the court.  
COACH RYAN: Was there?  
  
Q. How do you keep your team from not losing their cool and staying plugged
into the game situation like that?  
COACH RYAN: We're always talking to them about how that will hurt your team.
How it doesn't help. How it -- I mean, you can't get pushed around. Physically
you have to stand your ground, move your feet. But if you're worried more
about trying to bump somebody here or getting a shot in there or whatever,
then you're not playing basketball.  
It's like I've always said about on the playground, when guys start wolfing,
and something breaks out, my theory was, I always went after the guy that was
talking the most when we had to go after. In baseball, guys go after the guy
that was talking the most. You're usually safer. So if there was talk going, I
don't know. They were playing. I didn't see anything. Maybe you had a better
seat than I did.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, Coach.  
COACH RYAN: You bet.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  

Xavier  77  
Portland State - 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with an opening statement from Coach Miller
and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH MILLER: Well, I thought we beat a very good team in Portland State.
Watching them on film, and I believe our team would agree, we really respected
them, especially on offense. They have a little point guard, Jeremiah
Dominguez, to me he's one of the best we have played against and he's a
handful.  
But as our team continued to play the game, I thought our defense and size
really started to wear them down. I credit these guys for sticking with it. A
lot of times if you're a good defensive team you can really get to the other
team's heart late in the second half, middle of the second half and I thought
that really happened. Offensively there were times in this game where it was
the best we could play.  
And I'll give you one stat, any time our team can turn over the ball seven
times, that's as good as we can do. And we're a very good team when we take
care of the ball like we did today.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Dante, you had about a one-minute stretch at about the six-minute mark in
the first half, you had a layup, you had a steal that produced a layup for
B.J. and he hit a three. Can you talk about that sequence and did you think
that was kind of the spark that the team needed?  
DANTE JACKSON: I think so. But I was trying to do whatever I could do to help
our team be successful. Luckily the ball kind of found my hand on the steal
and then I was able to find B.J. for the layup and then I think it was C.J.
here who or Derrick who hit me or hit me for the three in the corner.  
  
Q. C.J., you talked about how you really wanted to get back to the way you
have been playing before, and you scored most of your points today in the
second half. Did you feel like they wanted you to shoot today? And kind of how
did you approach the matchup?  
C.J. ANDERSON: I just tried to be aggressive and take the opportunities that
were given to me. I think that because B.J. and the other guys were doing such
a good job shooting the ball it opened up the lane a little bit for me. So I
just tried to be aggressive and make the shots that I was taking.  
  
Q. For any of the players, why were you guys so efficient on offense
tonight? What was the key?  
DANTE JACKSON: I think that we were efficient because we were able to move the
ball. Coach always talks about moving the ball and moving yourself and I think
we did a really good job of that in the first half, which produced some open
looks and B.J. and C.J. and Derrick and then the rest of the guys were able to
hit some open shots and I think that's the main key.  
  
Q. Dante, did the three of you hit right to begin the game to beat the shot
clock? Did that give you any kind of extra confidence in what you were going
to be able to do tonight?  
DANTE JACKSON: A little bit. But then again, it was a long game, so you hit a
shot in the first 35 seconds of a 40-minute game, it's really not -- it
doesn't mean too much. So I was just hoping for the best the rest of the way.  
COACH MILLER: Don't forget about B.J. He'll be disappointed if he can't talk.  
B.J. RAYMOND: I'm good. Don't do it. Don't worry about me. Don't do it out of
courtesy, please.  
  
Q. B.J., I'm impressed by how your team shares the ball. Is that an
evolution over the season or is that Coach Miller's task mastering or how does
that happen?  
B.J. RAYMOND: We have a great play after the play and it starts with us moving
the ball from one side to the other. Everybody gets to touch the ball. And
everybody has confidence in the other players' ability to put it on the floor
or make the right decisions. So we love to share the ball and see our
teammates succeed.  
  
Q. Dante, I'm going to get something out of you, if it takes me all night.
What about running through the screens, at least especially in the first half?
You got to be a little bit banged up, it seemed like every time Dominguez had
the ball, you were slamming into somebody trying to follow him around the
court.  
DANTE JACKSON: Unfortunately I wasn't pressuring the ball like Coach Miller
wanted me to do, so I was getting backed pretty hard. But we made an
adjustment and I was able to -- I took the coaching that the coaches were
giving me and I was just trying to play hard.  
  
Q. B.J., can you talk about C.J.'s performance tonight and what he brought
to the team with his 14 points.  
B.J. RAYMOND: Well, C.J., any time he is aggressive he makes our team better.
Any time he's putting the ball in the basket, when you see 14 points, he's
doing it in a lot of ways. That means he's being aggressive, he's getting
shots for the shooters, but he's also putting fouls on the other team because
of the way he plays, he gets to the free throw line. And for him, scoring 14
points, for us that's a big lift for us because it helps us in a lot of ways
and we just hope that he's just like that. He's a pit bull and we appreciate
it.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, gentlemen. We'll take questions for Coach
Miller.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the turnover stat. How important are stats to you
and are there others that you consider more important for your team? Do you
set stat goals and that kind of thing before a game?  
COACH MILLER: We do. We're defense driven. Generally when we have had great
success it's holding the other team to a low field goal percentage. I was very
concerned at half time because Portland State had such a high percentage from
the field going. We're not a team that has necessarily won in a lot of
shootouts.  
And our defense in the second half was much better. And like I mentioned with
my opening comments, if you're a good defensive team, a lot of times it can
wear throughout the course of the game where the results don't come early,
they come in the second half. And our players really stuck with it and I
thought really defended an excellent offensive team in Portland State.  
  
Q. Sean, could you speak to the effort that Dante had tonight, especially in
the first half and especially that minute or so stretch where he had a couple
of baskets and a steal.  
COACH MILLER: Yeah, you know, when we recruited Dante, to me we were
recruiting a winner. He was a winner in high school, he approaches every day
with such enthusiasm that it's contagious. And as he's gained more experience
and grown as a player, he now can carry that into games. And for example,
today was a big game, but he is so energetic, he's such a positive guy, he's
such a great teammate that he's just someone that I think a lot of programs
would love to have on their team.  
At times he shot the ball better than others, but he knows for our team to be
really good he's got to be a hawk on defense. Guarding other good players at
different positions.  
And your questions about his effort today and they are very accurate in that I
thought more than anybody on our team he really had a wearing down effect on
the opposing players that he guarded. And he gave us offense, four steals. And
you look at his offense, arguably he was as good of a player today for us as
anyone.  
  
Q. Can you talk about C.J. and did you feel like they were trying to get him
to shoot, having scouted his last performance knowing he was 0-9?  
COACH MILLER: No one feels worse about 0-9 than C.J. He's been our team's
heart and soul and he has been a part of a lot of big wins. He struggled like
sometimes can happen with players, especially if you're not a perimeter
shooter, but I thought today he took a couple floaters, he shot the ball from
8 and 10 feet.  
I almost had a conniption when I saw him shoot a 17-footer, but he played with
confidence and he's a tough matchup off the dribble and he's very experienced.
And you heard B.J. describe him as a pit bull. The reason that B.J. describes
him as that is that he is such a competitive person. He's fearless, he's got
great confidence in his ability. I would have predicted that he would have
played well today.  
  
Q. Did you guys make an adjustment on Dominguez at half time after he had 13
points and had zero in the second half?  
COACH MILLER: It was just more of the same. No. To our players' credit we had
a great team effort against him and I thought he wore down, which happens.
It's mid March, he's dribbling the ball a lot, he's not a big guy, late in the
second half, middle of the second half, he took a pretty good punch throughout
the game in terms of players giving great effort in order to stop him, but
he's really a good player. He really is. He scared me to death before we
played him.  
And that first half was what I expected in terms of his overall ability level.
And he's as good of a player point guard as we played against this season.  
  
Q. Was it important for this team's kind of collective confidence to get so
many guys involved tonight?  
COACH MILLER: Not really. This team more than any Xavier team that I've been a
part of, and I've now been a part of eight, is really battle tested. When you
just look at the NCAA tournament field, the teams that are in the round of 32,
we have played an awful lot of them. And for example, in order for us to
advance in the next round we're going to have to be an excellent team. But our
team has played against teams like that throughout this season. Played in very
difficult non-conference schedule and how we play is going to be no different
in this tournament than we played in Puerto Rico, it's just a matter of to
what level we'll be at.  
  
Q. You had Dante as a hawk and C.J. as a pit bull, what's B.J.?  
COACH MILLER: Bull headed.  
(Laughter.) Very head strong. Very confident. B.J.'s an interesting story, if
you haven't covered us. Played about nine minutes a game as a freshman. About
12 minutes a game as a zone defense sophomore. Was our team's sixth man last
year, made some really big shots in this tournament a year ago and now he's
First Team All Conference as a senior.  
He's a throwback, guys like him, they want to transfer before they ever get to
their junior year. He's from a great family, played at a terrific high school
and his competitive spirit, bull-headedness in a positive way, really guides
him and he's, again, another ingredient to this year's team.  
We're led by B.J., C.J. and Derrick Brown, they have been the three most
consistent players, they're also the three oldest players on our team.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, Coach.  
COACH MILLER: Thank you.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  

Missouri  78  
Cornell - 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with the Missouri press conference. We'll
have an opening statement from Coach Anderson and then take questions for the
student-athletes.  
COACH ANDERSON: First, I thought it was a well-played ball game. I thought
both teams came out and you could see the nerves going. That's why the
shooting percentages were like they were. But you got to credit Cornell also.
They -- one of the things we always do, we pressure people and make people
turn it over, they had three turnovers at half time. But I still thought our
pressure defense was very, very effective because they had to use some
personnel that probably they're not used to using.  
I thought the second half was typical of our basketball team all year long. I
thought we came out in the second half and we had super energy and our defense
really, I thought, triggered our offense and you could see the percentages
went up. We had some seniors step up, DeMarre, Leo, I thought they set the
tone. And, of course, our guard tandem, to me, is one of the better guard
tandems in the country, because it's not all about offense with them.  
But it was a good win for us, it was a good opening game and we survived and
advance, that's our thing.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Leo, talk about your game and it seemed like they didn't really have the
athleticism inside to match up with you.  
LEO LYONS: We had a little quickness advantage when it came to the rebounding
and I just tried to stay close around the rim and get a lot of those loose
balls because they were getting all of them in the first half and I came in
the second half with the mindset of trying to get them.  
  
Q. J.T., Zaire, talk about what it was like in the morning leading up to the
game? Did you ever have to deal with the butterflies? And if so, how?  
J.T. TILLER: Me personally, I always have a couple of butterflies, especially
this being my first appearance in the NCAA tournament. But just leading up to
the game just got to get the right mindset and know what you got to come in
and do and then all that goes away.  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: I actually felt the least amount of butterflies I felt all
season. It kind of shocked me. I was trying to get myself nervous a little
bit, because I felt I was too cool. So, but I don't know, I guess it worked
out good.  
  
Q. Leo, when you went to the bench early in the game, can you tell us what
hurt and if you thought you could come back and give that kind of an effort.  
LEO LYONS: Well, I got to tell you I was hurt. You already know what happened.
And I was a little winded anyways. Just going out there in this part of the
country, I know it's kind of like Colorado was and I got kind of tired at the
beginning and he hit me and made me realize that it's time to take a seat.  
(Laughter.)  
But I came back with the right mindset. It gave me a chance to sit on the
bench and look at the game and try to catch the speed and try to see what our
strengths were.  
  
Q. Talk about what it's like to speed up a team like Cornell that wants to
play slow and why it was so much more effective in the second half?  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: I thought the tempo was pretty good. I didn't honestly feel like
they were going that slow. But I can't, we can't really be concerned with the
tempo that they're trying to play at. If you want to control tempo, you got to
get after it. With Coach A you don't have an option because I know there's a
lot of guys ready to get after it, so if I don't, somebody else is.  
J.T. TILLER: I think tempo played a very important part in the game today
because Cornell's a very good offensive team half court-wise and if you don't
get them out their comfort zone they can definitely kill you with the shooting
and inside play. So I think that our speed got them out of their comfort zone
and it played in our favor.  
  
Q. DeMarre and Zaire, can you guys just talk about now that you have one
won, is there a little sense of relief, you got some footing in the
tournament, and how do you look at where you go from here?  
DeMARRE CARROLL: The first game is always the most important game. We kind of
got through the first game and now our next opponent is Marquette. They're a
very talented basketball team. They're small, athletic. So hopefully Leo can
do the same thing he did tonight, catch the ball inside. And myself I can get
down there and give J.T. and them somebody to throw the ball to in the post
and we can take advantage of our size.  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: It was just a -- it's good to get a chance to get acclimated to
this situation a little bit, but pretty much the same thing he said. Get a
little - feel a little more comfortable.  
  
Q. DeMarre, can you talk about the lift Kim English gave you guys with that
little run he went on in the second half?  
DeMARRE CARROLL: Kim, wow, he came out of the bench, he is one of them guys
that you can't shake his confidence. He can miss about 30 shots but he's going
to come back and shoot the next one. But he came off with the right mindset
and knocked down some big shots for us. He played a really good game for us.  
I don't call him a freshman no more, they're sophomores and they should be
used to this kind of game time experience and hopefully we're going to need
them tomorrow to come off the bench and do the same thing.  
  
Q. Question for DeMarre, you got off to a slower start in the first half,
but it seemed like when you picked it up in the second half, your team flowed
around that, sort of built on your momentum. Can you describe how that worked
for you or what was going on at the time.  
DeMARRE CARROLL: Well, you know, I handled the nerves like J.T. said, but once
I got into the locker room my teammates, they were looking up to me and they
really told me to be the Junkyard Dog I am. So I tried to go in there and get
in every play. My teammates did a good job of feeding off me, J.T. and Zaire,
they made it easy for me to get a lot of steals and get a lot of easy buckets.
So I give credit to my teammates.  
  
Q. For DeMarre and Leo, can you talk about that stretch that always seems to
come for you guys where you kind of go on a little bit of a run and the energy
really builds up. Are you starting to expect that you've been doing that a lot
in the second half, are you starting to feel that coming and start to expect
that and see the other team start to lose it a little bit?  
DeMARRE CARROLL: We're a second half team, like Coach always says. He always,
we come in the locker room and he's like it's 20 minutes left, you know,
everybody get excited because it was a - he gave us a great motivation speech.
I think we're a second half team and if we can put two halves together like we
did in the second half, watch out for those Tigers.  
LEO LYONS: It's more we try to keep the pace of the game coming up. In the
second half that seems like when the teams get tired. We talk about the wear
and tear that we put on people by putting pressure on defense and offense. So
if you run for the whole game, sooner or later you're going to break down. And
today we played a team and it seemed like we took their legs from them in the
second half and we got the opportunities we needed to score and the stops that
we needed.  
  
Q. Can anybody tackle this that feels free to, what was the content, sum and
substance of that great half time speech?  
ZAIRE TAYLOR: DeMarre got it, he wrote it up. No, really.  
DeMARRE CARROLL: It was a great speech and let's say that, and it was a great
speech.  
(Laughter.)  
COACH ANDERSON: We can't tell everything, man.  
(Laughter.)  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thanks, guys. We'll excuse the student-athletes and take
questions for Coach Anderson.  
  
Q. Can you just give us a little hint about the half time? Was it your
actions, was it your words? Anything in particular that you used to convey
your message?  
COACH ANDERSON: Actually, I'm probably a little bit more calm and I think
that's probably shocking to them. Because right there you got to remember
right at the end of the half we had a six-point lead and we gave -- we made
Wittman take a tough shot and they got the offensive stick back and put it in.
And I had two freshman guards just kind of watching in amazement.  
I thought coming in they thought I was going to go off. But I thought we had
to settle down more than anything else and I always say there's two halves to
a game. But I thought our guys came out with tenaciousness on defense that we
played with all year long. I thought we made the subtle adjustments. I thought
we were doing the same thing over and over where they were trying to attack
us.  
And they only had three turnovers at half time. So to me that played into our
hands because they're more concerned about taking care of the ball than they
are maybe trying to score or get into what they want to do. And I think that's
what, as you look at the stat line, they had nine turnovers for the game, but
I thought our pressure defense was very, very effective. It was as one of the
guys alluded to. I thought we got to their legs and we tried to take them out
whatever they wanted to do and I thought that enabled us to really get into a
bit more aggressive offensively. It created some offense for us.  
  
Q. Do you see these runs coming? With the way you guys play and the style
you guys play, it seems like the run always comes. Do you see it coming? Do
you see it building up to that?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think we're capable of it. I think more than anything else
we're capable. I thought in the first half we didn't make shots. We had a lot
of open looks, as a matter of fact, we shot 12 threes and you can see the
effectiveness because we ended up shooting 57 percent in the second half. We
were 3 for 8 from the, I think from the 3-point line, and we make free throws.
So we didn't settle. I thought in the first half we just kind of settled.  
And getting a little bit more familiar with a team like Cornell, coming in we
knew they could shoot the basketball. And of course, they started off the game
with a zone which I expected to see that. But I thought we made the adjustment
at half time and that's what good teams do.  
But the runs when our defense is good, they're going to come. And I thought
our bench was a big, big key with that. Guys like Kim English coming off the
bench, Marcus, Justin, whoever came in, I thought they gave us some great,
great energy. But I thought the guys that started off in the second half, I
thought they set the stage and it was a good balance scoring and 19 assists on
28 field goals. That's pretty efficient and that's something we have been
doing all year long.  
I think this is a very unselfish team and, of course, Leo had it going on
tonight. He had a double-double and we know he's capable of it and I thought
he played very athletic tonight. He showcased that. And I thought DeMarre, you
look at the stat line, 13-7-5 assists, no turnovers, that's pretty strong
there. So again, it's those seniors that are doing those things. And of
course, I still like our guard play.  
  
Q. You mentioned Leo, can you talk a little more about the way he played. It
just seemed like they couldn't handle him inside.  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, it was to his advantage and you could see it early in
the game. I think he was making attacks to the basket, and that's, I think,
what our basketball team is and I think our guys are figuring out now that we
take advantage of that where people can. He's an inside outside guy that can
score. And the great thing I'm liking seeing now is he's doing a lot more
things on the defensive side. He's getting those rebounds, he's getting outlet
passes, he's having assists. So he's come a long way, he's playing some -- he
played one of his better games I thought in awhile tonight.  
  
Q. Coach Williams sat up there and gave a dissertation of numbers and
statistics. I wonder if there's a number or a stat that you guys pay specific
attention to and can sort of tell if you're going to win or lose a game?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think when we share the basketball. I think when our assist-
turnovers ratio, we recreate turnovers and if we can stay in the ballpark of
rebounding, tonight we were in the ballpark. They had 17 offensive rebounds.
Now that's a stat I don't like, but -- and of course, they got a lot of them
going down the stretch. But I think you're -- we're going to be one of the
better field goal percentage teams. We didn't shoot well in the first half.
Second half we ended up shooting 47 percent.  
So, that's been the theme of our team all year long. I mean, we have been
pretty good in those numbers. If you look to the conference and look at those
efficiency, the stats, the assists, the steals, the field goal percentage, the
defensive field goal percentage, those are some things that really stand out
with our basketball team.  
But I think more than anything else when I got the guys coming off the bench,
Kim English gives us 13 points off the bench, we have some other guys come in
and give us some quality minutes. I think that's more what I'm looking at.  
  
Q. A lot of guys new to this experience of the NCAA, what's been the
demeanor of the team? And has there been any surprises since they have been
here in Boise?  
COACH ANDERSON: No, I tell you what, they have been following my lead. These
guys are -- this is a great group of guys. They listen to, for the most part,
the things that we talk about. But I think the great part about it has been
the constant theme all year long, one game at a time. Every game's a big game.
No matter who you play, they're capable of beating you. And it's a big game
for them and it's a big game for us.  
So coming in you want to take out all the doubt in their minds and you know
there's going to be some nerves going. But I think that for our guys, things
have been pretty simple for them. And all I wanted them to do is bring the
energy and defense and I think the rest will take care of itself.  
I think I got some guys sitting there on the bench, they know that they're
going to have an opportunity to go play and I think that's been the secret of
our team. We're the ultimate team. The ultimate team.  
  
Q. I understand in the grand scheme of things it's probably not something
you think about right now, but your team tied a school record for wins in a
season. Is that an accomplishment down the road that you would be pretty proud
of?  
COACH ANDERSON: Probably on down the road. Right now it was the next game and
we got that one is over with and these guys can enjoy it to midnight and then
we get ready for Marquette. But these guys, again, these guys have done an
unbelievable job. They believe in one another, they trust in one another, if
you look out on the floor they're having fun.  
  
Q. With all the nerves and that going into this one, you guys come out and
turn the ball over the fewest amount of times all season. Can you explain how
that happened.  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, I just think the flow of the game. We were shooting it,
but we wasn't making any. So I guess, you know, that's probably good in a way.
Most times you turn over you don't get shots. At least we were shooting it, so
they were shooting it as well. So it wasn't a thing of beauty from a shooting
standpoint. And I thought both teams got real tired early on. But that's
nerves, I think.  
If we can take care of the ball and create tempo I think more than anything
else -- and that's probably the fewest turnovers a team has had against us
this year, maybe somebody else. But at the same time I thought our pressure
defense was the difference in the game. I really, really did. There was a lot
of different ways that it can have an effect on the game and I thought you saw
another way tonight. And I thought that it was good on our guys' part because
I always tell them there are times when you're going to have patience on your
defense as well and I thought we did that tonight.  
  
Q. You talked about the zone in the first half and you guys had some long
possessions. How do you stay aggressive and maintain tempo without forcing up
bad shots when a team is packing it in like that?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think we got to make the zone move and make our attacks, we
got it to the baseline -- as the game continued to flow I thought we started
getting the ball to the baseline, you see J.T. sneak back there, we got a lob
in there to Leo and eventually they're going to have to come out of that zone.  
But we just didn't -- I thought we didn't have -- we didn't take good shots. I
thought we just turned the ball around so we could shoot a jump shot. We can
shoot that on the first play if that's the case. But I thought we did a better
job of us start attacking and seeing the gaps and attacking and not only that,
putting our big guys in position where we can get in there to them and they
were a lot more effective.  
  
Q. In your opening statement you said that your pressure defense put them
into personnel groupings that made them uncomfortable that they hadn't used
before. Can you be more specific in terms of what you saw from your defense?  
COACH ANDERSON: I thought that Wittman is a big key in their team and I
thought that we did a good job on their screen and roll, they do a lot of
screen and roll and a lot of screening for him and I thought we had people
wherever he was. And obviously they had some shots that they missed too.  
But I thought just our presence, guys of being there in position, I thought it
kind of made them a little hesitant. And so again, I just thought our defense
was pretty darn good and we were rebounding the ball, we were pushing the
ball, and I thought that you saw the effect of it in the second half. And our
defense is to disrupt what other people want to do and I thought we did a good
job of that in the first half.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, Coach.  
COACH ANDERSON: Okay, thank you.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good morning, welcome to the first round interview session,
Boise, Idaho. For Utah State University, the Aggies, with us on the dais this
morning starting on your right and working to the left, Pooh Williams, Jared
Quayle, Tyler Newbold, Tai Wesley, and Gary Wilkinson. And we will start with
a couple of questions.  
  
Q. I'm assuming that you and Pooh will be the two regarding the two
Marquette guards. Can you talk about the matchups and how you guys are
preparing for, to meet those guys.  
TYLER NEWBOLD: We're going to be matched up against obviously Matthews and
McNeal. And watching them on film, they're great athletes, great basketball
players and myself and Pooh are really excited to be able to match up with
guys of that caliber.  
And you want to, as an athlete and competitor, you want to play against guys
like that. You want to compete against guys like that. So we're both looking
forward to that opportunity and looking forward to playing well against them.  
POOH WILLIAMS: Yeah, we're just really excited about it. These are two guards
that will possibly be in the NBA, so we're excited for our opportunity to have
a chance to play against great players like them and we're just excited for
it. We're going to do our best to slow them down.  
  
Q. Gary, since you guys are in the WAC, obviously, and have been here
before, can you talk about maybe a slight advantage about playing here in
Boise.  
GARY WILKINSON: Definitely. I think that we, yeah, we feel comfortable in the
gym and we have a great fan base. Obviously being in the WAC, Boise State fans
as well as coming up from Logan, it's not too far of a drive. So I think we'll
have a lot of support here. Feel comfortable playing in the gym. So that's
definitely an advantageous for us and I think we're going to try to use every
advantage we have to go out and win.  
So it's a great draw for us in terms of where we're playing.  
  
Q. Tai, two years ago you had one of your great wins in this building, this
year was one of your worst games. Talk a little bit about that.  
TAI WESLEY: I don't know really what to say about that. This year it was a
real big letdown for our team how we kind of didn't show up for that game. We
got beat.  
So hopefully we can come out like two years ago where we came out kind of on
fire, playing good defense, playing Aggie basketball and have the same result
as we did two years ago.  
  
Q. Looking at statistics at least there might be, if any advantage, you guys
have, as a team, there might be an advantage on being able to take advantage
or maybe their posts are not scoring and rebounding as much. Do you guys see
any advantage there that you can take advantage of?  
TAI WESLEY: We have, will have an advantage inside. Coach has been telling us
that they crowd hard with their perimeter players. So we'll probably look to
go inside out first and try to attack them on offense that way.  
GARY WILKINSON: Size-wise and that type of thing it may look like an
advantage, they're an athletic team. So they use that to their advantage.
They're quick and we'll just see what we can do as far as inside out game.
That's the game we played all year and I think we have always had an advantage
in the post. I think that's one of our largest strengths and then our outside
guys are deadly from outside. So I think that's, we'll just play the way we
have played all year. And it's worked for us so far and hopefully it will
continue to work for us tomorrow.  
  
Q. Gary, a lot has been made of the fact that you're older than dirt. Older
than 200 NBA players, you know, the oldest guy in the tournament. How do you
feel about that kind of talk and is it an asset for you to be an older guy?  
GARY WILKINSON: I don't know. It's just talk. I think there's older and
younger guys in every profession and it's just something -- I don't know if
it's an advantage, I have had a lot more experience in my life, so that might
play a part. It's what it is. I'm older than most guys and so maybe I have a
little bit more old man strength as some might say, but other than that I
don't know if it's too much of an advantage.  
  
Q. Marquette's game is a lot of drive and kick. They get a lot of 3-points
that way. How disciplined do you have to be on defense in terms of not helping
too much because they're going to kick out eventually and get some 3-pointers?
How disciplined do you have to be on defense?  
POOH WILLIAMS: We got to focus on keeping them in front of us. They're a very
athletic team and we just got to just stay in front, stay down on a shot fake
and just know that they're trying to get into the lane as much as they can.
They also can shoot good from the 3-point line, so we just got to stay
aggressive on defense and just be really disciplined.  
JARED QUAYLE: One of our strengths this year has been our help defense. We
know that they're going to get by us and they're great players, of course they
are. So our help defense is going to be key. We're going to have guys stepping
up and taking charges, because we know they like to get all the way to the
basket. So definitely our help defense is going to help us win this game.  
  
Q. You guys have talked about the athleticism. How do you prepare for that
without seeing it in practice? Have you guys done anything to try to simulate
it? Have you put seven offensive guys out there, anything like that to prepare
for the athleticism?  
POOH WILLIAMS: No, we have just been doing what we do all year as far as game
preparation. There's nothing we can really do about their athleticism, just
play smart and Aggie basketball. Cut hard, set good screens and that will take
care of itself. We haven't changed anything as far as that.  
JARED QUAYLE: Well, we have our scout team and they're great athletes, so they
give us a good look every day in practice. So they may not be as athletic or
as good as athletes as we're going to be facing tomorrow, but I think that it
will prepare us well and we'll be able to do what we do.  
  
Q. All year you guys have been, coach is trying to keep you on an even keel
with getting in the Top-25 and things like that. Now the atmosphere is even
more, NCAA tournament, the excitement and things like that. What are you guys
doing to stay focused despite all the circus?  
TAI WESLEY: All this excitement is only going to help us. It's exciting. Who
wouldn't want to be playing in the first round of the NCAA tournament? Five
hours from where we play. With we'll have a lot of fans here.  
I think all this excitement's just going to help us play better, get more up
for the game, we might have to deal with a little bit of nerves, but I don't
think we have had to deal with that much this year. So I think it will just
help our team play with more energy.  
TYLER NEWBOLD: Once they throw that ball up, it's just a basketball game.
There's a lot of stuff that goes into it and there's a lot of fun times and we
got to enjoy that, but we got to remember that what we focused on all year in
order to win and in order to play well. And I think as a team we're a mature
enough team that we know what we need to do to have a chance to win and we
just got to focus on those things. Have a good time with all of the other
things that are going on, but make sure we understand what it's going to take
physically and mentally in order to have a chance to win.  
  
Q. Gary, with your shorter amount of time on the team and doing what you've
done as far as putting up that massive amount of points, and being the senior
guy of the team talking about your age, how much pressure have you put on
yourself to try to take life experience and talk to these guys and actually
get everyone rallied to get involved in this game? It's going to be one of the
most important games ever for you.  
GARY WILKINSON: The great thing about this team and for me throughout the year
is that I think that every guy -- I haven't really had to be the loan leader.
These five guys or four guys sitting up here with me have been leaders on this
team and I never felt alone in terms of trying to amp up the team or get the
team ready. Every guy up here, and there are guys not up here, that have taken
it upon themselves to get ready to go every night out and that's one thing
that's been a strength for us. We have relied upon each other. We're a family.
And it's, we have relied upon each other to get going.  
One guy stepped up one night, another guy stepped up another and that's taken
a lot of pressure off me as a senior and I don't feel like I'm a lone leader.
And so I think that's what's really been a benefit for us. As far as trying to
help everyone get motivated, I just try to be motivated myself on the floor in
practice and that type of thing and hopefully don't have to say anything but
lead by example. And I think everyone up here's done that and I think that's
what has made us a really cohesive unit this year.  
  
Q. Tyler, everyone has been talking about how you're going to defense them,
but what can you offer offensively to set them a little bit back and try to
make them work extra hard so it takes up some of their energy on defense?  
TYLER NEWBOLD: The biggest thing we're going to have to do is with our
offense, we must screen well. And if we want to kind of offset their
athleticism and their pressure that they're obviously going to try to put on
us, we need to cut hard and we need to have a great screening game. When we
have screened well, in games this year, we have gotten great looks. If we want
good looks at the basket we will have to screen them well, we'll have to cut
hard and when we're open we have to be ready to knock those down.  
I think if we do that, I think our offense will be all right.  
  
Q. Gary and Tai, how important is it going to be to limit foul trouble? In
games where you guys have struggled there's one or two of you that have ended
up on the bench for a lot in the first half. How important is that going to be
against a team that's as athletic where you need that help defense?  
TAI WESLEY: I've struggled with foul trouble all year. So all my career,
excuse me. (Laughter.)  
But it will be extremely important. Coach has told us they have made more free
throws than any of their opponents have shot. So it is an extremely important
thing that not just me or Gary, but every member of our team stay out of foul
trouble. Limit their free throws during the game and I think that will help us
a lot.  
GARY WILKINSON: I echo what Tai said. I think staying out of foul trouble is a
huge part of any game but especially here because of how aggressive they are.
I think that it's just going to be about playing solid defense and then help
defense isn't so much about fouling but creating harder shots or getting in
the way, taking charges, that type of thing. And so we just got to be -- this
is probably the most solid help defense game we have had to play all year, so
that's the way we're going to approach it and hopefully we'll execute it.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, gentlemen. And we'll have Coach Morrill
up here in just a moment. We'll go ahead and get started with questions for
Coach Morrill.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about when you played in Boise and even
when you were in Reno you guys have had such good fan support, what does that
mean to you and to the guys on the team to be able to have so many people come
out, no matter where you play?  
COACH MORRILL: Well, that's the first thing I said when we got our NCAA
pairings and knew we were going to Boise, the first thing I said is, This is
unbelievable for our fans to have a chance to get to this venue, and it's four
hours away and the problem is getting enough tickets. I think we were assigned
originally I think 550 tickets and you will see more Aggies than 550. Last
time we were here, you know, there were 2, 3, 4,000, and we bought tickets
from our schools. I think we have done the same this time. However they get
tickets, they find a way.  
But it means a lot to our players. Our environment is as good as it gets in
college basketball. We get 4,000 students, our place is basically packed every
night we play. To our guys, it's as big time as it gets.  
So hopefully that will help us in an environment like this when we're stepping
into the NCAA's and competing and I hope our guys can settle in and play.
That's the challenge, obviously.  
  
Q. When you look at the tape of Marquette and you look at their athletic
guards, what do you see? A lot is made of what they can do on the floor and
that's really what makes Marquette tick. What do you see when you're watching
game tape?  
COACH MORRILL: Well, their skill level and athletic ability jump out at you.
It's real easy to say, Okay, it's a Big East team and they're extremely
athletic, but you got -- at that level and that league, you got to be more
than just athletics, you got to have really good basketball skills. And
obviously with the scoring averages of their team you got a lot of guys that
can shoot it and make plays and drive it and they're just so explosive. The
thing that concerns me, number one, is can we get them slowed down.  
If they're just getting easy baskets on turnover transition, easy baskets
driving to the paint because we can't contain them, then it's going to be a
long, I want to say night, a long morning for us.  
But, so that's the challenge is trying to stop them from getting so many easy
baskets in transition and off the drive.  
  
Q. Can you compare what you will be facing in Marquette with any team that
you've played this year? Is there anybody, any team that comes close to
that?  
COACH MORRILL: I think their style is similar to Boise State and New Mexico
State in that they want to run on mades, they want to play fast. They want to
mades, misses, whatever, I don't know anybody in our league that has the free
throw discrepancy that Marquette has with more than 300 free throws more than
their opponents have shot. I've been coaching a long time and I haven't seen
that one very often.  
What that tells you is that they are getting to the basket, they are getting
people in foul trouble. So similar styles to Boise and New Mexico State, but
yet obviously a little higher level talent level when you talk about Big East
players. And I like our league a lot and I think our league has real good
players, don't get me wrong, but obviously a little higher level player that
you're dealing with Marquette.  
  
Q. This isn't the first time you've been in the NCAA tournament, but it's
the first time for your players. This is the biggest stage they have been on.
How do you keep the atmosphere from being a distraction? How do you keep them
prepared to go?  
COACH MORRILL: We try and focus on playing the game. All this other stuff that
you do because you're in the NCAA tournament, enjoy it. Experience the whole
environment and enjoy it. But don't let it be a distraction. Focus on game
plan, focus on getting ready to play and it's a basketball game. It's not life
or death.  
And we went down to Nevada with a whole lot of pressure, there were a lot of
people saying even though the year we had had that we wouldn't be in if we
didn't win the quarterfinal game and then we won that one. Now you won't be in
unless you win the semifinal game and we won that. Now you probably won't be
in unless you win the championship game.  
So there's some pressure in that certainly, but our guys, we're real steady
and I kept telling them it was the Nevada invitational because we were playing
on Nevada's home court. And with all due respect, maybe this is the Big East
invitational with three number one seeds and pretty much all of their whole
league in the dang tournament or at least half of it. So for us we need to go
play. We're not picked to win, we need to go have fun and play and get our
game plan ready and see what we can get done. Obviously we want to show up and
compete.  
When you look at who we have played in the NCAA's, it's like a who's who of
college basketball. In the six years, we have been six out of the last ten
years and we started with Connecticut, then we beat Ohio State and got UCLA
the next year. Then it was Kansas, then it was Arizona, then it was
Washington. Now it's Marquette. So it's been a challenging game every time
out. So that's something that I'll relate to our team and it's no different
than it's been in the past when we have been here. Very challenging game.  
  
Q. Is too much being made of the age of your team?  
COACH MORRILL: Yes.  
  
Q. Seems like there's a lot of people that want to talk about that.  
COACH MORRILL: Yes, way too much is being made of the age of our team. Nothing
was made of it really until we got a lot of national publicity this year and
then Mark Fox from Nevada for whatever reason decided to make a deal out of
it.  
Every team and every program has things that help them. We're not as athletic
as some teams. We're not as big as some teams. We do have some older kids. And
that's a little niche for us. But everybody has their thing that helps their
team. Our guys have still played the same number of years, just the fact that
they interrupted it with two years of not bouncing a basketball some of them,
not all of them, that doesn't necessarily -- it makes them a little more
mature, it doesn't necessarily help their basketball abilities. I've always
said what it does most is help them deal with me, which isn't easy to do, just
ask my wife.  
So it helps them deal with me and maybe that's the biggest plus. But every
team has some things that help them, whether availability of getting players
or like I say, athleticism or size. Ours happens to be that we have a little
maturity. But it shouldn't be quite as big a deal as it's being made out to
be.  
  
Q. You mentioned the free throw discrepancy for Marquette. How important
will it be and what tactics or what game plan have you stressed to your team
to help avoid getting into foul trouble and getting them to the free throw
line?  
COACH MORRILL: Well, we're not going to tell you our game plan, you probably
knew that. But how important it will be depends on whether they can just get
us in foul trouble. You've seen a lot of games this year where Tai Wesley has
got in foul trouble. And that's not a plus if we have him or a number of
players setting over by me. You look at Marquette and their big three, McNeal,
Matthews and Hayward, they're on the floor for close to 40 minutes every night
out. So we have got to keep our top players out there as many minutes as they
can be out there to matchup and that kind of thing.  
If we're in foul trouble, it makes it really, really hard. One thing that will
help us maybe not get tired and maybe not foul as much is the NCAA time outs
are about nine minutes long. Believe it or not, even though it's the NCAA
tournament, as a coach you're used to about 90 seconds. And with these time
outs, in past NCAA tournaments I've said to my team, That's all I got. That's
all I got. We'll sit there for about 20 seconds and then we go out. I mean, it
may sound like coaches have always got more to say, but those time outs,
they're good for resting but sometimes they're a little long. But maybe that
will help us stay out of foul trouble, I don't know.  
  
Q. Have you noticed a difference between Marquette since they lost the point
guard? What do they do differently, how are they similar and different?  
COACH MORRILL: I haven't worried about them when they had the point guard.
He's a really good player. I saw a little bit of them playing when they had
him, but we have concentrated on who they are now. And they're still plenty
talented, still plenty good. We haven't got into all the differences when they
had him and when they don't, because we're playing the team that doesn't have
him and that's what we need to focus on.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you, Coach.  
COACH MORRILL: Thank you.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and take some questions for the student-athletes
of Wisconsin.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the problems their length inside could give you in
the middle?  
MARCUS LANDRY: As we all know, they're a pretty big team. They have a 7-1 guy,
6-9. They're a long team. But the good thing is that we just came off a game
where we saw some guys that are similar to those guys length-wise at least.
Maybe not as big, but it's a good thing that we have seen guys like this
during the year and it will help us out.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, as one of the last teams in the field do you feel
some added pressure to prove that you guys belong after hearing for a week
that maybe you should have got in, maybe you shouldn't have?  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: Even though I'm a senior, this is probably the least amount
of pressure I've felt to go out and just because maybe it's because of our
seed, I don't know. But the last two years we were a second and third seed and
you feel like you're expected to win. You guys all pick us to win. I don't
know how people picked to us win this game. And it really doesn't matter, we
don't really pay a lot of attention to it. We get a chance to play a really
good team in Florida State and make some noise and have some fun.  
So we're going to go out with some expectations on ourselves to win and play
well, but we just haven't been really listening to what everyone else says
about us, so it's kind of fun.  
MARCUS LANDRY: He said it right, some guys feel a lot of pressure of being a
low seed maybe and feeling like they have something to prove, but we're
seniors and we have to go out there and give it our all. We're happy to be
here, we get another chance at trying to accomplish something that we have as
a goal as Division I athletes. So it's a great feeling just to be in the
running again and have another chance.  
  
Q. On Sunday night did you think you would be sitting somewhere on either
Thursday or Friday?  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: Yeah, we did. We thought we were in. As the first two regions
went by without our name being called my heart was beating a little bit
faster, but that was only half the teams. We still felt pretty good about our
chances. We have had some pretty good wins this year. We're confident in our
resume. Our coaching staff did a great job of building our strength of
schedule up and we went out and performed as well as we could. We took some
bumps, but we responded well and played well toward the end, which I think
ultimately got us in this tournament.  
  
Q. For both, it kind of goes to playing well at the end. You had that long
losing streak in January and I know all the games were close. But at that
point I would imagine you're not thinking about the tournament, what were you
thinking about?  
MARCUS LANDRY: Well, it did come down to the last few possessions. And we
hopefully, when we go into these games, we learn from that, those things that
we were going through during the year. And this is the best time to prove that
we learned from those things. We're going to go into the game tomorrow ready
and prepared.  
The coaches, they do a great job at giving us certain things and showing us
what we need to do so that we won't have those scoring droughts or different
things like that. So hey, this is the best time to show what you learned and
put it to use.  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: I think that, of course, we would like to go back and replay
those six games, I think we would -- if we knew what we do now, I think we
would, those results would be a little bit different. But we went through that
stretch and we learned a lot and I think that we have accomplished a lot of
our goals because of that stretch. We learned that we had to trust each other,
that trust kept growing and growing and we learned how to finish games,
although we haven't done that in one or two since then as well as we would
like, would have liked to, we learned a lot about how to win ball games
through those, even though we lost, which is kind of weird.  
  
Q. Talk, obviously your stay at Wisconsin has been a little bit different on
the court, off the court. Can you talk about your experience there and sort of
what it feels like to come out with the accomplishments you have at the end.  
MARCUS LANDRY: It's been a great experience. Everybody, teachers, coaches,
they have all been behind me 100 percent. My experience at Wisconsin has been
great. I've grown as a person, as a man, and I can only say good things about
Wisconsin. And that made me a better player, a better person, a better
student-athlete. Everything. I couldn't have picked a better school.  
  
Q. You look at Toney Douglas, I don't know that anybody has really stopped
him this year, but you guys probably won't guard him per se, maybe someone
else will, maybe Trevon, but how do you maybe slow a guy like Toney Douglas
down or kind of contain him so he doesn't go off for 25, 30 or whatever?  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: "Contain" is a better word than "stop." I think we all have
watched Toney, especially this last weekend at in the ACC tournament, he just
put on a show and it was fun to watch. He's great player, we respect him as
much as anybody.  
I think that comparison-wise a lot of people ask that in the Big-10 who do we
compare him to? I don't know. Manny Harris, Kalin Lucas, I mean, you can throw
those names out there, but Toney Douglas is himself. I think he's made a name
for himself.  
So comparing people is just not fair for him because he made a great name for
himself and we got to go out there and stick to our rules. We're not going to
change a whole lot. Obviously we got to be really focused this time of year
because any mistake, if you go up on a pump fake and you foul him, the mistake
is magnified at this time of year. And he can really do that, he can hurt you
in so many ways.  
MARCUS LANDRY: That's definitely true. We're going to go out there and give it
our all. He's great player and only thing we can try and do is really contain
him. The best thing that we can do as a team is make him take tough shots.
That's something that we have done a great job at over the years and since
I've been here we do a great job at making guys take tough shots. If we can
make him take some shots maybe that he doesn't want to, that will work in our
favor.  
So we're going to go out there, we're going to give it our all and try to make
him take some shots that maybe he's not used to taking. But he can make some
tough shots too, but that's what we're going to try to do and we're not going
to let him get anything easy.  
  
Q. One of the few teams that has really handled Florida State was
Northwestern. I understand that was a long time ago, and the ACC Big-10
challenge, but is there something that you guys take from that? I'm not asking
you game plan, but something that you're familiar with obviously with
Northwestern?  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: Sure. I think all teams would say this, that you grow so much
from, I believe that game was probably played in November, maybe early
December. Teams have gotten so much better since then. I don't know what the
score would be now between those two teams, but you look at a team like
Northwestern, what they try to do is just move the ball, move bodies, and that
was successful. Any time you can do that against any team you're going to be
successful and they made their shots.  
But we're just going to try to -- I don't think we're going to be running the
Princeton offense. We're going to stick to our stuff and do what we do best,
but moving the ball and bodies is very important to winning ball games, it has
been for us all year and it if we're to win this game.  
  
Q. Do you guys think it's fair, so much criticism that's been leveled at the
Big-10 and are you rooting for those guys, your conference mates to make a run
and sort of help out the name of the Big-10, I guess?  
MARCUS LANDRY: I can't say it's fair or not. I guess everyone is entitled to
their own opinion. But those guys have done a good job at building their
resume and they're in the tournament and of course we're rooting for those
guys. It just shows how good of a conference the Big-10 is to have seven guys
in.  
So all the things that people may say about the conference, I don't really
believe it. I can't really agree with any of those things. It's a tough
conference. That just proves that it's a tough conference right there.
Northwestern giving Florida State -- I mean they're a good team -- giving them
a run for their money, you can't take teams in the Big-10 lightly, you got to
look at every team the way you do any team, whether it's a North Carolina,
UCONN, you go out there unprepared, then you'll take a bump. So I think the
Big-10 has shown that they can play with any conference.  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: I'm proud to be a part of the Big-10. Seven teams in the
Big-10 tournament or in the NCAA tournament is a great accomplishment and to
be one of those seven teams is awesome. I thought we could have got one more,
but the number just didn't work out with the numbers, but that's the analysts
job to say those type of things and we all just sit back and listen and enjoy
it.  
  
Q. You guys obviously come from the Big-10, do you feel that there's some
disrespect you getting the 12th seed and you guys having a chip on your
shoulder at all because of that?  
MARCUS LANDRY: I don't look at it as disrespect, to be honest with you. Like I
was saying before, once you become a Division I athlete you have certain
goals. One of our goals is to try to win a National Championship. I would be
very sad if I was sitting at home and I wasn't in the NCAA tournament. But
hey, I get another chance, Joe gets another chance, the team gets another
chance at trying to accomplish the goals that we have as Division I athletes.  
So whether we're 12 seed, 16 seed, it doesn't matter, it's just, hey, it's fun
being in. So we're going to go out there and give it our all.  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: He's right. We got to keep that chip on our shoulder, no
matter what seed they gave us on Selection Sunday we're going to come into
this tournament with a chip on our shoulder wanting to win as many games as
possible. Any team that doesn't have a chip on their shoulder is going to get
beat, because you got to have that.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thanks guys. We'll take questions for Coach Ryan.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the impact Toney Douglas has had on Florida State
and have you faced a guard that's so good on both ends of the floor like he
is?  
COACH RYAN: Well, you know, there's -- he's a senior, so he's maturity-wise,
he hurt us enough a couple years ago when he was a sophomore, but he's even
better now on both ends. Any time you have a guard that can catch and shoot,
put it on the floor, pull up and shoot, and get to the rim and shoot, and make
them, then offensively, you know, you got -- and be able to pass the ball --
you obviously got a pretty good player. Defensively he's as good as there is
out there. We have to face the Manny Harris's during our conference play,
E'Twaun Moore, a guy like him, long and rangy, Evan Turner, a little taller, a
little different type player. But the guards from Penn State are pretty quick
and pretty good shooters. And we played Connecticut, we played Virginia Tech,
some teams that people that Florida State would be familiar with.  
But it's always different. It's the next 40 minutes, it's a different team,
different venue, different time. So you just prepare with what you do and
knowing that he's a good player and try to make sure that he doesn't get too
many.  
  
Q. Talk about Sunday night, what the wait was like and then if you feel like
the team's maybe gotten a second chance. The players sort of talked about this
as a new experience, a fresh chance to start over. Do you feel like you've
kind of been given a second life?  
COACH RYAN: No, because once you have your body of work in, you really can't
change anything. So for me, a poker face guy, I just know that our guys
scratched and clawed their way into playing 30 games of pretty solid
basketball. Played a tough schedule. We knew that going in. And that's one of
the biggest things that helped us was our strength of schedule.  
And the fact that we got hot. I don't know of any other team that's ever lost
six games in the conference season, in a row, and still made the NCAA
tournament at large. There might have been -- our SID has not been able to
find -- you said four or five in a row and then still made it? So that says a
lot for the guys that are going to be on that floor tomorrow night. But it is
what it is when you're sitting there. I'm not one of those guys that's going
to bite his fingernails or do anything like that, there's a lot of intelligent
people that sit in that room and take information and I just figured let's go
play. And we weren't disappointed. We get a chance to play.  
  
Q. You mentioned the Florida State game from a couple of years ago. Toney
Douglas was on that team. Can you take anything from that game or was that in
the past or can you take any elements from that or maybe as far as what
Florida State does?  
COACH RYAN: I looked at 15 or 20 game films and all of them were from this
year, but at a half of that one. I looked at a half of the game a couple years
ago. It's two different teams. It's more about the precious present, what's
going on and the fact that they're playing so well.  
I looked at games in the beginning of the year, the Pitt game, the couple
games they had then and then mostly the last 12 to 15 games. All I know is
that they're pretty good and they deserve to be in it, I don't know, maybe
even a higher seed. But we're in it, so they have to win six, we have to win
six if we ever want to say that we're the best team, so it's mostly about now.  
  
Q. You were talking about the six-game losing streak and the question is, I
know the games were close, but given that that usually ends most of your
dreams, how did you keep your players' heads in the game and sort of get that
thing?  
COACH RYAN: Growing up in Chester, Pennsylvania. That's the truth. Just the
streets of Chester and growing up on the playgrounds and through Chester High
School and things my parents taught me. I'm a hard guy to get to, to the point
where you feel like you have no hope, you feel like we're not getting the best
end of this deal, because there was a couple games in there where there was
some things that were very interesting that happened that obviously we can't
talk about. But just it is my background and then I just tried to instill that
in the players and I got some pretty tough players.  
  
Q. You can talk about it?  
COACH RYAN: Joe Krabbenhoft off the streets of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, he's
a wily veteran now of growing up tough. But, no, the Marcus Landry and Joe
Krabbenhoft's and Trevon Hughes, Bohannon, all those guys, you know, they
didn't get down because they know how we always try to prepare for next. And
we were in a position where we lose any one of those games, we're not here. So
we were playing in the NCAA tournament a long time probably before anybody
else was.  
  
Q. Is there any advantage being a 12 seed for you guys?  
COACH RYAN: You know, I don't know anything about seeds. I don't know
sometimes on the lines where people are put. I don't know anything about that.
But I don't see any advantages of being high, in between or low. Other than
what you're doing with your players and in your practices and what you're
working on and how you're trying to prepare. I can guarantee you this, there
aren't too much coaches talking about seeds when they're getting ready to
play. It's all about the preparation, the drills, the scouting report, and the
main thing is take care of business with what you do.  
  
Q. I know you guys took the bump against Ohio State there in the Big-10
tournament, but can you talk about how you guys are playing right now, how do
you feel heading into this game against FSU?  
COACH RYAN: I think we're like a lot of teams where if you could just hit a
couple shots in certain situations it changes the whole complexion of a game.
Everybody says it at the end of the year, oh, if we would have made these two
free throws, if we would have made that shot, or, boy, that was wide open and
it didn't go in. But I've coached long enough to know that we have been on the
other side of that probably more than we have been on the short side of it, so
you have to take the bad with the good.  
And I just, I know one thing, when we were going home, we just kept thinking,
you know, we have got some good basketball in us, we just hope we can get a
chance to show that. So I don't think we were discouraged at all.  
I think our guys realized that that's a pretty good team, Ohio State was very
young and by the end of the year here now they're playing a lot better. And
they don't use the excuse of anybody being hurt or even though Lighty hasn't
been able to play, Thad and I are pretty good friends, he never whines about
injuries, he plays with what he has. And I thought Ohio State's been playing
pretty well. So I thought we were beaten by a good team, so I didn't let that
cloud hangover.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the -- has the Big-10 gotten a bad rap nationally and
is it important that the conference does well for recruiting and exposure
purposes in the NCAA tournament?  
COACH RYAN: I don't know. If you expect coaches to answer a question that way
-- there's an old line that people used to use, but you can't use it any more,
about, does a husband do something and the answer is you can't give an answer.
Because if you say yes or no or whatever, then no matter what it is, it's
wrong.  
The Big-10 did what it did, our RPI is what it is, we don't defend anything. I
was going to be a lawyer and in my ninth grade year book I put down, ambition,
I had lawyer down. Philadelphia area, that's what everybody says anyhow. But
I'm not one, so I'm not making any cases. We're just playing. And I think
that's what the other Big-10 teams are doing. They're just playing. And proud
to be playing.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, coach.  
COACH RYAN: All right. Thanks.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with questions for the Florida State student-
athletes.  
  
Q. All three of you have been the leaders all year trying to help these new
guys get accustomed to ACC basketball. Obviously none of you three guys have
ever played in a NCAA tournament game. What kind of advice have you been
giving them? Can you give them advice because you haven't really been her
yourself before?  
TONEY DOUGLAS: I think we started from the beginning of the season and that's
how we got to keep going. Even though this is even my first time being here in
the NCAA tournament, obviously throughout the whole preseason and the season
in the ACC, I think that we just take it over from here.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your evolution as defensive player, I guess I heard
that in the past maybe you weren't too interested in defense but obviously
that's changed.  
TONEY DOUGLAS: Yeah, I was horrible on defense coming out of high school. I
was just known as an offensive player. But I think I take a lot of pride in my
defense, especially in the ACC. It's a lot of top guards in our league, so if
you don't play defense you get exposed real quick. So that's one of the main
reasons why I play defense.  
  
Q. Was it an effort thing or just wanted to get good at it or what?  
TONEY DOUGLAS: It was effort. I want to be good too. Now I think it's just fun
for me. I love -- I always want to guard the best player on the floor if it's
at the guard standpoint. So in the NCAA tournament it's a lot of good guards,
so I'm looking forward to it.  
  
Q. How big of a difference tomorrow do you think it's going to be getting
tempo? I think they like to slow it down a little bit, play a little more half
court, you guys probably want to run a little bit.  
TONEY DOUGLAS: We're going to have to be solid on defense. Watching film they
use the whole 35-second shot clock. And all the five players on court can't
break down. So we're going to have to make sure we be solid on defense, help
each other, don't break down, we'll be just fine.  
  
Q. It's been a long time, obviously, since you guys have been to the NCAA
tournament, since '98. How do you guys make sure that you guys aren't just
happy to be here and you maintain the focus and hunger and that kind of
thing?  
TONEY DOUGLAS: Like we have been doing the whole year, we take one game at a
time. Focus on what's happening. Every time we play defense we win games.
That's been our theory for this whole year. The games we lost we haven't
played good defense. So as long as we defend and rebound I think we'll be just
fine. And have intensity for 40 minutes.  
BRIAN HOFF: Basically we just got to be consistent. This year our thing has
been defense. We have been playing defense consistently every game we won.
Pretty much that's been due to defense.  
As long as we keep playing defense for the whole 40 minutes, 35 seconds at a
time we'll be all right.  
  
Q. From what I understand you really asserted yourself this year as a leader
that maybe called the team together before the season started. Talk about what
you've done to sort of fill that role and how the team's responded.  
TONEY DOUGLAS: Basically I look at the past three years I've been at Florida
State, we have been so close and our coaching staff always tells us every
possession counts in every game we play. I think that in the past three years
for us not getting to the big dance because we took some possessions off. And
I think this year our young guys and the rest of my teammates, they really
took that in and they know it and that somehow some of our losses we have we
really know watching film that every possession counts. And I think we got to
look forward for this NCAA tournament and take -- don't take no possessions
off.  
  
Q. Toney, you mentioned your lack of defense coming out of high school. I
would guess that when you signed with Florida State you kind of knew that
Leonard Hamilton was going to be really emphatic on the defensive side.  
TONEY DOUGLAS: Yeah, he is known for his defense. It was sometimes in the past
three years when I was here that's all we did in practice is defense. And the
year, especially the year I was sitting out and I was like, okay, you know,
when we going to touch the basketball? But you know, being here the year
sitting out, looking at all the great guards in this league, I was like, Oh,
man, I got to work on my agility, foot work, foot speed, stuff like that. And
I just took it over from there.  
  
Q. For all three, when you were recruited to Florida State obviously it was
not a huge basketball school, but it's in a great basketball conference. What
was the lure of playing? Was it coming to change things at Florida State or
was it the chance to go get to play Duke and Carolina and those guys twice a
year?  
TONEY DOUGLAS: For me coming here, first of all, I always wanted to play in a
guard league, I wanted to be known as one of the best guards in the country,
and in the conference. And also being like the North Carolinas and the Dukes,
they already built legacies of winning. Me, I thought I could make a
difference by coming to Florida State by starting that legacy going to be one
of the first.  
We haven't been to the tournament in 11 years, so all I said before I leave
Florida State I want to leave that legacy back and have my teammates get to
continue that legacy when I leave.  
UCHE ECHEFU: I just think that we have the chance to make history for me
coming to Florida State, I think my freshman year, we have a bunch of -- group
of guys that can make it to the tournament that year, but at the end of the
year we came short of making the tournament. We got people like Alexander
Johnson and Todd Galloway, but by the end of the year, just like Toney said,
we took some possessions off and that cost us the tournament last year that
year, but right now I think that we just have a great opportunity to make
history.  
BRIAN HOFF: When I came to Florida State as a walk-on and I came there to play
in the ACC, the best league in the country. And when I came the coaches told
me that I got to do whatever I can to help us get to the NCAA tournament and
reach our goals.  
  
Q. Uche, this team was not picked very high in the preseason. Magazines
didn't think you guys would be having a season like this. It seems especially
with as much youth as there is, the team chemistry has been a big factor in
your success this year. Could you please talk about the team chemistry here
and how it's evolved and how much it's played a part in your success.  
UCHE ECHEFU: I just think that we are one family. Like especially the younger
guys, they look up to us and they listen to whatever we got to say. I will
give a big credit because they're willing to learn and trust in us. So we also
trust in them.  
But besides basketball, you know, like in the apartment, we're one family, we
do things together, we hang out and that really like builds the team chemistry
and that helps, you know, give us some wins on the basketball floor.  
  
Q. How long did it take for the seniors and the upperclassmen to start to
learn to trust the freshmen? You have a bunch of guys coming in right off the
bat and you're not really sure about them until you really get to know them.  
UCHE ECHEFU: I think it's tough in the preseason when we're doing conditioning
and stuff. Younger guys, we thought they were going to quit on us. We kept
pushing them and they responded. So that's when I know we have a special group
of guys this year. And even though they're young, they're willing to push to
the limit. So that's when we started having confidence in them.  
  
Q. Toney, Uche, do you expect tomorrow to feel different? I know you want to
take it one game at a time and you've done that all year, but tomorrow's going
to feel a little different, isn't it?  
TONEY DOUGLAS: Oh, well, of course it's going to feel different because my
whole -- every year I've been playing in college the season has been over. My
season continues now on the college level, you know. So it's going to feel a
little different. You know, I'm so anxious to get on the court. I was mad
because we were playing Friday. So I'm ready, man. I'm going to keep doing
like we have been doing the whole year. It's another game, but it's another
game that could help us really be successful.  
UCHE ECHEFU: Just like Toney said, it's going to be different. Like I been so
anxious to play, we haven't been here before, but we just want to experience
it. We talk to the coaches and they're like, This is the best feeling you can
ever feel. So we want to also have that feeling. And we want to just go out
there tomorrow and not just go out there and play, but to win. Just keep going
as far as we can.  
  
Q. People have noted your team chemistry. How much of an impact has Toney
had on that?  
BRIAN HOFF: Toney from day one from the end of last year and all the way up
until now he's been a big leader for us and starts off the court and carries
on the court. Every day in the summer he's hard worker, trying to get
everybody in the gym all the time. Even off the court, we -- him and Uche live
right downstairs from me and everyone lives together in the same apartment, so
we're always hanging out together and goofing around and Toney's been a huge
part of that.  
  
Q. Coach Hamilton has been to the NCAA tournament three times, it's been
awhile for him too, but what has he told you to expect about the NCAA
tournament? Has he shared any of his experiences from either Oklahoma State or
Miami?  
TONEY DOUGLAS: Yeah, he always tells us there's no greater feeling when you
cut the nets down. He tells us that when we were at the ACC Championship. And
NCAA tournament, you know, he been here a couple times, Sweet 16s, Elite 8s,
so always tell us, man, there's no greater feeling. And we are here to take
one game at a time and win every game we play, so we can feel that feeling. He
talks about it so much, I'm ready to get to that feeling.  
  
Q. For anybody. Did you feel pressure? It seemed that you guys mentioned you
haven't been here in a long time and Coach Hamilton has been there six, I
guess this is his 7th year, but did you feel pressure to get to the NCAA
tournament this year not only for yourselves but for coach?  
UCHE ECHEFU: Not really. We just want to play basketball and have fun. Plus
just to make history, like I said, from the season that we know that we had a
good chance of making the tournament this year and so we don't want anything
to slip away from us. We just keep pushing every day in practice and hold each
other accountable. Just trying to get the job done for everybody.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, gentlemen. We'll take questions from
Coach Hamilton now.  
  
Q. Toney Douglas talked about how he was a horrible defensive player coming
out of high school. Did you change his mind or did he just get his mindset
that he was going to have to play some defense?  
COACH HAMILTON: I think once he saw the competition that we were playing
against night in and night out and he realized that he had to get better, and
then actually once he became eligible, he realized that that was part of his
game that he could excel in, but that he had not given a whole lot of
concentration to.  
So he accepted our rules and our principles and more than anything else he got
his self in the kind of condition. I think when he realized that he had to be
in much better physical condition to be able to play at the level that we
needed him to play at in the ACC is when the light came on for him. He spent a
lot of time in the weight room, he gained 15, 20 pounds, he spent a lot of
time working on his conditioning. And then he devoted a lot of time to working
on his skill development.  
Even in the gym by himself, getting there early in the morning and getting 5
or 600 shots up before class and then coming back and this is in the summer.
Working on his conditioning by doing a lot of exceptional running. You would
find him running sprints in the summer, which is unusual for a player,
especially when they're by themselves. He devoted a lot of time in the weight
room. In fact, he lifted weights probably more than the regular times that he
was supposed to lift weights. And then he spent a lot of time just working on
his body, stretching, improving his flexibility. And that's given him an
opportunity to develop tremendous stamina that allows him to play both ends of
the court very well.  
  
Q. Detail a little the impact Toney's had on this team, the role he's had on
this team and also why do you think at this point he's yet to gain the same
national stature as some of the other point guards out there, Tai, Jeff?  
COACH HAMILTON: Well, I think he's gotten a certain amount of exposure. I
think that maybe it could be better, but I'm comfortable that people who
understand college basketball appreciate and respect what he's been able to
do. He was only two points short from being unanimous All Conference player.
Most people think that he legitimately had an opportunity to be named the
Player of the Year in our league.  
But I think the thing that separates Toney, and I said this several times, is
that not only he's a well-conditioned athlete, he's worked at it, he's devoted
a lot of time to it. And obviously as defensive player in our league,
sometimes that's very difficult to do for a guy whose maybe not a shot
blocker. And he's been the league leading scorer in all the ACC games, which
gives him a certain amount of notoriety.  
But I think the thing that he's done more than anything else is he has given
us tremendous leadership. He's taken a team with six first-year players and
he's found a way to communicate with them without being offensive and they
have followed his lead. He has temperament about him that is nonthreatening,
but is persistent and he's able to get guys to rally around him.  
Each night before each game we always have an -- I'll go over our scouting
report, but he'll go back and have a meeting with his teammates by himself at
11 o'clock before each game and he would give them his scouting report. So
he's developed that type of clear level of maturity the way he understood that
the players had to communicate with each other and then in their own terms.
And even different than the coaches. But he also has been around that we had a
clear understanding of what we needed and he kind of echoed, I'm sure, the
things that we were emphasizing in our game plans. He's just shown a different
level of maturity that I think that kind of separates him maybe sometime from
guys who are just really good players.  
  
Q. A lot of wins and a lot of high points this year, but earlier this week
it was announced that you guys had a hundred percent graduation rate. What
does that mean to you?  
COACH HAMILTON: Well, I'm proud of the fact that over my coaching career I've
had when I was at Miami, we only had three kids not graduate in the ten years
that I was there. I think that's important from a coaching standpoint to
realize that you have young men that you have in your environment that are
probably the most important part of development in their lives. They're going
from teenagers to manhood.  
And I've always felt that as a coach my true evaluation won't come until nine,
ten years down the road when you look and see how productive those guys are in
their different walks of life as they go on and become husbands, fathers,
neighbors, citizens, as well as those who have the opportunity to be good
basketball players. For the most part most of them will play basketball for
awhile, then they're going to other things. And I think my true evaluation
would be what have I been able to contribute to them that will help them move
on through life and be productive as a result of going through our program.  
So I do place a lot of emphasis on making sure that they do the kind of things
that they're supposed to, to get the education, because without that sometimes
you can get stymied and maybe not have the opportunity to grow and you miss
out on a lot of opportunities.  
  
Q. Did you feel much pressure this year? I know you haven't been to the NCAA
tournament at Florida State. How much pressure was on you and is it a relief
to finally get back here?  
COACH HAMILTON: Well, I think that you always can put out statistics to
justify one thing or another, but any time you take over a program that needs
a little fixing up and that's been my legacy, I enjoy going and being a part
of making the difference in programs that maybe have not been as successful
consistently over the years. But the last four years people don't realize
this, but I think we might be the fourth winningest program in the ACC in
terms of victories in the ACC, I believe that somewhere close to that. I think
it's North Carolina, Duke, and Clemson have won more games than we have the
last four years. So it took us a couple years to get it together.  
But we won nine games three years ago, we won seven and seven the last couple
of years and we won 10 this year. Now, the problem is we ran into some speed
bumps along the way. I thought we deserved to be in the NCAA and then we have
had, like most coaches have, you go through a period if you are going to stay
and continue to coach where you're going to have injuries, going to have
someone go to the league too early, you're going to have some unfortunate
things pop up. We went through our period.  
This year we have not had one, we have not had any of those basketball demons
raise their ugly head, we like to call them. We have been void of any extended
injuries for the most part. The team that we started the season with, we have.
Uche was a little slow coming back from his injury and Solomon was a little
slow coming around and Kitchen missed the first nine games. But we basically
have had the team together and it's made a big difference.  
As a coach I'm confident, I've always been confident and I think that pressure
means different things to different people. I've always been confident that we
would get the job done. And I feel like we have only scratched the surface, I
think we're going to continue getting better and better as we move on through
our -- with our teams. I feel confident that we have a nucleus of youngsters
coming back, I think our recruiting is going good. So if you keep doing things
the right way and stay focused and don't allow yourself to be distracted
things normally work themselves out.  
  
Q. I know you're a forward-looking guy by nature, but I was wondering when
you finally got the announcement that you're going to go back, did your mind
flash back at all to previous NCAA tournaments, the Sweet 16 run at UM or
anything at Oklahoma State?  
COACH HAMILTON: Maybe I'm a boring type of guy. I try to stick with the things
that I'm just dealing with. I worry about those things I can control.  
I've had a wonderful career. I've had so many unique and special opportunities
that I can't even count them. My whole focus has been just on a team with six
first-year players that you're depending on, you can't get too far ahead of
yourself. We have dealt with things on a very matter-of-fact approach. We lose
a game, we try not to get too low. We win a game, we try not to get too high.
So with each step that we have taken hopefully moving in the right direction,
we have analyzed it, discussed it, and tried to keep things in perspective. I
really didn't give any thought to anything other than let's prepare ourselves
and make sure that when we get to the NCAA tournament that we take advantage
of the opportunity. And we tried to keep our youngsters focused.  
We went to Wisconsin a couple years ago and they kind of handed our hat to us
and showed us the door. They did a very good job, we were -- and now they are
a team that creates a lot of challenges for us and we have to be focused on
being prepared. And so I'm not allowing myself to look too far behind, I'm not
looking too far ahead, we're just staying focused on the task we know we have
at hand and that's to try to be prepared to play a very good Wisconsin team
tomorrow.  
  
Q. You were mentioning the amount of first-year players that you have. How
much has just the -- it seems it's a very special kind of team chemistry. How
much has that played a part into your run this year and how would you compare
if you want to compare this team's chemistry to other groups that you have had
in the past?  
COACH HAMILTON: We have recruited some fairly mature youngsters. And I knew
this team had something special about them because it seemed as though I could
always feel relationships developing. Where even during the summer the guys
were always coming out of the office just wanting to say "hello" and wanting
to spend time chatting with the coaches, coming around together. And they end
up going bowling together and movies together and kind of hanging out, and you
could just feel them enjoying each other's company. And that's a pretty
positive sign.  
And once we got into school, Toney and Uche would step up and speak and I
noticed a level of respect that the youngsters gave them because they listened
to what they had to say. And they all came in and realized that we have been
coming close, and that they had an opportunity to be part of making a
difference and I think they really were anxious to want to make sure they
could find out exactly how they could contribute. We haven't had a problem
defining roles, they have accepted the roles. Some of them have started, some
have not. Some played major minutes, some games they have not. I have not had
to deal with a lot of home sickness or issues. They have really been a team
that appears that they have been this focused on accepting the direction not
only from the coaches and the senior leadership, and sometimes it's hard to be
a leader when you don't have guys that are willing to follow.  
These guys have, they check their egos when they checked in school. For
instance, a kid like Chris Singleton, a youngster that was McDonald's All-
American, I don't think he ever took more, he said he never took more than 15
shots in a high school game. But that's a youngster who understands that he
wants to become a more and more complete player. And I think that Chris has
devoted his time to defending, rebounding, learning how to adjust his speed to
the game. And I think that you see him getting better and better now as he's
grown and matured and gained experience through the season.  
But they all have done that. They have all had games where they have been
major contributors to the success of that game. And so you just have to say
it's an unusual bunch that seems to have that little something special that
keeps them focused.  
  
Q. Everyone talks about how physical Wisconsin is. How big of a challenge is
this game going to be for Solomon? And a second part to that question, what
makes him such a good shot blocker besides his size?  
COACH HAMILTON: Oh, well, you made an excellent observation. Because we're
long and lean and our youngsters have not matured to the point where they got
those lower base that keeps them, that allows them to hold their spot when
they're posting up or not being able to be moved around as well. That's
probably been a problem for us all year with Xavier and Solomon alone and so
did Uche. Chris has developed. So people have been, who have been physical
with us have -- and a lot depends on how the officials call the game. When
they're able to push us out and be physical, it has bothered us. That is a
concern of ours.  
Wisconsin seems to be a little more, play a little bit more of a physical game
than we do. And the Big-10's maybe a little more aggressive than the ACC. But
we feel that we have talked about it, hopefully we have made the adjustments
that we will be able to handle their physicality tomorrow.  
I think Solomon is, has good instincts for blocking shots, first. I think he's
a pretty good athlete. He has not gotten all his athleticism back because he's
still kind of coming back from not being able to do anything for a year and a
half. And you, it takes awhile to get your timing back.  
But he's gotten to the point where he's solid. He runs the floor pretty well.
He has great instincts, he's long, and he has a quick jump, so to speak. But I
think he's only scratched the surface of his potential. He's still learning
and growing. He has a great attitude. He's eager to learn. He's very
coachable. I think that in all phases of the game you're going to see him
continue to keep getting better and better along with shot blocking,
rebounding, and his offensive skills as well.  
  
Q. How important is conference affiliation this time of year? Is it
important to you that the ACC does well or how many teams each conference gets
in the tournament?  
COACH HAMILTON: I think that that's kind of part of just being in a
conference. You take a certain level of pride when certain teams, your teams
go in. You want them to do well because there's a lot of conversation all year
long about what conference is better than the other. Which I think is a bunch
of baloney. I think they're all good. But I think it's great for I guess water
cooler talk and arm chair quarterback talk and different alumni's talk. It's
just part of what makes sports exciting. But in reality, we all need to be try
to do the very, very best we can.  
I think when you look back at even some of the games that we played today,
once you get to the certain level, I think that most of the teams are capable
of winning. Maybe some have gotten more publicity than others, but you need to
be ready to play because I think you would not have had the level of success
unless you execute what you have in your game plan, playing to a certain level
of efficiency.  
So I think you got to be very focused. Much as I would like to see some of the
others teams in our conference be successful, at this particular point we're
going to worry about Florida State and try to get it together.  
  
Q. Speaking of the ACC, what would it, what does it take to get so that
you're in that conversation at the top of that league every year? Is it as
simple as just a couple good recruiting classes or does it go down to
facilities and the way the whole sports department thinks and stuff like
that?  
COACH HAMILTON: I think that that's an excellent question. Let's deal with our
team this year. We were picked to finish somewhere toward the bottom. But we
didn't have a lot of setbacks from injuries, we had the team that we had at
the beginning of the year, we kept growing and developing and maturing.  
We won some close games. But you have a some of those years where like for
instance two years ago we lost two seven footers and Toney Douglas broke his
hand. We won seven games, but we lost a lot of close games. Maybe if Toney had
not -- just think about the team that won the national title, whatever year
that is. Take their two inside guys off the team, their four and five man, and
break their point guard's hand. That's hard to come back from. That sounds
like an excuse from a coach and people don't want to hear that, but the bottom
line is the luck of the draw. Sometimes you have those unfortunate things
happen.  
For instance, North Carolina I'm sure would have played in the ACC tournament
a lot better had they not lost Lawson and those things happen. So maybe they
could have possible have won the ACC championship. Maybe. I don't know. Not to
take anything away from our victory against them. But that happens.  
But to answer your question, we just got to continue to keep doing what we're
doing. We think we everyone in our league recruits well. All the teams are
very well prepared. When you go on the road and play against the atmosphere
it's not very much different than Virginia Tech's atmosphere and Clemson's
atmosphere, Wake Forest, they all are, their fans are all passionate in the
support of their teams.  
And so I just think you got to just get the best players you can and try to
coach them and just hope that you don't have anything unfortunate happen that
gives you a chance to at least coach what you have.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you coach.  
COACH HAMILTON: All right. Thank you.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and take questions for the Cornell student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Louis, can you talk about what Mike Anderson said that he knew of you and
talked to you a little bit out of high school. Talk about what you know about
him and that kind of thing.  
  
LOUIS DALE: Well, coming from Birmingham, UAB is basically the basketball
school for us. Mike Anderson was there and it was a lot of excitement about
the solid play, the style of play, and that's what fans wanted to see. And he
recruited me a little bit in high school. I liked the solid play they played.
Pressing defense. And I just kind of talked to him every now and then about
possibly attending UAB to play basketball.  
  
Q. Louis, and any of the others, Missouri's defense starts with Zaire Taylor
and J.T. Tiller. Have you faced that kind of intensity that will pick up at
half court if not beyond?  
LOUIS DALE: When we played Minnesota I think they pressed us pretty well. We
kind of got used to that playing against a pressure defense. And I think that
will help us.  
We haven't played against Missouri, obviously, but we'll see what happens.  
ADAM GORE: I think we have played a pretty tough preseason schedule with
Minnesota and Syracuse, teams like that. So I think just playing that type of
talent has prepared the guys to face Mizzou. Like Louis said, we haven't
actually played or probably seen a pressure like they're going to bring, but
that's pretty hard to simulate and I think we have done the best we could in
practice and with our preseason schedule.  
  
Q. A lot of teams practice against six and seven guys to try to simulate
that. Have you guys done any of that?  
ADAM GORE: Yeah, we have. We have thrown the sixth guy in on the half court
and stuff like that just to kind of simulate their athleticism, their length
and stuff and the pressure. So we actually have been doing that this week.  
  
Q. Coming in as an underdog what do you do to prepare mentally against a
team like Mizzou, not only for the game but also for the hype surrounding
them?  
JEFF FOOTE: Coming in, we were here last year and we kind of let all the
surrounding environment kind of play into that. I think the experience this
year we have been more focused mentally. We have a couple weeks off because we
don't have a conference tournament. So we were using that more to focus on
looking past all the stuff, the extracurricular stuff and then just really
focusing on our opponents.  
RYAN WITTMAN: I don't think we go into the game worrying that we're the
underdog. I think that we just got to go out there and execute our style of
play.  
I know Adam mentioned it earlier, we played a pretty challenging preconference
schedule. We have got to use that experience to help us play against this type
of athleticism that we're going to see on Friday.  
  
Q. For Louis and Adam, how did you do when they threw the sixth man on the
floor?  
LOUIS DALE: I think we did pretty well. We just got to be ball tough and
execute passes and come meet the ball. I think that we can do a great job if
we just make sure that we do those things and not turn the ball over.  
ADAM GORE: I think we did a pretty good job all week. I think it's a focus
that we just have to make sure that we don't play into their hands of speeding
ourselves up and rushing our style of play. I think we just kind of need to
play at our own pace and realize that if we do that we'll be okay.  
  
Q. Ryan, last year against Stanford you kind of had a tough shooting day.
What kind of motivation does that bring and was it just a case of nerves or
something Stanford was doing?  
RYAN WITTMAN: Yeah, obviously they're a great defensive team last year. That
probably had something to do with it. Sometimes you just have those days.
Obviously the excitement probably played into it a little bit. I think I
remember my first shot almost broke the back board. So I think maybe the
experience will help out a little bit this year. Going into the game we're
going to not be quite as amped up. We're going to try to use that excitement
to help us.  
  
Q. Can you speak about your connection with Coach Anderson and how it's
going to feel to play against a coach that was recruiting you at one point?  
LOUIS DALE: It will be exciting, it will be fun to play this game. It's a
challenge for our team to come out and be the, quote, unquote, "underdog" and
play against a great team like Mizzou. Coach Anderson, we just, he recruited
me in high school and we talked about me joining the UAB team. But it's over
now. I don't know what else to say.  
  
Q. Do any of you guys watch "The Office"?   
RYAN WITTMAN: Yes.  
  
Q. Have you seen the Cornell episode?  
RYAN WITTMAN: Yeah.  
  
Q. Just what did you guys think of that episode? And I guess the question
that was sort of brought up in that show is: What does it mean to be a Cornell
man and like can I wear a Cornell T-shirt if I want?  
JEFF FOOTE: I'm kind of new at "The Office." I just started watching it. Andy
is the guy's name, I think he's hilarious. The creators of the show are from
Dartmouth, so obviously Cornell gets a little zing from that. But I think it's
just kind of funny that they play off of that and play off on the Ivy League
reputation.  
  
Q. Anybody else?  
THE MODERATOR: I think they're taking a pass on that.  
  
Q. The whole Ivy League thing, in the tournament, you know, just like the
guy in "The Office," we see the Ivy League team come in and it's kind of a
fascination. What's the academic pressure like or would you say you have a
basketball experience that's pretty close to what everybody else is doing?   
RYAN WITTMAN: I think that the transition to college is tough for anyone. I
think just like any other program out there it takes some time to adjust and
to get used to college and succeeding in the classroom, I guess.  
So I'm not really sure if it's that much tougher at Cornell or anything, but
because I haven't been to any other college, I think it's an adjustment for
anyone.  
ADAM GORE: Basically what Ryan said, that's kind of my opinion also. I don't
really have any opinions on any other schools, I never been there. So the
classroom and the ball experience, I think, would probably be pretty similar
to most places. I think we should put in the same kind of work on the
basketball floor that the other teams do and I think the classroom is
something that we focus on quite a bit, but I don't think that distracts away
from the level of basketball we're trying to play.  
  
Q. A follow-up to that, when they found out that they were playing you guys,
one of the Missouri freshman, and you know it had to be a freshman, comes out
with the idea that, yeah, in four years we're probably going to be working for
those guys, but we may have to beat them while we can. Do you get that a lot,
that kind of stuff?  
LOUIS DALE: I guess so. Coming from an Ivy League school we kind of have that
label as being really nerdy kids or smart kids. So I'm sure that a lot of
people think that or say those type of things. It just comes along with it, I
guess.  
  
Q. You guys all went through this last year and not only the game, could you
talk about going through the media attention, the practices again and what
experience that's going to give you helping you ultimately trying to pull off
this upset.  
RYAN WITTMAN: Obviously experience is going to help us. I think last year we
might have got caught up a little bit in that. We heard a lot about how it was
the first time Cornell had been to the tournament in 20 years, I think. This
year I think we're a little more focused. But on the other hand our experience
alone isn't going to win this game. We still have to come out and we're going
to have to play really well if we're going to win. We're going to have to
execute, going to have to take care of the ball. And experience can help us do
that if we use it in the right way. But it is not going to win the game by
itself.  
  
Q. Can you recount a little bit your journey to Cornell. I heard a little
bit of it but sort of how you ended up here.  
JEFF FOOTE: I was, you know, recruited out of high school by any Division-I's
and I walked on to St. Bonaventure after I met Coach Jason G. I was there for
a year, I was red shirted and then, you know, Coach G was kind of my mentor
there and he left. And so I was kind of out in no man's land and Khaliq Gant
had his accident where he was nearly paralyzed. And right after his accident
when he was in the ICU, my mom was his nurse. And she got to know Coach
Spiker, she got to know a lot of the guys on the team like Conor and Adam. And
she just like when I decided that I was going to transfer, she kind of gave
Cornell a big push because she knew the guys on the team, she knew the
coaches.  
And after that I started talking with Coach Spiker and things looked really
good. I couldn't pass up an Ivy League education. And it seemed like a place
that I would really fit in. So it really kind of worked out very well for me,
so I ended up here.  
THE MODERATOR: We thank Cornell student-athletes. We'll now take questions for
Coach Donahue up in a second. We'll take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I wonder if you can talk about your use of the sixth man to simulate
their defense. What you were able to accomplish and how it worked out.  
COACH DONAHUE: I guess you're referring to trying to simulate Missouri's
athleticism and length and there's really no way to do that except add bodies.
And that's what we have done.  
Over the last couple weeks we have done that. And I sense that we would get,
we would get a team that we would play, since we run good offense and we have
good shooters, that someone that's going to try to take us out of our offense,
full court press, good long athletes. And so we took that week that we had,
because we have no league tournament, and just really worked on the press,
thinking that we would get somebody.  
Sure enough, you get somebody not only that does it, does it for 40 minutes.
So I think that's helped us. That being said, as I said, it's very hard to
simulate just the pace of the game that Missouri presents itself. It's
extremely difficult to do that.  
The other thing I think we have, we have a lot of guys on our team in general,
we carry a lot of guys at the Ivy League level, we have a couple transfers, a
kid named Marc Van Burck that played at Kentucky last year and some good
length and athleticism really in our second group. And I thought our white
team really bought into trying to make it hard for our first team to run
offense and simulate as best we can. And now we have done it for 10, 12 days.
It's actually been interesting to watch it develop, to watch the development
of it.  
  
Q. Foote was talking about it when he was here but can you talk about how
Jeff and Khaliq and their roles on the team and how it ultimately brought Jeff
to Cornell?  
COACH DONAHUE: Yeah, you're referring to when Khaliq was hurt and obviously a
very difficult time in our program. I told this story a lot, but it's worth
saying again. That was a very difficult time for me personally. We hadn't had
a winning season at Cornell at that point and Khaliq was playing a great deal
for us and suffers that serious injury in practice. And all during that
traumatic experience we meet a woman named Wanda Foote who mentions her son, a
7 foot basketball player at St. Bonaventure, really didn't think more of it
than that. But what impressed me is that she called later and said how
impressed she was with our guys, and just how they cared about Khaliq and what
he was going through. And loved her son to consider Cornell.  
Obviously it's something great that came out of that whole situation. Two
things, Khaliq is doing terrific, he's got a great life ahead of him, he's a
normal college student, although he won't play college basketball and I think
Jeff Foote has flourished in our system, all due to his hard work. Where he's
come from, and he's not even close to where he can be, but where he was and
where he is now is incredible due to his work ethic.  
  
Q. For those who are not as familiar with Khaliq, how he got hurt, can you
briefly tell us.  
COACH DONAHUE: Absolutely. Khaliq was a day after a Monday after we practiced
or lost at the buzzer to Columbia, our arch rival. Remember I went red eye
back to New York and walk in a night practice and it's a difficult game for
us. We don't have any league tournament, you lose to your arch rival so the
intensity of that practice was up and I probably was more into it than I ever
have been, set a couple rebounding drills. And the ball's thrown up, two guys
collide, that I watched, hit heads and I see blood. I'm like, oh man, can't
believe this. And then sure enough to the right is Khaliq's down on the ground
laying on someone's legs. And what happened was someone's chest crushed his
neck into his chest. He laid motionless to the point where you know right away
something is seriously wrong.  
From that point on I think we handled everything incredible. Kid that he was
laying on doesn't move. Ryan Rourke, which prevented any additional damage.
Trainer's 10 feet a way, medical staff's there 20 minutes getting steroids in
him. He's air-vaced to a medical center. And then later down to his home down
of Atlanta. Doesn't really have any movement for about two months. And a
miracle, he starts working through it and eventually walks out of that
facility in four months.  
Just a remarkable young man and what he went through and watching our team go
through it, and I say this all the time, it changed me definitely as a coach,
but as a father and as a man to watch that what we went through and as I said,
I didn't really care what happened that year, and sure enough we have our
first winning year and I think I'm a better coach because of it.  
The way you handle things, small things don't bother me any more. It is way
more about the bigger picture and having the guys enjoy their experience and I
think you end up getting more out of kids and producing more off the court as
well.  
  
Q. One guy on your team that didn't go through this last year was Chris
Wroblewski, can you talk about how he's handling the pressure and the role
he's going to play in tomorrow's game, especially with all of the press that
Missouri puts on?  
COACH DONAHUE: I think you're referring to, we were here last year,
fortunately, and we had basically five sophomores start. Those guys are all
juniors, one exception is Chris Wroblewski, who was our Freshman of the Year
in our league in a league that had very good freshmen this year.  
What happens was Adam Gore our starting guard tears his ACL in September,
decides to take the operation and come back. And in the meantime we lose our
starting point guard, Louis Dale for the first ten games of the year and we
have to start a freshman and we're playing him 37 minutes a game. And we're
playing the likes of Saint Johns, Siena, Syracuse, Minnesota, Indiana, Saint
Joe's, La Salle. And I thought the kid was tremendous from the start. What
I'll say to you is I think those 10 games that we'll prepare much better than
if we had Louis and had Adam. Chris, he's had three turnovers in the last 120
minutes of play in our league. I have great confidence in him. I think he's as
good as we can have out there versus Missouri. Going through that experience,
I think he's ready to play this game, seems like nothing really bothers him
poise-wise. He never seems to lose his composure.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Jeff Foote and sort of kind of coming out of nowhere
and then what he's meant to your program?  
COACH DONAHUE: Yeah. Just to give you an idea, he played in our gym I think in
a high school playoff game his senior year. With a lot of Division III schools
in the building. Not one thought he was good enough for a Division III. And I
thought, to be honest with you, I didn't think he would ever be able to play
at this level. He was very thin like 160 or 170, six-nine, six-ten. And I go
-- he goes on an academic scholarship to Bonaventure and really never plays
college basketball for two and a half years. Because he red shirts there, he
then transfers and sits out for us and plays the second semester of last year.
And by that time I think there's two and a half years, obviously put on a
great deal of weight, grew to seven foot, and what he does is he just really
works on his game all the time. It's a simple thing that players do that are
good. Great skill, if he was six-seven right now he would be a good player.
That he's seven foot makes him special. Led us in assists for most of the
season. Just really seized the floor.  
I think he's not even close, I think three or four years down the road he's
going to be making a great deal of money at this game because I know how hard
he's going to work. And at that size it's rare to see a kid that is that
skilled, runs that fast, has that kind of work ethic.  
  
Q. Missouri seems to come up with nicknames for a lots of its players.
Carroll, the junkyard dog, and they call Tiller the Tasmanian Devil and of
course they play 40 minutes of hell, so what do you call the practice of
putting seven guys out on defense against your offense to try to prepare them
for all that?  
COACH DONAHUE: I wish I had a cute nickname for it. But it's fear, you know.
You practice and you watch Missouri's stuff and I say this a lot to a lot of
people, you can go clips of 10 minutes at a time and think, well, you know,
it's not that devastating. And then you just watch and all of a sudden that
affect plays on teams. And a lot of it is unforced stuff. Kids just get
fatigued and they kind of throw the ball away and really without a trap. And
it's so different than everybody else plays now days.  
I think we tried to, I think we got to that point a couple times in practice.
We do, we did a lot of stretches where I didn't blow the whistle, did not stop
it, it got very ugly. Like things that I would really would not want to happen
in a game. But I don't know if you're playing into their hands if you don't
try to take advantage of that.  
That to me is a key. If someone is going to try to take advantage and gamble
and you're not using that as part of your attack, I think you're in trouble.  
You start thinking -- and we're not that type of team, to be quite honest. We
share the ball, based on what the defense does. I don't have an offense that
runs for 30 seconds straight and calculate these guys. I try to teach them how
to play basketball against what the defense does. So we're going to have to
take advantage of that.  
And at times we're going to have to put it on our hip and make them guard us.
And it's going to have to be the players understanding when to do it and when
not to do it.  
  
Q. Could you speak to Ryan Wittman's importance to your team and maybe also
touch on what happened to him last year in the NCAA tournament. How you think
he'll rebound from that?  
COACH DONAHUE: Ryan's has developed his game and it's been immense over each
season. Again he was an unrecruited kid. Reason we got him was because no one
else wanted him. We worked hard for him and I appreciate him coming to
Cornell, but if people knew how good he would be, he wouldn't be here.  
From a freshman, when he -- most of his, 75 percent of his baskets were threes
until now it's under 50 percent. He's almost a 2-1 assist to turnover. One of
our better rebounders, defenders. I think last year he's developed so much
more of his all-around game.  
I think last year it was a three or nothing. Now it is way different. I also
feel that the preseason schedule that we played without Louis Dale, to be
honest we would not be in those games if he doesn't get 25 to 30. And that's,
he knew that. And I felt that part of his game really developed during that
stretch. So now he's played almost a hundred college basketball games,
probably 25 against teams like Missouri, just much more confident in going
against that kind of athleticism now than he was last year.  
  
Q. A lot of talk has been about how you're going to handle the Missouri
pressure, but what's the plan on the defensive end about how to control their
offense?  
COACH DONAHUE: That's a great question because I think it's as important, like
I think people look at what they do on defense, they're a terrific offensive
basketball team. Their assist to turnover numbers are staggering. Just
tremendous.  
They assist on almost 70 percent of the baskets. We're going to have to guard
and you're going to have to limit them to one shot. We can take care of the
ball all we want and we don't guard in the half court, and we don't limit them
to one shot, we're in trouble.  
We have been focused on that as much as anybody, but it just doesn't get as
much publicity, because you watch them play and you don't sense that they
share the ball as well as they do. They don't move without the ball as well as
they really do. Those things Coach Anderson does with his team, that's the
thing that amazed me. There's a lot of teams that try to press you and then
they're so unfundamentally sound on the offensive end you can hang in there.
It's not the case with Missouri. They do it on both ends.  
  
Q. Talk about how Missouri the way they played that defense is different
than anybody else. Why is it different, why don't other people do it more what
are the challenges you think of coaching that way?  
COACH DONAHUE: I think there's a couple key things that make it's extremely
difficult. You have to have kids just buy into that type of thing. And now
days at that level my sense is that kids want to go to that level and play in
the NBA. And what I think he has if you look at it, he's got kids that were
kind of under-recruited, transfer from Delaware, his nephew buying into it,
like all those kids are just buying into it right now. You really, it's hard
to sell kids that you're going to only play 24 minutes a game, we want you to
play full court defense, we don't want you really to think about yourself,
that's it in a nutshell at that level.  
I think that the teams want to get marquee players at the highest level and
this isn't a style that necessarily plays into that and I think it's a credit
to those kids that he has. Especially the kid Carroll, I think he's as
talented as there is and I know he has a junkyard dog, I'm more impressed with
his just feel for the game of basketball. It comes so easy to him. He just
gets baskets in so many different ways. He moves the ball, he rebounds, he
defends, he just does so many other things. But I do think it has lot to do
with the unselfishness of buying into that and not thinking about your stats.  
  
Q. This time of year the Ivy League team always seems to capture a little
bit of America's imagination because we want to know what it's like to be in
that kind of an atmosphere. Is there any way a kid can sneak a good basketball
player can sneak through the academic side at a place like Cornell? Could you
just describe what the academic challenges are?  
COACH DONAHUE: You mean sneak through in terms of not doing his work and play?  
  
Q. Anyway you want to answer it?  
COACH DONAHUE: I'll say this, the Ivy League is so legitimate in terms of
academics at all eight of our institutions. And I've been at Penn State for 10
years and this is my ninth year at Cornell. I think about the players in our
league, we have had academic All-Americans, I talk to my colleagues, Joe Jones
at Columbia, James Jones at Yale, Tommy Amaker at Harvard and all the guys,
Terry Dunn at Dartmouth, we talk about the load that these kids have
academically. And you wouldn't imagine it. We don't miss much at the school.
Our kids miss three days of class in a second semester. That's all.  
Our practices are set up to be successful in the classroom. Our game schedule
Friday and Saturday is set up to be successful.  
There's nowhere to hide, there's no joke courses, these kids have so much on
their plate academically and I'm in tune to it because I've been around it for
19 years and sense when it's too much to put in maybe on a Wednesday we look,
I have four guys with mid terms and I can see that they're done. And we can't
go any longer. All those things are within our world and are very difficult if
you want to compete at the highest level.  
And if you saw these four guys, all of these guys right now can play, I feel,
for any school in the country. But what they do is they achieve such great an
academics and they have overcome so much, and still have a dream of playing
after college. And it's just a credit to them in all the workload that they
have and I mean that at all eight of our schools. I sense that this is a huge
challenge for these kids day in and day out to want to compete at the highest
level basketball and achieve great things in the classroom.  
  
Q. Following up on that, what has it meant to you to be at the Ivy League
for 19 years to coach at it, what has that meant to you?  
COACH DONAHUE: I feel extremely privileged to coach the group of young men
that I have always said and this quote is I think we're the best coached
league in the country and it has nothing to do with the coaches it has all to
do with the players. You tell them one thing, they do it. They don't
necessarily care how it gets done. These kids all buy into the roles. They're
not worried about the next level and all those things. So when you go to
Columbia or you go to Dartmouth, those kids know your stuff inside and out.
They're going to follow the game plan that the coach says. They're not going
to deviate from that. All those things are there.  
The other thing is I talk to my colleagues in the business and I know what
goes on off the court. To be honest with you, I don't have a lot of rules off
the basketball court about my team. There's a great deal of trust that I have
with my players. But I still 19, 20 year old kids and they will be
knuckleheads sometimes like all of our kids will be. But in reality they
really just care about what they're doing, they have much more focused goals
in their life than the typical 19, 20 year old kid does. And as a coach it's
just makes it so much easier to coach basketball that way.  
  
Q. A lot of talk about Missouri's style of play. Obviously we haven't seen
you guys play a lot out here. What should people expect out of your team?  
COACH DONAHUE: I think the thing that sticks out if you haven't seen us play
is that we play fast. We're trying to -- my thing in basketball is always been
is be the aggressor. And obviously within your physical capabilities, but I
think the thing that makes us good is that we're able to play fast and still
be skilled. Still be fundamentally sound.  
We're the leading scoring team in our league by a long shot. We have been.
We're going to move the basketball, someone's open, and he's a shooter, he
shoots the ball. We just try to play fast, share the basketball, make teams
guard us right away, and then obviously we're trying to limit the opponents.
We'll mix up our defense, we'll play different ways, try to prevent them from
getting good shots. Not necessarily taking them out of their stuff, but more
staying in front, limit them to one shot, keep them out of the lane, contest
them hard, and all those things that are within our physical capabilities.  
  
Q. Last year was the first Ivy League title for Cornell in 20 years and this
year is the second. So a lot of the guys have experience from last year of all
of this. So how does that experience help them concentrate on the game and the
task at hand and less on all of the attention from the media?  
COACH DONAHUE: That's -- obviously that's a huge point that we mention. I
think a couple things: One, I say that I noticed a difference right after we
won it this year. That that week we had off last year was incredibly like a
circus. And I sense we probably got caught up in it. Young kids who had no
idea what just hit them. And we were so different.  
This year we were very excited, but it's more like this job's not done. Let's
go to work. We had tremendous practices over the last two weeks. Really
focused. Less worrying about where we're going and then the other thing is I
think that that taste in your mouth after you are so disappointed, not just
that Stanford beat us but we didn't play well. We were very disappointed and
in our performance. I think for our team's sake and our fan's sake and our
alumni's sake and our league sake we want to prove that there is good
basketball in the Ivy League level and just really show better than we did
last year. I think that's a great motivating factor.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you coach.  
COACH DONAHUE: Thanks, guys.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions now for the Marquette student-athletes.  
  
Q. Lazar, everyone's been making, rightfully so, about the focus on the
guards. Do you feel sort of maybe lost out in all of the attention and what do
you make of the matchups with you and Utah State?  
LAZAR HAYWARD: No, I don't feel left out and I don't think Dwight does either.
I think that there's always going to be certain focus on certain guys. That's
just how things are.  
I think Utah State has two great big men and it's going to be a great matchup
for Dwight and myself.  
  
Q. Wesley, give us just a read on how you feel like your team is different
since Dominic has been out.  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: We're different in a sense where we lose that dynamic
athlete. Bringing the ball up the court.  
He's played four years, he's been battle tested, he's played four years with
the three of us, three years with Lazar. There's just plays and reads that he
makes that we don't have to talk about. Just that chemistry on the court that
he has and he brings and just what we know we can expect from him. But Maurice
has made a lot of strides since Dominic went out. He's been better every game,
he had a his breakout game against Villanova in the Garden and we're adjusting
to life without Dominic. And this team is ready, we're prepared, and we're,
more importantly, we're excited to play again.  
  
Q. You've seen a lot of good big men in the Big East and if you could
compare where Wilkinson is as to others that we have seen in the Big East and
what his skill set is.  
DWIGHT BURKE: Well, Wilkinson, the coaching staff has kind of compared him to
like a player like Luke Harangody, with the same build and height and weight.
And he does a lot of the same things. He likes to score in a lot of the same
ways on the block. And he's crafty and he can pass out of the post, so we're
focused on trying to limit his touches and keep him out of his comfort zone
and he's going to get out there tomorrow -- we're going to get out there
tomorrow and try to make that happen.  
  
Q. Jerel, you obviously probably learned a lot about Utah State in the last
couple of days, how they run a lot of set plays and how precise they are in
their offensive sets. How do you plan on disrupting that?  
JEREL McNEAL: I think the situation just like you said, they're a team that
does an unbelievable job of getting the great look every possession that they
have with the ball.  
Our main focus in coming into the game is just to put nonstop pressure on
them, force them into tough shots if possible. And after we make them take
those tough shots, that we got to get a defensive rebound right way. They're
not the type of team that you can give second chances to or anything like
that. So I think if we do a good job of pressuring them 94 feet and making
things tough on them, giving them, making them have tougher looks and get
first shot rebounds, that we'll be all right.  
  
Q. Wesley, it wasn't that long ago, four years ago, that you were sitting up
there and you guys were in San Diego, California and you thought, Hey we got
three more years of this. Now that you're seniors do you feel the sense of
urgency that this is our last go around, let's try to make this special?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I think so. It's definitely a sense of urgency coming from
the three of us who are playing. But I think there's a sense of urgency
throughout the whole team because it is our last go around, our last shot at
this. But for everybody, we got something special as a team and I don't think
any of us will get this again at any level, no matter what team we're on, how
long we play this game. We're not going to get what we have here. So I think
that's why we want to, why we're playing with the edge, playing with a chip on
our shoulders, because we're not ready for this to end yet. And a lot of teams
say it, everybody says it, but we mean it more than anything.  
  
Q. You guys have been through this four times now, you've been up there, can
you talk about how much the experience means when you're out there on the
court, not being overwhelmed by the lights and pressure and everything like
that, having been through this so many times before.  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I think it's going to help us. We have been through a lot in
these four years. Our freshmen, we had a chance to, we made a great comeback
against Alabama and had a chance to tie it up. Missed it. So a heartbreak game
there. Our sophomore year we went scoreless for the first nine minutes. Last
year, we were able to win our first game and then we lost a heartbreak in the
second round. So we have been through a lot in four years. So I think that
just gets us mentally ready to overcome whatever happens. And we have been
through a tough conference, we have had a tough stretch in our last six games
and we have been -- we have battled a lot through that. So I think that as a
team mentally our focus is ready.  
  
Q. Coming from the Big East conference people out here in Boise don't get to
see too many Big East teams. What can people expect from you guys talking
about the style of play in the Big East?  
JEREL McNEAL: I think it's a situation that as far as our conference goes,
it's so many diverse teams in our conference and everybody in our conference
plays a completely different way. And I think that's one of the things that
makes our conference so unique and tough as well.  
But one of the constant things that you get out of coming out of the Big East
conference is just tough, hard-nosed physical play on a night in, night out
basis. And I think that over the next couple days the people out here are
going to get a taste of that.  
DWIGHT BURKE: Definitely as he said, you know, it's tough every night and
every team is just competitive and you can lose on any night in the Big East.
And that's been proven throughout the college season so far. We have been
battle tested through all our wins and losses and in situations where we
played every kind of style and every kind of player. And like he said, we're
going to get a taste of it. We're going to work hard and be very competitive
and show the world and America that we're still trying to be competitive and
make things happen in this tournament.  
  
Q. Lazar, having to watch Utah State on tape and you guys have played a lot
of different opponents this season, anybody you can compare them to that you
look and say, Okay there's some similarities here?  
LAZAR HAYWARD: I don't know. In our league I don't know if we can compare them
to any team. I'm not sure. That's a really good question. I'm not sure if we
seen a lot of teams that run their sets as well as they do. They get a good
look at the basket every single possession.  
I think what we have to do is just try and makes defenses and show them a
different look every time they come down the floor. They're getting the ball
in the post a very high percentage of the time on offense and they're always
making the extra pass and they play very well together. So I don't know a lot
of teams in the country that can do that.  
  
Q. Jerel, you were talking about running their sets, Utah State, how
important is it to remain patient with you guys on defense and not try to
overwork, overforce things?  
JEREL McNEAL: You talking about for us defensively?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
JEREL McNEAL: I think for us it's the main thing is just having that mental
toughness and being mature enough and poised enough to know that you're not,
you're not going to, they're not a team that you're just going to take the
ball away from them, you're not going to force them into a lot of quick, bad
shots. But it's a situation where we got to be mentally tough enough to be
prepared to guard some possessions for 30 seconds, 34 seconds, whatever it may
be until it comes down to the end of the shot clock.  
The real thing is that after they do take that shot and they ground up so much
clock that we got to make sure that we get a rebound after that and we don't
give them a second look. We can't let a 35 second possession turn into a whole
minute possession for them.  
  
Q. Wesley, did you have any familiarity with Utah State before the pairing
was announced? Did you know anything about them? What have you learned about
them since then?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: None before the pairing. But after we learned a lot. Like he
said, they get a good shot every time. They don't shoot 49 percent from the
field by taking bad shots. And they're going to get their shot, no matter what
you're doing. So our focus has to be of playing sound defense.  
We got to make sure we're disciplined. As soon as that shot goes up, we got to
get the ball, because we don't want to play defense for another 35 seconds.
They're a good team, they play inside out, they got a lot of players. They're
a disciplined team. They're a mature team. It's going to be a good game. It's
going to be a battle of two different styles.  
  
Q. Playing them, their defense, what do you see of Utah State's defense? We
talked a lot about you having to play against their offense. What do you see
from their defense and what can you do to them defensively or with their
defense?  
JEREL McNEAL: I think it's going to be a situation where we are going to have
to do the things that we always do, which is just playing, drive and kick
basketball, playing off one another, trying to get to the rim, and forcing
them to foul us early on in the game.  
But just as far as the defense goes, they got a good mix of man-to-man, zone.
Personally I think we'll see a lot more zone on Friday. So it's a situation
though that we just got to do things that we always do. We got to get paint
touches and play inside out and get everybody involved. If we do that, we'll
be all right.  
  
Q. It's been joked about that with the way things have been seeded that they
should change the name from the NCAA Tournament to the Big East Invitational.
Do you think that's deserved at this point and what do you think people should
expect from the Big East in this tournament?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I don't know. I can't really comment on that. I can't really
speak on behalf of other Big East teams, but having played them for four years
I know they're going to compete, fight, work and try to win just like we are.
And it is deserving. We have been beating up on each other all year, and it
feels good to get out of it and play against somebody else.  
But I know that we're going to come ready to play, to win, to fight, and play
for each other. I'm sure that the rest of them are going to do the same thing.  
LAZAR HAYWARD: Like he said, we all beat each other up all year long and I
think it's a good challenge for all of us when we get to match up with another
team. I just think that's the thrill of basketball to have fun and see
different guys and try and beat somebody else up for once in a while.  
  
Q. You talked about defense being important here against Utah State. Late in
the regular season in the Big East your defensive numbers in terms of other
teams having success were up there. But then in the Big East tournament it
seemed to turn around, especially St. Johns and then you held Villanova to 42
percent. Do you feel like you're back into that defensive mindset and maybe
how Maurice Acker has been, you know, put into that system as well?  
JEREL McNEAL: I wouldn't necessarily say that we're back in it. We had one
good game, complete game, pretty good defense against St. Johns and that still
could have been better because they did an unbelievable job in the first half.
We let up a little bit in the second half. Villanova, we weren't very good in
the first half and then we were really good in the second half. So I think
we're right on the cusp of getting back in the rhythm of what we need to do
defensively. And if we are able to come out and defend for 40 minutes at a
high level, playing team defense and doing things that we need to do, I think
we're a very tough team to beat.  
And as far as Maurice goes, he's been doing an unbelievable job, just like Wes
talked about earlier, we all feel like he's just improving each and every
game. He's getting more and more confidence. We're getting more and more
confidence in him as the games go on. And like the most important thing with
him is that as long as he come out and he's defending, at a high level, and
getting, helping the team run the offense, that he'll be fine.  
  
Q. Since Logan is driving distance from Boise, we anticipate it's going to
be a pro Utah State crowd here. Do you guys anticipate it being like a true
road game for you?  
DWIGHT BURKE: Definitely. It's a long way from home for us. It's like a three
and a half, four-hour flight and it's like right down the street for Utah
State.  
So definitely. Their fans are probably going to show up and maybe pack the
place out. But we'll have our fans and it will be kind of a road environment
for us, but we played on the road all year, so we're not intimidated by that.  
  
Q. A lot has been made about the age of some of Utah State's players, some
of these guys have taken two-year missions and Wilkinson is 26. Does that
matter to you guys?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: Not at all. Not at all. I mean, hopefully we got a lot more
years of basketball after college and I'm pretty sure we're going to play
against men there too, so there's no difference. I said it before, they're
mature, they're veterans, but I mean it's still the same game.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thanks, guys. We'll have Coach Williams in just a
moment. Let's go ahead and take some questions for Coach.  
  
Q. First off, you and Stew Morrill must be really of the same kind of mind
that smartness. He hired Tony Benford for one day, you've hired him. Has Coach
Benford said anything about the one-day experience of being a Utah State
assistant?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I actually saw Coach Benford the day he was employed at Utah
State. I don't think he ever made it to Logan, but I think that Coach Morrill
or Coach Duryea probably sent him a Utah State T-shirt to wear on the road
that day. The day that I saw Tony he was wearing a UTEP shirt. And I said,
Tony, what happened? And he said, Well, it just happened so quick.  
So I'm not near as smart as Coach Morrill, you can look at his record and look
at my record and understand that I pale in comparison to him. But Tony is one
of the most talented assistant coaches that I've been around and I think he'll
be a head coach sooner rather than later.  
  
Q. If you could just talk about the transformation of your team of getting
used to playing without Dominic.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, I think the best word in the question is
"transformation." I think it's been an ongoing process. Dominic got hurt in 10
days before the season was over and injury is a part of basketball and a part
of sport, but I think that any time in our particular situation he had started
127 games. And there were built-in decisions he gave us, that's not just on
offense, that's on defense.  
And so from the time that he's gotten hurt we have played six games, we have
only won one of those six and we have practiced 12 times. And I think that
every day has been critical for us in regards to the transformation. And I
think that in the six games that we played we haven't been beat from start to
finish. But there have been segments in those games where we haven't been near
as efficient as we have to be on both ends of the floor and you could possibly
justify that it was because of Dominic's absence, or you could say that
whether Dominic played or not we weren't assured of winning any of those
games.  
We miss him, but I think that with each passing day we have continued to get
better and learn to be more efficient within what we have to do on both ends
of the floor in order for us to have a chance for success.  
  
Q. Certainly you talk about defensive efficiency, and late in the regular
season, now obviously caliber of opponent went up as well, but their field
goal percentages were high, it went down in the Big East tournament. Do you
guys think you've turned the corner in terms of better on ball and off ball?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think it's a combination of what you said. I think it's
playing without Dominic, obviously with Dominic we scored many more points in
transition. When you score more points in transition that obviously aids in an
increased field goal percentage.  
It's partly who we played. It's partly where we played. I think initially
maybe the first two and a half games it was guys trying to do more than they
typically had to do to try to overcome the absence of Dominic.  
Which may at that time they may have thought that that was the best thing for
our team and then as time has transpired I think they have better understood
from watching tape from practice, from playing, I think it's a combination of
all of the things that you said.  
You're right, when Dominic got hurt we were third in the Big East and ninth in
the country in field goal percentage. We were shooting from the field about
what Utah State has shot from the field in their 34 games and then since that
time we haven't.  
We never want to say that it was all on us, we always want to say it was part
of what our opponent did to us. But I think that it's a combination of both,
yes.  
  
Q. Talk about Utah State and all the set plays that they run, if you have
seen anything close to that either in your league play or even non-conference
play throughout the season.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Completely unequivocally no, we haven't seen anything like it.
I think Utah State, one of the reasons why they're the fifth winningest
program since 2000 is because of their style of play. A lot of that has to do
with Coach Morrill's talent as a coach, but it also has to do with their
ability to recruit players that can fit completely into what they do. Because
he hasn't changed. I don't think that in the time that I've known Coach that's
changed in what he does.  
They're very efficient, obviously they have won 30 games, that's second in the
country, and they make 50 percent of their shots. So to an extent it's a
little bit of a math problem, in that the 86 games that Coach Morrill has lost
in the last ten years, 70 of those 86 games he hasn't scored 72 points. In the
games that he has scored 72 points or more, this year, they have won 30. In
the games that they haven't scored 72, they have lost four. And so from a
mathematical point of view, they want to be on offense two times per game
minute and if they can do that, they're going to win.  
Their set plays, I don't know that any team and I've watched every WAC
opponent that they have played, I don't know that any team can completely
absorb what they do and all of their sets. And because none of it, none of
their calls are verbal, they're all coming from either the placebo card or
either Tim's holding the real card or the placebo card, I think the only
person that knows which one is the real card is the players and the trainer
who is monitoring the efficiency of it. I haven't been able to figure that
out.  
But you can't worry about or try to absorb completely all of their sets,
particularly in a short preparation time, I think that the things that you
have to prepare for are their actions. Cross screen, down screen, back screen,
UCLA screen, things like that. Because those are core to what they do, no
matter what the set is. I think where they're really efficient is not only in
their sets, but the counters to those sets. They run one play that is a core
thing that they do and they have five counters to that one play. So as a
coach, do you call that one play or do you call that six plays? Because as a
player you call it six plays because it's six different things that you have
to remember.  
So we played 18 opponents, obviously in the Big East 15 of them were
different. So there were 15 scouts, none of those scouts are unique or
comparatively like Utah State. It's unlike any other scout and I think that
that's, when you're playing games two games a week in league play, that's
really, really hard to prepare your team for Utah State. And it's been
difficult to prepare our team for them. Our guys have done a great job of
absorbing it, but it's a unique scout for sure.  
  
Q. Since NCAA tournament crowds tend to pull for the underdog anyway, Logan
Utah is so close to Boise, are you anticipating a hostile treatment out there
tomorrow?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think everybody this time of the year is excited just
because it's March Madness. I think that it goes without saying that they have
played here, they have comfort level here, obviously it's a lot closer to
Logan, Utah than it is Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I think that they will have more
fans, even the nonpartisan fans that come here, I think that they will
probably be rooting for Utah State just because of the familiarity within this
region.  
With all of that having been said, they want to win and we want to win,
despite whoever the crowd's pulling for. And I don't mean that in a
condescending way. We're grateful to be here, we're hungry to be here, so
we'll compete and try to do our absolute best regardless of how many fans,
Aggie fans are here.  
  
Q. You did complete that comeback against Villanova, but you were down by
17, you took a lead with less than two minutes to go in the game. Even though
you weren't quite able to complete that, do you feel that you guys gained some
momentum heading into the tournament and if so how much?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think that the four halves that we played in New York, three
of those four halves were the best defensive halves that we have played
throughout the year. Distinctly the best that we had played without Dominic.
Obviously Dominic was a really good offender for us, not just because of his
athleticism, but more so because he was at the top of what we were doing, man
or zone.  
But I think that from our experience in New York I do think that we gained
confidence. The problem with the first half against Villanova, I think they're
one of the best teams in the country, only time will tell, over the next few
week if that statement is true. But you can't spot any team, Utah State,
California State Northridge, I think Memphis probably learned that today, you
can't spot any team 16 points and then think that you're going to have a
chance to win the game.  
We overcame a lot of different things in the second half to give ourselves a
chance to win. And probably in a lot of different respects should have won the
game. That was more my fault than it was our players' fault. But I think that,
I think the lessons that we learned in New York in addition to the momentum
that we gained defensively were both positives as it related to heading into
the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Would you discuss the importance of guard play, specifically point guard
play when it comes to playing ball in this tournament?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think that you would probably have to do a study for it to
be factual evidence, but if you were to look at all the best teams across the
country over the last ten years, very rarely do teams advance and have success
at an elite level in a tournament type situation unless they have a really,
really good point guard that can run things offensively, and also keep things
cohesive defensively whether they're in man or zone.  
So I think it's critical, I think when Illinois was really good, when they
went to so many Elite 8s and Final Fours, it was because they had three point
guards that started on the perimeter. Dee Brown, Deron Williams, Luther, all
three of those kids were point guards coming out of high school and they were
all recruited to Illinois, two in the same year and one in the next year. So I
think the way you win is with guards. You can definitely argue that. From a
statistical standpoint in tournament playing you win with guards for sure.  
  
Q. How important is conference affiliation this time of year? Are you
rooting for other Big East teams, hoping they get knocked out early?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I'm probably the worst coach in the country in the NCAA to ask
that question for. It's partly probably due to my shortsightedness. I'm really
just consumed with our team. And I hope that you're team gives our best effort
tomorrow. And I think that in practice today we gave our best effort. I will
say this, and I probably don't have built up enough equity, I haven't built up
enough for it to be believable, but I think that the Big East is the best
league in the country. But I don't like to get into a barbing situation with
other coaches in the league. Because they have all won more games than I have.  
So really what I try to do is just be consumed with Marquette and the players
that represent Marquette and do what we can on the court to help them get
better and add value to their life off the court. But for sure I root for Big
East teams because I think that success in the tournament, success from a
seeding standpoint, all of those things continue to add to the wherewithal of
the league and I think that as you're able to do that over a consistent period
of time that probably aids you in recruiting. And since at the end of the day
it's always about players, you want to sign the best players can you, so any
ammunition you can get is always beneficial.  
  
Q. Your players talked about this being a battle of two different styles.
Can you contrast the advantages and disadvantages your style has against what
they're going to present?  
COACH WILLIAMS: That's a really good question. I think it is two distinct
styles of play. I think that the reason that Utah State has had the success
that they have had over the last decade is every team to an extent is
diametrically oppose today what Utah State does. In the WAC, in the non-
conference, in the post season, because teams are so different.  
Obviously I think if the, if it's a high possession game you could argue that
that favors us. But if you look at it from a mathematical situation, I'm not
sure that it does favor us.  
If they're making one out of every two shots that they attempt they're
probably going to win. So the thing that we have to do more so than any other
thing is we have got to get consecutive stops defensively because if you try
to trade baskets with them, and 34 games into it they're shooting 50 percent,
you can't trade baskets, you got to be able to manufacture and get consecutive
stops and finish possessions with a defensive rebound. I think if we're able
to do that I think that that trends towards us being able to shoot the ball
from a higher percentage offensively. So I don't know that it's a matter of
wills and impose our will, I think that nothing against our guys, our guys are
a lot smarter than me in some ways, but I think a lot of that is just media
rhetoric.  
We're not going to try to impose our will. I don't know how that works. Really
what you need to do is compete every single possession as hard as you possible
can and be efficient in what you do and be intelligent in what you do to give
yourself a chance for success.  
  
Q. Dwight Burke compared Wilkinson to Luke Harangody, in terms of Quayle and
his ability to run that offense and run that team, is he more Scotty Reynolds,
more A.J. Price, more Jackson from Notre Dame, because you also talked
yesterday about his rebounding ability?  
COACH WILLIAMS: That's a good question. I do think that Gary Wilkinson, if he
was playing in the Big East, would have garnered much more attention than he
has up until this point. With then having said that they won the regular
season, they won the post season, he was named MVP of the Year in the regular
season and he was named MVP of the post season tournament. So from an
accolades standpoint he's gotten everything that he can possible get.  
Then having said that because of the exposure that our league gets in
comparison to their league I do think that he would have been compared to
Luke. I don't think he's quite as tall as Luke, but I don't know if it was a
sprint from baseline to baseline who would win. But from a skill set
perspective, they're for sure the same. And from their ability to score over
either shoulder from four feet to 15 feet out to three, I think they're very
similar.  
As it relates to Quayle, I think that he's probably similar to Tory Jackson,
because he can really run the team. And you're right, I think he's the only
point guard in the country that's second on their team in rebounding of the
east. He's averaging 5.8 rebounds a game. Two of those are offensive. For a
point guard to average two offensive rebounds is almost unheard of. Not just
this year, but any year. So I think he does a great job running their team and
he does do an unbelievable job of attacking the basket once the shot goes up.  
But he's more offensive minded, he's the second leading scorer and the second
leading rebounder. That's a unique combination when you run a set play every
possession from the point guard position. So I think he is in a lot of ways
the key to what they do.  
I think Gary Wilkinson gets a lot of credit for being the best player, but I
think Tai Wesley is the heart and soul of their team.  
  
Q. Utah State has noted that you are team has actually made more free throws
than your opponents have shot. How are you getting it done, how important is
that, and are you particularly friendly with referees?  
COACH WILLIAMS: No. I think it's probably similar to the question about how do
I root for our league. I don't know that I have built any equity, probably I'm
upside down in my loan with the officials. We have made more free throws than
our opponents have attempted. And that's a stat in a lot of different ways
that we pull from. We don't necessarily just monitor it, have we attempted
more, have we made more than our opponents have attempted.  
We want to make 23.4 free throws per game. We have been in the Top-5 in the
country through the first 30 games of the season. And I think that that's been
really important to us for a number of reasons. But the number one reason
being we have nobody in the post that can score. So we translate free throw
makes, no matter who makes them, into post scores.  
Because obviously for the most part in order to get fouled you got to attack
the paint. And we keep up with paint touches. And we want to have 38 paint
touches per game and we want to make 23.4 free throws per game. I'm not trying
to be silly with the .4. I understand that you can't do that, per game, but
from an average standpoint, and in order to get fouled you need to get paint
touches and because we don't have Gary Wilkinson on our team or Tai Wesley on
our team, that we can just throw the ball to, we have got to manufacture it
from 22 to 25 feet. And that's got to come off penetration and so to be honest
with you in a lot of respects that's one of the reasons that's given us a
chance to win some games because is because we have made more froze than our
opponents have attempted, but that's because we got to play downhill because
if we try to play east and west, we'll lose every game.  
  
Q. How did you settle on 23.4?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I would -- it would take longer than I'm prescribed to and I'm
really trying to with hold any analness or uniqueness to what I'm saying to
you, but it is 23.4 and if I would have been smarter I would have just said
23. I don't think you think I answered your question completely and I wasn't
trying to dodge it, um, I don't think you can impose your will. I think you
have to play the way you play every day to give yourself a chance for success.
And that's what we have got to do and that's what Utah State's going to do.
And you look at all of the teams that they have played in the WAC, every team
has played them zone, every team has played them an odd front zone, an even
front zone they have pressured them in the full court man, they have pressured
them in the full court in zone. They're not changing what they do. And just
because we're playing them we're not going to change what we do. And that's
not to be, that's not my ego speaking, that's just how I believe that you have
to play. I don't think that you can play 34 games and then get to this point
and go, hey, our opponent does this so we're going to change what we do and do
this. So maybe that will help you answer your question better.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you about Tai Wesley. And they often run their offense
as you said inside out and a lot of that goes through Tai and his passing
ability. Gary gets a lot of attention as well. But what does he, what have you
seen that he does for their team in getting the offense going?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think he's the heart and soul of their team as I said
earlier.  
They're averaging 72 points a game, 29 of it comes from the post. 29 points
per game come in the paint. Most of that either comes from Wesley or from
Wilkinson. Both of which are shooting 59 percent from the field. Which
definitely aids their team in shooting 50 percent overall.  
They're scoring 13 points a game off inside out. So the ball goes to Wesley,
the ball goes to Wilkinson, it's fanned out, and it's either, typically for
Utah State when the ball goes inside, and they fan it across the court, it's
as soon as that guard catches it, no matter who it is, it's one more pass to
the corner. They're scoring 13 points a game on that.  
So at that moment in time they're at 42 points. So they're getting 42 points
just from that. They're getting five points off offensive rebounds. They get
11 offensive rebounds a game. They get five off offensive rebounds. Typically
that comes from either Wilkinson, Wesley, or Quayle.  
So we're at 47 points, there's only what is that? How many points are left? 72
out of 47, whatever the difference in that is. But I think that Wesley like I
said, is the heart and soul, and I think so many times that teams, what they
do such a good job of is they're going to throw the ball inside and shall
knows that, but when the ball goes out side, where they're really good is they
throw it immediately right back inside. And I think Wesley does a great job of
I'm posting, I'm throwing it back out and as soon as I throw it back out as
the ball's in flight I'm going to get a deeper position and we're going to
throw it right back into him.  
He can turn over either shoulder, I think Gary Wilkinson's probably better
turning over his left shoulder, maybe even facing up, he's better than Wesley,
but Wesley is so hard to guard because he just has such great poise. I think
that probably comes from playing with his older brothers as he was growing up
because he's not scared of anything and I go I think that he gives them a
level of toughness that probably helps that team from a toughness perspective.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Thank you.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions now for the Portland State student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Now that you've had a chance to really look at Xavier, what are your
biggest concerns about them heading into tomorrow's game?  
JEREMIAH DOMINGUEZ: We watched film on them earlier. They're big. A lot of
their points come from rebounding the offensive glass, so we know we're
undersized and we're going to have to keep them off the glass, so that's big
concern for us.  
  
Q. For Dominic, Dominic, can you talk about what Jeremiah brings to the
table for your team?  
DOMINIC WATERS: He's our general out there. He controls the ball, controls the
tempo of the game. Distributes to everybody. He controls everybody's shots.
And pretty much the whole game.  
Really, he's the deciding factor usually whether we win or lose, whether or
not he's on and off or what he decides to do during the game. Really, he's our
leader, so we follow him. As he goes, we go.  
  
Q. Since you were here last year do you find that it's an advantage that you
come in and know what to expect this time around?  
ANDRE MURRAY: Yeah, especially us being here last year, at this time around
we'll be a little bit more motivated. Last year we were just happy with the 16
seed and for the school to get the 16 seed. But now we're coming here hungry.
We're looking to get a win, hopefully a win or two. So it's a big drive and I
feel like it's a better advantage for us knowing that we have been here
before.  
  
Q. Earlier the Xavier players were up here and they talked about how some of
the games they lost were against teams that play your style. What does that do
for your confidence entering tomorrow's game?  
JEREMIAH DOMINGUEZ: Our style is, we're up-and-down. And we get out and push
the ball. If we hit our threes then we're dangerous. They know that we're
dangerous if we come out, so it gives us a lot of confidence coming into the
game.  
  
Q. I haven't seen a team that's attempted or made as many 3-pointers as you
guys. Jeremiah, in your practices is that something you guys set aside time
for? How do you guys approach 3-point shooting as like a philosophy with your
team?  
JEREMIAH DOMINGUEZ: We play four guys on the court, one through four can shoot
on our team. So that's what our coach wants. We have a motion offense that
sets -- sets us up to have 3-point opportunities for the defense we're
playing.  
  
Q. Andre, how does your interior game respond when you guys stall on the
perimeter?  
ANDRE MURRAY: It responds pretty well as far as the interior as far as when
we're out there on the perimeter. We do stall a lot, but the interior brings
it whether or not we do good or not. So I think we should be all right in that
department.  
  
Q. You guys were pretty happy when you found out that you got a 13 seed and
you found out your draw. Do you still feel pretty confident about your
chances? Are you happy with the draw? How do you feel about it?  
DOMINIC WATERS: We're very excited about our opportunity to be here. Excited
about our seed. But we're just ready to go. We're ready to compete, we're
ready to play. Regardless of who we were going to play we were going to come
in here and prepare like any other game. Not put too much pressure on
ourselves, just come out and be ready to win. We're not backing down from
anyone.  
We're a competitive group. We got competitive coaches and obviously we're
going to be ready. We are here for a reason. We're not here just to be here,
we are here to compete to win. So we're excited.  
  
Q. You guys obviously beat Gonzaga earlier this year, they're a number four
seed. Does that give you guys confidence going against a team like Xavier? A
win over Gonzaga earlier this year.  
DOMINIC WATERS: It definitely gives us a boost. That win was huge for us.
That's probably the reason why we're a 13 seed is because of that win, going
into their house and beating them and now that we're on a neutral floor it
gives us a big boost.  
There's no home court advantage. We have more of a home court advantage than
they do being as we're just a state away from Portland, so we're excited about
this opportunity. It's just -- I'm happy to be here, after sitting out last
year and seeing them do this last year, I mean, we're ready to go. We're
excited.  
  
Q. For any of the guys, just talk about relishing the role of the underdog.
As a 13 seed you're not expected to win, is that something that you guys feed
on and try to work to your advantage?  
ANDRE MURRAY: Personally I like the underdog role. Sometimes you got to --
those are ones you should be most worried about and those are the ones that
are the most dangerous. For us not having any pressure on our back, that's a
pretty relieving thing. So I accept the role a hundred percent of being the
underdog.  
  
Q. Jeremiah, talk about the mood or morale of the team at this point before
a game versus last year. Is there more confidence this year heading into the
game or is there nerves still?  
JEREMIAH DOMINGUEZ: Our team's very confident right now. I know it's going to
take a lot, it's going to be a 40-minute game, a hard game, but we're
confident of what our matchup is with Xavier, I think if we stop a lot of --
stop them on the boards and get out and go, I think we have a good chance.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thanks guys. We'll take questions for Coach Bone.  
  
Q. If you could talk about Jeremiah, what getting him for Portland, that
whole process and when did you start recruiting him initially?  
COACH BONE: Never really recruited him. He was at University of Portland, five
miles away from our campus and things did not work out real well there for
him. So they came to a mutual agreement. He left Portland, called us up, asked
if he could meet with myself and my Associate Head Coach Tyler Geving. Sat
down, met, and he was enrolling a few days later.  
  
Q. Talked to you right after the tournament show. And you had only seen 20
minutes of Xavier at that point and you said that you thought that their
interior game was going to be a problem for you. Now that you've been able to
see them a little bit more, do you still have the same assessment?  
COACH BONE: My assessment now is their interior game and their exterior game
is going to be a problem, on both ends of the court. They're pretty darn good.
I'm really impressed with the way they play. They're a, to me, they're just a
really good solid basketball team. I don't see any All-Americans on their
team, but I see five or six extremely good basketball players. They're solid
defensively, they make it very difficult for you to get shots, and then when
you do get shots they do a great job of contesting shots. And then they finish
it with rebounds. They're one of the leading rebounding teams in the country,
and that has not been one of our strong suits this year. So I'm concerned with
being able to battle them on the glass.  
Then I think offensively, again, almost like defense, they're just solid. They
execute well, they share the ball, they come up with good shots, and then
unfortunately if they miss, they go get it and put it in. So we have our work
cut out for us. They're pretty good.  
  
Q. Coach, Xavier is obviously one of the bigger teams you've played all year
in size. How concerned are you between the size differential between your team
and theirs?  
COACH BONE: Well, we have had to deal with the size issue a few times as of
late, not the last game we played against Montana State, but prior to that
Idaho State in our conference, they're pretty big too. And they start similar,
as far as their height, they start similar size-wise as Xavier.  
So we have had a little bit of experience against teams like that. Compared to
Idaho State, they're a little quicker, and a little more athletic. But the
size, it can bother you if you're trying to get shots off. So we're going to
need to be able to execute some things offensively to make sure we get some
good shots, good looks at the basket.  
  
Q. Going back to Jeremiah, did you know what you were getting? A guy who was
going to be this successful and did his size at all make you worry?  
COACH BONE: Well, prior to coming to Portland State I was at University of
Washington for three years and had a chance to coach Nate Robinson. And Nate
was obviously a spectacular player, spectacular athlete. But he was about the
same height as Jeremiah Dominguez. Now the difference was like I've just
mentioned, physically Nate Robinson is just a specimen and kind of a freak
athlete. Jeremiah is not that.  
But Nate was also competing at the national level in the Pac-10, and
Jeremiah's spent most of his time in the Big Sky the last two years. So the
similarities are they're both small and they both have a huge heart and they
just bring it. Not every game -- not only every game, but it's like they're
always trying to prove themselves every possession. That's where Jeremiah is
really good and that's why I'm sitting here today is how he turned the
championship game at the Big Sky Conference tournament into a Jeremiah
Dominguez show for about 10 minutes, which made the difference in the game on
both ends of the court.  
  
Q. Can you talk about just the benefit of playing in Boise, the quick trip
over here and the morale of your team right now?  
COACH BONE: I haven't seen the team a whole lot because we have been so busy,
but I think the morale is good. I can't imagine it being anything different.
I'm sure they're excited because, for a Big Sky school, there's only one
that's coming to this tournament and they understand, I believe, that we are
that one team and we need to just cherish the moment and try to live it as
long as we can.  
It's nice to be here in Boise. We travel quite a bit within our conference and
we're in and out of airports a lot and we get out of the airport and we're
hopping on buses and going elsewhere. So it was nice to just have a one-hour
flight to Boise and we're hoping that a number of our fans and supporters can
show up, which I believe they will.  
  
Q. You mentioned last year that the team was pretty wide eyed and dazzled by
being in the tournament for the first time. Do you see anything different this
year in their approach as compared to last year?  
COACH BONE: I do think the last week our kids have handled the situation
better than last year. Last year just seemed like they were a little bit giddy
at times. This time around I think our guys have come to practice, worked
hard, and been about as focused as we have been all year. So that's exciting
to go me as a coach to know that I think this tournament has their attention
and they know what's ahead in that we're playing a very, very good team and
they need to be focused and locked in and ready to go.  
  
Q. Xavier has had some problems against teams that play your style,
spreading the floor, does that give you more confidence entering tomorrow's
game?  
COACH BONE: What else do they have problems with? Do you know? (Laughter.)  
Well, they're not perfect. There's been times they have been beat just like
the rest of us. So we watched enough video to recognize that there's a few
things that they do and they do them well, but we have got a decent team too
and we got a couple guys that can play and hopefully we can exploit those
weaknesses or at least weaknesses as far as it's all relative, weaknesses
compared to some other things that they do extremely well.  
  
Q. What kind of tempo would you like to see in tomorrow's game? Would you
like to see something more slowed down or up and down running?  
COACH BONE: To start the game out I would like to see us get up-and-down the
floor a little bit and try to push it. Because I think that if you have tried
to play that style for, and teach it since mid September, basically for six
months, you're sending a pretty strong message if you tell the guys, hey, we
got to slow this game down now because we're inferior to them.  
So I would like to us initiate the game, try to get out, try to push it, see
if we can't get a good look at the basket in transition, and then obviously
get back quick on defense and hold them down from being able to get the same
thing on their end.  
But as the game proceeds, I think that we need to try to control the tempo a
little bit, yet at the same time look for shots if we get them in transition.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started. We'll take questions for the
student-athletes of Xavier.  
  
Q. B.J., last time we talked to you you didn't know much about Portland
State. Can you talk about what you've learned about them since and what
concerns you most heading into tomorrow's game.  
B.J. RAYMOND: Well, they're a good team. We know that they were here last year
and they like to win the game by making a lot of 3s. And they're quick, and
they know how to play as a team. They won their tournament In four games, and
they are a really good team. They're not to be taken for granted.  
  
Q. You guys have played with Drew Lavander, so you understand that the size
doesn't always matter. Can you talk a little bit about five-foot-six Jeremiah
Dominguez and what he brings to the table for Portland State.  
B.J. RAYMOND: He's the engine to their team. He was the Player of the Year
last year in their conference. He made First Team this year and he makes their
team go. He's a great guard for them. He sets up other players, while also
getting himself off. And that's the same thing that Drew did for us last year
and he is a big part of the team and we need to make sure that we kind of
contain him a little bit if we want to be successful.  
  
Q. Derrick, it seems that an advantage you guys would have would be
rebounding. I think they're averaging plus 0.9, yours is 8.4. Talk about how
important rebounding is going to be in this game.  
DERRICK BROWN: Rebound is going to be very important. It's important actually
every game for us. It's one of the strengths of our team. We just want to do
good in that area, especially like offensive rebounds and things like that
because we are on paper bigger, taller team than them. But it's going to be an
interesting game and that's -- rebounding is a place that we have to do a
better job.  
  
Q. The two seniors, talk about how you're approaching this game as opposed
to the tournament last year knowing that the next game could be the last
game.  
C.J. ANDERSON: That's just basically how I'm taking it, that when you're in
the NCAA tournament as a senior, if you don't come to play or you're not
prepared, then your season and your career is over. So I'm just coming out
like it could be my last game, so I'm just looking forward to coming out and
giving as much effort as possible.  
B.J. RAYMOND: I learned a lesson when I was a kid that you never know when
you're going to be. So you always need to play your best at every point in
time. Last year we didn't know if we were coming back to the NCAA tournament
last year. We just hoped -- we are here this year, you know. So just like last
year, it doesn't matter how hard you played sometimes, it's just your
continuous effort no matter how strong you are or how tall you are, it's just
all about continuous effort. And just one thing that I'm going to bring to the
table to make sure that as a leader of my team to make sure that my effort is
always there.  
  
Q. Portland State's a team that spreads you out, all five guys can shoot the
3. Have you guys faced anyone who has played that same style and what do you
have to do differently than maybe against a traditional opponent?  
B.J. RAYMOND: Yes, we played against Butler, who we lost to and Duquesne who
we lost to. They did the same thing. They spread us out and we took kind of a
tongue lashing a little bit for both of those games. I feel that we have
learned from that. One thing that we learned is that we have to keep our
defense tight and make sure that we close out the shooters. And make sure that
we make the game hard. In both games both teams got out to a quick and early
start. We got hit in the mouth in both games. And we just want to make sure
that we're ready to play and not playing catchup for the rest of the -- for
the whole game.  
  
Q. In their nine losses I believe they missed 168 3-pointers, talk about how
important it is going to be to play perimeter defense on a team like this.  
B.J. RAYMOND: It's very important. Also it's very important to block out and
make sure that you don't collapse too much. Because they're a team that they
live and die by the 3. And they're a great 3-point shooting team, they shoot
it really well from four positions and their five man is usually a great
passer from inside the post. So it's a difficult game, but within ourselves we
have been down this road before and we have to try our best to contain and
stick to the game plan.  
  
Q. Talk about the depth on your team. You got nine guys playing 15 to 30
minutes and no one's really logging that many more. How much of an advantage
is that to each one of you guys individually?  
DERRICK BROWN: That's a big part of our success this year. Coach -- it's not
just sticking with five or six players, we're a very deep team. That's why I
feel like on any given night different players can step up. It's not always
one player averaging 25 points or anything like that because on this team, I
guess I said it best, it is a team. We got young players and different players
in different roles and I think that's why our program continues to be
successful because the experience that people get in all different situations.  
  
Q. How does the experience gained last year going to help you guys? You have
had a lot of nice runs in the tournament and how does the experience help you
and is there anything you guys want to do differently this year that you
thought you might do that would help you?  
DERRICK BROWN: Being here last year, it's not like a, for us, a couple players
on the team like me and B.J., it's not like we're looking around in amazement.
Maybe for the younger guys it's an experience that they haven't been there,
but I guess that's, it's more of just we know what to do, we know what to
expect, we know that we're expecting to advance. It's not like, Thank you, we
are here, and let's see what happens. It's like it's our job or our goal to
advance this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We'll dismiss the student-athletes and bring Coach Miller
up shortly. We'll take questions for Coach Miller now.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the depth on your team and how much a factor that is
for you guys?  
COACH MILLER: It's a big factor for us. We have played nine players
consistently really from Game 1 through game 32. To me that's how we do it. We
try to have different players able to step up on different nights and
hopefully the bench, the younger players in particular, can develop as the
season goes on, so that when and if we are here in this tournament that we're
not relying on a short bench or one or two players, but we really are a team
in every essence of the word and have a lot of different parts that can beat
you.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your interior game and how important that will be
against a team that isn't rebounding as much as you guys are?  
COACH MILLER: Our inside play is one of the keys to our success. When we have
had inside scoring, especially from our center position in Jason Love and Ken
Frease, when you look at when those two guys have scored well, and had good
games together, it makes us much more difficult to beat.  
Recently some of our tough losses and not playing as well as we did coming
into the tournament, it is a reflection of just the up and down, so to speak,
of our scoring inside. I'm really hopeful -- we have had a couple really good
days of practice. I think we talked a lot about establishing that, that those
two guys can really pick up where they left off a few weeks back and also be
complemented with our forwards rebounding the ball and scoring close to the
basket too. But we're a bigger stronger team than we are a quicker and skill
team and we have to be able to take advantage of that.  
  
Q. Your players came up here and they talked about some losses that you had
against teams with Portland State's style, being able to spread out the floor.
How do you correct those things in time for tomorrow's game?  
COACH MILLER: They weren't supposed to mention that. I'm going to have to talk
to them. (Laughter.)  
I think that more than anything Portland State is here for a reason. Any time
a team can be in last year's tournament and then come back to this year's
tournament and it says that they not only have a good team but they have an
excellent program that people in their program know how to win.  
I'm sure we have been in their seat before, you get to the tournament, when
you get back you want to stay in it longer. They're led by a terrific point
guard Jeremiah Dominguez and it doesn't just stop with him. They have several
players in double figures, great balance and then I think much has been said
for a good reason about their shooting. They're the most dangerous or one of
the most dangerous 3-point shooting teams in the tournament. And it's our size
and defense that's going to have to deal with that and make sure that, as best
we can, that we make sure that we're there.  
I think our players respect them a great deal. It's probably why they said
what they said about certain other teams beating us with that style.  
  
Q. Is it just their shooting that gives you guys cause for concern or is
there something else that stands out?  
COACH MILLER: No, they do a lot of things well. They're extremely well
coached. Very, very organized in their approach. A lot of their 3-point shots
stem from great pace and that they really get the ball up and down the court
and pass the ball extremely well, making the extra pass, sharing the ball,
playing together. And that's one of the reasons why they shoot such a good
percentage from the 3-point line in that they also take very good 3s.  
We played Missouri a long time ago and I think Missouri has that same
characteristic. They can share the ball and create high percentage shots in a
quick pace. They do that very, very well. You could tell that they're
organized on both ends of the court, and play to their strengths.  
  
Q. Talk about exactly what B.J. means to your program. What he brings to the
table.  
COACH MILLER: Yeah, that's a great topic for me to talk about. B.J. Raymond
came to Xavier, played about eight minutes a game as a freshman, played a
little more than that as a sophomore, about 11 or 12, but yet was a big part
of both teams in that he was that bench you talked about in years gone by. A
year ago he was our sixth man in last year's tournament. He made two or three
of the biggest shots that we have ever had in our program's history.  
This year in his senior year I expected him to be better because that's what
he did. But when you look at his statistics, the senior season that he's had
arguably is one of the best that we have had in recent times at Xavier. First
Team All Conference player, just has a knack for making big plays, is a much
better defender now than he ever was. When he was younger that aspect of
things prevented him from playing more and when you watch him as an
upperclassman it's arguably sometimes what he does the best. And just a real
credit for him. He's going to get his degree in May, he's from our state,
Toledo, Ohio and one of those great stories where he hung in there and at the
end got what he deserved.  
  
Q. It's been an up-and-down year for Terrell and Dante defensively. How much
on the spot are they going to be tomorrow when their defense is really going
to count?  
COACH MILLER: Our point guard position, we replaced Drew Lavender, who was our
version of Jeremiah Dominguez the last two years, and we knew going into this
year that replacing him with inexperience or a freshman was not going to allow
us to be the same team.  
The thing that I would say about both Dante and Terrell, they have been good
enough to win 25 games, they have been good enough for us to be a fourth seed,
play some excellent basketball, and they just have to be who they are. And
that is the steady force on offense, taking care of the ball, playing with
great energy, defending in tomorrow's game perhaps the most important player
on the other team and if they do that, they did their job. It's up to the
other players, C.J., Derrick and B.J., those three players are more important
scoring and doing some statistical things than we really count on from our
point guard position.  
But this is going to be great experience for them, there's no question about
it. Guard play in the NCAA tournament is crucial. Our guard play, those guys
don't have to score 20 points or get 10 assists, they just have to be as
steady as they can be.  
  
Q. A little bit off the subject, just talk about transfers in general.
Portland State's got five, you've had some over the years that have helped you
out. What is your thought on building a team around transfers?  
COACH MILLER: If that person really fits who we are at Xavier, off the court
as well as on, and to me is able to come to our program and be a real
difference maker, that's something that has set us apart over the last several
years. C.J. Anderson is a guy who transferred to us two years ago and he's
made an immense difference in what we do the last two seasons. He's got a
toughness about him. He's older. When he became ready, he wasn't a freshman
when he started to play. To compliment that person with guys like B.J. Raymond
and Derrick gives you great consistency in terms of, you lose older players,
and there are those that are ready to replace them.  
We have two players right now sitting out that when you watch us next year
you'll see right away that we have a guy ready and a couple guys ready. And we
like to kind of sprinkle that in.  
And you could tell that it's one thing Portland State has, they have players
that are a little bit older than maybe everyone else understands, having sat
out that year and combined their different experiences.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you, coach.  
COACH MILLER: Thank you.

_BOISE, IDAHO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with the Missouri student-
athletes. So let's open it up to questions.  
  
Q. J.T., can you just address your relationship with Zaire Taylor off the
court and how it's come together on the court to really form a guard tandem on
defense?  
J.T. TILLER: My relationship with him is we just are like the best of friends
off the court. Just like I have a relationship with everybody else on the
team. We just talk about what we're going to do on the court most of all.  
Some kind of joking manner, but you can tell it's in a serious manner also.
But what we have to do to get a win and help Leo and DeMarre and Matt and
everybody else on the court to make it easier for them also.  
  
Q. Going back to that. J.T., also the guys said at the tournament that two
minutes into his Missouri tryout basically Zaire was on his knees. At that
point did you think, Oh, yeah, this is a guy I want to go to war with, or was
he really that out of shape?  
J.T. TILLER: No, if anybody can understand his situation it's definitely me
because two minutes into the game I'm pretty much in the same position, bent
over on my knees, gasping for air. So that's definitely somebody I wanted to
go to war with.  
  
Q. Matt, you obviously grew up following Missouri pretty passionately. Can
you recall what you paid attention to when Missouri was here last time and
does that stick with you at all, the whole Tyus Edny stuff?  
MATT LAWRENCE: You see that kind of stuff on all the previews, a guy going
full court for that layup to knock Missouri out. So there's definitely a lot
of history with us coming back here and we're trying not to repeat that. We're
trying to go out and have some success here and just having an overall
successful year.  
Missouri with 28 wins this season is one away, I think, from its most ever in
its history. So it would be good to leave that kind of mark. I know for the
seniors especially to leave that kind of mark on Missouri.  
  
Q. Coming off the run you guys had down in Oklahoma City, what's this week
been like for you? After seeing your name pop up, knowing you are going to the
tournament and coming down here to Boise?  
DEMARRE CARROLL: It's been a relief because last year we wasn't in this
predicament, so to know we got an automatic bid in the tournament was really
an exciting thing. Hopefully we gained a lot of confidence from that
tournament and we can carry it on to the game tomorrow.  
  
Q. How much are the steals and the opportunity for steals that you guys get
predicated on the pressure that's going on out front?  
LEO LYONS: Our guards put a lot of pressure on the guards up top. And most of
the time when we press we're trying to put the ball into somebody's hands who
doesn't dribble that much. So that gives us an opportunity to play a lot of
passing lanes and play good on ball defense. And we get a lot of steals from
balls that aren't normally dribbling the ball.  
DEMARRE CARROLL: I got to give credit to our guards, because they really put a
lot of pressure and allow guys like myself, Leo and Justin and so on to play
the passing lane, because we're not your natural forwards, we just don't go
and post up or that. We can guard a guard, a forward, we can guard whoever is
on the court. So I think it's about putting pressure on the ball and reading
the passing lanes and having big guys who can move up and down the floor is
also a good key.  
  
Q. I wanted to follow-up on that game. You watched that game, I assume. Do
you recall what you did as that play happened and then after that? Could you
say whether, did Cornell recruit you or did you have any visit there?  
MATT LAWRENCE: Well, the day of the game it was awhile back. But I just
remember a lot of people back -- I'm from St. Louis. A lot of people back
there were really disappointed with it and it was kind of heartbreaking
definitely to lose in that kind of fashion, because they played very good
basketball game.  
With Cornell, I can't remember. I think maybe, I think a little bit. Yeah, a
lot of Ivy League, I was looking at some Ivy League actually and they're a
great basketball team and they're here for a reason and they put some good
teams non-conference as well. And any team that wins their league it has to be
a good basketball team.  
So credit to them for getting here.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the season that you've had and the First Team All
Big-12 and MVP of the tournament last week and just what that's done for
you.  
DEMARRE CARROLL: I think it's a great thing to have that kind of recognition,
but I wouldn't be in this predicament or this place without my teammates. They
really allowed me to be able to play basketball and be able to be a complete
basketball player. So my teammates, I got to give credit to them because they
really helped me get all those awards.  
So I think it's a great achievement, but I'm not going to stop right here,
hopefully we can take it on throughout this NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Certainly this is a family affair there at Missouri. Talk a little bit
about having family there during the highs and lows since you've been there.  
DEMARRE CARROLL: That's always great. It's a key to success too to have your
family there. So because when you're down, your family is there and when
you're up your family is there. So it's great to have family wherever you go.
Especially in Columbia and through my hard times and through the good times.
So I cherish that and hopefully my family can be there along through this
whole NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. To follow-up with the other players, is there a sense of family there
with Coach Anderson and everybody that's related to him?  
LEO LYONS: Yeah. We're together every single day. A lot of people don't think
about that. And we become family over time. Us four right here, we have been
here for awhile. We had a lot of downs, so that made us come closer together
to fight through those things. And now that we're having success, we always
stick together and depend on each other for advice and everything like that.
So the family environment here is very strong and I think that's why we're
doing so well.  
  
Q. Looking how things worked out here it looks like your coach is about
really the only person who has experience in the tourney, so what's he been
telling you guys to expect coming to the NCAA tournament?  
LEO LYONS: It hasn't been much he said, he showed us his ring. And that's the
ultimate goal. It's not too much to say. He's been there before, so we just
follow him and hopefully he can get us back there.  
  
Q. J.T. and Matt, and DeMarre, could you guys answer this: Just what do you
make of the idea that you're about to play in the tournament for the first
time as opposed to Cornell team that has a lot of guys who played? Obviously
you'll be pretty excited for the game, but do you have to think about reeling
that in? How are you feeling about that?  
J.T. TILLER: Just for our first time experience we're definitely going to have
some butterflies. Just because this is a place we haven't been before. We're
going to have that nervousness. That nervous energy. We're going to get rid of
that very quickly.  
Their experience is definitely going to lead them to do more things that a
mature team would do, but we just got to play our game and continue to do the
things that we do to get here, that we have done to get here.  
LEO LYONS: I don't too much worry about the opponent. I think if we do the
right things such as our defense, we're doing it the right way, we can compete
with anybody in the country.  
So this right here is just our first stepping stone in the tournament and just
by being here for the first time, I don't think it's going to be like such a
hard thing, because it's still basketball, it's another game that we have to
play.  
MATT LAWRENCE: I think Cornell definitely uses that experience to their
advantage. They're a very smart basketball team. Even though we may be the
higher seed, the seedings you definitely throw out the window once you get
here. And you've seen it in the past. Upsets happen all the time. And people
love to see them. So I'm sure Cornell will be ready and use their experience
to their advantage.  
DEMARRE CARROLL: The record is 0-0. They're 0-0 and we're 0-0. It's the first
clean slate. So I think all you got to do is throw the ball up and we're just
going to play basketball and they're going to play basketball. So I think
experience really doesn't matter, it's just a game of basketball. If you go
out there and play it the way that you're supposed to play, you'll be happy
with the end results.  
  
Q. What have you guys learned about Cornell over the last couple of days as
you studied them? And do you guys follow at all the Ivy League, do you guys
watch any of their games at all?  
DEMARRE CARROLL: Me personally, I really don't follow the Ivy League. But you
know we heard about Cornell and they're a pretty good basketball team and they
got a lot of experience, like he said before, but there's 64 teams in this
tournament, so obviously they're a good team. So you can't look past no team.
I think we're just going to come out like we did in the Big-12 tournament and
take it from the defensive standpoint.  
MATT LAWRENCE: From what I watched they seemed to know each other's game very
well, they work together, pass the ball, move the ball very well. Obviously
they shoot the ball. They have multiple guys who have hit a lot of threes this
year and they got a seven-footer in the middle who hustles very well and
rebounds. So they work well together and they seem like they have been playing
together for a long time.  
LEO LYONS: After watching them, I didn't know too much about them before, but
after watching them I think they're a great shooting team. It's a team that
you can't gamble on, it's a team that you can't leave open. So I think our
defense has to be at a hundred percent for to us win this game and to stop
them from shooting.  
J.T. TILLER: They're a very intelligent team. They're very great shooting
team. One through five they have great players. Just seeing by the games that
they have played outside of conference they can hang with the best teams in
the nation. So it should make out for a great game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what role kind of conference pride plays this time of
year and do you follow the other teams in your league and root for them, just
sort of make your league good this time of year?  
J.T. TILLER: Yeah, I think we do have some kind of sense of conference pride.
We were watching the Texas A&M game and we just want the Big-12 to go pretty
far. I guess it's kind of some kind of family pride. If you want to call it
that. Because we want them to go far because we want the other teams to see
what we had to go through in our conference play.  
MATT LAWRENCE: There's definitely a sense of conference pride. It's kind of
hard to watch last year, seeing our conference rival win it all, but it's good
to see the Big-12 doing so well and it shows how tough our league is and how
tough it was for to us get here.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thanks, guys, we'll have Coach Anderson here in just
a moment. We'll go ahead and take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. The first time these guys have played, but your first head coaching
experience, I think, in the tournament was the Sweet 16 run. Can you just
describe what it takes to get their mind right for this kind of situation when
they're playing for the first time?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think, first of all, we have approached this season one game
at a time. One day at a time. I think that's something that's worked for us.
And obviously when you get to tournament play, your conference tournament, you
want to use that experience as you come to NCAA tournaments.  
I think one, it's a one-game season. You survive and advance. That's the way I
describe it. So we try to just stay consistent with what we have been doing
all year long. I think that's been the biggest advantage for the team I had at
UAB and the teams at Arkansas, of course, and it's something we'll do here.
Just try to keep things as simple as possible.  
  
Q. Your team was picked to finish sixth or seven in the preseason poll for
your conference and I was told that you knew you had a special team at the
beginning of the season. You guys press hard and you have great defense. Can
you tell me a little bit about how you knew you had a good team coming in.  
COACH ANDERSON: I think it starts with our older guys: Leo Lyons, DeMarre
Carroll, Matt Lawrence, Mike Anderson, Jr., I think those guys coming back.
Last year I made a statement in terms of those guys going to be the core guys.
Tiller, and then, of course, Justin Safford and then we added a guy like Zaire
Taylor. So I think with those guys being the core and the new guys coming
onboard, they made the commitment during the summer months to come up. And
that formulated a bonding situation where these guys got to know one another.  
Then, of course, we had an opportunity to go to Canada on a foreign tour trip,
without doing a whole lot of practicing just to see the basketball IQ, see how
they came together. We averaged almost 130 points without me doing anything.
So I'm looking at myself and my coaching staff and I say, We got some more
options now. And so I think with that, in my mind, I thought that we had an
opportunity to be a pretty good basketball team if we continued with the same
attitude of working and bonding and pushing one another and look where we are
now.  
  
Q. The guys were saying that you showed them your ring this week. Can you
talk about that. Is that something you wear often or just break out to
motivate them once in a while or talk about sort of why you did it and the
reaction you got?  
COACH ANDERSON: I tell you what, it was something I thought about real hard
before I did it. I never ever showed those guys the ring. I think when I first
took the Missouri job I showed the guys that were here, you know, this is what
I'm all about. I'm used to winning, I like to win, I want to win a National
Championship.  
I always said in order to have something you got to be able to see it. So I
wanted them to physically see it. But that's the first time I pulled the ring
out. We were getting ready for the championship game of the conference
tournament. And obviously that puts you in position to have the automatic bid
to the NCAA tournament. But I wanted those guys to actually see it. I said all
season long, as the season progressed we're in the hunt for something, I don't
know what it is. Well, lo and behold, we won the conference championship and
that puts you in the NCAA. Now we're in the big dance and we want to dance. So
hopefully in order to have something, as I said, you got to be able to see it.  
  
Q. Speaking of seeing it, it's all Tiger nation could talk about Sunday
night was, We're disappointed we didn't get to go to Kansas City and we got to
go to the scene of the Tyus Edny crime. You've been here a long time, you have
been here a number of times in the NCAA tournament, but you know all about
that Tyus Edny play. Is there any, with the risk of sounding tongue in cheek,
is there any motivational ploy at all involved in that play that you can use
for these kids today now?  
COACH ANDERSON: No, that has nothing to do with this basketball team right
now. As a matter of fact, I'm thinking the committee probably, I've been here
like every four years, I came in '98 with Arkansas, I came in 2001 with
Arkansas, I came in 2005 as a head coach with UAB. And so I think the
committee looked at it and they basically said, It's time to send Mike
Anderson back home. So I'm back home boys, I want you all to know that.  
So I'm excited to be here. I think they do a great job with this tournament
and we're excited about being here and I think that we're looking forward to
playing. Again, that particular situation doesn't have no bearing on what's
taking place here.  
  
Q. Can you talk about DeMarre and the season he's had and what he's meant to
this team this year.  
COACH ANDERSON: I tell you what, DeMarre Carroll is like the heart and soul of
our basketball team at the forward position. I say the same thing about J.T. I
think he's the heart and soul of our basketball team at the guard position. I
think you put those two guys together, you got a pretty good combination.  
But DeMarre's a fifth-year senior and I think just to see the progression of
him as a basketball player, not only as basketball player but a leader on a
basketball team, I think that a lot of that credit goes to him. I think he's
worked extremely, extremely hard. And not only that, I think that because of
his work ethic, I think he's got the younger guys as well as the older guys,
they really look up to DeMarre Carroll, Leo Lyons, you name any guy on our
team, they really look up to DeMarre.  
But coming from Vanderbilt, he was pretty limited in the things that he did.
But I think that having an opportunity to play an up-tempo basketball, that
gave him an opportunity to really broaden his game. You can see now at times
he's like a point forward. But I always tell him, you know, as you continue to
improve and develop, don't forget who you are, what you are. And I keep saying
he's a junkyard dog and that's what he does. But he's important to our
basketball team.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Cornell and what you see with them when you look at
that team?  
COACH ANDERSON: I see a team that's a very dangerous team because any time
have you a team that can shoot the basketball with guys that Wittman, Louis
Dale, of course I'm very familiar with him from Birmingham.  
When you talk about that, Foote, I think he's a tremendous passing center,
handles the basketball. A good passing team, they average almost 15 assist as
game. And I think they're good at what they do. Then you put in some of the
role guys that are playing real well, but they shoot the ball extremely well
and they make good decisions. So it's a very dangerous team and they have won
quite a few games and they won the league two years in a row and they have
been to the NCAA tournament two years in a row. I think that gives them an
edge because they have been here.  
So I'm sure that coming in I think they're looking forward to the challenge of
playing our basketball team. We're going to have to play some pretty good
basketball in order to try to pull out that win.  
  
Q. Someone asked Cornell's coach why we don't see more 40 minutes of hell,
more of your pressure style of defense. And he said maybe it was a challenge
to recruit the type of players that would be willing to play only 24 minutes,
that some people might not see it a conducive system to making the jump to the
NBA. And I'm curious to get your thoughts on why we don't see more of it and
whether or not it really is a challenge to get those types of players and who
you look for?  
COACH ANDERSON: I tell you what, we're pretty fortunate at Arkansas we got
some guys to play it. I think it's just a process at Missouri. This is only my
third year. I think when you watch our basketball team play the guys get,
actually get a chance to really showcase their God-given abilities and I think
that it all comes back to winning. You want guys that want to win. I like
winners more than anything else.  
So Corliss Williams on our Arkansas National Championship team, as good as he
was, he probably averaged 28 to 29 minutes a game. Corliss averages 22 points
and probably 10 rebounds a game.  
So what I'm saying from that standpoint is, 28 minutes of the way we play, you
getting quality minutes, not just quantity minutes. It's the equivalent
probably of 38 minutes for somebody else.  
And I think when kids see that, then I think that it makes them think again.
But again, I think that you might be right from the standpoint of some kids
don't want to commit to that, because we -- one thing about it, we get after
it on the defensive side of the ball. But I think we did a great job at
Arkansas in attracting guys that fit what we're doing and we play all kind of
ways. We want to play up tempo basketball.  
  
Q. Do you look at the tournament when it comes out how many teams from each
conference got in and then do you think the Big-12 is represented enough and
do you root for those teams obviously when you're not playing them?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think we got six teams in this year. Obviously, I think that
the Big East with all their teams and the power conference they have they
probably got the most. As well as the ACC, I think.  
So, but I think it's the Big-12 is kind of underrated from the most part until
the tournament. Selection came then and you see six teams and possible could
have been a seventh team. But I think that you'll find out how well the
conference really was, I guess, when the tournament unfolds. But we do follow
each other.  
  
Q. What were some of the challenges you faced, some of the bigger challenges
you faced when you took this job; and then to follow-up, do you think this
trip to Boise shows that you've passed those challenges or those challenges
are behind you now?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think first coming in to the Missouri job it was obvious the
reason why the job was open, so coming in I knew I had my work cut out for me.
I had to go in and find out, number one, what we had there. In terms of
players and personnel the kind of kids they were. They had to find out a
little bit more about me.  
And as I got in there obviously we had to do a good job in terms of recruiting
and finding players. But I'm one of those guys that I don't worry about what I
don't have. I work with what I got. And there was a lot of guys that were
coming back and we tried to, our first year we won 18 games, and next year we
had a lot of off-court issues that took place, that probably kind of dampened
the season. And I thought that was a tournament team. Last year.  
Some unfortunate situations took place, but it also gave me an opportunity to
establish what type of program we're going to have. The brand. So I think
coming in changing the culture, and more importantly, I think, getting some
players.  
  
Q. You knew what you had coming in with Tiller, how important is it that
Taylor became the number two guy that gave you two kind of spear points out
front? Is that a key to your season?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think guard play is very, very important. And I think that
again as the trip went to Canada, you could see some things that Zaire brought
to the table. Sitting out the year, that's different than actually coming in
and playing. So but I saw a guy that could give us a lot of versatility, a big
guard that could rebound and have a good feel for the game. Just a matter of
how soon he picked things up.  
And I think actually J.T. probably helped him. And why I say that is because
of the competition day in and day out. And so I think that I got one of the
better guard tandems in the country, I really do. I think that they can have
an effect on the game without even scoring. And we have seen over the course
of a year that they can score and make big plays.  
So I think when you get guards like that I'm sure DeMarre and Leo and Matt,
those guys are happy to play with those guys. Why? They're so unselfish and
they take care of the ball and they leave to know the floor. So I think it was
important that you got a core of guards and I think we got some good young
guards that are coming in behind those guys.  
  
Q. Interested in your thoughts on Cornell's talent level and also what do
you make of Wittman and what type of player he is.  
COACH ANDERSON: I think Wittman's a dynamite player. Probably one of those
guys you're going to see play like his dad at the next level. He has unlimited
range and I think that he's added on some weight and you can see, Player of
the Year in the league. They have had back to back players of the year in that
league. The defensive player of the league in Foote. Louis Dale was the Player
of the Year last year. He came out hurt and of course, so they have got some
experienced guys.  
They returned a lot of people from last year. So I think their talent level is
a lot better than what people think. And that's why I say, the first game is
one of the toughest games. Why? The nerves are going and you got a lot of guys
never been here before, so it's going to be interesting. Not only that, their
team, they understand the game. And they can really shoot the basketball. And
they get the ball to the right people. So Steve Donahue's done a great job
with those guys.  
  
Q. It's a real family affair there at Missouri. Talk about -- or what has it
meant to you personally that you've had this success this year and a bunch of
your family has been able to be there with you.  
COACH ANDERSON: It's kind of like you have to go through some things, so you
have to go through the bad times or the storms that you go through, it makes
you appreciate the good times. As things are starting to happen. So as we come
through the storms it makes you appreciative of the good times. So in order to
have something you got to go through some things and I think one thing about
family they're going to stick with you no matter what.  
So to see the things taking place for DeMarre, Mike, and all of my players, my
team is my family. So I've had some guys that stuck through it. It could have
easily said hey, coach, I can't handle this, let me get out of here. But they
didn't. So it's kind of rewarding to see all the things that I talked about to
them that are starting to happen.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.  
COACH ANDERSON: All right. Thank you.
