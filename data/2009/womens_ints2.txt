_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Connecticut Â– 76  
Louisville - 54

  
AMY YAKOLA: Pleased to be joined up here at the podium by Louisville head
coach Jeff Walz, as well as student-athletes Angel McCoughtry, Deseree' Byrd
and Candyce Bingham.  
Coach, when you're ready, an opening statement, please.  
COACH WALZ: Yes, ma'am. First, I'd just like to congratulate Geno and his
staff and all of his kids for a game well played.  
You know, it's one of those when you sit there and you look at it as the game
was unfolding, we did a lot of good things. We had the tempo of the game going
the way we wanted it to go. Unfortunately, we just, you know, missed some
shots we normally make.  
And, you know, it's the big stage. It's our first time playing in a
championship game. And I felt really good going into the game. The first five
minutes, again, was the one I was most concerned about, and I thought we came
out and Angel hits the first 3, they come down and score, then we score again.  
I mean, we went back and forth and I felt really good about things. And then
we just started to rush some shots. Tina Charles did an outstanding job of
intimidating us. I thought she made us alter a lot of shots that we really
didn't need to alter.  
And, you know, we couldn't -- we had no answer for her. I mean, she's the one
I told you all two days ago that I was most concerned about. She's so active
in the post. We can defend post players that like to stay on the block and
just try and post up, because we've got some kids that will work and battle
and fight to do that.  
But what she does so well is she just moves from block to block so quick that
at her size we have a hard time trying to keep up with her. And then when you
can't throw a 6-4 body at her, it just makes it really difficult for us to
slow her down. And, I mean, the kid gets 25 and 19. I'm not sure you can do
much better than that.  
But with all that said, I am really proud of this group of kids. No one
expected us to be here. No one really gave us much of a chance in this game.
But I thought we fought. I thought we competed. And unfortunately it just did
not go our way. And those are the things you're going to have to deal with. So
that's it.  
AMY YAKOLA: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Des, I know it's a difficult moment, but when you look back on this whole
experience, what will you think about?  
DESEREE' BYRD: Me, I'm just blessed. I'm blessed to be here. Just coming from
where I'm from, I'm just blessed to be here, again, with these two girls on my
left and right. I mean, it's still an amazing feeling to be here, like you
said. Unfortunately, we came out with a loss, but I'm blessed. I'm truly
blessed.  
  
Q. Candyce, just talk about you guys, the shots, like Coach said some shots
you normally would hit just didn't fall for a good stretch of that first
half.  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: I mean, yeah, just shots that we normally would make or we
practice every day in practice, and we just didn't make them. I guess we just,
like Coach said, got a little intimidated, just didn't concentrate. She just
altered some shots. We usually make those and we didn't.  
  
Q. Angel, can you tell us what is it that -- the emotion you take away from
this? Is it pride? Is it disappointment after the way you guys played in this
game versus the game the last time you faced them in the Big East
championship?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: We have nothing to be disappointed about. We're going to
hold our heads up high, and we're grateful to be here. Unfortunately, we
couldn't come out and be national champions. But we have so much to be proud
of. And they're going to be a great squad next year. I'm excited to see them
next year. We're just going to hold our heads up high.  
  
Q. Angel, after your hot start, did they run a lot of different defensive
looks at you?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I mean, if they did it wasn't nothing I wasn't used to
already. I know they switched it up, went 3-1 a little bit, then they went
back to man. But it was nothing I wasn't used to.  
  
Q. Angel, I think you scored 10 of the first 15 points. Was it a mission of
yours to get the team going quickly and to come out that quickly?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I just wanted to help us keep up, because they can score so
fast. But the main thing is also get the teammates involved, and that's
another thing too, to get my teammates involved. So it's just a matter of we
just wanted to win.  
  
Q. Just for any or all of you, what has these few days been like with the
number of fans that you've had here and the number of people that you've
probably drawn to the program just through all of this?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: Words really can't describe. It's a really great feeling. I
mean, unbelievable feeling. I mean, I'm sure we probably had more than -- you
know, tonight than we did the other night. And just seeing all the fans at the
hotel just cheering us on, and I'm sure we'll still have more when we get back
there and others, but, I mean, it's just a really good feeling.  
  
Q. Angel, you talked about the TV thing a little bit and about not wanting
to be viewed as underdogs. Through the course of this tournament, particularly
making to it the championship game, do you feel now like you've shown why the
program deserves respect?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: Oh, yeah. I definitely believe we've shown why we need some
respect. And I know people are going to -- next year they're going to look at
the schedule and say, Look, we've got to play Louisville. It's going to make a
big difference next year as well.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Jeff, what does it say that a team can go through an entire season and no
one gets -- every win is by double figures?  
COACH WALZ: They're pretty good. I'm not sure what you want me to say. They're
a great basketball team. I said it the other day. I'll say it again today.
They've got three State Farm All-Americans on it. There's 10 of those players
selected each year. They have three of them. That's pretty darned good.  
And Geno does a great job with them. He gets them to play as hard as any team
we've played against. And it's just a tribute to him and what he gets his kids
to do.  
  
Q. Coach, you were called for a technical after Candyce Bingham scored a
basket. What was it that you were objecting to on that play?  
COACH WALZ: I was a little concerned with the amount of contact that happened
on the shot before that. I think Mo may have actually scored on that. I think
Candyce went up or went up for the first shot. And I just thought there was a
lot of body contact.  
And I just tried to voice my displeasure, and they obviously didn't like it,
which is okay.  
  
Q. Was it your strategy to try to ride Angel today?  
COACH WALZ: You know, no, not really. We came out and our first thought was
when they put Renee Montgomery on Des was to go flat for Des and let her back
her down.  
And Des got six great looks to start the game that she normally makes. She's
not your typical point guard, has some good size to her, can back you down,
and normally makes that little turnaround jump shot. Then she split it once
and had a layup, and unfortunately we couldn't get one of those to go.  
And then we came out and we ran some things for Angel, and she was patient and
stayed within the offense. And I thought she did a very good job.  
  
Q. Coach, it's pretty remarkable for you to have gotten as far as you have
after just a year or two at that school. Is there anything existing at
University of Connecticut that doesn't exist at Louisville to keep you from
doing exactly what Geno's done there at UConn, and is that sort of your goal
to have a consistent team that's going to be here every year?  
COACH WALZ: I think that's every coach's goal. That's why we do this. It all
comes down to players. I mean, you can be -- everybody wants to say you can X
and O and you can draw stuff up, but we drew the same stuff up tonight as we
did on Sunday night.  
Unfortunately, we just didn't make it. So, you know, we have to get out there
and continue to recruit. That's the biggest -- that's the most important
aspect of this game. If you don't get players, it doesn't matter what else you
do.  
So, you know, he continues. And Geno continues to get great players, and
that's why they're back here year after year. So our goal is go out there and
compete with them on the recruiting trail and hopefully get one or two away
from him and see if we can't continue to build this thing here. No problem.  
  
Q. Jeff, you had nine freshmen and sophomores play in this game. When you
look at the future, how valuable have these last three weeks been to that
group of players?  
COACH WALZ: It's been a great experience for all of them, to have the
opportunity to play in a national championship game, to make the run that we
did through the NCAA tournament as a freshman and a sophomore; should give us
a lot of confidence and a lot of excitement to carry over to next season.  
And, you know, that's one of the things that I challenged the returning
players with in the locker room after the game. We have to find out who our
leaders are going to be this spring and this summer to get in the gym when I
can't make them get in the gym.  
That's the difference between your great programs and your good programs,
because, I promise you, Maya Moore, Renee Montgomery weren't going to the
beach all summer. I mean, they spent hour after hour in the gym. You don't
become the players they are if you aren't a dedicated player.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you about the post game and what you said to the group
as a whole.  
COACH WALZ: I first just told our two seniors, Angel McCoughtry and Candyce
Bingham, I think both of them, to have the opportunity to have your first head
coaching job be with two players that are seniors like those two, they've made
my first two years very enjoyable. They've taken a lot of responsibility upon
themselves to be leaders. And that's what you need if you want to be a
successful program.  
Then, you know, I talked to our freshmen and sophomores, just talked to them
about the opportunity of getting back here. I told them the story: You know,
at Maryland we started two freshmen, two sophomores and one junior when we won
a national championship in 2006. And everybody thought this is easy. We'll get
back here every year. And, unfortunately, you know, those kids never made it
back to a Final Four.  
So you've got to get in the gym and you've got to be willing to work every
single day so you can get back to this. And I'm hoping our freshmen and
sophomores heard that, because it's tough.  
I mean, I got a really nice text from Marissa Coleman today wishing us luck.
And I know how bad that young lady hurt after our game in the Elite Eight. And
it's a feeling that I hope our kids don't have to experience. But it's one
that you can't take for granted the opportunity to get here and you can't take
for granted you'll ever get back here either.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been staying with them throughout the first ten minutes of
the first half, and there was a lot of motion and energy in your offense at
that point. From that point forward throughout the first half seemed like you
were settling more into half-court sets and sort of a lot of standing around.
Was that a fatigue factor setting in or was there something different they
were throwing at you?  
COACH WALZ: There wasn't a fatigue factor. They weren't throwing anything
different at us. When I look at the game and I watch the game, I actually
thought we got some really, really good shots and missed some 1- and
2-footers.  
Yeah, our goal was to try to run with the ball when we had numbers at our
advantage or if we got a steal off of our press. But if we didn't, our goal
was to run the shot clock down and try and cut the game down to possession by
possession.  
Like I said, we got really good looks. I was proud of our kids for the way we
executed. But, unfortunately, we just could not put the ball in the basket.  
  
Q. Coach, I just want to ask you about Deseree' Byrd. And we've seen all
week that this is a young lady with an awful lot of pride. Just lost what has
to be a very devastating game, and she shot 1-for-10. And instead of sitting
there with her shoulders slumped over and instead of making excuses she sat up
straight and looked us in the eye and said "I'm blessed" after shooting
1-for-10 and losing a game that must have been so difficult for her.   
COACH WALZ: That's just the way all our kids are, Des included. It's like I've
told you from day one, we're honest in our program. And, you know, it hurt
Des. There's no question. I know she wanted to play a lot better. But she
played hard.  
And I told her before the game started, if we can come in the locker room
after the game and look each other in the eye and say I gave it everything I
had, then that's all you can ask for. And I thought Des did. I thought all the
kids did.  
Unfortunately, the ball just did not go in the basket for us. You have those
games. And you just really don't want it to be your national championship
game, but it happens. For us to get a 68 field goals attempted, 10 more than
they attempted, and we get 19 offensive boards and only turn the ball over
nine times, I mean, you look at the stat line, and we played a pretty damn
good game. Unfortunately, we just didn't make them.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you, Coach.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Connecticut Â– 76  
Louisville - 54

  
AMY YAKOLA: Pleased to be joined up here on the podium by Connecticut head
coach Gene Auriemma as well as student-athletes Renee Montgomery, Tina Charles
and Maya Moore.  
Coach, when you're ready.  
COACH AURIEMMA: The worst part about doing something like this is you have to
be asked what it feels like. Now, I'm not saying it's because we don't want to
say what it feels like, it's just you can't put into words what it feels like.  
This is the first time since the brackets came out that I don't feel like I'm
going to get sick, physically sick, thinking about everything that was ahead
of us.  
And I told these guys in the locker room, ever since 1995 and the team went
35-0 at Connecticut, every team after that was compared to the 35-0 team and
they couldn't handle it. They didn't want to handle it.  
And after that 2002 team, every team was compared to that team. And now this
year, after these guys ran off a bunch of wins, they had to live with the
whole aura of going undefeated and winning a national championship at
Connecticut.  
And then the more we won by, the margin of victories kept getting bigger and
the more it was expected that, well, of course they're going to win. Of course
they're the best team ever. Of course, of course, of course.  
Well, there's nothing that I'm more proud of than the fact that especially
these three came in every day from September 1st until today and gave me
everything they had every single day. And, like I told them, I hope I gave
them as much back, and tonight we gave you the best of what we got.  
AMY YAKOLA: Questions for student-athletes.  
  
Q. Renee, just describe the feeling for you guys to put in all the work all
year and to come out like this tonight?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: It feels great. I mean, it's hard to believe just because
when preseason was going on -- preseason was so hard. And I'm like, oh, my
goodness, we haven't even played a game yet. And then you get to practice and
the practices before the game and that's even worse.  
And it's just, you think, okay, we need to win 39 games to get there. It seems
like forever away, and now I'm actually sitting here and we won 39 games. And,
I don't know, it's just really hard to explain because it's something you
wanted so bad and a lot of people I don't think get to feel the feeling when
you want something really bad and you work hard for it and then actually get
it.  
I think that's one of the best feelings, that it wasn't, you know -- the
scores might have showed that we won by a lot, but it wasn't easy. And just to
work hard at something and win with people I love is the best feeling -- I
don't know how to explain it.  
  
Q. Tina, Coach was saying the other day that he believes that somewhere
inside you lies potentially the best player in the country, it's just a matter
of convincing you of that. After tonight's game, are you closer to being
convinced?  
TINA CHARLES: I was always convinced ever since I went to Connecticut that I
do have the potential to become the best center in the country if I wanted to
be. I just needed the players around me to help me, which they always do every
time I was in practice, and just having Coach in my ear, just pushing me all
the time.  
One of my first -- when I came to campus and -- on my unofficial visit, the
one thing I keyed in on was just Coach saying the only way you're going to
play is if you work hard, and that was something that was a challenge and I
just accepted it and went with it.  
  
Q. Renee, could you just comment on Tina's game tonight?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: She was great. Before we went out there, Coach told us we
needed to establish the post game. And I think she took it personally. She
really came out there and she played aggressively on both ends of the floor.
And I think that might be the best game I've seen her play in a long time, not
only because of the stats, but because how she carried herself and how she
scored. Even though she was getting fouls, she made sure she made the basket
anyways. And on defense she was trying to block all kinds of shots.  
I don't know, just the way she carried herself during the game was
unbelievable.  
  
Q. Tina, just to follow up exactly on what Renee said. I was going to ask,
you seemed like you were smiling the whole game on the court. You had a
demeanor like you were having a totally great time. Can you talk about how you
were feeling as the game was unwinding?  
TINA CHARLES: I felt great. It was always fun to come out and just play with
this team, specifically. The past two years I had fun, too, but just with this
team and how hard we worked since September, like Renee said. And just the
fact that it hit me that this is going to be my last time, like, playing in a
Connecticut jersey with Renee. So I wanted to have as much fun as possible.  
  
Q. Tina, a lot of kids dream of this stage, national championship on the
line. Your team needing you to come up big. Can you just try and describe your
emotions that your team needed you, Coach needed you, and you were able to
deliver at the most important time of your career?  
TINA CHARLES: You know, like I said, it was just another challenge, and I just
wanted to show my teammates that they could depend on me, and that was just
basically it. I just wanted to show that I'm going to send off Renee just
feeling happy and everything. She's about to be drafted, God willing, and
everything is going to go great for her. But I just wanted her to have all
smiles in the next step of her career.  
  
Q. Renee, you talked about how the beginning of the season, all the
expectations on you guys and you going through training camp and it was so
hard. I'm curious about all three of you. Now that all those expectations are
over, is the predominant emotion happiness or relief?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I think a little bit of everything. I think we can actually
finally like breathe. I feel like every time we've won something this year --
I'll start back in preseason. Salt and pepper won the challenge, but
everything we won, the Cancun tournament, the regular season, Big East, we
always couldn't be too excited because we have another game to follow up. We
can't dwell on that win because we have another game that we have to win.  
So I think this is the first time we actually can just stop and really enjoy
the win for more than a couple days. And I think that's just the biggest thing
that we can actually -- because I think the mentality of our team is we're
happy with what we did but we're always looking to the future. And now I think
we have, you know, time to enjoy this win and all the other ones.  
  
Q. Maya, with the team this close, what does it mean for you guys to
accomplish the ultimate goal together?  
MAYA MOORE: Like Renee said, just to be able to achieve this goal with people
that you love. I mean, I just -- I couldn't stop crying at certain points
because I was so happy to have won with every single one of my teammates. I
just really feel like this year we really just sacrificed and put each other
first and genuinely cared about each other.  
And that's the best way to win it, because if we were on a team that we didn't
really get along or we just came, did our work and went our separate ways, it
would be nice but it wouldn't feel as good as it does right now to have your
family up there with you and win it.  
That's why I came here. And when I signed, that's what I was hoping to get.
I'm just glad I got one and I was able to do it with these wonderful girls.  
  
Q. Maya, when Becky Burke hit a 3, made it a four-point game, Coach ripped
into you guys a little bit. You went on a defensive run, they didn't make
another field goal pretty much the rest of the half. Just run me through that
stretch in the first half, beginning of the second half and what you were able
to do to turn the game around defensively.  
MAYA MOORE: Anytime somebody scores on us or they do hit a 3-pointer,
especially, we really try to defend the 3-point line very well. It just fires
us up. I mean, we know that when another team scores, we want to drive it
right back at them.  
And usually when that happens, you know, Renee will push it in transition and
the next thing find Tina and we will get one in and we'll just keep thriving
on that momentum.  
I think it's a maturity, sign of maturity for our people to be able to have a
team come close and be battling with us the whole half and just be able to get
on spurts and get on runs like we were able to do. And that run right there
and the way we started off the second half was key to the margin of victory
that we ended up having.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you. Congratulations.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Geno, you mentioned yesterday that you couldn't remember wanting anything
as badly as you wanted the title for Renee. Could you just speak on that now
that she has one?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. When you've been fortunate enough as we've been to win
multiple national championships and to have a couple of undefeated teams, you
know it was because somewhere along that line there was probably a great guard
that defined who we were, because that's just the way it is.  
It's like if you win a Super Bowl, you probably have a quarterback that
defines the team. And every one of those players that were All-Americans and
great players had the same characteristics as Renee.  
And she did everything they did. She handled herself exactly the way they did.
She worked as hard as they did. Led as well as they led.  
So for a lot of them, it happened before their senior year. You think back to
all the great ones that we had, Jennifer and Sue and Di and, you know, all of
them, Shea, Svet, all of them, it happened before their senior year. By the
time their senior year came around, it was like, okay, well, whatever, if it
doesn't happen at least it happened once.  
But to have Renee go through three years and do what she did, the thought of
it not happening for her was just, honest to God, I've been ill. Doc said, Is
there anything I can give you? Yeah, I said, Give me a sleeping pill so I can
wake up when the game ends.  
I've never felt like I felt. You would have thought -- if you followed me
around the last two days, you would have thought that my team had no chance to
win. That's how -- it was incredible. And now I'm so speechless. I'm so
overwhelmed by how I feel about the way that it ended, that I feel like -- you
know what, I kept telling myself all day long today, I said, you know, look, I
know God loves everybody, and I know he's a benevolent God, and if for some
reason I've done something to offend him and he doesn't like me, don't take it
out on me. These kids deserve it. She deserves it. Even if I don't. Which I
don't care if I don't or not.  
But all I kept thinking about was, man, I do not want to get up tomorrow
morning with that feeling. I don't. And now I don't have to.  
  
Q. You said about two weeks ago how legends are made by winning national
champions. Did Tina cement herself as a UConn legend by her performance
tonight and the rest of the tournament?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, she's kind of like a legendary make a blockbuster movie
and now we're going to wait to see how she follows that up next year. That
kind of legendary.  
She's not Meryl Streep yet, but she is getting closer to where Tina wants to
be. And that's what I'm happy about. Tina's always wanted to be what she did
today. It's just that when she looked out there and said, Ooh, I'm not sure
she believed that she could do it.  
And it had to happen for her so that now she knows she can do it. And one of
the things we talked about was: You can't be a great player unless you play
great in this game right here. If you ever want to be called a great player,
you've got to play great in this game.  
And she did. I said, Go out and get a triple-double. Score as many points as
you want. Block as many shots as you want, go ahead. Play like you're the best
center in the country. And maybe I should have said that before every game
instead of going in there, Tina Charles, blah, blah, blah. Maybe she was
waiting for me to say that. I wish she would have sent me an e-mail or
something. I would have said it earlier.  
  
Q. Geno, when Renee was talking about the mentality of the team, always
looking ahead to the next game, in past experience of five national titles,
how much have you allowed yourself to enjoy it before you started to look
ahead to the next challenge? And the second part of the question is based on
what you've seen of Maya, Tina, the freshmen, what you know is coming next
year, do you think this team, the core of this team is capable of pulling off
a Taurasi-like kind of run over the next couple of years?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, as far as the enjoyment part, there have been wins that
I've enjoyed over the course of the season that I thought were really, really
special and really cool. There have been moments in practice that I thought
were really neat and I've gotten enjoyment out of it.  
Honest to God, the longer I'm doing this, the more I'm in this situation, the
harder it is to enjoy it while it's happening. But the better it feels after
the fact. So as we were going along on this ride, I'm constantly looking
around the corner to see what's next, so I'm not appreciating the scenery
along the way. And it's not until afterwards you look back and you go: Wow,
that was really cool. I'm glad we did that.  
And, yeah, for me, you know, I have a tendency to put the season behind me
immediately. Like starting tomorrow, I'm not going to be thinking about this
past season. I'm not going to be thinking about next season either.  
So I've got a couple months where I can just clear my head and think about
nothing. Come the middle of August, I'll be trying to figure out how we can do
the same exact thing next year. And the minute we lose our first game, I'll
start screaming at these guys: You're nowhere near as good as last year's
team, they were unbelievable. Because, I don't know, I can't get past looking
to the next thing.  
But having said all that, I do not ever want to burden these guys with what
Diana did. That's just too much. That's just too much. I think they're capable
of doing anything next year. But to sit here and think, you know what? Yeah,
we've got what it takes to win three in a row. Man, come see me like middle of
November. And by the middle of November I'll have a pretty good idea.  
  
Q. Geno, you said yesterday you were interested in finding out how that --
or before that, in fact, how the men's game would turn out given some similar
situations. A, to what extent did that, you know, soothe any concerns that you
had? And, B, what did you draw from that that did make you feel like, hey, you
know, things have a way of turning out the way you want them to?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, when I saw last night's game I thought, man, you know,
Michigan State just ran into a whirlwind. Carolina was the best team in the
country all year, just people forgot about them, a couple of injuries, a
couple of losses, but all year long everybody said Carolina was the best team,
and they proved it last night.  
And I kept thinking, I wonder how many times the best team in the country wins
the NCAA championship. Sometimes it's just the best team for six games or the
best team for one night. I thought, well, that's what's going to happen with
us. We're the best team in the country, we're going to win it. Then five
minutes later I like, nah, just too much coincidence that it would happen two
nights in a row. So you start to have like these jitters.  
But in '91 I went down and I touched Stan Musial's statue in the front of the
old Busch Stadium and he was only good for a half (laughter). So this time I
got them all. I got the whole crew down there, went all the way back, all the
way back. And I figured, you know what? Now I'm a true St. Louis guy. I got to
touch all the statues, rubbed all their heads. This was great.  
  
Q. Geno, I think the Yankees might be the only other team besides yours
where people can say, You haven't won in five whole years, what's wrong?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I know. I know.  
  
Q. My question is, since you have not won, did you start to doubt how you
did things, the players you were getting, are we doing something wrong,
anything like that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Uh-huh. It is kind of the most insane thing when you think
about it, that who knows what could have happened. With a little bit of luck
we could have won five in a row. We could have -- we could have eight or nine
by now. I don't know anybody else that's had the injuries we've had to their
great players.  
So with any kind of luck, we could be sitting here with eight or nine and all
that. I could be second to John Wooden. That's the way some -- although,
actually, you don't ever want to compare yourself to the men's coaches because
that's a completely different ball game.  
There came a point during the last four years that it really was about you
haven't won five national championships. As a matter of fact, you haven't won
one since 2004. And some people, including me, I would just as soon walk away
from that, because that means, you know, that there's not an appreciation for
what we did. But, again, that's the world we live in. That's the world we
created.  
And there was that four-year period where I really, four years? Five maybe? I
started to question a lot of things. I started to question our recruiting. I
started to question whether or not we had slipped in the way we prepared, the
way we did things in our office, preseason conditioning, practice, the way
practices were structured. I started to question everything, post-season
workouts. Whether I had it anymore. Whether our coaching staff had been too
stagnant.  
And, yet, every one of those years we were winning 30 games. Like in every one
of those years we won 30 games except one, if I'm not mistaken. I think
Renee's freshman year maybe, maybe we won 30 games all four of Renee's years
there. I don't even know. I know we lost in the final eight. Final eight
overtime. Final Four.  
And you're thinking, you know what, maybe it's just time to hang it up, we're
not any good. That's sad, isn't it? That's like going to the World Series five
years in a row and now winning it. Well, then you, you know, I don't want to
be called the Atlanta Braves. You know, you win the most games and you don't
win titles. People go -- like you're not any good, my point is. Like you're
not any good, you know? Even though you're really good.  
But that's the world we live in now. Nobody remembers our string of
accomplishments. They just remember you haven't won a national championship in
four years.  
But I'm glad I stayed.  
  
Q. If you still do not want to declare which of your teams was the best
ever, could you at least compare and contrast your undefeated teams in
approach and how they handled the pressure of what they did?  
COACH AURIEMMA: The first one had no idea what they were doing. As a matter of
fact, I just had this discussion with Jamele and Rebecca recently.  
The first one had no idea what they were doing. We got to Minneapolis. We
stayed so far from the Final Four, they didn't know there was a Final Four
going; they thought we were on a road trip and they were just going to play
two games.  
Then we played Saturday-Sunday. It's like, What are we doing here? Then we win
and we go home and there's people lining the streets of I-91 and kids are
going, It's like the O.J. chase, cops everywhere. Helicopters. It was
unbelievable. And it dawned on them that they had done something that was just
incredible.  
Then the 2002 team, they were so pissed about what happened in St. Louis in
2000, they actually thought the first day of practice, if we lose a game, it's
a disgrace. They actually thought that anybody that walked on the court that
really believed they should be on the same court with them was out of their
mind.  
And they played like it. This team, this team is young, fun-loving, enjoy each
other's company. They're fun to be around. They get a kick out of spending
time together, going to practice. And as it's all unfolding in front of them,
they're kind of like, yeah, everybody thinks this is like something big. Like
Renee said, we've got another game Wednesday, yeah, who do we play Saturday.  
And it wasn't until late, late, late in the season that they really started
bearing down on it. And that's when I think I started to see a different side
to them.  
But all three teams in and of themselves are separate, but they all had that
one quality that they were really, really tight together, loved each other for
the most part. And they were easy to coach. Really, really easy to coach.  
  
Q. Coach, I went and looked and saw that your first team at Connecticut
actually lost more games than it won. This did not happen automatically. This
did not happen by magic. It took a while to build the program to where you are
right now. I see schools where the administration has a commitment to women's
athletics and for whatever reason they don't win. I see very few that win that
really establish a standard of excellence that don't have the real commitment
from their university for that. Tell me a little bit about how University of
Connecticut has played a role in setting the standard of excellence that
you've got with your basketball team.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I think if a school wanted to win a national
championship right now, it would be a lot easier than in 1985 when I got the
job at Connecticut. When I got the job at Connecticut, 1985, the goal at
Connecticut was don't finish eighth or ninth in the league. And try to get up
from eighth or ninth to fourth or fifth and live happily ever after and
everything is good.  
Why would the expectations be high when you don't have a locker room? You're
playing in a place where they roll up the bleachers, metal bleachers, and
you're treated like an intramural team. So the expectation level was just try
not to finish last, Coach, that would be a really big deal.  
Today, every BCS school that wants to win a national championship can do it.
Every one. Every BCS school in America, if they wanted to, could do it. At
Connecticut, they want to. Now if they didn't want to, in '85, in '86, '87,
'88, '89, I mean, there's a long time there where they didn't want to, because
they couldn't. They couldn't afford it.  
But that doesn't mean I didn't want to. I wanted to. But I think if every BCS
school, and others maybe -- see, in men's basketball anybody can win a
national championship. You don't have to be a BCS school. You can be any
Division I school and have a shot at it. Mid-major, high major, doesn't
matter.  
In women's basketball it's a little bit harder. But there's a lot of BCS
schools out there that have a tremendous amount of resources, great
facilities, tremendous tradition in their university and in their athletic
department, that if they wanted to, they could. Half of them just don't want
to.  
Now, more and more each year want to because they can see, you know, it's
pretty cool if you can do this. It means a lot to the university. It means a
lot to the community. It means a lot to a lot of people. It's something
significant now. But that hasn't been the case yet.  
And it's getting better and getting better, and five years from now I would
venture to say a lot more BCS schools are going to be trying to win a national
championship than there were five years ago. And that's kind of the
progression that we're making. There might have only been five in 1991 that
could win it. Maybe now there's 30, 35 that are committed to winning it.  
So maybe in five years it will be 70, 55, who knows. But I think we're doing
our part to kind of help that.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 6, 2009

  

### [Sue Donohoe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15066)

### [Jacki Silar](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18999)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  
AMY YAKOLA: Pleased to be joined up at the podium by the chair of the Division
I Women's Basketball Committee, Jacki Silar, as well as from the NCAA staff,
Sue Donohoe.  
Jacki, if you could, just give us a brief opening statement and then we'll
take questions.  
JACKI SILAR: Just want to say on behalf of the Division I Women's Basketball
Committee and the NCAA staff, we're excited to have our host of the city of
St. Louis and the Missouri Valley Conference take a part in this fabulous
tournament. They have done a great job over the last year to prepare for this,
and we're really excited to have UConn and Louisville participate in the
championship game tomorrow night, on Tuesday night.  
I think throughout the championship tournament we've seen some outstanding
games. We've had some upsets, which is exciting in the women's game. We've
taken our game to I think a new level with 16-sites format that has enabled
more of our fans to take part in cheering on their teams, as well as having a
better experience for our student-athletes.  
So we are continuing to look at different ways to grow our game and we always
need the help of our women's basketball coaches as well as our media folks to
help us propel this fabulous sport into everybody's homes, as well as getting
new people into our stands to enjoy this fabulous game.  
AMY YAKOLA: Questions for either Sue or Jacki.  
  
Q. This is a couple of attendance questions. The stands weren't full, and I
know that some groups had cancelled. What kind of groups had cancelled for
this?  
SUE DONOHOE: What we have, we have different groups that get allotments. We
have the local organizing committee that gets allotment. Then the Women's
Basketball Coaches Association and then the four participating teams, then the
NCAA.  
And so those are your primary allotments. And there's no doubt the local
organizing committee, they had some tickets out of their allocation. Our NCAA
allocation we had some tickets. WBCA. And the teams that traditionally have
needed 15-, 1600 tickets, they didn't need that many tickets.  
And so you did see some holes, particularly in the upper level last night. I
think it's a reflection of the difficult economic times right now. And I think
the local organizing committee and the Coaches Association did a great job in
trying to move their tickets as well as they could. But I think it just
reflects the economic challenges that we're in right now.  
  
Q. Do you think that not having a Tennessee or somebody like that there
could also hurt? Would that have helped to sell more tickets or not?  
SUE DONOHOE: I'm not sure. Because, I mean, traditionally when we've had a
program like a Connecticut or an Oklahoma in, they will simply tell us we'll
take everything that you've got. And I think that they were a little bit
surprised that the demands weren't as great as they probably anticipated.  
Having Louisville, which is four and a half hours from here, certainly you
would think that folks could hop in a car, come over, drive over, and I think
we can anticipate having a lot of that happen on Tuesday evening.  
So I don't even know that a traditional attendance driver like Tennessee, that
we would have seen anything any different. I do, I truly believe it's a little
bit of a reflection of folks have so many discretionary dollars right now and
didn't choose to use it on tickets.  
  
Q. You mentioned the first- and second-round games going to 16 sites. Do you
have figures on that? Did you get a boost from that versus the eight sites
over the last few years?  
JACKI SILAR: Again, a reflection of what has happened here at the Final Four.
Our numbers were slightly down. But we also out of our 16 sites we had six of
them that were totally neutral sites, which didn't have a home team playing.
Where, in '04, when our attendance was the highest ever, we only -- out of the
16 only two were neutral. So it's kind of a combination.  
SUE DONOHOE: And it's difficult, there's no doubt about it. You look at higher
seeds playing on lower seeds' floor. And I don't think any of us that walk in
the world of women's basketball want that, but where we are with the game
right now, that's the reality of it.  
And there are a lot of coaches that understand, you know what, if I'm a 2 seed
and I'm playing an 8 or a 9 on their floor, hopefully a 2 seed's going to be
the stronger team. Sometimes that's not always the case. But I think the
committee made the decision a few years ago to try eight sites with eight
teams. You know what, it was a risk. And after three or four years and
evaluating it, it didn't do what we needed it to do.  
So you've got to say, okay, that didn't work. The most successful format we've
been in, bar none, eight sites, eight teams, 16, top 16 seeds, the best format
from an attendance standpoint, a logistical and operational standpoint, is 16
predetermined.  
There's some folks that say, well, let's go back to the top 16 seeds and
announce that on Monday night. If we do that, ESPN's ability to be able to
televise and produce 63 games, we won't have those opportunities in first and
second rounds. So as difficult sometimes as it is, it's where we are right
now. Is that where we ultimately want to be? No, probably not.  
But you look at some of our sites this year that didn't have a team there, and
that's not the championship experience that you want. So it's something that
we've all got to keep working on together.  
  
Q. Is it never going to be considered that it's not worth the television
getting every single one of those games televised to avoid situations? I'm
just curious if that door's just shut, you're never going back there?  
SUE DONOHOE: I think that's a great question. And I think I'm not one that
will ever say never. So I always believe there's always a door open now. You
know, how far your foot is stuck in it, I don't know right now. I think there
are a lot of people that for years worked so hard to get the television
exposure that we now are lucky to have, and I think we all benefit from that.  
And they did a great job at the negotiation table. I think we would have to
really, really look at it. Certainly our contract with ESPN, we're entering
into a phase here over the next 18 months where we will start renegotiation.
And I think we've got to consider what's best for the overall good of the
game.  
It's interesting, if you talk to a coach that is from a high-profile program
that they are on television every week all regular season, they'd say, you
know, get rid of those early rounds on TV and let's get to a format that's
better for us.  
If you talk to some of those programs that the only time they're ever on
television is that first-round game or that second round game, that exposure
for them, there's not enough dollars in their marketing budget that buys them
that kind of exposure.  
So you've got to look at it, I think, what's good for the best, and what's
good for all. But to say will we ever consider that, certainly I think as we
move into this next negotiation of our contract, we'll have some good dialogue
and discussion about what's best for us.  
JACKI SILAR: What I would like to see is I would like to see the growth of the
game. I would like to have the fan that is just the fan of women's basketball,
not the fan of that particular university or institution, and that's where we
have to take our game. It's a fabulous game. It's a different game than the
men. It's played below the rim.  
And when a regional or first-round site is determined for the men, within a
year the tickets in that city are already sold, and they don't know what teams
are going to be there.  
But they sell those seats already, because those people are fans of the game
of men's basketball. And that's what we have to develop. You know, we're
young. We haven't been around that long, if you really think about it. We have
time to grow, and we have time to get there. And that's what we have to
develop. And we need everybody to help do that.  
  
Q. It's been more than two decades since two men were coaches in the
national championship game. What significance do you put on that, if any? And
it's okay if there is no significance to it.  
JACKI SILAR: I would have never known that. I put no significance on it
whatsoever.  
  
Q. To go back to what you were saying about growth of the game. I think
everyone wants that, but wanting it and actually seeing it happen are two
different things. When you have a crowd -- a fortunate crowd like you had out
in LA, and unfortunately Raleigh was not well attended, how do you look at
those things and try to avoid them, saying I understand you want growth of the
game, but there are places in this country that have consistently, for more
than a decade, produced crowds in the Midwest as opposed to some other
places?  
JACKI SILAR: Well, I think when we have to put forth our sites, our
predetermined sites for first and second rounds and regionals, I think the
committee has to really, really examine where you're going to put those sites.  
Now, TV does dictate that we have four in the Pacific and Mountain time zone
and four in the Central time zone and the other eight in the Eastern time zone
for the first and second rounds.  
But we as a committee, we've talked about that. And we have criteria. And in
the summer, when we meet, we examine those types of things. And I think that
will be one of our discussions about how can we help this, how can we ensure
that the institutions that do get the first- and second-round bid for their
institution, that they do have a marketing plan in place prior to submitting
that bid, that they really are committed, even if their team doesn't make it,
that they are committed to getting people, new people, new fans, as creative
as they can be.  
And the NCAA -- Myles Brand is an exceptional pioneer for women's basketball.
And he's put forth so much money towards marketing our sport. And I can't tell
you how much that means to this game. And it will benefit down the road.  
SUE DONOHOE: And I would add to that. Because from a staff standpoint we've
been working with these host sites now for 18 months, 24 months, and I feel
like we had really good host staffs this year. They worked hard at it.  
For instance, we did struggle out in LA. What we need is we need more, some
more sites in the Pacific time zone, the Mountain time zone, to be part of the
bid process.  
The other thing that I think that's really important is a host institution and
their staff will work really hard and put a lot of energy and effort into it,
and then when those teams are sent to that site, getting the fans to travel
with their teams.  
We require each of our teams to purchase a minimum of 100 tickets. 100
tickets. And we've got some institutions that don't purchase that full
allotment. And so you got a lot of host institutions that do a great job and
they may presell 2,500 or 3,000 tickets, and then you've got to partner that
with teams bringing people with them.  
We will go into another bid cycle late spring, mid-summer, and it's our hope
that we'll have a strong group of institutions submit bids so that we've got
some good choices to make for the future.  
  
Q. You see that staying at 16. Are you guys committed for the next -- can
you say how many years you feel like you're committed to 16 predetermined
years?  
JACKI SILAR: I think any time you make changes you need to stay with it. I
rotate off the committee, but I would hope that the committee will stay with
it for a four-year cycle. I think until you really figure out if it's going to
work, you can't make a switch after a year or two.  
  
Q. The other question is, does NCAA set ticket prices? Because ticket prices
in Raleigh are $50 and I think you unfortunately did get caught by a bad
economy. And you have tickets sold in advance so you can't like lower the
price. But how does that set up and how do you revisit to try to make those --
especially if the economy isn't improving, to make those more attainable?  
SUE DONOHOE: That's a great question. We've got minimum ticket prices for
first and second rounds and for regionals. So we tell them, okay, here's the
bottom of the range. And then we allow the host institutions to set what their
price is going to be as long as they meet the minimum, because they know their
marketplace better than we do. And so you might have a ticket priced at one
price point in the Raleigh regional and it might be different than the
Berkeley regional. And it's based on market.  
I think one thing that we've done over the last several years, and I would
venture to say more than ever this year, in light of the economic landscape,
we got as creative as we could.  
I mean, we worked with our hosts and we simply said: If you've got an idea
that you believe will help us with ticket sales, send it to us, shoot it to us
and let us review it and take a look at it. And we did things like special
baseline ticket sales. We did things like family four-packs. We did a lot of
group sales that typically we've never done in the past. And I felt really
good about the efforts and the collective efforts that the host and our staff
put into it.  
But, again, it's a difficult time. But I do think that we've looked at how we
can be more creative and be more effective in our marketing efforts to help
our sites.  
  
Q. This is a follow-up to the Final Four prices. The NCAA sets those. In
light of what's happened this year, this might have happened with the men,
too, if Michigan State hadn't ended up in the Final Four there, has there been
any consideration to maybe lower prices next year for the Final Four in light
of the economics this year?  
JACKI SILAR: I don't know. Sue, you do the prices.  
SUE DONOHOE: We have not. Because Final Four tickets for 2010 are already on
sale. They've been on sale now about a month and a half. But I will tell you,
we've got an opportunity next year with us being in the dome, and we're really
looking at some kind of neat things that we can do, because we can set the
seating capacity at, say, 25,000 or thereabouts.  
And that building gives us some flexibility. So if we want to offer like a
special student price so that teams can bring their students in, and we sit
them court-side or something like that, we've got some neat ideas and I think
you'll see some things put in place for next year's Final Four.  
Although the ticket prices are set, I think we'll see some structure. We'll
put a model in that kind of gives some folks an opportunity to experience it
in a different way. And we're excited about trying it.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you, both.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  
AMY YAKOLA: I'm joined by head coach Jeff Walz of Louisville as well as
student-athletes Deseree' Byrd, Becky Burke, Keshia Hines, Angel McCoughtry
and Candyce Bingham.  
Coach, an opening statement when you're ready.  
COACH WALZ: Yes, ma'am. Again, we'd just like to thank everyone involved with
the Final Four for just giving us such a great experience, everyone that's
worked with our student-athletes to make their experience here -- I'm sure
they'll agree -- it's been outstanding.  
And I'm proud of this team. I'm proud of everyone involved in our program,
from my assistant coaches to our managers, to our administration, everyone
that has given it all they have this entire season. And for us to be able to
sit here today and say we're going to practice the last possible day you can
practice is an awfully good feeling.  
We'll come out tomorrow night and throw a game plan out there and see what can
happen. So we're excited to be here and appreciate everything you all have
done.  
AMY YAKOLA: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Angel, last night there was a reference at least once during the
broadcast about the lesser team. Do you think by now this whole underdog thing
should go away? Are you surprised by that? Where do you stand on all this?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: No. We want them to keep saying the other team's going,
because that's how we win. So I hope they wish Connecticut wins tomorrow.
That's what we've been thriving off of, so we don't want that to change.  
  
Q. Are you surprised by all this? Frankly, even we were a little taken aback
by someone so polarized in the national semifinal, and then of course you come
back and win.  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: We just came out and believed. We weren't surprised at all
when we won the game. We knew we would win the game. We just want people to
keep doubting us.  
  
Q. Candyce, can you talk about the three of the last five games Becky's made
two 3s that came at the most opportune time, the biggest time in the game?
Talk about her development as you've seen it through this year.  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: I mean, she's come on at the right time. I know a couple of
us during the game just kept telling her to shoot. And at one point she said
she will, she will. So we kept looking for her, and she knocked down 3s at
crucial points in the game. And that's what we need.  
  
Q. Candyce, UConn was saying yesterday that they're convinced that you're a
different team than you were on March 10th when you played them in the Big
East final. How has Louisville changed in that month?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: I believe we are a different team. I think that our freshmen
are really starting to buy into things more and putting in the time. They
started putting in the time and knowing that they are a crucial part of our
program and being successful.  
I mean, Coach said when they don't play well, we don't play well. And I think
they finally realized that we don't play well when they play well. So they're
really starting to pick it up. And we are a different team than what we played
them the last time.  
  
Q. Angel, can you just talk about the Big East championship game and what it
was that either Connecticut did on you defensively or what you did. I mean,
was it just an off night for you?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: That was a time, you know, we don't want to use it as an
excuse, but we did play a double overtime game, then we went down to the wire
with Pittsburgh, then we played in front of all their fans at home. And then
they were just getting rebound after rebound after rebound.  
Now we have to take it upon ourselves to really box out and don't give them
one chance on the offensive end. And that's what I think the difference was.  
  
Q. Angel, have you given any thought as far as tomorrow being your final
game, and also can you just give us your thoughts on your career as a whole at
Louisville?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: Yeah, it's great to play the last game of the college
season. My career has been great. I'm blessed. And I have no complaints, win
or lose tomorrow. This is what everybody dreams of doing. And to be here is
just amazing. And then to play one of the great teams of America, it's great.
You wouldn't ask for anything else.  
  
Q. Becky, this is for you, how does the team start to believe that you can
beat Connecticut after what's happened? How do you get over the -- if there
even is an emotional hump to get over? And, secondly, what does that tattoo on
your back say?  
BECKY BURKE: This is a national championship game and it's for everything. So
I think we're not looking at what happened in the past two games. Obviously
we're pretty familiar with them because they're in our conference. But this is
a national championship, it's for everything. You're laying it all on the
line. So I think anything can happen.  
And my tattoo says "Be strong in the Lord and the victory is yours."  
  
Q. Geno said last night on the TV that he thought you were the biggest
difference or one of the biggest differences in the team in the last month.
Talk about how much you've improved in this round and what you've done
different in the NCAA tournament.  
DESEREE' BYRD: I just think I've been more relaxed. Like I've been saying, the
patience with the coaches and the patience with my teammates and the
confidence they have in me just being out there running the point guard for
this team has been lifting me up. I think that's what's been the difference
maker.  
  
Q. Deseree', do you see this as a David-Goliath thing like so many people
do, and, if you do, are there advantages in that?  
DESEREE' BYRD: We were just talking about that before we walked in here. But,
yeah, you can look at it like that. I know many people said Geno never lost a
national championship game. But neither has Coach Walz. (Laughter.) Thank you,
Ms. Kim.  
Like I said, we still want our doubters. They add fuel to our fire. I think,
like Becky said, this is the national championship. Anything can happen. And
we're going to leave it all out on the floor.  
  
Q. Could you just comment on Renee Montgomery and what she does and what a
tough matchup that is for anybody?  
DESEREE' BYRD: I mean, Renee Montgomery, UConn's point guard, she had a great
game yesterday, offensively and defensively, and I think it's one of the best
games I've seen her play, all-around game.  
She's a great point guard. I think a lot of people look up to her. I mean, we
come out defensively, play a perfect 40-minute half. This is anybody's game.  
  
Q. Angel, can you tell us how you ended up getting to Louisville after the
St. John's situation? Do you ever think about how your career may have been
different if it played out at St. John's instead of Louisville?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: After not being able to go to St. John's I had to take
another route. But I knew once I came to Louisville that this is the place I
needed to be.  
When I signed with Louisville, everybody was like why are you going there? Why
would you go to Louisville? Nobody ever heard of Louisville, and the women's
program wasn't the caliber that it is now. But for some reason I seen
something that a lot of people didn't see. And I think now they're saying --
now we see why you went to Louisville.  
  
Q. Deseree', you all have obviously built up a pretty hardcore fan base. I
wonder if you have any words for them before tomorrow night's game.  
DESEREE' BYRD: We just appreciate all the support from all our friends and
family. I mean, we're blessed. We're truly blessed to be in this position that
we are in. And, like I said, we really appreciate everything that everybody
has done for our program and all our fans who came out and support us.  
  
Q. Candyce, can you give us your thoughts what it's been like to play with
Angel and your thoughts on her as a player?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: It's been great coming back home. Again, I never thought we
would be in this position. But Angel is a phenomenal player. I love playing
with her. Some people might think it was -- I should be different as far as
she gets all the attention or whatever. But I love it.  
She just makes it so much easier for other people to play with her. And, I
mean, sometimes she has her moments. But other than that, she's a great
player. And she's going to be phenomenal at the next level, too. So I just
really enjoy playing with her.  
  
Q. Keshia, we see you all the time in the Big East obviously in Connecticut
and we're wondering how you guys think the program is going to carry on next
year when Angel and Candyce are gone and what the next step for Louisville
basketball is going to be. Just wondering what your point of view was on
that.  
KESHIA HINES: Well, we have some great freshmen coming in next year. Even
though we're going to miss Candyce and Angel, it's another year and it's part
of life. We gain some and we lose some. We're going to do the best we can.  
DESEREE' BYRD: Can't replace a Candyce Bingham and an Angel McCoughtry. But I
think we feel like we all feel the same way, and I think we want to have the
same feeling next year. Everybody is going to get in the gym and work on their
weaknesses and get better as individuals. Because as Coach Walz said, if we
get better as individuals we get better as a team. He's going to push us just
like he pushed us this year.  
With Angel and Candyce -- without Angel and Candyce he's still going to push
us to the fullest, to the best as we can be.  
  
Q. Candyce, I was wondering, could you talk about just like since the
beginning of the tournament, since Selection Monday, you guys got sent down to
Louisiana and just the ride that it's been, like just keeping winning and
winning to get here?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: I'm so glad we got a 3 seed. Because I think we had the most
promising route to get here. I mean, I don't know. You know, people are
doubting us, saying we couldn't do this, we couldn't do that, but we beat two
No. 1 seeds and a No. 2 seed. And we believed. We didn't let the 3 seed get
down. We didn't let having to play at LSU get us down because we all just
believed.  
We've played in front of crowds like that all season. So we just believed in
each other and believed in the coaching staff and now we're playing for the
national championship.  
  
Q. Candyce, how have you changed since you first got to the program? How are
you different now than maybe when you started? And I would even ask that about
the team. What have you seen in that time how the program and the people in it
have changed?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: I think for myself, leadership has been a big factor in me
changing, and then with the team, just believing in one another. And then when
we got a new coaching staff I know at first it was hard to buy into what they
were saying, but we knew that Coach Walz had won a national championship. He
knew what it took to get there.  
So I think it didn't happen overnight. But we knew that in the end him coming
here and bringing in that staff would get us to the point we are today. And it
worked.  
  
Q. Candyce, just following up on that. Maybe, Angel, you can chime in here
if you would like. But do you recall that first drill of the first day of
practice, and what was that? And when you were going through that, did you
ever, in your wildest dreams, think about that it would lead you here, that
doing something like that would lead you here? And how far away did that dream
seem then and now that you're on the threshold of it? How real does it seem?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: Yeah, we have this drill, what is it, 21 free throws. And you
have -- you and a partner. And you have to make basically a 1-and-1 free
throw, whatever, but we didn't make it. We just ran. This was last year. We
just ran for like an hour straight. And this year there were different drills.
We had one person pretty much give up on the drill and you were just looking
around and saying, wow, what are we getting ourselves into.  
But with six freshmen on the team that's what's going to happen. You're going
to have days where you're just kind of like, What is going on? What are we
getting ourselves into? But we had plenty of meetings and talked to them and
told them how things were going to be. And it finally ended up working.  
We didn't think it would at that time. But it finally came through and we're
in the national championship game.  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: Well, it's just been crazy. We had to run for hours. It
seemed like it was going to be a long year. But ever since the North Carolina
game last year, that's all I dreamed about was getting to St. Louis and
getting to this. I've actually had a dream about it, putting on the hat,
running up and down the court. So hopefully my dream can come true tomorrow.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Jeff, can you just talk about what -- you talked a little last night
about the development of everybody other than Candyce and Angel, especially in
the tournament and what Becky kind of has brought to this team.  
COACH WALZ: Yeah, it's been a year. It's been a two-year process for Keshia
and Des. And we had our freshmen, we had to put them on a fast track because
they didn't have the luxury of playing like a normal freshman. With Keshia and
Des, their first year we could throw them out there and if they had some
problems I could sub them back out.  
To just give them time to reflect on the bench and relax and put them back in.
But we've started two freshmen the entire year, just about. And it's been good
for them, but at the same time it's been tough on them. Because they've had to
learn as the game's going. There's no time for them to sit on the bench and
kind of reflect and try to take things in.  
We've had to have freshmen step up and play, and especially this past month in
the NCAA tournament, Becky Burke has stepped up big. Monique Reid last night
-- I watched the game film this morning, and Mo was as good as anyone on the
floor defensively for us. She just did an outstanding job.  
She took the ball hard to the hole in the last two minutes of the game. Just
did everything we asked her to do. And our kids are starting to play a year
ahead of what they really are. Des and Keshia are starting to play like some
juniors and our freshmen are starting to play like sophomores. And that's what
we have to have if we want to have a chance to compete tomorrow night.  
  
Q. How would you rate yourself as a motivator? And in your career where does
this game rank as a motivational challenge?  
COACH WALZ: You know, we keep it real. I mean, that's the one thing we do.
I've always been a believer in being honest with players. So when it comes to
motivating them, I just try and challenge them. I told Angel last night at
halftime, she was bad. It's the worst I'd seen her play, and it was.  
So I wasn't going to walk in there and tell her it's okay, because it wasn't.
And that's what we've done for the two years I've been there. And our players,
you know, at the moment they might not appreciate it, because every player,
when they leave a locker room after a game, they go back and see their parents
and the first thing they say is, Great job. You did a great job. It's a lie.
Just tell them the truth.  
So I've told our kids after our UConn game in the Big East finals, I told
them, When you walk out of here, if your parents tell you you did a good job,
they're lying to you. Just tell them you're awful. And that's what they
appreciate now because they at least know they're going to get the truth.  
When our kids play well, I tell them they play well. I'm the first one to
praise them and tell them they've done a great job. So we motivate by just
telling the truth to them.  
And our entire program is based on that and our players learn to respect that,
and that's all I really care about.  
I tell them, I'm not trying to find 15 new friends. I'm there to coach a
basketball team. But what I do care about is when the day's done and we walk
off the floor that they respect me and they know I'll take care of them. And
that's what it's all about. It's not just about winning basketball games.
We've done a great job of that this season, but I'm just as proud of what
they've done off the floor as I am what they've done on it.  
So motivation is not tough if you're just honest with players. And for myself,
it's going to be fun tomorrow night. We're going to have to come out and play
a great game. There's no question UConn is the best team in the country.
There's no doubt. But what we have to do is find a way to play better for 40
minutes. That's it. It doesn't have to be 42, 43. We've got to play a better
basketball game for 40 minutes.  
If we can find a way to do that, well, then we win tomorrow night. And that's
not going to say that we're a better basketball team if we can figure that way
out. It's going to be a challenge for us.  
  
Q. I know you've talked in the past, but can you revisit the tape that you
showed Angel to kind of open her eyes to how immature she was being and how
far she's come since then? And kind of as a follow-up, did that really present
itself at halftime in the national semifinals? I mean, in the past could her
maturity even allowed her to come out and play as well as she did to end that
game?  
COACH WALZ: All we did was -- Steph Norman, my assistant, we sat down and I
watched some game film and I'd ask her, Hey, let's clip out about four minutes
of Angel her freshman and sophomore year, just the way she reacted to the
officiating calls, to her teammates and just show her how she's handling
different situations.  
And it's not that she was immature, it's just the kid's a fierce competitor.
She wants to win, and that's what it all comes down to. And people, I think,
had talked to her in the past about, how, you've got to watch your behavior,
you've got to relax a little more. But no one had actually shown it to her.  
And my wife -- we've got a three-year-old that threw food on the floor once
and we laughed at it and we thought it was funny. The next day she starts
doing it again. So we realized we better not laugh at that anymore. So if you
show them stuff on film, especially, kids will change. It just takes some
time.  
And last night's game, Angel, there was no doubt in my mind she was going to
come out and play a much better second half. But she needed to know that the
way she played in the first half was not acceptable.  
And she took the challenge and came out and just played extremely well for us.  
  
Q. Jeff, you mentioned they're the best team in the country. Could you just
talk about what weaknesses you can see such as maybe depth and what do you do
to try to exploit those?  
COACH WALZ: I think I saw their manager drop a bottle of water. So that's a
weakness.  
You know, that's the scary thing about them. They've got three of the top 10
players or 12 players -- 10, right? State Farm team's 10. Yeah. Three of the
top 10 players in the country. Then you've got Tiffany Hayes, who is shooting
the ball extremely well.  
Kalana Greene, I mean, it's just a list of them. We're going to have to come
out and we're going to have to try to find a way to make them uncomfortable.
How we're going to do that, I haven't quite figured out yet. I've got until
7:30 tomorrow night to try and figure that out.  
But we're going to have to try to control the tempo of the game. We're going
to have to make some shots early. The difference is if we come out tomorrow
night the same first five minutes the way we played last night, instead of
being 11-0 it's 25-0. So I'm aware of that. Our kids know that.  
But at the same time, who expected us to be here? I'm not sure anyone did.
Well, actually I know no one did. So we've got nothing to lose and everything
to gain, and that's how we're going to approach this game. We're going to come
out and lay it on the line for 40 minutes. And we'll be proud of our effort,
there's no doubt about that. And hopefully we can play better basketball than
they do for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Two-part question. Following up on what I asked your players. When you
ran them for an hour in that first practice, you say you like to keep it real,
and they were asking themselves what have we got ourselves into. With as many
freshmen you had to integrate on this team, were you asking yourself the same
thing? As a coach, as you motivate your players, is it tough to kind of, I
guess, reconcile wanting them to keep focus but at the same time to have a
purpose for what they do in terms of playing for a national championship? Do
you dangle that as kind of a carrot out there in that first practice and say,
Look, if we do the little things, this is what can happen at the end of the
year?  
COACH WALZ: You know, our first practice, we go into it each year and I tell
them exactly what drill we're going to start off with. So I tell them that our
first individual workout. It's the same drill we do in individual workouts. So
they know what to expect.  
I told them this is our goal. And until we meet it we're going to run. So it
took us an hour. So our first day of practice was just up and down. But what
that did was that got a group of players to understand, hey, when Coach says
something, he means it.  
So it started -- I thought even though it was a bad first day, I thought it
sent a message to all of them. And I've said all year long that our margin for
error is very thin. We've got Angel McCoughtry and Candyce Bingham who are two
fantastic players, and we've got really good role players, and we've got some
that are starting to step up and get better.  
But it's the same thing. We can't afford a lot of mistakes if we're going to
win games. And we've done a really good job. If you go back and look at our
last five games, we've, I think, cut our turnovers down from averaging about
18 to averaging about 12 or 13. And those are things we're going to have to
continue to do if we're going to have a chance to win tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Jeff, you're a pretty animated guy on the sidelines. I was wondering how
you gauge how you approach the officials during the game and what you can get
away with and when you cross the line, or how do you feel them out and know
what kind of conduct or decorum to carry through on a game?  
COACH WALZ: I've watched film of Coach Auriemma, Geno, and I've learned from
him. He does an outstanding job with the officials.  
And we try to have conversation with them back and forth. You know, there are
things I question at times and I'm sure they question my coaching at times as
they're officiating a game.  
But I've got to try to protect my players as much as the next coach does. And,
you know, when they warn you, I say okay, and then you try to back off some.
But I just go as the game goes. Some games are better than others.  
  
Q. This was the year there was so much talk about the Big East men and the
possibility of three teams in the Final Four. As it turns out, there is no Big
East team playing for the title tonight but you have two Big East teams
playing for the title here. Could you speak first to the pride of the
conference, what you think it says about the conference? And also, from a
Louisville point of view, after the disappointment with the men's team,
whether this game alone is enough to bring the campus back up to a very
spirited level, or would it take you guys beating Connecticut to do that?  
COACH WALZ: You know, we had two bus loads of students that came up for the
game last night, bused back home after the game. And I think we've got three
or four bus loads of students that will come back up tomorrow night. So our
campus pride is great. Our men's team had a great year. They ran into a very,
very good Michigan State team that's playing for a championship tonight.  
So that's just one of those things where, you know, our men would have loved
to have been playing in the game tonight. And unfortunately they're not.
Speaking on behalf of the Big East now, I think you just go back and look at
what our conference has done. 13 of our 16 teams played in post-season play.
South Florida just won the NIT. And now you've got two teams playing in the
championship game.  
So I don't think there's a question of what league was the best. I know this
year we were being told we were the second or third best conference in the
country. But I think we showed everybody with the performance we've had here,
not only with the teams in the NCAA tournament, but the teams that played in
the NIT, who the best league was.  
  
Q. Jeff, just wondered if you as a sports fan have a favorite upset and
whether you -- I don't know, Villanova over Georgetown, U.S.A. Hockey over
Russia, and whether you might draw on that in talking to the team?  
COACH WALZ: We've talked about those things, and, no, I really don't have one
that I'm going to sit there and go on. I mean, we've kind of gone on the
philosophy the whole year that we're the Bad News Bears. So that's still going
to be our approach to things.  
It's like I said, no one -- even when I listened to the game of last night,
the commentators, Oklahoma is letting a lesser team come back. They should
have buried them in the first half. This team's not as good. But it just seems
that our kids find a way.  
And we might not have been the most talented team on the floor for the past
four games that we've played. But I think we've been the tougher team and the
team with more heart. And that goes a long way. And we've got a group of
players here that are buying into a system and buying into their role.  
We have kids that aren't shooters that aren't shooting, which is a good thing.
It's like I tell a few of our players when they come over to me and they say,
Hey, coach I'm open, I tell them, There's a reason you're open; they ain't
guarding you. Those kids aren't shooting anymore. Which is good. They're
passing and setting screens for our shooters.  
And I think when you get a group of players that buy into what their job is,
you've got a chance to be successful. Because our past three games we've tried
to make kids on other teams that normally don't score take shots. And we've
been successful with that.  
So hopefully we can continue to do that. Now, tomorrow night my problem is
they all make shots for UConn. So it's a matter of trying to figure out who
we're going to have to try to make more shots compared to what they normally
make.  
  
Q. How much did the way the Big East championship game play out help you
guys regroup for the NCAA tournament, make this run? I think I remember you
saying your team sort of quit towards the end and gave up in the last couple
of minutes. Did that get you refocused and help say, okay, we've got new life
here, new season, and play that way?  
COACH WALZ: You know what, we looked at the film for about one time through,
just real quick, and it was kind of like it was ugly. It was bad. And just
kind of explained to our kids that's not us, we can't let that happen again.  
And the nice thing about it was we had about a week and a half off to forget
about that game. And then a chance to start things over again. And they bought
into coming back and practicing hard and working on the small things. And now
we're playing here.  
  
Q. Coach, it's been more than two decades since two men have coached in the
national championship game. What significance, if any, do you find in that
fact and that time gap?  
COACH WALZ: None. Honestly, it's just one of those that -- our team has just
been playing well and I happen to be a man and he's a man and we're playing
tomorrow night.  
I don't think there's any significance in it at all. I think there's a bunch
of great coaches in our game, male and female. When we go to play somebody, I
don't look down the bench to see if it's a male coach or a female coach; I
just look at their coaching and what they've done.  
So to me there's really no significance in that at all. We're just thrilled to
be playing tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Can you sum up Angel's accomplishments in her career and also how fitting
is it for her to have the opportunity to play for a national championship
tomorrow night?  
COACH WALZ: What she's done for this program you really can't put into words.
I think the easiest way to sum everything up is her freshman year I think they
average about 1,400 fans a game. And by her senior year we were averaging
close to about 8,000.  
So that sums up her career in my mind, just the fact that she brought women's
basketball in our city to a brand-new stage.  
And I think it's going to continue to grow. We're opening up a brand-new arena
in two years, and our goal is to have 10,000 season ticket holders when that
opens. And I really think we have a great chance at that.  
  
Q. How fitting is it for her?  
COACH WALZ: It's wonderful. I mean, she's one of the few players that, you
know, you come out of high school and she was recruited by some good teams.
St. John's, Kim does a great job up there. And she saw in her before what
everybody else saw what she could be.  
And the amount of work Angel has put into her game to go from being ranked
about 80th or 90th out of high school to being a three-time All-American
doesn't happen very often in women's basketball.  
So for what she's done for her career and how fitting it is to play in this
championship game, I'm so excited for her and Candyce.  
We have two seniors that have been the heart and soul of this team the entire
season. And I'm happy for both of them. But I know they're not satisfied with
just playing in this game tomorrow night.  
  
Q. How much of the film from the previous two games do you show today and
tomorrow before the game, or do you use it as motivation?  
COACH WALZ: None. Not going to watch it. There's no need to.  
  
Q. This is a little off-the-beaten-path kind of question, but following up
the question about the male coaches thing. Geno talks once in a while about
how he aspires someday perhaps -- daydreams about coaching men. And I'm
wondering if you ever thought about that, and, more importantly, how you
thought an elite women's coach like you and Coach Auriemma would be accepted
by male players on the college level?  
COACH WALZ: I had the chance, my second year, at Western Kentucky, to possibly
switch over to the men's side and really had no interest in that. I enjoy
coaching the women's game. I enjoy the fact of recruiting, that when you
recruit players you've got the opportunity to see them grow and develop for
four years.  
On the men's side, I've got a lot of respect for what they do because you have
coaches that go out there and bust their tail recruiting to get the best
player and then they're there for one year. We can sit there and -- Geno, you
get a Maya Moore and you're going to get a chance to coach the kid for four
years, and that's a pretty darned good feeling.  
So I enjoy being in the women's game. I don't really have a desire to switch
to the men. But I don't think if he wanted to do it or if I decided to do it,
if the opportunity came about, I don't think it would be a problem about
coaching men. I don't think they'd have a problem respecting us. Basketball's
basketball. You still have to put the ball in the basket. You've got to be
able to draw up some plays.  
So Xs and Os are about the same. I think it's how you handle your players on
and off the court that are going to make a difference how you can adjust
coaching a female athlete and a male athlete.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the Bad News Bears analogy. I mean, you guys have
been a top 10 team all year. Do you just see things inside the program that
you are busting the kids about that they have to fix to get better?  
COACH WALZ: No, you know what, we've been a top 10 program all season long.
But I really believe that it's one of those, I think we're voted the top 10
because we just kept winning. It's like, golly, I really don't want to vote
them there, but they didn't lose; so we're stuck voting them there.  
I mean, our center is six-foot-two and about 145 pounds. When they announce
the starting lineups for last night's game, and again Gwen Rucker runs out to
half court and here comes Courtney Paris, were you not like, wow, that could
be a problem for them.  
Our point guard goes out to shake hands and, you know, Des has just done a
phenomenal job, but she's not your typical point guard. I've had everybody be
like Des will tell you she was a quarterback for a pee-wee league football
team. She played with the guys.  
And when I say that, that's what I talk about. We don't have your six-foot-
four post player. We don't have your five-foot-ten lightning-quick point
guard. We're just different. And I think it plays well into the way we play.  
But that's what I refer -- when I sit there and I say we're the Bad News
Bears, that's what I talk about.  
  
Q. I know you talked before about your relationship with Rick Pitino, could
you expand on that? Do you know if he's coming here tomorrow to watch you guys
play?  
COACH WALZ: I'm not sure if Coach is or not. Got a text from him last night
congratulating us on the win, and some of his staff are here and said that
he's going to try and come to the game tomorrow night. He's been outstanding
to us.  
He's given us the opportunity to come and watch practice, pick up some Xs and
Os from him. He'll sit down and talk basketball whenever he's got time and we
have time. It's a very good relationship, and I appreciate the time he's given
me and my staff.  
And, you know, it's one that hopefully it will continue to grow because it's
benefited me greatly.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you, Coach.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  
AMY YAKOLA: I'm pleased to be joined on the podium today by Connecticut head
coach Gene Auriemma, as well as student-athletes Maya Moore, Tiffany Hayes,
Tina Charles, Renee Montgomery, and Kalana Greene.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know, we're saying the same things every day seems
like. If I was you guys, I'd get tired of listening to it. We're tired of
saying it. But I know we have to say it because you have to write it.  
But nothing has changed in the three days that we've been here. Today we'll do
the same thing we did the day before yesterday. Tomorrow hopefully we'll
prepare the same way we did yesterday.  
We have a great opportunity here in front of us. We're playing a team that
obviously has an awful lot going for them right now. And we're playing a team
that, from what I heard, really wanted to play us, wants to play us, which I
admire their camaraderie that they want it to be an all Big East final. I'm
sure that's what they meant.  
So all I can say is we've done 38 times what I hope we can do one more time.  
AMY YAKOLA: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Renee, could you just talk about Angel McCoughtry not just as a player
but as a leader of the team and what you're most impressed about her?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I'm just impressed about how she really puts herself aside.
I think this last month a lot of the other players on her team have been
stepping up and she's allowed them to do it. I know a couple times in the game
she drove ball to the basket and dished it off to one of her teammates, and
just to have enough trust and faith in her teammates to make a big play, or
when it was going down the line, I think there was a few seconds on the shot
clock and she let one of her teammates shoot the ball.  
You can just see she trusts her teammates, and I think that's big when you
have a player that is always used to having the ball and always used to making
the big play to put herself aside and let her teammates make that play because
she trusts them enough.  
  
Q. Kalana and Maya, I'm sure if you were on Louisville you would be feeling
the same they are, the underdog, it's a great role, nothing to lose. And I'm
wondering where you think the fantasy ends and the reality begins.  
KALANA GREENE: I think when the ball's thrown up in the air, that's when it
begins and when the clock ends is when it ends. It's going to be a good game
for the fans. I don't think they're looking at it as they're any less than us.
At this point in the tournament everyone's 5-0. And they're looking to get a
win just like we are.  
MAYA MOORE: I agree, the game has to be played. And all talk stops. Like
Kalana said, when the ball is thrown up you have to go out and play, and at
the end of the game hopefully our reality will be where we want it to be.  
  
Q. Renee and Maya, have you guys played with a refuse-to-lose attitude all
year? And have you allowed yourselves to think about what's at stake tomorrow,
not only a national championship but an undefeated season?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I think we all played with that mentality, because every
year before this we've lost. And I think everyone came with the mindset that
it takes one game at a time, and we've made it really simple. And we haven't
really looked too far in the future. Each game we're just worried about the
next game, and not necessarily two games in that advance. So right now we're
worried about the national championship game and not really what it's going to
mean to be undefeated but just to get one more win and end our season the
right way.  
MAYA MOORE: Definitely, I think that's the key to our success all year, is
staying focused on what's ahead or the next game ahead and not getting too
wrapped up in being afraid of what if we lose or what if we do this, but just
getting excited and showing up and playing UConn basketball for 40 minutes.
And all the things, the records whatever comes with it, it's something we can
look at afterwards.  
But we're definitely not going to get caught up in the what-ifs; we're just
going to come in and get prepared for the game.  
  
Q. Maya and Renee, Coach was saying yesterday that he would rather play
anybody but Louisville tomorrow because of what happened in the other games.
Do you guys feel that way at all?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I do, just -- I think one of the better things about playing
in the NCAA tournament, you get to play teams you haven't played before that
you don't know anything about and it's kind of exciting to play someone that
you've never played before.  
But, I mean, we are playing them. And so we have to get excited for the game
and we know that in a sense they're not going to be the same team we played
before. So we can look at it that way and just be excited.  
MAYA MOORE: Yeah, I agree. It's fun to play different teams in the tournament.
It's kind of like a matchup of all the big games we've had so far this season
in the regular season championship. We were competing with Louisville and Big
East tournament and competing with Louisville. So this is the third time. So
it's not a different team, but it's still a big game for us. It's somewhere
that our team hasn't been before. So I don't think it will be hard to get
excited about it.  
  
Q. Last night your coach was talking about how you've prepared this season
in each and every drill as though the national championship was at stake. Was
that something that you brought with you this year to the court after you
walked off the court at St. Pete Times Forum, and did that drive you? And how
did you maintain that intensity day in, day out without allowing it to become
drudgery?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I think it's easy when you have things motivating you. For
instance, losing three years in a row. I think you don't get complacent or you
don't lose your hunger because you've never won before. And any time you get
tired you just think of things to motivate yourself with, and losing is the
best motivator for me as well as my teammates.  
And then when we have teammates that are going just as hard as I am and
pushing themselves and everyone has a lot of energy, it makes it fun. So it's
not drudgery because it's fun. Every drill we make it fun. There's a
competition. We turn everything into a competition that we do. And I just
think practice has been fun all year, and we've had a lot of fun in all the
games. So I think it's easy to stay focused when we have the chemistry that we
do on this team.  
  
Q. Renee, I was wondering, with the two Big East teams in the final, and
then the other day with the four All-Americans from the Big East, what does it
say about your conference to have this kind of representation? And also what
kind of camaraderie do you have like maybe with Angel? I know you guys have
been going back and forth a little bit.  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: It says a lot. I think we've been saying all year that the
Big East is a really tough conference to play in. And every game, you know,
the score might not show it, but it was hard games to play in, and we'd wake
up the next morning sore and tired because we got beat up and it was a
physical game and it was hard.  
And I don't know if the score necessarily reflected it so people didn't really
take it to heart, but now that you see it, another Big East team is in the
championship game, and that we had four players from the Big East on the All-
American team, it just shows that it's a tough conference to play in.  
And I definitely think from battling with Louisville over the years that me
and Angel have developed a friendship, and I'm sure we'll be friends once we
leave college. Just not right now (smiling).  
  
Q. Tiffany and Tina, what did you notice, what did Louisville try to do
differently in the Big East championship game that maybe they didn't try in
January and what do you think they might try to do tomorrow night that's
different?  
TINA CHARLES: I think just, you know, it's March, and I think every team is
going to come out and play different. I think even our team has been playing
different in this tournament and the Big East tournament.  
Coach set out a couple of goals for people on the team and individually
everyone had to go out and perform. I'm sure they're thinking the same thing
that they have to perform to the best ability that they can. So I think that's
what they're going to do different.  
TIFFANY HAYES: I just think that it's hard beating a team three times in a
year. They're going to come out hard. Like you said, it's a national
championship game, so they're definitely going to come with something
different than what they've been coming with the last couple of games. And we
just gotta go out and play UConn basketball.  
  
Q. Renee and Maya, if you could both, I asked Angel what she admired most
about the UConn program; she said because UConn players are all business. I
wonder if you could talk about is that something you feel like your coach is
recruiting when he picks you out, but also is it something that develops once
you get on campus?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I think it's a little bit of both. I think they recruit a
certain type of player that they can see potential in being able to play in
this program. And to be able to play in this program you have to be about
business. It's not that we can't have fun, but we just know when it's time to
play and when it's time to have fun.  
And I think that's just something we've done really well this year, and in all
the situations we've been in, for instance, Cancun, we could have easily went
out there and just pretty much had a party for a week and lost the games. But
we had fun when it was time to have fun and we played hard when it was time to
play. And I think that's what makes -- that's what makes us have so much fun
this year.  
MAYA MOORE: I think that when you come to Connecticut you have to have a
certain competitive mindset. And that's not something you can really teach to
a certain point. So the players that Coach recruits, he tries to get tough,
competitive people who always want to come to play. When they're in the game
or when they're on the bench, whatever it is, they're going to bring
everything they can.  
And there's a time and a place for everything, like Renee said, and I think
our team is a pretty mature group to know when it's time to go to practice or
when it's time to go to shoot-around or play the game we have to be extremely
focused, and until the buzzer goes off.  
We've experienced games, except for Tiffany as a freshman, where if you're not
focused you're going to lose. So we know what can happen. And that's why I
really think this year we've come more than ever so focused in knowing when
we're on the court it is about business and it's about winning.  
  
Q. Renee, probably a week from today your life is going to be so different.
You're going to be drafted by somebody. You're going to probably be in a new
city, meeting new teammates, coaching staff, everything. Rebecca Lobo said
yesterday she thought you would be the first player taken in the draft. And
I'm just wondering how you feel about that possibility and do you ever
daydream about what's next in your life?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I know people probably don't believe me when I say I don't
think about it much. It comes to mind sometimes, when people ask me questions
about it. And I'm excited for the future. But it's just -- what's on my mind
the most right now is just winning the national championship. And my life is
definitely going to change. That's one of the reasons why I'm trying to enjoy
these moments I have here right now, because I know the teammates I meet in
the future are not going to be like the ones I have now.  
And everything is going to be different and I'm excited for the future. And
I'm just -- I try to live in the present. But I am definitely excited and
wherever I am chosen to go I'm going to be happy.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Geno, could you tell the story of recruiting Renee? Essentially you went
to see Alexis Hornbuckle and discovered Renee, could you talk about that a
little bit?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, it wasn't necessarily a discovery of her. Obviously we
had had a chance to see Renee play quite often. She played on one of those
high-powered AAU teams with four or five Division I players. And it was easy
to overlook Renee. And you look at her now and to me she's still one of the
little guys out there on the floor.  
Now, imagine her even 20 pounds lighter than she is right now and playing,
again, with all these great players. But when I went to her state tournament
game and I actually saw her play with her high school team, that's when I
really got a sense for her leadership skills and who she is and what she's
able to accomplish.  
And I remember coming back and I remember Chris Dailey asking me how was the
game. I said it was a great game. She said, What do you think? I said, I think
Alexis Hornbuckle is going to Tennessee. She said, Her father told me that
it's down to three schools. I said, I don't care what her father told you. I
said, I'm telling you she's going to Tennessee.  
She said, How do you know? I said, 'Cause I can tell, I know. I've been
watching games long enough. But don't worry about it; we're going to get the
right one. And we did. And what else can I say?  
  
Q. Can you just address how Louisville-UConn rivalry has matured in the last
two years, two Big East finals now and a national championship? And maybe also
how after this game how maybe you guys will take this rivalry to even a higher
level now that you're playing in a national final?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, it's always interesting for us in the last 10 years or
so, however long, it was going to be Connecticut and Notre Dame for the rest
of the Big East history. And then it was Connecticut and Rutgers for the rest
of the Big East history.  
Now it's Connecticut/Louisville. It just seems to me that if you consider
yourself the best team or the best, more importantly, the best basketball
program in a conference, then it's just natural that as other programs get
better you're going to have to deal with that.  
And in this case, again, because of Angel McCoughtry and Candyce Bingham,
specifically, and generally the way they recruited and the way they've built
their program, who knows what's going to happen in the future. Who knows where
they'll be next year. I just hope we're still around to still talk about who
our big rivals are.  
But if you look at our league, there's no shortage of teams that can be your
rivals. And Louisville is just the latest one to step up.  
  
Q. It strikes me, you're not much different than you were when we were
having these press conferences in 1995. You're very much the same. But
everybody talks about evolving in their profession, no matter what their
profession is. Can you maybe give us some insight in how you think you might
have changed in that time period?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I believe I'm a little more cautious, a little more
apprehensive about a lot of things. I'm not as free-spirited as I think I was
back then. I think a lot of things that have happened in the last 14, 15 years
have obviously had an effect on how I view myself and my profession and what I
have to do to be successful in it.  
I can't just go about doing what I want to do when I want to do it, how I want
to do it and have fun. I gotta be somewhat miserable like the rest of the
world. Because you always gotta worry about what you say, how you say it and
how it's going to be interpreted, what you do, how you do it, who's watching.  
So in that respect I probably don't enjoy doing what I do as much as I did
back then. But at the same time I probably appreciate it even more because I
know how hard it is now. Back then I thought, come on, how hard is this? You
go to the Final Four, you win a national championship. And the more times
we've been here, the more times I've been able to experience it, the more
times we've lost at this level, the more I appreciate how difficult it is and
what goes into it.  
So I am a better coach in some ways. But anybody who gets the best players
every year like I do is always a good coach. So if this was 1995 I'd tell you
how I really feel (laughter).  
  
Q. Why has this team been able to maintain its focus throughout the season?
And is this one of the more driven teams that you've had?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, yeah. I mean, it's awfully difficult to answer a lot of
these questions, and I know they're obviously significant or you wouldn't ask
them. But it's difficult to answer a lot of these questions, because how do I
say that this team is driven more than the '95 team or more than the 2000 team
that won in Philadelphia or the 2002 team that was undefeated, or 2003 and
2004 that Di drove them?  
How do I compare that? It's a double-edged sword for us, constantly being
compared to other teams, constantly having to answer about our last loss. It's
kind of why I'm glad the Stanford game is behind us now. We don't have to
answer about our last loss. Now we just have to answer about there's no way
you can lose to this team tomorrow night.  
So there's a lot of difficult questions that I'm in a tough situation that I
can't answer them. The reason that this team is where they are is because they
have all those qualities that those other teams have: really good players,
really committed, really good role players, and they get really good coaching
from their coaching staff. Tonya did a great job for us while she was here,
certainly Chris in all the time she's been here.  
We've got nothing but national championship coaches working with these guys.
But that's all they know. So you put all that together and you almost think,
well, we should be. And when you say that, you go, You know how hard it is to
get here? It's kind of a double-edged sword for us.  
  
Q. Geno, how much of the evidence that's been presented in the first two
games with Louisville, I mean, is indisputable to people trying to evaluate
this game on the outside? And, secondly, what is the value in approaching a
game like this like Louisville is, with their mindset? How does that alter
what the truth is?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, again, it works both ways. I said this the other day, I
think, I don't know to who, but if you flip a coin and it comes up heads 10
times in a row, there's no guarantee that the 11th will be tails. They're all
individual. They're all in and of itself, its own separate act.  
So what we did to them the first game, I don't know that it had any effect on
the second game. What we did to them in the second game, I don't know that it
has any effect on today. Different environment. Different day. Different
attitudes among the players. Different emotions going through.  
So, yeah, I mean, there's no disputing the fact that we won by a lot both
times. But I don't know what that gets you. You still have to go out tomorrow
and make shots and stop them.  
If we don't make shots and we don't stop them, we're going to lose. Just like
they beat Maryland, just like they beat Oklahoma. So obviously they're really,
really good. We have to be really good. And if we are, we'll be fine.  
  
Q. My question to you, you've answered certain parts of my question before,
so I'm going to have to restyle it fairly quickly. But with Louisville, what
can sneak up on you and what can surprise you about that team that's going to
make it difficult for your players tomorrow night?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, that's the one thing that I think is a little bit of a
comfort area, that I don't know what could be considered sneaking up on us. We
know their players inside out. They know our players inside out.  
It's way too much familiarity between both teams. A lot more than you like to
have at this time of the year.  
Obviously have to see how tonight's game goes between North Carolina and
Michigan State. They're not in the same league, but they played once and the
game was really one-sided. I think they lost by 36 or something like that. I
think if somebody asks me, Would you take Michigan State at 30, I would say,
Yeah, I would. Not that I would do anything like that, but if somebody asked
me, I would.  
  
Q. What would you say tomorrow night you by 30 points, really?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Really? No, I would throw up if somebody told me that that's
what was going to happen, because then I know that that's -- exactly the
opposite is going to happen. I always think -- I think the worst. I prepare
for the best, but I think the worst.  
It's the key to being neurotic and Italian and Catholic. Something bad is
going to happen five minutes from now, tomorrow; you just count on it.  
  
Q. I know you touched on this last night, but given the special bond between
point guard and coach and also the kind of birthright it seems that the great
players need to have to win a championship while at UConn, Renee going out on
that kind of note, it's going to be a very powerful feeling within yourself
toward her these last 24 hours. Could you just explore that a little bit?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. I wish we were having this conversation Wednesday
morning or Tuesday night after the game and she was fortunate enough to do
that. But whether it was Jennifer or Sue or Di, Maria, even, to a certain
extent, I think any time you have an opportunity to win a national
championship, you can pretty much follow that trail and it leads right to the
point guard or certainly to a guard who can control the game.  
Now you add to that the special ones just transcend all the practices, all the
drills, all the Xs and Os, all the bus travel, the plane travel, film
sessions. They go above and beyond that. They're not about just, yeah, how are
we going to guard the pick-and-roll. That's so insignificant when you're
talking about those kinds of players, and certainly Renee Montgomery.  
I really admire her as a person. I really do. Even when she doesn't make a
shot, when she takes shots that I think are ill-advised, even when she didn't
talk to me for a couple of years when Tonya was her coach, I still admired
her.  
I've gotten to like her now more now that I'm her coach, and it's been a great
relationship and she's gotten to like me a little more and let me coach her.
But there's -- and if you've been around people like this, and I'm sure you
have, every great team has somebody like this on their team.  
And she's just one of those special people. But not all fairy tales end with
the prince taking the princess home and living happily ever after. Sometimes
it doesn't end right. I guess in a short period of time we'll find out. But I
don't know that I've wanted anything more than I want this.  
  
Q. Geno, the other day Jim Calhoun was talking about his '06 team that had
four or five guys go to the pros. And he said he thought that the lure of the
NBA started to affect the way they were playing. Well, this game that we have,
we probably have the top two picks in the draft, and they seem to be doing
fine. Doesn't seem to be affecting them at all. Why do you think women are
able to stay more focused, most of the time, anyway, than men?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Obviously, when we talk like that, we're talking in
generalities for the most part. And having a son and two daughters, I think
women are a little more grounded because guys are just schmoes. They just
don't get it. They just don't get it. It's so much about themselves, it's so
much about what people around them are telling them, they don't have the
backbone to stand up for themselves.  
Somebody says: Hey, you're not getting enough shots. You're not getting enough
touches. How are you going to get drafted if you don't do this. Now all of a
sudden you've got people thinking about everything but winning a national
championship or state championship, for that matter, or conference
championship.  
I think women don't have as many jerks hanging around them. There's not a lot
of people telling Renee Montgomery: Hey, you're not getting enough shots. Hey,
you're not going to be the first pick if you don't do this, this and that.
There's nobody telling Angel McCoughtry: You gotta go out tomorrow night and
you've got to be MVP of this tournament so you can be the first pick. That
just doesn't exist, I don't think.  
Now, I'm sure it does exist, I just don't think, from my experience, the
players I've had, anyway, ever have to deal with any of that. And maybe that's
why they're able to be as successful in these moments.  
But it's just a culture. It's the culture that we live in. That's how those
boys are raised from the time they're in junior high to the time they get to
wherever they're going. And it's awfully difficult to be successful in that
culture. Really difficult.  
  
Q. Two questions. First, do you want to take a second to brag about the Big
East since you have two teams in the finals and South Florida won the NIT?
And, secondly, as sad as it is, this has been considered a drought for you
guys being back here for the first time in a couple of years --  
COACH AURIEMMA: I said to somebody -- I think I know where you're going. I
said to somebody this morning. I said, Most places in America, they would go
-- you know, big headline: UConn going for their sixth national championship.
Like that's a big deal, right? I think Connecticut -- UConn, which hasn't won
an NCAA championship since 2004, and you go, Holy Jesus.  
So that's kind of -- you're right. You're like, That is a drought. Like, How
dare you? When you win three in a row and you go four years without one, it's
like, Your program has fallen off a cliff.  
So, yeah, that's -- I guess that's what we've created and that's what we've
got to live with. And it's okay, to a point, I guess.  
But one of the things that's gratifying is a few years ago we were at the Big
East meetings in Ponte Vedra, and I gotta tell you, it was one of the more
tense, contentious Big East meetings I've ever been a part of. Miami was
leaving, Virginia Tech was leaving. Boston College said they were staying,
they lied, then they were leaving. So there was a lot of emotion running
through those athletic directors, presidents, coaches.  
And the perception was you'll never be the same. You'll never be as good. It's
the end of the Big East. And now here we are X number of years later and we
have two teams in the men's Final Four. Two in the women's Final Four playing
for the national championship. That's four out of eight. You know, there's a
lot of good conferences, a lot of good schools, but I would venture to say
that the Big East is healthier, stronger, and better than it's ever been.  
And Mike Tanghese and John Marinatto and everybody in that Providence office,
I know they're probably the proudest people in the country right now for
what's happened in this conference.  
  
Q. Taking it a step further with the draft coming up on Thursday, do you
have a sense either from what you know about the league or instincts,
conversations you've had, how they may evaluate Renee and Angel on Thursday
and how that might all work out?  
COACH AURIEMMA: No. Again, I don't allow myself. We've had a couple of coaches
and a couple general managers and those people come to practice and all that.
But I'm not really involved in any of that at that point. I really don't care.  
As a matter of fact, I didn't even tell Renee that she was invited to the
draft. They want her there in person. I didn't even tell her that. I didn't
tell Maya Moore that she was AP Player of the Year. I don't tell these guys
anything. I figure in due time they'll find out. I didn't tell her that she
won the Wade Trophy. I figure in time they'll find out. When it's time for
them to know, they'll know.  
If I was a general manager and I had the draft, I don't know, obviously I
would pick Renee because I've coached Renee. But if you pick Angel McCoughtry,
how can you go wrong? I love her. I love her as a player. She does so many
things. I like Kristi Toliver. I like Courtney Paris. There's a lot of really
good players out there.  
I think a team's going to have to make their evaluations and say what's more
important to us, which position and which kind of player is there a best
chance for us to be really good. And sometimes it's not just about this year.  
If you look down, a couple years down the road, is there another player like
this coming along that if we pass on this one we'll get another one. A lot of
things go into making these decisions. Michael Jordan was picked third. Wonder
what those two guys are doing today. He's going in the Hall of Fame. The other
two guys are what? You know?  
  
Q. A lot of stars in this game. I'm wondering with your familiarity with
them what your thoughts might be on Candyce Bingham who is a player that
doesn't get a lot of --  
COACH AURIEMMA: Very overlooked and as key to their team as anybody else.
Angel just dominates the stat sheets so much. What did she get five steals
last night. They all probably led to buckets. Sometimes turnovers just go out
of bounds. When there's a turnover at Louisville there's a basket at the other
end and she's the big reason why.  
But I think Deseree' and Candyce are way overlooked. They're probably the
reasons why they're in the Final Four and playing for a national championship
game. As good as Angel has been, I think since this tournament has started,
and especially Deseree', I think those people have stepped up their game so
much that it's allowed people to -- you can't just concentrate on Angel
McCoughtry.  
So I've often believed that those players, those other players that nobody's
talking about, are going to be the ones that are going to decide the game. And
I love both of those two kids. They're exceptional competitors and they're
tough kids.  
And that second game at the Civic Center was a little bit of a slugfest. I got
a feeling the referees are going to have their hands full tomorrow night.  
  
Q. You've been in this situation before. How does an undefeated record
change things?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Not that much. Right now that's not the issue for them, for
me, because if you had three losses you wouldn't approach it any different
than you approach it now. If you had 10 losses, you wouldn't approach tomorrow
any different than you approach it.  
What's in the past is in the past. Being undefeated is a big deal to everybody
else as you go through the season. It becomes a big deal to you if you finish
the regular season and then the tournament undefeated and look back and go,
whoa, that was unbelievable. As you're going along it really doesn't enter
into it.  
If tomorrow we're more worried about being undefeated than winning one game, I
don't know that that's going to be the winning edge for us.  
  
Q. Is there a pressure element at all, do you compartmentalize it and get it
out of the way?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, there's pressure in everything we do. I criticize our
guys the way they eat breakfast. So there's pressure in everything we do, in
every pass, every drill, every time we do anything.  
So the pressure to win at Connecticut is great. Maybe too great. But without
pressure you can't be great. So we love the pressure. We embrace it and we run
with it.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you, Coach.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Louisville Â– 61  
Oklahoma - 59

  
AMY YAKOLA: I am pleased to be joined at the podium by Louisville head coach
Jeff Walz as well as student-athletes Candyce Bingham, Angel McCoughtry and
Becky Burke.  
Coach, when you're ready, let's have an opening statement.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you. Well, I'm not sure what to say. Just a group of kids in
that locker room that I challenged at halftime as much as I could have
challenged a group. I told Angel McCoughtry it was the worst I've seen her
play. She was an embarrassment.  
And that's the way we do things in our program, we're honest. And she came out
in the second half and played the way she's supposed to play, and I'm so proud
of her, and Candyce Bingham sitting next to me, she played for all -- every
second she was on the floor she played.  
It was a game that we just had to dig down. I thought we did a good job in the
first half of defending when we got them in the half court. But,
unfortunately, they scored on transition point after point, and that was just
killing us.  
So it was just a crazy game. And I gotta give a lot of respect to Oklahoma and
Coach Coale. Those kids came out and battled, too. It's one of those you hate
to see anyone lose, but we're really excited about things, and we're playing
on Tuesday.  
AMY YAKOLA: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Angel, how are you feeling? Holding your heart?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I'm feeling great. Gosh, nobody expected us to be here right
now. It feels so good to prove everybody wrong. I'm not going to call anybody
out this time.  
But I'm so proud of these girls. And we believed. Halftime we were down. That
shows a lot of heart to come back and play against this Oklahoma team who have
a lot of great players and to come out with the win. It's a lot of heart right
there.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, Candyce, you talk about those last free throws and the
last couple 10 seconds or so in the game?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: Well, I am a little mad that I missed the last one. But Mo
hustled and she tipped the ball, which took a couple of seconds off. But, I
mean, it was great, when the Oklahoma players -- we went in and out, we were
so excited.  
So like Angel said, this team showed a lot of heart. I mean, we did not give
up and we believed in every single person and Becky came out and hit big
shots. It was a great team win.  
  
Q. What was going through your mind, Angel, when you saw that last shot in
the air?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I said, oh, Lord, I said, I need to be over there. And all I
could do was just pause and watch and pray and hope that it didn't go in,
because if they made that, that's another Rutgers game for us, type game. And
that would have been devastating. But at the same time I would have had no
regrets, and I felt like we all laid it on the line. I've had a great season
and no complaints.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the first nine shots you guys missed in the game and
what was going on and what you were feeling as you're getting into a hole
there?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: Well, I think that just shows you that we're not aliens,
we're human. And I'm so glad to know that we are human. But you know what,
they played great defense. I think we just had those jitters that we just had
to relax and get out of. And I think it took us to the second half to get out
of it, which is sad.  
But we cannot allow that next game. We gotta come out strong for the next
game.  
  
Q. Angel, I want to follow up a little bit and talk about Oklahoma's defense
in the first half and specifically Whitney Hand. I think people would look at
an All-American being defended by a freshman and think that that might be an
easier task than it turned out to be. She really battled a lot, especially in
that first half.  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: Yeah, she's the heart and soul of that team and a freshman
isn't going to start for no reason.  
She hit three 3s on us, and, I mean, our job was really to contain her,
because she makes that team go.  
And I totally commend Oklahoma. They're a great team. And Courtney Paris is a
great friend of mine, and I really respect her. So I just had to like settle
down and just take my time. Second half I said to myself, you know what, we
got this, let's just take our time, do what Coach asked us to do because we
weren't following the game plan in the first half. Once we followed Coach's
game plan, then things started going our way.  
So we believe you now, Coach (laughter).  
  
Q. Candyce, what was the plan to stop? They have such great players, what
were you trying to do to slow them down in there?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: Well, we were trying to locate Hand and obviously we didn't
do a good job of that in the first half. Then just when Courtney Paris got on
the low block to double them, and just trying to keep them off the boards, and
they got some really quick guards, so just kind of tried to contain them, too.  
  
Q. Becky, what were you trying to do against Whitney, particularly in the
second half, and the two 3s you hit, you guys just throw from the outside,
talk about those shots you made.  
BECKY BURKE: In the second half we played a little claw and one -- or I mean
claw and two and box and ones. And I was on Hand. These guys had to get their
screens, just stay on each other, try to let her not let her touch the ball as
much as possible.  
And as far as my shots, I wasn't hitting anything, but in Raleigh I got a
little upset when I wasn't hitting shots so Coach got on me. I was going to
stay positive and kept shooting because that's what I'm out there to do is to
shoot and I eventually I knew one was going to go in. And I'm glad a couple
went in at the end there.  
  
Q. Candyce, can you talk about what was the feeling in being in the middle
of that celebration there? And you've had a lot of celebrations this year, but
this one is to go to the final game.  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: Again, I'm kind of speechless. But, I mean, it feels great.
Knowing that we were down 12 at halftime and we always looked to Angel and she
didn't even have a good first half. But to know that we were still pretty much
in the game.  
I mean, we didn't even play a great first half. We were only down 12. So just
to know everybody came together and we played a good second half. I mean, it
was a really good feeling. And nobody believed in us, so that makes it even
better.  
  
Q. Candyce, what did Coach say to you about the free throws before you took
them, if anything? What did he say in the last huddle? And just being from
Louisville and having Louisville play in this game, how did it make you
feeling?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: He just winked at me and said knocked them down and smiled.
And I'm sorry I missed that second one. What was your second question?  
  
Q. Being from Louisville.  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: It's great being from Louisville and being a part of this.
Words can't describe how I feel right now.  
  
Q. Angel, during the first half, there's something that played on the big
screen and each of the players were shouting out little things about this team
and one of the comments was Cinderella Team. What's your response to that
now?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I wouldn't really say we're Cinderella, because I think
we're just as good as any of these teams. Even though I was mad about the
commercial. They're going to have to change that for the next one, okay? I
mean, they were spoiling us from getting a national championship, too.  
But I wouldn't think of us as a Cinderella, we're just as good as any of those
teams and we want to be considered just as good as those teams, even though we
weren't.  
  
Q. Angel and Candyce, if it is Connecticut that you're playing, given the
two previous games, what kind of a different mindset do you have to take into
this one?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: Well, we know Connecticut is a great team. And a big upset,
Big East, and if we have two Big East teams in there it's really good for our
conference. We're glad to have two Big East teams in the national
championship. We have a lot of respect for Geno and his program, and we're
just going to come out, play hard. We know what to expect. We played them
twice, we're going to come out and play hard and hope to win.  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: UConn is a good team. If they do come out and win, we'll just
approach it like any other game. Coaches will put a good game plan together
and our job will be to execute it.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. It's easy when you've got the stage that we're playing on tonight to
forget that these are very young ladies we're talking about here. Talk about
the emotion of your players. I'm thinking about the block that Angel got and
her reaction and the anger that we saw in Byrd's face when she picked up her
fourth foul, and how you kind of used that to your advantage without letting
it get out of control in a situation like this.  
COACH WALZ: We are on a huge stage. And I told the kids when they came out for
the first hour, when the court opened, to just kind of stop and take four or
five minutes to look around and enjoy it, because it's an opportunity that we
hope to get back here many times. But I've got two great seniors on this team.
This is it for them.  
So I wanted to make sure they really soaked it all in and realized what we've
done. And we play with emotion all season. We do a pretty good job of trying
to corral it in to make sure it doesn't get overboard.  
That's why I took Angel out in the first half. I knew her emotion was getting
the best of her. And I sat her down, you know? And I thought after she came
out, then she went back in, I thought she started to let things come to her
more.  
  
Q. Just talk about your emotion, what you were thinking as Mo tried to get
that -- kind of took a little time there for them to get the ball and then
when the shot was in the air?  
COACH WALZ: Monique did an outstanding job. I thought Mo came in and played
her tail off, especially when Keshia picked up that fourth foul. She was doing
most of the work on Courtney Paris.  
And I thought Mo was going to be able to grab that thing and if they could
have got it they're going to foul her and we're back at the line. But the one
thing that concerns you about that is exactly what happened to us, is Mo is
out there scrambling for it and my other four decided to watch her.  
And Oklahoma gets the ball, throws it up the floor and we've got nobody within
about eight feet of her. And she got a great look. And it was one of those all
game, when we went our triangle and 2, I was going to make Stevenson beat us.
And she had some clean looks, and she made a big 3 late. When that shot went
up, I did think it was going in because it looked good from where I was
sitting.  
  
Q. There's a guy from Louisville named Ali who had a Rope-a-Dope strategy.
Was that a little bit at least the way the game started, do you think? You
think you maybe got Oklahoma lulled a little bit?  
COACH WALZ: That's not exactly the way I scripted it, I will tell you that.
But I told my staff before the game started: I was concerned about the first
five minutes of the game. If we could stay within -- if we could stay within
the first five minutes I felt good about things.  
And they were up I think 11-0. And at half we go in 34-22. So we're only
trailing by one after that first five minutes of the half. I felt good about
things. I told our kids if we'll follow the game plan, we have a chance to
win.  
And we came out in the second half and followed it and knocked down some shots
and was more patient at the offensive end. So I promise you on Tuesday I hope
we don't come out like that.  
  
Q. Jeff, again, if it is UConn that you play Tuesday night, how do you, I
don't know if convince is the right word, but how do you take these girls into
that game knowing what's happened in the two previous games?  
COACH WALZ: Well, you know, it's one of those, you're playing for the national
championship on Tuesday night. So it doesn't matter what the scores have been
in the past. We have to come out and play. Our game at UConn, you know, we
played competitively for 12 minutes, which is encouraging.  
So we've got to just look at some of that and take the positive from it. And
our game in the Big East finals, they got us right from the start. It's the
same thing, I told my staff at that one, too: First five minutes is going to
be crucial.  
And they really took it to us, and we missed some shots that you have to make
if you want to compete with a team like that. Because they're a special team.  
  
Q. What was your focus during the halftime message and also did you change
anything defensively in the second half?  
COACH WALZ: No, I can't repeat what the focus was. To be honest with you, I
told them -- I went in there. I just said, If you all want to play your own
game, that's fine, and then we'll pack up and go home.  
You know, because we put a game plan together as a staff. And I thought it was
a solid one. And I told them, If you want to come out here in the second half
and compete and follow our game plan, tell me.  
And they're all like, Yeah, we will, we will. And I thought we did a great
job. We held them to a 27 percent shooting in the second half compared to 42
in the first.  
  
Q. Coach, you took two timeouts early in the first half. The first I think
at 11-0 didn't seem to work, then called another one at 16-2 which I think was
the low point. What happened in that second timeout that kind of turned things
around?  
COACH WALZ: You know, I tried to talk to them about their body language.
Deseree' Byrd, who has been a leader for us the entire tournament, was
starting to show frustration at the point. When she starts to show that it
rubs off on everybody.  
I tried to calm her down. I tried to calm Angel down. Candyce was really the
only one that stepped up the entire night and played. And we had some good
shots. I mean, Keshia Hines who played her butt off gets 10 boards and 19
minutes of play. She air-balled a 1-footer. We couldn't have gotten her any
closer.  
I knew it was just tightness. It was jitters. So I was going to burn them off.
I had to, just to try and get our team calmed down. And I just am really,
really proud how we responded.  
  
Q. You're talking about how you felt sort of at halftime, did you draw back
to 2006 when you were actually in worst shape against Duke in that title game
with Maryland?  
COACH WALZ: No, you know what, I didn't even think about that at all. It was
just one of those that I felt good that we were only down 12, because we could
have been down 20.  
So I felt good about things, because when we got them in the half court, we
actually guarded them. The problem was their transition game was killing us.
And then we lose Whitney Hand three times in the first half and she hits three
3s and then we hold her -- I think she got two points in the second half at
the free throw line, because I thought that kid was the key to their team. And
we really contained her. And then that kind of stopped their offense from
going.  
  
Q. What do you think the key was to limiting Courtney Paris's touches?  
COACH WALZ: We did a great job of playing in front of her. We had help coming
from the backside. That's all we did all night. We talked about it. We worked
on it for four days. And that's why I was so upset in the first half because
we spent four days on a game plan, and I promise you, I guarantee you half the
fans out there were wondering what we had done for four days, because it was
embarrassing.  
  
Q. You had a couple of freshmen and you have so many young players coming up
and doing things in such a magnitude of a game. What accounts for that and
these freshmen being able to make the plays they're making?  
COACH WALZ: It's a group of freshmen -- I told them when they came in I wasn't
going to treat them like freshmen. You know, it was going to be tough. And
it's been a tough haul for some of them. But they've gotten a lot tougher over
this past three months.  
And Becky Burke is one, you know, she missed a 3 and coming out of the timeout
she goes, Coach, I'm going to make one. I said, I know you are, keep shooting
them. She went back and hit back to back from that corner that really gave us
a lift.  
And Monique Reid played so well for us. You know, we just got kids -- I told
them, everybody has a role and they're starting to believe if they do their
role we have a chance to win.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you, Coach.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Connecticut Â– 83  
Stanford - 64

  
AMY YAKOLA: Joined up here by head coach Gene Auriemma, as well as student-
athletes Maya Moore and Renee Montgomery. Coach.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, all I can say is going into this game I was very nervous
about how we were going to be able to guard Jayne Appel and how we were going
to defend Stanford in general.  
I wasn't that concerned about how many points we would score. I thought we
could get our shots. But I can't say enough about the defensive effort that
these kids put forth tonight. And these two players right here were just
unbelievable, and they just were determined to play one more game, to be in
Tuesday night's game.  
I said to Renee, I wanted you to play in your last game of your college career
to be the last game. And this is the first time that she's had a chance to do
that, and I'm really happy for her, as I am for everybody else on our team.  
AMY YAKOLA: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Renee, sum up your individual performance as well as your thoughts about
getting to the title game, please.  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: My thought process was simple the whole game. Coach broke it
down, just get a score and a stop. And the whole time, every time they shot
the ball, if it went in or didn't go in, I was thinking we've got to get the
ball up the floor quick.  
That was my thought process the whole game, and we have to get a lot of stops
and pressure the ball on defense.  
  
Q. Thoughts on the title game?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I'm excited to have another Big East championship game.
That's exciting. I know they're definitely not going to be the same team we
played before. Everyone gets better and everyone plays a whole lot better in
the tournament.  
So right now both of us are 1-0. And I'm happy for another Big East team to
make it to the championship game, and me and Angel have been talking along the
tournament and we actually was hoping each other would meet, and I guess now,
you know, we did it and may the best one win.  
  
Q. Renee and Maya, how satisfying was this win for you considering that they
knocked you out last year and maybe both of you didn't have your best games
against them?  
MAYA MOORE: It feels good to make progress. And I feel as a whole our team is
better, and we were more prepared this year to compete against Stanford.  
And we knew coming in that they were going to fight. They were going to be
disciplined. They were going to run. They were going to be aggressive, as you
saw. They didn't stop the whole game. They crashed the boards, they ran the
floor hard.  
If anything, we knew what we had to do to beat Stanford. So I'm just happy the
way everybody contributed tonight. If you look at the stats, really balanced
and I couldn't ask for anything more than just everybody stepping up and doing
what they're good at.  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I completely agree. I just think that I'm just excited about
how my teammates stepped up in the big moments just to get us here. I think
everybody came in, they knew what they had to do and everyone did their part
no matter how big or small it was. That's just the most fulfilling part.  
  
Q. Maya, can you just address the defensive effort on their role players
compared to last year, how you shut down Pohlen and Pedersen and Harmon, they
killed you last year, and what were you able to do this year that you weren't
able to do last year?  
MAYA MOORE: That was part of the game plan, too, make sure we guard the
3-point line. Which I thought we did a very good job of up until a little bit
in the second half. Because that's what hurt us last year.  
They were getting inside with Jayne, she's a great player, she's going to
score. We tried to make it tough for her. But if other people start getting
involved, it gives the whole team momentum that way. So we just tried to do a
good job recovering back on them, trying to make it tough for them, pressuring
them, and it worked.  
  
Q. Renee, do you ever surprise yourself with your capacity to come up big in
important situations like this?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I think it's just practice. I think every day in practice I
practice to be able to step up in the big moments, and that's why you put
yourself in every drill, to be able to, when your teammates need you, hit the
big shot or drive.  
You just feel completely comfortable and ready when you've practiced hard
every day to come in in a big game and perform. I think it's just work ethic
that gives you confidence. So, yeah, it's definitely work ethic.  
  
Q. Maya, you guys talked up here yesterday about how uncomfortable Stanford
made you last year. Do you feel like you guys made them uncomfortable early in
the game tonight?  
MAYA MOORE: I like to think so. I was really proud of my teammates for just
stepping up and just really putting pressure on the guards and doing a good
job of trying to help each other.  
I think one of the best moments in the game was the ball was on the sideline
in front of their bench and Renee I think Kalana or Tiffany, you guys just
trapped and just pressured the guards. It was the game plan executed
perfectly.  
So just for Coach to come and tell us to do something and we go out and do it,
it just feels great. Especially right here in the Final Four.  
  
Q. Maya, can you just talk about the sense of comfort you have playing with
Renee when she's locked in the way she was today?  
MAYA MOORE: It feels great, just to know that even when I make a crazy
decision or throw up a horrible shot I know Renee's going to come back the
next time and make something good happen.  
So she definitely -- her presence on the court gives us confidence, and when
she comes in and plays like herself, is patient, aggressive, attacks the hole,
everybody, just lifts everybody. That's an important part of our team, our
point guard, and I really feel like she's led us this way, and we have all the
confidence in the world in her.  
  
Q. Maya, it was 14-13. What was Stanford doing early on and what did you
guys do defensively to stop them and go on that run?  
MAYA MOORE: In the beginning of the game, both teams are going to battle. It's
one of those things where we just can't get -- try to get a 20-point lead off
of one shot.  
So it was going up and down. Stanford was running the floor really hard. And
we had to adjust to that and get back in transition. They were getting some
transition buckets. Once we started containing them that way, that helped
defensively, and then offensively we just found an open guy. Tiffany hit some
big shots, Kalana hit some big shots. When everybody's contributing like that,
our momentum just swings and that's when the lead -- we separate from other
teams.  
  
Q. Renee, how much was last year's game against Stanford like just in the
back of your mind all season long, like as you went through all those drills
and did all the hard work to get back here?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: Stanford wasn't the only team on our minds. You think back
to all of our losses, that was probably the only team in her mind because it
was her first loss in the tournament. But I think back to when we lost to Duke
and LSU, you don't forget losses. Stanford was the most fresh loss, but you
just think back to all the years where you fell short.  
And you just push yourself harder because you know you need that extra 2
percent in the Final Four. You need that extra everything when it comes down
to the Final Four. And we kept on falling short. So you have to change
something when you're not successful, and I think all the losses that I've had
in my career just got me to where we are here today.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you both. Congratulations. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you know Renee so well. Do you have a sense -- when you see
her before a game or you chat with her before a game, can you read her mind,
you know what she's thinking? Do you have a sense of what she might do over
the next 40 minutes?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Pretty much. I think we all do on our team, all of our coaches
are very aware of that. It's not just right before the game, it's the day
leading up to the game. It's everything that she does.  
A performance like tonight is almost what I've come to expect from Renee in
any meaningful, big game, because that's who she is. And she's absolutely
right about -- I don't think there was a drill this year at any one time that
I can remember where she didn't treat that drill like it was for the national
championship.  
Every dribble move, every coming off a screen, you know, every single thing
that she did was at that level every day. And when you do that, as she said,
you expect to be in this position. And that's what you're planning for.  
She's Renee Montgomery, you know? She's just really good.  
  
Q. Geno, 38 games in, does this team continue to impress you by the way it
executes and responds in situations such as this?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. Yeah. We talked about that before the game. We talked
about that when you believe in yourself and you believe in each other and in
the group how you know that the person sitting next to you and the one behind
you and the one in front of you have all invested the exact same amount and
are going to be there for you, it's a real comfort level. It's something that
all great teams share and it allows you to withstand the other teams making
shots, your missing shots.  
It allows you to withstand anything. They're just really intertwined and
really connected right now and they have been since September. My job's been
much easier this year than the last three or four years in terms of knowing
that they're ready to play.  
  
Q. Geno, last time you were in St. Louis, it was a similar situation. First
half you dominated. It was 13 or in that range and you guys didn't come out in
the second half and finish the job. Did you bring that up with them or compare
how this team was able to come out in that second half and just lock up on
them defensively and take this game over?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Actually, I didn't bring up our game with Notre Dame in 2001.
In the locker room I brought up the Louisville/Oklahoma game that was played
right before us. Oklahoma is up 12 and we're up 13, and at this time of the
year, you know, there's no recovering from a bad five, six, seven, eight, ten
minutes. There's no getting it back.  
So I thought if we would come out in the second half and put together a real
good five-minute spurt that it would be hard for Stanford to come back from
that. And they helped us. I mean, they missed some shots and we took advantage
of it.  
But I haven't really mentioned anything about the Notre Dame game back here in
2001. We're on the same bench as we were then. We're in the same locker room
as we were then. There's a lot of similarities. But I'm trying not to burden
them with that.  
  
Q. How satisfying is it to get back a win from a team that beat you last
time?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I like Tara, you know? And I respect what she's done and I've
always had great admiration for the way she coaches and the kids she gets to
go to Stanford and play. And so that really didn't enter any of it. No more
satisfaction beating Stanford than it would have been Oklahoma or Louisville
in the semifinal game.  
The feelings are more about I don't want this team to come up short. I don't
want them to stop playing. I wanted them to be in the championship game. Who
we had to play to get there was really not even an afterthought. I was more
scared and more nervous rather than looking for some satisfaction for beating
them.  
They're a hard team to play against, and any time you beat Stanford, you've
accomplished a great deal.  
  
Q. Since you brought up the Oklahoma/Louisville game at half, how astonished
or breathtaking was Louisville's comeback in that second half, and does that
familiarity give you any sense of what exactly going into the championship
game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I wish we were playing anybody but Louisville Tuesday night.
Anybody. I don't care who. And the reason I say that is -- at least we're
going to have a Big East national champion. So that's a good thing.  
The bad thing is the last team you want to play is a team that you beat the
way we beat them the two times we played them. And especially the last time we
played them.  
So when I saw what they did today, I was not surprised. I wasn't surprised
they beat Maryland. I wasn't surprised they got here. We've seen them play.
I've seen what Angel can do, by herself, just take over games.  
For them to only be down 12 and she hadn't scored yet, you know, Oklahoma's in
trouble. They're up 12, but they're in trouble because Angel hasn't scored
yet.  
So the familiarity works both ways, you know? They know us as much as we know
them.  
  
Q. Is this the most satisfying get to the championship game since you have
Renee who hasn't been there before? I mean, you've had a lot of titles and a
lot of teams make to it the championship, but is there something about her
that this is for her to get a championship and put her name with the other
incredible players to come through UConn?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, yeah, I've kind of felt that from the very first one. I
don't mean to go into the history of Connecticut basketball, but in 1991 I
just wanted to go to the Final Four because I had a couple seniors that were
just responsible for building our program.  
Then in '95 I really wanted Rebecca Lobo to go out as a national champion. And
the same with Sue and the same with Diana. You love when your best players,
the ones that have given their heart and soul to your program and have
accomplished so many things for themselves individually, for your team, for
their teammates, I don't think there's anything greater than winning your last
college game. I don't know that there's anything that could possibly top that.  
And I tell my players this all the time. It's not about me or my coaches or
the University of Connecticut or the fans that are out here. They might not
want to hear that, but it's not about that. Because if we were playing in
front of nobody at midnight, it would still be the same. It's about the
players that are doing it and how they're going to remember their experience
at Connecticut.  
If you're Renee Montgomery and we would be fortunate enough to win Tuesday
night, that would be like waking up from a dream with a smile on your face for
the rest of your life. I just can't imagine that it could get any better than
that.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you, Coach.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Connecticut Â– 83  
Stanford - 64

  
AMY YAKOLA: Joined by Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer as well as student-
athletes Jayne Appel and Jillian Harmon.  
Coach, when you're ready, an opening statement.  
COACH VANDERVEER: First, I'd just like to congratulate Connecticut on a great
game. They have a terrific team, and I thought it was a really outstanding
individual performance by Renee Montgomery.  
And, second, I'd like to just extend my congratulations to Stanford and to
especially Jill and Jayne being up here, having just a fabulous season, a team
I'm really proud of. And I really liked how our team battled. This was a very
tough night for us.  
We did not shoot the ball well at all. We struggled turning the ball over. We
worked very hard defensively, and were in great position and took away a lot
of the things we needed to do. They still made some shots.  
And our team, especially with the leadership of Jill and Jayne, competed for
40 minutes and represented themselves and our team and our university in a way
that I'm exceedingly proud of.  
AMY YAKOLA: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jayne, through much of the first half and a fair portion of the second
half, they seemed to have you playing much further out from the basket than
I've seen in the last five games I've watched you. Late in the game you were
able to get much closer to the hoop. And the scoring picked up. What were they
doing and what changed?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think they came out with a game plan to be very physical,
always have a body on me and push me out away from the block. As the game went
on I just kept trying, kept trying to get in as deep as possible and as close
to the basket as possible. Just kept trying to wear them down, I guess, and
tried to give myself the best opportunity to score.  
  
Q. Jill, was it a frustrating start? There were some quick turnovers and you
guys were having trouble moving the ball around. Then it was 14-13, then they
went on a run. Was that not the start obviously that you guys wanted?  
JILLIAN HARMON: It was definitely a disappointing start. UConn is a great team
and they played a great game. They hit shots. We didn't hit many shots. But
I'm so proud of the way our team stayed with it. We were positive for the
whole 40 minutes, and it's an honor to be a part of this team.  
  
Q. Jill, can you just talk about this being your last game?  
JILLIAN HARMON: I don't know how -- it's been a great four years. I couldn't
have asked more. The best coaches in the world. Best teammates. To have it
come to an end is a bit surreal. I was balling my eyes out in the locker room
not because we lost the game but because I can't play with these ladies again.
But I know they'll come back next year and hopefully be at the Final Four and
hopefully I'll be here to watch.  
  
Q. Jill, can you step back and play coach for a second. What would you tell
your teammates for next year?  
JILLIAN HARMON: Just to work on things they need to work on, to remember this
loss and have it motivate them. I think our loss last year in the championship
game really motivated us just to improve.  
And I know everyone on our team can do that. And I know this team will be back
strong.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Will you talk about those first maybe 10 minutes of the game, how things
went and what kind of hole it put you in?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think, well, first of all, as somebody already mentioned,
it was extremely physical, in terms of the amount of contact on Jayne. I mean,
just -- every time she came down totally pushing her off the block.  
And so that created a situation where she then -- she was easier to double
because she was closer to the perimeter people. And we did turn it over. We
did miss shots that we needed to make.  
I thought we were doing a really good job defensively. We rebounded well, but
our offense was -- we were taken out of our offense by the physicality inside.
And they're extremely aggressive and quick on the perimeter.  
And we just, you know -- we took some bad shots, I thought, early. Some quick
shots. We missed some shots that we needed to make. And we had too many
turnovers.  
At the same time, they did go -- they went on a run where like one time we
just totally lost Montgomery. And honestly, for their team, they really
capitalized on anytime -- for the most part anytime someone was open -- like
the first play of the game, Hayes was left open. She knocked down a 3.  
And we weren't open that much. But we have to help ourselves more by knocking
down shots and making free throws. There's certain things that as a team we
have to do to be able to stay in it.  
We had some open shots we needed to knock down. Had some free throws that we
needed to knock down.  
  
Q. Coach, Nnemkadi spent more time on the bench than she typically does in a
game. Was it part of your strategy to sort of pick up more guard play?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Are you talking about Nnemkadi Ogwumike? Nnemkadi Ogwumike
played really well. And she's averaging about 25 minutes. She played about the
amount of time that she was playing. Defensively it was the toughest matchup
for her guarding Maya Moore. And a couple times she asked for a sub. She's
young and she was tired. But I thought she did a great job when she was in
there.  
And also some of the things that they were giving us were kind of more to be
spread out, and for her to make better decisions on the perimeter and I think
as she gets more experience, to be able to hit more of a high post shot and a
perimeter shot, I thought she did a great job for us. So she rebounded. She
scored. And she really competed well for the time she was in there.  
  
Q. Can you just reflect on the whole season? You lost your best player,
Candice Wiggins, to graduation, lost your point guard but yet you made it to
the semifinal game. And even though this was a bad loss, at this point can you
put it all in perspective?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I mean, Connecticut is a terrific team. One of the
disappointments that I had was as soon as I looked at the bracket -- in some
ways it's like, I mean, I really feel like we could compete on a really good
basis with the other two teams that were here, whether it's Oklahoma. But
Connecticut was head and shoulders above us tonight.  
And what I wanted to make sure with our team was this one game in some ways
did define us but in some ways it did not define us.  
The best thing that happened was the fact that when things were not going our
way, our kids really -- they stayed with things really well. They competed.
They weren't sniping at each other. They didn't have excuses when they came to
the bench.  
I was so proud of that. Now, it was very difficult. We didn't do some of the
things that we needed to do or we wanted to do.  
But we've really grown up a lot this season. And to have Jayne in there. She
really was an All-American in how she kept demanding the ball. Totally getting
bodied out and stayed with things really well.  
We have a very, very young team and we do not have the guard leadership that
Connecticut had. I thought Jeanette filled in really well, but there were
times tonight when we just didn't have the let's set things up and let's run
things that we needed.  
But for the whole season, for our team to be playing in the Final Four with
what we've been through, I'm exceedingly proud. I just can't even -- I have to
pinch myself, say, We're in the Final Four. And I just think that our team
will build on this experience and it will set in that, wow, you get here, and
we want to do better.  
  
Q. You've been coaching for a while. How good is this Connecticut team?
There's been four other undefeated teams in the history of this sport. You've
seen a bunch of them, if not all of them. How good is this team? Where does it
fit in?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Tonight, I thought they played really well tonight. They
don't have -- maybe they don't have a lot of depth, but they don't need it.
They play Renee Montgomery. They shoot the ball really well. And they defended
us very well. They're extremely aggressive. They are extremely athletic.  
I don't know about the hyperbole about the greatest team, whatever, whatever.
It's comparing -- how can you compare? How can have you Diana Taurasi come
back with that team? Geno would know best.  
But they're on a mission. And I think coming out and beating them last year,
they've dedicated themselves. Renee Montgomery has improved tremendously. Maya
Moore is a great player. But I think she was really the difference-maker, and
I told Geno after, I said, That's the Player of the Year right there. She's
phenomenal.  
And their whole team, they stepped up and made plays that they had to make,
and they don't make a lot of mistakes. They don't take bad shots. They play
within the flow of the game and they play with a purpose.  
  
Q. You mentioned in a conference several days ago your preference for not
coaching an undefeated team and how you're uncomfortable with that and your
ability to take lessons from defeats. With a young team and so many players
returning next year, what lessons do you think those young players can take
out of this defeat today?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that's a great question. I mean, what they saw today
either out there or from the bench was a team that has great athleticism, but
they're in terrific shape. They run, and they set screens. They're very
physical.  
I think that they're very skilled. The ability to put the ball on the floor
and go to the basket. We had players go in and the ball was taken right away.
I think players on our team are going to -- if we want to be at this level, if
we want to compete for a national championship, I think there are a lot of
young players who can say, boy, I can get in the gym and I can improve and I
can help our team. And hopefully either from not playing or from even playing
and saying I can do better, I can help our team more.  
Being better 3-point shooters, we didn't shoot the ball well from 3. We
weren't as physical as we needed to be. So, again, this is -- Connecticut's a
young team in a way, take away Renee Montgomery, they've got a lot of young
players, too.  
In order for us to compete with them, we're going to have to really work hard
in the off-season in the same way they did.  
  
Q. I know it's very soon after a loss. But do you have two or three things
in your mind that you know you want to work on for next season with the group
you've got coming back?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that there are some real positives to be gained from
this game, I think, anytime you come to the Final Four. But I think that
people will leave with a sense of feeling great accomplishment of coming, but
a great disappointment in not playing better.  
I would say the number one -- we have to shoot the ball better. We have to
take care of the ball. We have to be in better condition to be able to run. We
have to be better skilled in handling the ball and less turnovers, knocking
down shots. And through our season we have not shot the ball well from the
perimeter. And that's something that we have to improve.  
But I think that that's something that we can do. And players will put the
time into that. But I would just say basic skills. Fundamental skills of ball
handling, passing, shooting, conditioning, and putting time in in the off-
season.  
  
Q. Following up what you just said. When you get in the Pac-10, you've got
two other teams that are pretty high level with you, you've got others that
are developing. And you go for that long stretch. And I think of some earlier
years, the Texas teams and the Southwest conference that play well early and
not see a lot, and then you don't see it until you get here. Would it be
helpful to like get an out-of-conference game in late February or just give a
team a sense of what's ahead?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Our schedule next year is really as competitive, but we
don't have that gap. We played Cal in the first game. So we played two games
all the way through with the Pac-10. And I think the Pac-10 -- I don't feel
that the Pac-10 did not get us ready. I will say this, the physical play that
was allowed in this game was different than what -- but I've said that all
year long. When we came back East and we played Duke, we had Eric on that
game. When we played Tennessee. Next year we're opening at Old Dominion.
Rutgers, we play Tennessee, Duke, Gonzaga, Utah.  
We go to Connecticut. We're starting a home and away with Connecticut. So
we're playing as tough a schedule as an assistant coach could give a head
coach. So I think the main thing for us is to at this point be able to take
positive things from our trip here, and I think our team will.  
And it's been a phenomenal experience. We're thrilled to be here. We want to
compete better, but I'm really proud of our team and how well we've done.  
AMY YAKOLA: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 4, 2009

  

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

### [Whitney Hand](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19708)

### [Ashley Paris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16964)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Oklahoma head coach Sherri Coale, as well as
student-athletes Ashley Paris and Whitney Hand. Coach, if you could give us an
opening statement.  
COACH COALE: Thank you very much. We're honored to be here, honored to be
competing in this Final Four in St. Louis, looking forward to the challenges
that lie ahead and very appreciative of the opportunity.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Ashley, after four years of working, working, working, what does it mean
to you to finally get to a Final Four?  
ASHLEY PARIS: It means a lot. And Courtney obviously has been here every year
for the All-America awards and she's always talked to me about how cool it is
and how much it hurts not to be here and be an All-American.  
But just how exciting it is for those girls who are All-Americans and playing.
So just to be here is unreal. And I don't feel like there's any better way to
end my career, any group of people that, better people that I could have been
around. So this is just fun, real and exciting for me.  
  
Q. Ashley and Whitney, if you could talk about the challenge ahead what you
know about Louisville and this is a program that's new to the Final Four. Is
it hard facing a team that's seen somewhat as an underdog?  
WHITNEY HAND: Yeah, definitely. I think Louisville is a great program. I think
they've gained some momentum in the tournament and they're definitely on a
roll and I think they're playing with some sense of urgency that we haven't
seen really from them yet in this tournament.  
So I think they're definitely on a roll, and I think Angel McCoughtry is one
of the best players in the country, and she's definitely difficult to contain
and they just play really well around her.  
So they're definitely going to be a hard matchup, but they're playing well
right now.  
ASHLEY PARIS: It is kind of hard because they consider themselves underdogs
and they play with that the world's against us mentality and it's hard to play
against. And Angel is a talented player, but they obviously have some great
pieces that go along with her. They mix stuff up on defense and offense and
they're just a very talented team. So it's going to be a great game, I think.  
  
Q. Ashley, can you talk about the matchup with McCoughtry, what a difficult
matchup she is being a pretty big girl who also plays outside and how you guys
might try to defend her?  
ASHLEY PARIS: She is a difficult matchup, because she's a very talented player
and she can score the basketball in a lot of ways, but I feel like we have a
lot of guys who can try to contain her. I feel, yeah, she's a bigger guard,
but Amanda and Whitney are six foot.  
So I just feel like with our guards, I feel like they can do a pretty solid
job of trying to slow her down a bit?  
  
Q. Ashley, Courtney's not here so you can talk about her sort of behind her
back. What is it that you do better on the court and what is it that you are
better than her at off the court?  
ASHLEY PARIS: Off the court, I'm better than her at pretty much everything
(laughter), except for like being annoying and stuff that you don't want to be
better at. On the court, I don't know, it's hard to say. I feel like I really
complement her game and I think that comes with playing with her all my life.  
And naturally I feel like I'm a little bit more mobile than she is and a
little bit more versatile than she is.  
  
Q. Follow-up, you mentioned the mobility. Has that helped? I read somewhere
that you lost some weight over the summer. Do you attribute being a little bit
more mobile to losing the weight or how has that affected your game?  
ASHLEY PARIS: Definitely. I feel like I have more endurance and just I'm
quicker up and down the court and I'm able to be out on the perimeter and give
our guards some room to penetrate and Courtney more room to work on the post.
Yeah, definitely has contributed a lot.  
  
Q. If you could talk about your season a little bit, both of you, why do you
think you got this far? Is there something about the team that maybe we don't
know that helped you get this far, whether it's friendship or the bonding that
went on? Was there a pivotal moment in the season where you sort of catapulted
to this?  
WHITNEY HAND: I think our team really just -- we're as together as any team
can be and I think that's really genuine, and I think that's something you
don't see very often. It's not just surface we have to respect each other,
like each other because we're forced to play with each other; it's a genuine
want to be together friendship and love and family that kind of you can just
see it resonate to the surface.  
And I think that's what made our team special. You've seen very many times
we'll have a struggle in the first half. We'll be down at halftime and I think
we just show that by playing together and playing within each other to just
battle our way back. I think when you're playing for each other it makes it a
whole lot harder to beat than when you're just playing for yourselves.  
ASHLEY PARIS: Yeah, what Whitney said. I think we're a very talented team. I
think our coaches have recruited pretty solid players. We have Courtney and
Whitney and Danielle and just a bunch of depth.  
I mean, we're a good team. I think the main thing about us and the reason that
we're here is because of our chemistry on and off the court. It is that bond
we have and that belief in each other and that we truly want to win for each
other, and I feel like that's why we're here today.  
  
Q. Ashley, you talked a lot about how you've changed as a ball player over
the years, particularly from last year to this year. Tell us how Courtney's
changed as a player. Is she pretty much the same player she was when she came
in, or what's been her development and progression?  
ASHLEY PARIS: Man, it's hard to say that about Courtney. Because most of the
time she's going to have the double-double and dominate a game and when she
doesn't the whole world knows about it.  
So, I mean, I feel like she's become a smarter basketball player here and just
really learned the game and really learned how to make teammates better and
just become a student of the game?  
  
Q. A &M, Iowa State, Baylor made some very strong runs through this
tournament and there have been several other Big 12 teams that obviously
played real well in the post season. Talk about how getting through a season
playing against competition in one of the tougher conferences maybe prepared
y'all for getting to a tournament where you're playing very good teams every
night and how it might make you prepared for the Final Four.   
ASHLEY PARIS: I think the Big 12 is it's frustrating but it's great. I feel
like every time we go into one of these games, okay, they're like a Baylor;
okay, that's kind of like an Iowa State; okay, they're like a Texas.  
I feel like the Big 12 is so versatile and so talented that it prepares you
for everything post season has to offer.  
WHITNEY HAND: Yeah, I totally agree. I think that, I mean, when you go to
press conferences everyone's like how do you handle Georgia Tech's pressure?
You lost to A&M, how is that? But the cool thing is we got to play A&M three
times and the cool thing is we got to play Baylor twice. I mean, that
definitely prepares you and I think especially as a young player it really
exposes you to this kind of attention earlier while you're going through it
later, I guess.  
  
Q. Whitney and Ashley, is it difficult or how do you go about separating the
hoopla of this event and this is a very serious business of trying to win a
national championship? Is that a difficult thing to do?  
ASHLEY PARIS: I feel like you don't take for granted being here. There's a lot
of hoopla going on and I feel like we owe it to ourselves to enjoy it and
embrace it, but we also came here with a goal; that's to be national
champions. At the end of the day this is all great, but we remember we came
here to try to win two games.  
WHITNEY HAND: I think, I mean, the same thing. I think it obviously can be
distracting, but Coach talks about staying within our bubble and being excited
for each other but not losing focus of our ultimate goal.  
  
Q. Ashley, do you feel like you play in your sister's shadow?  
ASHLEY PARIS: I think I've said this last night or whenever I was doing media
yesterday. I feel like most of the world plays in Courtney's shadow. It's not
just me.  
And obviously she's a very dominant presence, and she's a post and I'm her
twin sister and she's done so much for women's basketball and so much for our
program that naturally I play in her shadow. But I enjoy it. I signed up for
it.  
  
Q. This is a follow-up for Ashley on that. Was there ever a time when you
guys thought about going to different schools or were you always a package
deal in high school?  
ASHLEY PARIS: I think we would have loved to be a package deal. And we thought
that way when recruiting started. But I felt like we both decided that we're
going to make the best decision for us individually and if we could do that
together, then great. And I felt like Oklahoma has what was best for both of
us. So it kind of worked out that way.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks to both of you. Questions for Coach Sherri Coale.  
  
Q. Sherri, when Whitney is smiling, what does that mean for your team, not
only game plan-wise? I know it's important for her shots game plan-wise, talk
about that, but also psychologically her infectious personality, how does that
benefit you?  
COACH COALE: I've said a number of times this season that when Whitney's
making baskets from behind the arc we feel like we're invincible and we sort
of play that way.  
I think particularly in this tournament, our team has taken on both Whitney
and Danielle's personality. I think they've just kind of followed suit. One of
the keys I think once you get here, everybody's good. Who can relax and who
can enjoy the experience and who can get lost in the immersion of playing the
game, that might determine who ends up with a W at the end of the night.  
And when Whitney's hitting 3s and smiling and we're jumping around and hugging
each other, it's pretty easy to get immersed in the moment and it allows you
most often to put your best game forward.  
  
Q. When you look at DVDs, game film, whatever, what do you see with the Lady
Cards, the particular style, and what kind of different challenges do they
bring to you guys, especially the whole underdog thing and really never been
here before?  
COACH COALE: The whole underdog thing I find kind of interesting because
nobody on my team has ever been here before either. So it's a new experience
for everyone.  
But Angel McCoughtry obviously is their axis, and as she goes they go. But I
think the people around her know how to play around her and with her and
alongside of her. They don't stand and watch her play. That's the reason why
they're here. They do a lot of things defensively which keeps you from
scripting too much offensively. When you don't know what's coming, it's hard
to be prepared for it.  
I think our guards have to be real heady and we have to handle all those
changes and adapt and we'll see how deep our basketball IQ really is because
we're going to have to make decisions on the fly and react.  
Offensively, I think they're so difficult to contain. I don't know that you
can stop Angel McCoughtry. You can maybe limit her as best you can, limit her
touches, get her off the ball, and then do everything within your power to
keep her from getting the rebound. But she's interesting, because they run
everything to her, obviously. You go through their sets and we could have 12
pages of diagrams of sets that they run. Pretty quick hitters, but they all
have the same exact ending action.  
Angel gets the ball. And it's hard to keep her from doing that, yet that's not
the way that she always scores. She's great on defense her anticipatory skills
are outstanding. So she creates offense for herself.  
She gets a lot of it off defense, anticipating and getting steals, and she
gets a lot of it off the glass. So you try to at least limit her touches in
those two avenues.  
  
Q. How different is this for you from the first time? Because I remember you
telling stories about going to Stacy Hansmeyer, what is this like and what
happens in a Final Four. Do you feel like a wise veteran at this point? How is
it different?  
COACH COALE: I do, I feel like a wise old sage. I've got that Smart Water back
there and I've been drinking it and I feel really good.  
You know, it is nice to have had the experience, but things change every year.
It's funny, we were just in a team meeting this morning. I was trying to tell
my guys what was going to happen at the State Farm All-American press
conference and how it happens. And I was talking about every year inevitably
it's in a room that's way too small for all the people who would like to get
in there.  
We walk in there; it's a daggone banquet hall, it's nothing like it's been,
and they're looking at me like, Really, you've been here before?  
So everything changes as you go, but I do think it's helpful to be able to
prepare just for what the media is like, the open practice, the way you're
pulled in different directions and how you have to at the end of the day
return to your bubble and do the work you're called here to do. So I think
it's helpful to have been here before.  
  
Q. Sherri, what do you need from Danielle tomorrow?  
COACH COALE: Continued leadership. Continued leadership, toughness. Control of
the basketball. Management of the game. We don't ask point guards to do much,
do we. Just listed everything that's important except score 40. We don't need
her to do that, though; it would be nice, and I'll take it if she'd like to.
She needs to run the team, recognize, handle the basketball, stay composed,
have the good face that I think all great point guards who are successful,
they carry the good face with them. If she has that, we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Sherri, kind of the same question I asked Ashley. What do you think is
the biggest improvement in her game in the last year? And people say that
twins tend to have that sort of special chemistry. And I wonder if that helps
the rest of the team, complements it or if that ever gets in the way of team
chemistry?  
COACH COALE: Good question. First of all -- or questions. First of all, in
terms of Ashley's improvement, I think there have been two major areas and
they're connected one to the other.  
One is obviously her improved fitness level which enables her to play harder,
longer, enables her to do more things. I said repeatedly that she has improved
her skill set in terms of facing the basket. But the way her improved
conditioning level has helped us most is in the area of transition, because it
gives us a target down the floor every single time and offensive transition
gives us a post player running rim to rim, and defensively it allows us to get
out from basket protection to get to our shooters and get early defense sets.
She's really affected us in that very important piece of a full-court
basketball game.  
I think the other way that she's improved dramatically has been her
confidence. And it's hard to say which came first. But typically kids'
confidence grows when you give them something really hard to do and they do
it.  
Whether we gave it to her or she gave it to herself, she committed to getting
into physical condition and she committed to developing a perimeter skill set
and when she did that her confidence blossomed and grew, and hard to tell what
came first, the chicken or the egg, but it's been a nice ending product.  
As far as the sixth sense that the twins have I think it's fabulous, I think
very rarely does it cause any sort of a disconnection with the rest of the
team. I think you could see a little bit of it in the second half of the
Purdue game, a couple of high-low passes and extra gives they gave to one
another late in the game when the other three guys on the floor are taking
care of their business and moving, and it allows that sixth sense that I think
is special to twins to sort of rise to the top.  
  
Q. There seems to be a consensus among people who have watched the game all
year that your semifinal was a game for second place. Do you catch yourself
peeking ahead to UConn, the challenge that you guys would face?  
COACH COALE: No. I'm focused on Louisville right now.  
  
Q. Sherri, do you find the last four years have been somewhat of a tinkering
process as far as trying to find the right pieces to complement Courtney, and
why did this year's team connect?  
COACH COALE: I think every season is a tinkering process, honestly. You have
different pieces and parts, and even if you have the same exact team, you have
guys that develop and change and hopefully they're all getting better and
improving in that direction. But no one's static. And it's like riding a bike,
you're either going forward or backward. You're not going to sit still on it.  
So every team is different. I look at through the four-year progression of
what we have had around Courtney and with her on the floor and her freshman
year. We had very seasoned guards who really had a high basketball IQ and knew
how to play around her and with her. She got to go to the block and do the
easy stuff, kind of be -- not that her job was easy, I don't want to say that.  
But she just had to hold down that piece in the paint, and the people around
her thought and moved and created things and she had this incredible freshman
year. Some of those guys graduated and suddenly it got a little bit different.  
And every year there's been a different composition. I think the unique thing
about this year is that we have, proverbially, I guess, all the pieces in
terms of we have a real heady, talented point guard; we have shooters who can
stretch the defense; we have speed; guys who can break the defense down off
the dribble.  
And then Ashley's development, too, and her ability to step off the block and
become sort of a quasi perimeter player complements Courtney as well.  
I think all those things sort of have fallen into place, along with that
magical ever elusive thing called chemistry.  
  
Q. Not necessarily looking at teams in this year's Final Four, but if you go
back and look at some of those Tennessee teams, UConn teams, do you think it's
good for the game to have teams that are so dominating in one year they can
just shear through teams like that?  
COACH COALE: Not especially. I think parity is always good for growth. I think
Louisville being here for the first time is good for the growth of women's
basketball.  
I think it's tough. It's obviously tough to break through that when those sort
of dynasties are in place, but I think you're continuing to see that. I think
we saw more upsets in the NCAA tournament this year than we've ever seen.  
And while you hate it for Pat and everything that she's done for this sport,
and obviously the success of Tennessee and Connecticut have catapulted our
sport into the national spotlight. But in order to continue to grow, there
need to be other folks in the sight. And I think it is healthy for the growth.  
  
Q. Sherri, how much can we expect to see Amanda play, and is her foot
getting better? And the other thing talk about Courtney's second half against
Purdue?  
COACH COALE: I think we will see even more of Amanda. We kind of had to make a
tough decision at the start of the NCAA tournament as to how much we used her,
and I made the decision to only use her if I thought we had to have her early
on, particularly in the first and second games.  
And I think that it's paid off dramatically. She was feeling much better in
the Oklahoma City regional and yet again I thought every day helps. And the
training staff told us that: The longer you can rest her the more efficient
she'll be when she returns.  
We got her some what I call momentum minutes in the first game at Oklahoma
City just to get some timing back and to get a feel for the game. And then
when we had to have her against Purdue. She was fabulous and was able to
practice more yesterday and the day before than she has practiced in three
weeks. And that's because of that two-week rest we were able to give her. So I
expect her to be able to give us whatever we need from her on Sunday night.  
Courtney's second half against Purdue I thought was vintage Courtney Paris.
You know, she's so good all the time. Who does that? Who gets a double-double
almost every night of their entire collegiate career? But she does have ups
and downs and hills and valleys like everybody else, just her valleys don't
sweep quite as deeply as some of ours do sometimes.  
I think what you saw in the second half was what has defined Courtney
throughout her career: will, passion, energy, explosiveness. She just competed
on every possession. And I thought really controlled the real estate right
around the rim.  
  
Q. It's easy to forgive because so much has been made against Courtney and
Ashley, but beyond those two you've got a pretty young team. Talk about beyond
their play on the court, the leadership that you get out of them as seniors.
And then also this is horribly unfair, we're not going to give you a second to
enjoy the success of this year, but talk about the future. You've got a young
bunch that'd be easy to see where they're going to be awfully good for a while
now.  
COACH COALE: I think our leadership has grown throughout the year. Our two
team captains, Carolyn Winchester and Amanda Thompson did a fabulous job early
in the year, sort of solidifying everyone and saying this is what we're going
to stand for and this is how we're going to work and this is what you'll be
accountable for and we're going to hold you to that. And it's not an easy
thing for peers to do. I think all successful teams have it, but it's not an
easy thing to do. And those two guys really sort of put the rudder in the
water and said this is the direction we're going to go.  
And as the season has gone on and Whitney has performed the way she has and
Danielle has grown in her leadership capacity. Those two guys on the floor in
game situations have guided the ship. They've been the ones in charge. I think
when you watch us play I think you see we have as a group collectively sort of
picked up their personalities and we play in their way.  
I think all great leaders have the ability to do that, to infect the people
around them and to say, you know, follow me. I know where I'm going, follow
me.  
And it's really good news for myself and our coaching staff that those two
guys are sophomores and freshmen.  
  
Q. Coaches in college basketball, they seem to be the face, the constants
because the players revolve all the time. How mindful of that are you that
you're one of those faces out there? I asked Geno about it and he said with
your presidency of the coaches association and those sorts of things, you're
one of those people that's out there. But how mindful of that are you and how
important have you taken that role?  
COACH COALE: I don't really think about it a whole lot at times like this. I
think about it more so when I'm wearing the WBCA hat and going from group to
group and doing those type of things than when I'm coaching my team.  
Because when you're coaching your team it's sort of your safe haven and it's
your grungy sweats, if you will, where you are really who you are and immersed
in that thing that you love to do. So it comes naturally.  
I think we have a responsibility, though. And I feel so incredibly indebted to
the amazing mentors in my conference that I was able to come in and learn the
game from in terms of what are my responsibilities as a professional.  
You go from high school to coaching college ball and you know everything that
happens in between those lines. But the big wide world that's beyond that
court is a different deal. And I didn't know much about it. And I had to learn
and I was lucky, because I had Marcia Sharp and Jody Conrad and Phil Berry
(phonetic) to learn from, and the list goes on. Bill Finley. I could go down
the list.  
But our league, I think, really gave me a leg up and taught me that we have a
responsibility that extends far beyond our program and our institution. It is
to this game.  
And I feel fortunate and take that responsibility very seriously. At the same
time, there are lots of faces that are the sport of women's basketball, and I
feel unbelievably humbled to even be mentioned among those.  
  
Q. It's interesting, both you and Ashley when asked about Louisville being
the underdog were quick to say that it was them that think they're the
underdog. I'm curious, what's your take on the team?  
COACH COALE: I think they're really good, obviously. They play in the Big East
conference. You look at their schedule, and it goes W, W, W, W and you see a
loss. And then you see it goes W, W, W, and you see another loss and it's to
Connecticut. And these guys are really good. I don't think anybody that gets
here necessarily sees themselves as an underdog. Maybe once they arrive and
they look at the field.  
But you don't think like an underdog and earn your way to one of these. So
everybody has to -- is given a card or gets an opportunity to play a card and
that is whatever you choose it to be. I don't think it's much of a factor to
us.  
  
Q. Sherri, I was just curious, and I apologize if this has been asked
already. But you're here for a second time with the team. When you come back a
second time I know you have in your mind things I would do differently. What
are some of those things in terms of bringing a team here again that you do
differently the second time than the first experience?  
COACH COALE: Give all those ticket requests to somebody else on my staff and
let them deal with it. You know, as far as the team goes, honestly, we don't
have any idea what we were doing in 2002, we were just playing ball and loving
the journey together. That may be the secret. I don't know that I would change
a whole lot about what we did.  
We were who we had been the entire year. We enjoyed everything. We took
everything in. And then when it was time to go to practice we practiced. And
when it was time to watch film, we watched film. When it was time to play, we
played.  
In that regard I really didn't change much. I went back and looked at what did
we do in practice, how did we prepare, what were the schedules. Because you
know how we coaches are, we keep up with everything. So I go back and look at
it and say, Yeah, that's what we still do. Let's do it again.  
I think what you do has worked for a reason, so you need to stay with that and
feel very fortunate to have opportunity to go back and look at those old
notes.  
  
Q. Question and a half I have for you. Your trip to St. Louis earlier this
year, even though it's in a different gym, how beneficial do you think that
was? And also just your general thoughts about handicapping the field?  
COACH COALE: I think everybody has their motivational or preparatory
activities that they think puts them in a good spot to be able to achieve
their goals. And for us we thought it was important to try to get to the Final
Four city, to plant some seeds, to have the experience for a number of
reasons.  
And in 2002 we played in San Antonio earlier before we went to the
championship game there. So we had an opportunity. And I appreciate so much
St. Louis wanting to schedule that game and allowing us to be here.  
Different arena, but that wasn't really the issue. It was being in the city
and having an opportunity to talk about it. And I do think it has helped us.
Sort of crystallizes things and makes it a little bit more real for you.
Handicapping the field, obviously you just told me that the real game was the
second one, so I didn't know that until you told me. So thanks for the heads
up.  
We're going to go ahead and play six, if that's all right with everybody.
Louisville is really good. I talked about them plenty, probably. As far as the
other two go, Stanford plays so pretty. I love the way they play. They share
the ball. They're skilled. They compete. They just -- they understand the
game. And it's interesting, I heard some little sound bite in the very small
amount of time I've had to watch television over the last week or so, but I
heard Tara say that basketball is like ballet with a ball.  
When I watched them play, that's exactly -- it looks like a beautiful dance. I
think that's the way offensive basketball should look. I have a great
appreciation for the way they play. I don't think there's any program in
America that's tougher than Connecticut.  
I think their toughness is their ace. Are they skilled? Absolutely they're
skilled. Do they have a high basketball IQ? Absolutely they do. What separates
them from the rest of the world? Their toughness. Just mentally, physically,
emotionally, every way you can count it, they're tough. And they're not going
to go away.  
And so I think it's a great Final Four. I think it's a fan's paradise and I
think there will be two really good games on Sunday and another really good
one on Tuesday.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Pleased to have up here on the podium head coach Jeff Walz as
well as student-athletes Angel McCoughtry, Deseree' Byrd, and Candyce Bingham.  
Coach, when you're ready, an opening statement and then we'll take questions.  
COACH WALZ: We'd first like to thank everyone that's involved that's put this
wonderful event on. The hospitality that we've received since we arrived here
has just been outstanding. I know our players have enjoyed the experience to
this point and we're really looking forward for the opportunity of playing on
Sunday.  
It's a group of players from day one we had some goals, we put some things out
there in front of them and they've just continued to rise to the challenge day
after day. And to be able to say we're playing on the last weekend of
basketball is quite an accomplishment for all of these players, and I'm very
proud of them and excited to be able to say I'm their coach.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Angel, the comments you made about Kara Lawson the other night after the
game, just curious why you said what you said and what you think about it
looking back now?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I was very excited during the time and like I told her it
was all in fun and I was enjoying myself. And I wouldn't take back anything I
said because it was all in fun.  
  
Q. Angel, talk about this team this season and why you think this particular
team was the one that made it in terms of the program for the first time, the
program's history, to a Final Four, and was there a key point in time, a game
or a moment where you saw something happen that propelled this team to this
point?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I think it was just because this is our time. Truly this is
our season, we all believed it. We've been saying since last year we were
going to get to St. Louis. Everybody said it, and now we're here.  
  
Q. Angel and Candyce, Coach Walz has been here for two years and now you're
in the Final Four. And I'm kind of curious, what did he have to do for you
guys to accept him and believe in him and get you to play at the style you've
obviously learned to play?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: Well, we already knew he came from Maryland and won the
national championship. So that speaks -- that in itself tells us that he knows
what he's doing and can get us to the same spot.  
So he just came in and had us work hard and be disciplined and obviously it
helped. We're in the Final Four now?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: You know, it takes time when a new coach comes in to funnel
the program in what he wants us to do. But we all believed it. That's why I
think we're so successful within two years.  
  
Q. Candyce, talk about when you were growing up you saw the program not get
a whole lot of publicity, play for less than a thousand people; now you're at
the Final Four and you're on the national networks. What's it like and what's
it like to be here for someone from Louisville who grew up watching the
program?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: Again, I never thought this would happen. But, I mean, it's
history again. And it's an amazing feeling to be a part of this. Because I
think no one ever thought that this program could rise to -- get to this
point. And we've proven that we could. So it's an amazing feeling.  
  
Q. Candyce, talk a little bit about the Paris twins, defending them.  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: They're great players. Courtney Paris, four-time All-
American. That in itself speaks -- that speaks for itself.  
But they're great rebounders, great players, and we're going to have to come
out and make sure we're boxing them out and just follow the game plan.  
  
Q. Angel, can you talk about how you've changed personally since you came to
Louisville, kind of how you've developed and if your teammates could talk
about that, too.  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: When I first came to Louisville I was younger, and if you
don't mature in four years something's wrong with you. I've matured, and I'm a
woman now.  
DESEREE' BYRD: Being here just two years playing with Angel, last year coming
in I was obviously recruited by Louisville, but watching the game she had a
kind of attitude problem.  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: A little bit true (laughter).  
DESEREE' BYRD: She had an attitude problem. With Coach Walz coming in he got
on her enough and he kept it real with her. He's an honest man and whether you
like it or not he's going to tell you. And he basically told her. I think it's
been -- it's just watching my knees go up -- I've been here two years with
Angel, just watching the change, seeing the attitude problem to just it's just
an inspiration to many people around the world. It's respectable (laughter).  
  
Q. Angel, how are the nerves holding up? It's a big week. Deseree' and
Candyce, what makes Angel so good?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: Well, I'm very relaxed right now. This is a business trip;
we're not here for a lot of fun. So we're ready to play.  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: Just her dedication and her competitiveness. I mean, Angel's
always wanting to win, always in the gym, wanting to get better. I think it's
her dedication and competitiveness. And it's rubbed off on the rest of us.  
DESEREE' BYRD: What Candyce said, her work ethic running up the court. Trying
to keep everybody up. We are the sisterhood, and she try to keep us together
as a sisterhood. She try to do things. On the court, she ain't always happy
with what we do on the court, and she yells that, that's because she wants to
be the best and she wants this team to be the best, and off the court she try
to do things to keep us together.  
  
Q. Angel, because of your stature, awards and accolades and people have been
talking about Candyce the past couple of weeks, can you talk about the rest of
the parts like we talked last week and how everybody else has stepped up in
the NCAA tournament when you struggled a little bit shooting a couple of games
and everybody else has really stepped up?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: Well, I have to say for Des, Deseree' Byrd, she played a
tremendous game against Maryland, and Becky Burke stepped up a lot. And that's
what you need, for the girls to step forward a little bit if you're
struggling. And Des put the team on her shoulders. She said, I got you all.
That's the type of attitude she play with, like, I've got the team. And it
really worked and I'm just proud of everybody stepping up. And if one of us
are having a bad shooting night, then we know it's okay because somebody else
is going to step up.  
  
Q. There's a perception that your semifinal game is for second place because
UConn has handled both of your teams. How do you feel about that?  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: I mean, yeah, they beat us. But it's a new day. If we do get
to that game, it will be another game and we're going to approach it like
another game.  
DESEREE' BYRD: Like she said, yeah, they beat us, any given day. Third time's
a charm. I'm not saying anything. But, you know, like I told some other
people, we've been playing as the underdogs all year and now there's four.  
And we're one of those four. So like Angel said, this is a business trip and
we're on a mission and we're here to handle our business.  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: We better get past this round first. We're focusing on
Oklahoma. We need to do that and we'll see what we've got in the next round,
once we try to get past Oklahoma.  
  
Q. I know you guys just mentioned doubters. Is that something that you have
had something, do you want people maybe in a sense to keep doubting you guys
because it only makes you want to prove them wrong even more?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I mean, of course. If you watch the commercial, the
commercial strictly says Oklahoma is on a mission to win a championship, but
Louisville is trying to fool with that. We're trying to win a national
championship too. It's even in the commercials. So for God's sakes, I mean, I
don't know what else we have to do to get some type of respect to say they're
good, too, they can win on any given day just like the other teams can.  
But, hey, I think that does fuel our fire.  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: It's okay, they can keep doubting us. We love it.  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: Watch the commercial tonight, you'll see it.  
  
Q. Can you talk to me about, there's been a lot of talk about this is the
first time you've ever been to the Final Four but now actually getting here I
know you still haven't played that first game. But can you talk about actually
being here now?  
DESEREE' BYRD: It's an amazing feeling. I never ever in a million years
thought I would be here. I couldn't ask for a better group of girls to be here
with and coaching staff to be here with. We bust our butts all year and, like
I said, we're on a mission. And that's all I'm going to say.  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: Again, we're excited to be here but this is a business trip.
And we don't want to get too caught up in all the hype or whatever. So we're
going to go out and practice hard and try to win a game tomorrow.  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I'm not on cloud nine anymore. So, like I said, it's a
business trip. I'm ready to play.  
  
Q. Angel, are you at all curious about once we get past this weekend how
you're going to be evaluated by the WNBA, whether you're going to be the first
pick and how your life is going to change at this point next week? Do you
spend any time thinking about it? Do you daydream about it, anything like
that?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: Right now this comes first. This is what we have to take
care of right now. But like I told people, I'm going to go where I'm wanted to
play, where I'm needed to help the team and to help the program win a WNBA
championship. So whether it's for No. 1 or 20, wherever I'm needed, that's
where I'm going to go.  
  
Q. Angel, why do you think you guys haven't received more respect?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I guess because we're the newcomers on the block. We don't
have as much tradition as the other schools. But I still feel like we can
still -- we've played hard to the point we need to earn a little bit of
respect.  
We've had the hardest road to the Final Four. We've had to play LSU. All of
the other squads basically played at home. Especially when California,
Oklahoma was at home. UConn was at home. We were at LSU somewhere with the
alligators.  
So we had the hardest road here and I think that's why it's so special right
now. I think this is our season. I truly believe we can take it all the way.  
  
Q. For any of the players. You've got national media here, what should the
world know about your coach? Tell me about the job he's done and what he's
like away from these cameras.  
DESEREE' BYRD: He's a hard-working man. Like I said, he's going to keep it
honest with you, whether he thinks you'll like it or not. Because he's not
here only to make us better players but he's here to make us better people.  
I think once everybody believes in him, then everybody is willing to make a
change. I mean, it took me a long time to really believe it. And I do. And I
appreciate him. He's one of my fathers and I really look to Coach Walz as a
father figure.  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: He's one that's done a lot for us. And he really cares about
us. His first year he took us to the Big East championship. This is only his
second year and we're in the Final Four. Enough said.  
CANDYCE BINGHAM: Again, he's brutally honest, but I think that's a good thing,
because some people don't like that. But in the end I think you do pay
attention to it. And so, I mean, he's a great guy.  
I mean, he wants us to be great players, but, like Des said, be good people.
So I'm glad that he's been here.  
  
Q. Do you or does the coach have any superstitions that you do or not do
before your game?  
ANGEL MCCOUGHTRY: I don't really have a lot of superstitions as far as
basketball. I just go out there and play. But I do have one superstition:
Never split the pole. I don't like that. As far as that's said, no.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Have you ever coached or seen a team that kind of came together the way
this one did with so many different players who originally were going
somewhere else and then came together and did it present any particular
challenges?  
COACH WALZ: No, actually. This is the first time that I've worked with a group
of players that four of them I think had signed out of high school with
different schools, but they all ended up at the same place.  
And they even talk about it, just fate. Angel at the time with St. John's,
Chauntise Wright I think at the time with Seton Hall, Candyce Bingham played
two years at Xavier. We just had some players that came together and found a
common ground, and they've been great to coach.  
They're right, I'm honest with them. Sometimes they like it. Sometimes they
don't. But at least, like I tell them, I sleep well at night because I tell
them exactly how I'm feeling. If they're doing well, I tell them they're doing
well. If not, I tell them they're not.  
So they really learned my philosophy of coaching, and I've gotten to know all
of them. So I don't coach each player the same way. But we're fair with all of
them. So it's been a great two years and looking forward to many more.  
  
Q. Did you see the commercial that Angel's referring to and what did you
think when you first saw it?  
COACH WALZ: You know what, the one thing I love about her is she'll just say
the truth. She just speaks from the heart and some people don't understand
her.  
But, yeah, it's not a big deal. They take the schools that they thought were
going to have a chance to make a run for the Final Four and those coaches say
their spiel, and we're the one that we weren't supposed to be here.  
So they weren't prepared for it. Which is okay. And it's understandable. When
it comes down to playing, the commercials and all that stuff, it's not going
to make a difference either way. It's whoever shows up and plays the best. And
at this time of the year a bounce here, bounce there, a call here, call there,
can make a difference of if you're going home or if you're advancing.  
  
Q. What concerns you most about Oklahoma and how do you defend Courtney
Paris?  
COACH WALZ: It's probably easier if I said what doesn't concern me. Because
there's about one thing that doesn't concern me. I mean, there's a bunch of
things that concern me. I mean, the way Danielle Robinson has been playing at
the point. She's been outstanding. Whitney Hand has been shooting the ball
lights out. Then you've got the Paris sisters inside.  
They've just got a very good team. Sherri's done a great job of putting
players around the twins. And it's going to be a challenge for us. We're going
to have to come out here tomorrow night and defend well and rebound.  
If you look at Courtney Paris's stats, I think she's made 219 shots and she's
got 203 offensive boards. It's an unbelievable stat when you look at it. For a
kid to rebound the ball as well as she does at the offensive end we've got to
make sure we've got a body on her and sacrificing someone so she can't get
offensive boards.  
  
Q. Your experience with the Final Four a couple years ago, how does that
help you now?  
COACH WALZ: I think it's helped with the fact that at least I've been able to
share with the players what to expect each day. When it comes to when we get
here, what to expect when we get to the hotel, our practice the other day off
site and then we come here today, you know we've got practice and an autograph
session afterwards.  
Just the small things. Just trying to get them to understand the routine to
make sure we don't get too caught up in what's going on, but at the same time
I want them to enjoy every second of it.  
It's something you don't want to take for granted. We've got two great seniors
here that I want to make sure that they remember the entire trip. So we're
soaking it in. They're having fun, but when it comes to prepare and practice
they're focused. I've been pleased with things. So I expect us to come out
tomorrow night and play hard.  
  
Q. When you went home the night you got the job, if you were being honest
with yourself, what did you think your time line might be? What were your
expectations about how long this job might take you to get this program where
you wanted it to be?  
COACH WALZ: You know, when I took the job, I knew they had some players. Angel
McCoughtry, I've watched her play in high school. And Chauntise Wright. So I
knew those two kids before I even took the job. And once I got on campus and
had a chance at doing about four days of workouts before we were actually
finished with school, I was able to see that they had some talent, especially
with the way we wanted to play.  
We don't -- Keshia Hines has done a nice job for us in the post, especially
with Chauntise out. We don't have a true post player, per se, but the way we
like to play by trying to press and making it an up-tempo game and scoring off
of turnovers, our length and athleticism plays well into that.  
So if I'm to tell you we expected to be here when I took the job in two years,
I'd tell you I was lying. But we knew we had some players and I told them when
I took the job that once you get to the Sweet 16 I really believe anybody can
win. It's just the best team might not win. It's the team that plays the best
that day.  
And we've been playing some really good basketball the past three weeks.  
  
Q. Just talk about this full game round, I don't think you would term
Angel's play as vintage Angel because she hasn't shot the ball very well at
all. A, do you think at some point she's sitting on a big game, and then, B,
what does that say about everybody else?  
COACH WALZ: You're exactly right. I don't think Angel's had a superb four
games. Now, she's played solid. She'll get her 23 points. She gets her 12, 13
boards, three or four steals. But she hasn't had the games that we're used to
seeing.  
And it's exciting for me. It's exciting for our staff to see the rest of our
young kids stepping up the way Monique Reid played in our regional games, the
way Becky Burke has been playing. We've really relied on everyone on this
team. And we've got three solid players each night with these three that were
just up here.  
I've told them, we need two more. And I don't care which two, because they all
get a chance throughout the game and Keshia Hines has been playing well and
Monique Reid and Becky Burke have been playing solid for us. Actually we've
been getting three of them to show up. If we can continue to do that, plus
we've got to get some minutes from Gwen, that we'll have a chance to compete.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what kind of -- your brutal honest it took to get
Angel where you wanted her, kind of more than talking about her attitude and
all that, what you had to do to get her where she is now?  
COACH WALZ: She's a great kid. She's fun to coach. You never know what's going
to come out of her mouth. You know, she's great. Now, when she competes, she
wants to win. And sometimes, you know, she'll show some disgust at a call,
disgust at some teammates.  
And we just took some game film, our assistant, Steph Norman, just went
through and we pulled out about seven minutes of game film from the previous
year before we got there of her reacting to her teammates, to calls. And it
wasn't hard. It's simple. You can sit there and tell someone they're doing
something wrong but until you show them, they really don't buy into it.  
And then as soon as we showed her on film, she was upset. She was like, I
can't believe I do that. So she's gotten better. Now, she's still got some
room to grow, but from where she was before we got here to where she is now,
it says a lot about her character.  
  
Q. You mentioned this a little bit earlier, maybe, but just how good has
Candyce been? Angel gets so much attention, and rightfully so, but what kind
of a player is she, person, and how good has she been this year?  
COACH WALZ: She's been a rock. Angel gets a lot of the press. It's very
thorough. Because she's a fantastic player but Candyce is the one that every
night I know what I'm going to get. We don't have to run a bunch of plays for
her. She just understands the game. She's in the right place at the right
time. She goes hard. She can defend in the post on the perimeter for us.  
She means as much to this program as Angel does. So without her we wouldn't be
where we are right now and I tell her that every day.  
  
Q. I know this is putting the cart before the horse, but did you spend any
time thinking about if you win this game, UConn, the next step?  
COACH WALZ: You know, I think we did a great job. I mean, because obviously if
we play them they're way overconfident. When you lose by a 38 and 28, which we
planned that. So, I mean, it was good coaching on my part. It's not easy to
do.  
You know, we're going to come out here. And it's like I tell them. You can --
it's one game and that's what it's going to take. We're going to have to come
out here tomorrow night and beat a very good Oklahoma team to even have a
chance to play the next game.  
And if we can come out here and do that, then we'll worry about that tomorrow
night after the game. And then, hey, you never know what can happen. If we can
get to that game and if UConn can get to that game, then we'll throw it up on
Tuesday night and see what happens.  
  
Q. Going back to Courtney Paris, have you in doing all your scouting seen
anybody defend her in a way that you think you might try to defend her and
what is your defensive plan there?  
COACH WALZ: Well, we're going to have to throw a lot of players at her. She's
so strong and does a great job of getting position. And Keshia Hines, our post
player that comes off the bench, probably is our best match-up with her, and
that's still not a great one.  
So we'll have to go small at times. We'll have to throw the entire team at
her. We just don't have enough fouls in the post, I don't think, to be able to
just send one at her and try to stop her.  
So it's going to be something where we'll clog up and try and make it
difficult for her to score. But at the same time I'm just as concerned about
Whitney Hand and the way Danielle Robinson gets to the basket.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2009&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 4, 2009

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Renee Montgomery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18485)

### [Maya Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19726)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Pleased to be joined up here at the podium by Connecticut head
coach Gene Auriemma and Maya Moore and Renee Montgomery.  
Again, once we have an opening statement from Coach we'll take questions for
the student-athletes.  
COACH AURIEMMA: The same thing I say all the time, whether it's at the
regionals or at the Final Four, game time never gets here fast enough. There's
a million things you have to do and I obviously know they have to be done. But
I know I speak for the players. I wish game day was today, but it's not. We're
anxious to play. We're obviously thrilled to be here.  
I don't think that we're surprised that we're here. This was something that
these kids have worked really hard for. And as I tell them every day in
practice, there's only four teams left. And they're all really, really good.
So I would expect nothing but great games on Sunday.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For either or both of you, can you talk about the matchup with Stanford,
where you feel like your biggest strengths are and maybe where their strengths
lie?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: For Stanford, I think their biggest strength, of course, is
their post game. I think Jayne Appel has really made herself a dominant post
presence throughout the season, and she's just left it up to other teams to
have to try to stop her. And I also think they have a perimeter to go along
with that post game. But I'll say that's definitely one of their strengths.  
As far as us, our strength is running the floor, making it a full-court game
instead of a half-court offense and defense. I think our strength will just be
to push the ball as much as possible.  
MAYA MOORE: I agree, just as far as our strength being -- we like to go. We
like to run. And that's just definitely one of our -- mostly our style of
play. They're a disciplined team. They're going to force us to play their
style of basketball. They're patient with their offense and they get the shot
that they want. So we're just going to have to do our best to try to just
disrupt their offensive flow as much as possible.  
  
Q. Maya and then Renee, anything that you learned from last year's matchup
in the semifinal that could help you Sunday?  
MAYA MOORE: Just how much those little things matter. And the Final Four, all
the things that you work on throughout the year. When your coaches are harping
on getting the little things right. I think this year we definitely took it to
heart a little more.  
And so hopefully we've taken care of a lot of those little things and we'll be
able to execute tomorrow.  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I think we learned that it really is a team concept that
everybody has to work at the same level and you can't let someone work at
their own pace or, you know -- I think that we learned that everyone is
accountable 1 through 13 on our team.  
And that's something that we didn't have last year that we definitely have
this year, that no matter how many minutes you play, everyone on the team
feels they have a role on the team that they have to do every day for us to be
successful.  
And I think that's the main thing, that everybody comes every day ready to do
their role and do the best they can.  
  
Q. Both Maya and Renee, what did last year's game as far as losing, did that
in any way teach you how to be ready not to lose tomorrow night?  
MAYA MOORE: I don't think we ever play not to lose. I think we always play to
win the game. But I think losing last year did teach us a lot of things about
better ways to win, a better way to execute the game or what we did wrong.  
I think we came and we didn't play our style of play. We let them play how
they wanted to play and we didn't play how we wanted to play. So I think it
just taught us how to win more, per se, than to not play how to lose.  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I agree. I don't think you can win championships being
afraid that you're going to lose. And maybe last year, I don't know, our team
maybe was playing with that a little bit. I don't think we came into that game
as confident as we would have liked to have been. And this year we're not
going to play tentative. I think this is win or go home, so we're going to
leave it all out on the court this year.  
But we definitely know through Coach and his experience just telling us that
you can't be on the court being afraid to lose. You have to go out there and
just being excited and competitive to win.  
  
Q. Renee, Maya, did you notice anything about Stanford's court presence last
year, were they more poised, more disciplined than a lot of the teams you
played last year? Obviously had a Hall of Fame coach, very experienced. Was
their demeanor on the court different or more impressive than some of the
other teams you dealt with last year?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I would definitely say yes. I think the main thing about
them is they never take a shot that they don't want to take. They go down on
offense and they keep on working the ball around until the right people shoot
the ball, where they should be shooting it.  
I think a lot of teams sometimes might have players that just take errant
shots that aren't supposed to be shooting it from the 3-point line and they
just shoot it because they're open. But I think Stanford does a really good
job of making sure that people they want to shoot the ball are shooting it
where they like to shoot it. And that's what makes them so tough, because they
have enough patience to wait until they get the right shot that they want.  
  
Q. I'm struck listening to these questions about the loss last year.
Everybody loses sometimes, and yet it seems like there's a different standard,
a loss in any game is different for y'all than it is for any other team. Is
that a pain in the buns or is that the way you want it to be?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I don't think it's a pain, because I think you know that
going into Connecticut. I think it's just -- they said along the years that we
didn't make it to the Final Four that was unbelievable to our fans and to just
the community, because they set such a high standard and we knew that coming
in. So it's not like we can come here and think, My goodness, we didn't expect
this. But we kind of knew it coming in, but it's also good because when you
have high standards I think you reach a higher potential.  
So I don't really see it as a pain; I think of it more as a motivation to work
harder.  
MAYA MOORE: When you come to Connecticut you know the culture of Connecticut
basketball because of the success has been set at a really high level. And
when we go out, our goal every time we step out on the court is to go out. And
if we're going to lose on the scoreboard, it's because another team has just
outplayed us and beaten us.  
And most of the time when we're on the court we feel like when we play no team
should be able to beat us when we're at our best. So that's just kind of the
expectation that we have as a team, that we're not just going to give anyone a
game. So when we do feel like that happens, that's devastating to us. And just
the type of practices that we have throughout the whole year, consistency,
intensity, it just makes it so hard when you lose. So hopefully something we
won't have to experience.  
  
Q. Do you guys have a sense of how you will play in a late-game situation if
it's close? I mean, you've won just by simply obviously a lot of the year, if
this is a two-possession game with 30 seconds left, whatever, are you
confident that it's not something that you guys have experienced a lot this
year?  
MAYA MOORE: We always have to be confident. I think that's something that's
separated our team this whole year. We came in thinking we can make the next
play, get the next run, hit the next best shot. It's one of the situations you
can't get caught up in the situation; just trust your instincts. And I trust
my teammates. And that's when you find out the character of your team. I feel
we've got good chemistry this year and we feel confident in each other to
finish and make big plays. And if it comes down to it, we're not going to be
afraid to make a big play.  
  
Q. Renee, at this point on the eve of the semifinal you've had Coach give
you the scouting report so you know your opponent pretty well. Do you think
anybody at Stanford can actually stop you?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: That's a tough question. I think they're going to find ways.
I know they're going to know all our weaknesses. They're going to pretty much
try to play against that to make us do things we're uncomfortable with.  
I'm sure they're going to try to slow us down, do some three-quarters. I know
they're not going to have everybody crashing the boards like they did before.
I know they'll do things to hinder us from playing the best basketball we can
play.  
But in that sense I think they will. They do have a Hall of Fame coach and I'm
sure she's going to come up with something. But as far as -- I think we'll
still be able to execute a certain extent to our game plan, might not be
exactly how we want to go, but I still think even if, for instance, me or Maya
don't score a point, I have confidence in my teammates that they'll be ready
to step up in the big moment.  
  
Q. Renee, you mentioned Jayne Appel. What have you or the team told Tina
that she has to do to counter Jayne's play?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I personally haven't talked to her yet about it. I don't
think I need to. I think she knows that this is a great matchup for her as far
as dominant post players. They both were up there today for the All-American
awards. So they both I'm sure have a certain level of respect for each other.  
I think she needs to be aggressive. I think any time when she comes out there
and she's aggressive on offense and defense she plays really well against
other top post players. And I've seen her play against some of the best ones,
Courtney Paris and Kia Vaughn. I've seen her play against them. I know she's
capable. I would tell her personally I've seen her do it before, so let's have
it two more games.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, both.  
Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Two-part question on Tina Charles. I know you've said in the past you
needed to push her. At what point did the light go on for her and, secondly,
how much more room does she have to grow as a player?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't think Tina's any more different than a whole bunch of
players I've had at Connecticut. I think players like Maya Moore, Renee
Montgomery, Diana Taurasi, they're different. Everybody else is pretty much in
the same boat. They all come to college and they all think they're pretty
good. They all think they're working hard. Then they get some numbers that
make them feel like, hey, I'm pretty good.  
They get some awards that remind them that I'm pretty good. And my job is to
remind them it's not good enough. And with some players you can't do that,
because it may be all there is. That's all they have in the tank.  
But with Tina, I've seen Tina in high school. I've seen her in AAU. I've seen
her in college do some things that lead you to believe that somewhere inside
there there's the potential to be the best player in the country.  
But Tina may not see that. And as long as Tina doesn't see that herself, then
it was a struggle. So the biggest challenge that I had was how to make her see
it, that inside of you is the best player in the country, the best center in
America.  
Has the light gone on? Yeah, I'm sure it has. I'm sure it has. But in coaching
you always gotta have your hand ready to put it on the switch because it could
go out at any time, and you have to keep turning the light on for her
sometimes, as you do for any player except the two that are up here.  
So I think Tina's going to play great this weekend.  
  
Q. The biggest deficit you faced all year was eight points. That was still
in the first half. Do you have any remaining anxiety if it's a close game
tomorrow night how your team is going to respond?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I have anxieties about a lot of things. You spend a lot of
time in Philly. You can't go up there without having anxieties about
everything.  
I worry about lots of things. I don't worry about what the score's going to be
with five minutes left or three minutes left or 30 seconds left. I don't worry
about that. I figure if we're in the game and there's three minutes left and
we have a chance to win, we're going to win.  
I spent -- I bet you I spent more time worrying about the other 37 minutes and
how to get us to that point. I think we've got -- I'm confident because I've
seen it. I've seen Renee Montgomery and Maya Moore make plays in the last
minute of games last year in practice.  
If you told me there's 30 seconds left and we need a 3 to win the game, I'd
dare you to pick anybody in this tournament that you would want shooting the
ball other than Renee Montgomery and Maya Moore. So I feel pretty good about
that.  
  
Q. First, if you win tomorrow are you going to petition the Pac-10 to get a
share of their title? And also is there a feel that this is kind of like the
championship game tomorrow night since you've already beaten Louisville twice
and Oklahoma once, although it was earlier in the year, this game kind of has
a little more of that championship feel to it?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, I've heard people say that. But it's not. The
championship game is Tuesday night. So I don't want to make tomorrow night's
game the championship game because I don't want to -- if you lose the game you
lost the national championship. So in that respect it's the national
championship game, because if you lose you're done. The national championship
is over for you. But I don't want to be in a position where if we win the game
our guys think we just won the national championship, now the next game's
going to be easy.  
There's no comparison between the Louisville team we played in the regular
season and the Big East tournament and the team that's here today. And there's
certainly no comparison between the Oklahoma team we played earlier in the
season and the team that's here today.  
So tomorrow we've got our hands full with Stanford. No question about it. But
I'm sure you'll ask Tara all these questions. They've got their hands full
with us. Sometimes that gets overlooked. I think your point about is it a pain
in the ass to constantly have to -- I say this all the time to our writers up
in Connecticut. At Connecticut the only story is if we lose. If we win, it's
not a story. It's not a big deal. That story's already been written 100 times.  
The only thing people -- it's like coming to see the gladiators, you know? You
know who is going to slaughter who but you go there, and the only way it's
going to be a big story is if we were to lose somehow, some way.  
And it's a tough way to go through life. But, believe me, I wouldn't want to
be in any other situation.  
  
Q. How do you keep your undefeated team focused on the goal?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I'm a really mean person (laughter). So I went to Catholic
school all my life. And they scared me into doing things the right way all the
time. So I scare them every day that if they don't do it the right way all the
time -- but today you can't use the ruler. You can't take your belt off and
slap them. You can't do any of those things that we were fortunate to have. So
the kids are missing out on a great learning experience (laughter).  
So I just go to practice every day and don't talk about our record, don't talk
about our ranking, don't talk about how good we are. I just keep trying to
find things that we have to get better at. And by constantly looking at those
things we constantly find things that can make us a better team. And that's
kind of the goal every day is become a better team. Not remain undefeated.  
  
Q. Renee talked a bit about Stanford making you uncomfortable. Are they
particularly good at that? Is Tara in terms of game planning particularly good
at making you feel uncomfortable and doing things you don't want to do?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think sometimes too much attention is placed on who is
coaching what team. I'm a lot better coach when I have really good players.
And Tara is a really good coach when they've got really good players. But as a
coach you can only do so many things.  
When we played them in St. Thomas last year, the score at one time was 60 to
36. And then we played them here and they scored 80-some on us. So Tara became
a really good coach in a couple of months and I became an awful coach in those
couple of months.  
When in reality what happens is you have a style of play and you're committed
to it. And if you are committed to that style of play and you're disciplined
enough and you do it, regardless, then you have to trust your players.  
Tara's style of play that they've used throughout the season works great for
the players they have and it's the perfect system for them to play. And
they're committed to it and the players are committed to it and they execute
it flawlessly.  
If they're allowed to do that tomorrow night, they will win. So it's as simple
as that.  
  
Q. Coach, when you were in the Norman High gym recruiting Stacy Hansmeyer
and perhaps Sarah Dimson, I don't know if you recruited her, but what was it
about Sherri that made you an advocate of hers, that sort of made you think
this woman has a future in the college game if she wants it?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I said this on one of the teleconferences I was on. I was
really fortunate growing up where I grew up to be surrounded by a basketball
culture of great coaches, high school, college. I don't think any place in
America has had more good coaches than Philadelphia, where coaching became the
reason why you went. And sometimes to a fault. Like they think they invented
the game, they were in the room with Naismith when the game was put together.  
But I've always had a pretty good eye for what makes somebody good, I think.
So when I walked in that gym and I saw the way their practices were
structured, the way the people moved from one thing to another, the attention
that was being paid to certain details of the game and the way she
communicated with her players and the way they responded to her, to me it was
the same thing that I was doing at the college level. And it's being done in a
high school gym in Norman, Oklahoma.  
So if you can do it there, the gym at Oklahoma is the same size, the court is,
the players are going to do the same things, and you're going to do it with
just better players.  
So there was no doubt in my mind that with her communication skills and her
organizational skills that she would be successful at Oklahoma. Never any
doubt. When I spoke to her associate AD I told her that.  
  
Q. Was that Marita?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah.  
  
Q. I know the story of Jayne Appel's recruiting trip has been talked about a
lot. Can you revisit that one more time, her visit to Storrs?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, any time you're recruiting a kid from California, you
know, you're taking a huge risk to get somebody to travel 3,000 miles to go to
college when there's so many good alternatives on the West Coast and then
you've got to fly over a lot of good alternatives to get to our place.  
But you don't count on snow and ice and all that other good stuff waiting for
you when you get there. And you certainly, when you're having shoot-around the
day of the game, don't expect to see security guards and police come in and
lead your recruit, telling you that we've got a problem. And you realize that
her father's in the hospital going to have screws into his ankle because he
broke it getting into your building. That's not the winning edge, I don't
think. Except we showed off that we have good doctors.  
But even if that hadn't happened, how could you pass up a chance to go to
Stanford if you're a West Coast kid and they really want you bad? It's a risk
that we take and sometimes we win and sometimes we lose. And I thought
wherever Jayne went she was going to be what she is today.  
Because people think recruiting is difficult. It's not that difficult. You
watch kids play AU when they're 16 and the ones that beat the hell out of all
the other 16-year-olds end up doing it when they're 18, 19, and 20. That's
what she did when she was in high school and that's what she's doing now. I
wish she was just doing it for us.  
  
Q. What did you see as having went wrong last year against Stanford and what
has to change this time?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, to beat Stanford you have to have good guards and a lot
of them. And when we were in St. Thomas, we had really good guards and we had
a lot of them. Then when we got out here, we had good guards but we were minus
two of them.  
So we couldn't play the way we wanted to play. We had to play the way they
wanted to play. And you can't let somebody play to their strengths. And we
did. And they played to their strengths better than we played to our
strengths.  
And they made shots that they had to make when they had to make them. And I
thought the game was lost at about the 10-minute mark in the second half, when
we cut it to 1 and I made a couple of mistakes in that game. That was one of
them.  
We had gone from man-to-man to a zone, and they didn't score for three and a
half minutes, and that's how we cut it to 1. And my gut instinct told me as
we're going down the floor, down 1, we need to get out of this because they're
going to figure it out. And I didn't change it. I didn't communicate well
enough with my players. So Wiggins runs out to the corner and gets a 3. We
come down and miss, and now I'm pissed. And I don't get out of it again and
son of a gun makes another 3.  
And now we get out of it, we're scrambling and then Pedersen makes a 3. So in
that stretch the game ended right there and we didn't respond, we didn't
recover. What are you going to do, you know? We could have made those same
mistakes and they miss those shots and we win the game, who knows. But the key
is Stanford won the game. I don't think we lost a game last year.  
  
Q. If you were playing to their strengths, what would you --  
COACH AURIEMMA: Their strengths, I think they're very organized offensively,
they're very patient, very deliberate, very thorough. And they're really good.  
Everybody talks about who we have. I'm not going to run down the whole roster
for Stanford because I'm not familiar with it 1 through 13, but I guarantee
you that most of the players that they put on the floor tomorrow were high
school All-Americans or some version of it.  
So they've got talent. They've got a great center. They shoot the ball well.
They handle it well. That's why they're in the Final Four.  
  
Q. A lot has been said, maybe on the West Coast more, I don't know, about
Stanford's -- over the past decade, if you will, Stanford's talent but
softness, not being a tough team. It was something they really tried to
overcome last year. How do you look now that you've had a chance to pay
attention and scout this particular team? How would you describe it as being a
tough team or maybe not? We know you guys are a tough team.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, we're a tough team. I know this is going to get played
out the wrong way. But I'm going to say it anyway. And I know I'm going to get
criticized for this. White kids are always looked upon as being soft. So
Stanford's got tremendous amount of really good players who for whatever
reason, because they don't look like Tina Charles or Maya Moore, the
perception out there is going to be, well, they must be soft.  
Well, I think that's a bunch of bull. I watched them play and nobody goes
harder to the boards. Nobody takes more charges. Nobody runs the floor as
hard. Those kids are as tough as any of the kids in the country. But people on
the sports world like to make judgments on people by how they look. And it's
grossly unfair.  
I had somebody say, well, you know, Stanford's really disciplined, as if to
say we're not. You know, it's just the perceptions out there that people make.
And, yet, you don't get here to play in these games if you're not tough, if
you're not disciplined, if you're not talented, and you don't do all the
little things that good players do.  
So those West Coast people, you know what, the West Coast in general has a
reputation of being soft. But that's to the East Coast people, you know? And
it's probably true. Because we live in New York and Philadelphia and places
like that and we walk down the street going: What are you looking at? People
on the West Coast go: Hi, how are you doing? So, yeah, they are a bunch of
pansies (laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Pleased to be joined up here on the podium by Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer as well as student-athletes Jayne Appel and Kayla
Pedersen.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Thank you, Amy. We're really excited to be here. Our team
has worked, I think, very hard all season long, and we've improved a lot.  
And we're very excited to have an opportunity to play in the Final Four and to
play Connecticut. We have our work cut out for ourselves, but we're confident
we'll do a good job.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kayla, I know I've asked you this already, and I apologize, but I'm going
to ask it again anyway. Can you talk about how you view this year's team's
toughness, especially now that you're going against a team that's purported to
be, perhaps, the toughest in the country?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I think that defines our team right now, especially with those
big losses at the beginning of the year. I think we really got after it and
worked hard and everybody adjusted to their new roles.  
And I think that takes a lot of mental toughness, more than physical. And I
think that we're running the floor better. We're stronger. Just in every
aspect of the game I just think we're more cohesive and tough together.  
  
Q. Jayne, you guys have won pretty decisively in the last few weeks, do you
have any sense if in a late-game situation, if it's to, say, a two-possession
game late in the game, how you guys are going to react?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think that even though the scores might have seemed like they
were big games for us, we felt they were close the entire game, especially for
us, Ohio State, we felt it was an extremely close game the entire time.  
So I think we'll have confidence if that situation were to come up against
Connecticut.  
  
Q. Jayne, could you just talk about the success that you have had
individually during this tournament as well as your matchup with Tina Charles
tomorrow night?  
JAYNE APPEL: I couldn't take any credit, really, for my individual success
without my teammates. It takes all five of us on the court and really all 12
of us on our team in order for me to achieve what I have so far this season.  
They push me every day in practice. Sarah Boothe has become one of my -- we
all dread guarding her in practice because she has elbows that just go
everywhere. So I give all the credit to my teammates.  
And in terms of the matchup with Tina Charles, I think she's a great post
player. We definitely have our work cut out for us, and it will definitely be
a team effort in stopping her and their other great players.  
  
Q. Jayne, do you still have the promise with your coach that she has to get
a tattoo this year if you guys go?  
JAYNE APPEL: Yes, we do. We decided -- we don't know what it's going to be
yet. We decided it's going to be on her foot. That's as far as we've gotten.  
  
Q. Going against a tough team like UConn, how do you mentally prepare to win
this game as well as balance being student-athletes?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think we have to go and play with confidence is one thing and
come out and not be timid and be able to try and react to runs they're going
to make.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I didn't bring any of my books with me here because I wanted
to focus on the Final Four. But, yeah, we just started a new quarter so we're
not really worried about academics right now. So we're just totally mentally
focused.  
JAYNE APPEL: We did have to finish finals last regionals so that was pretty
tough.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: But we're mentally ready to go.  
  
Q. Jayne, I'll ask you this. For fans or for outsiders they see this rematch
as kind of a dÃ©jÃ  vu for obvious reasons. But talking to Connecticut players,
they didn't put necessarily a whole lot of focus on that, even though a lot of
people are returning. What's it like for you guys?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think we feel the same way. I feel like both teams are
extremely different in the -- not only the style of play but the players who
have a big impact on the team.  
Last year we relied a lot on Candice to do a lot for us and they had a
different starting lineup as well. Definitely I agree with them in the sense
that they were two different teams taking the floor, so it's not so much a big
rematch as it is just the names matching up again.  
  
Q. Do you have any stories about some of your early battles with Tina over
the years in AAU?  
JAYNE APPEL: On the court? I mean, we've battled it out every summer. We've
played AU basketball actually -- Melanie Murphy on our team was her teammate
when they played for the Gazelles, I believe. So I always give Mel a hard
time. They had this whole Gazelle chant they used to do. So we've played since
seventh grade against each other. So she's one of my great friends off the
court, but on the court we're going to battle it out.  
  
Q. Kayla, there's a perception that Connecticut's strength is in its
transition. Most of the teams that have played them have marveled at how fast
they get up and down the floor. How would you classify Stanford as a
transition team, and do you think you can keep pace with them?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I think that one of the things we take pride in is our ability
to run. And I don't think a lot of those people give us credit for that. But
that's our game. We run the floor. No other post can run like Jayne can.  
So it will definitely be a fast-paced game.  
  
Q. Jayne and Kayla, you talk about UConn being on a mission since they lost
to you guys last year in the Final Four. Just talk about the mission that
you're on, too, as a team this year after losing in the title game last
year.  
JAYNE APPEL: I think it's the same motivation that we want to get back to
where we were and get to where we're knocking on the door of happening. It was
so close last year and playing in the championship game. But we had a lot of
work to do in the off season. We've really changed.  
Even Coach has told us if I were to take a bet from the beginning of the year
to now on how much improvement we've made and how much of a different team we
are in just one year, starting from the beginning to now, it's a dramatic
difference. So I think we've definitely worked really hard to get to this
point so far.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Yeah, I mean, everybody remembers what it felt like to lose to
Tennessee last year. I think that makes us really hungry and we don't want to
be in that same position; at the same time, we're not content just being here.
We're here to play to win. And we've been here before. So that's our next
step. We want to get the whole thing now.  
  
Q. Jayne and Kayla, I realize Wiggins is gone and UConn has also lost their
seniors, but is there confidence to be gained as to how the matchup against
the existing players played out in Final Four and how you guys were able to
play Maya and Renee and Tina Charles?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Yeah, we have -- I know JJ's not here for us and Candice isn't
here. But us two are playing, Jill, Jeanette, we had crucial roles in the last
game, same as their players.  
So it is a similar matchup but not totally the same.  
JAYNE APPEL: I think there's the experience that both teams gained last year.
I know I think the first time anyone comes to a Final Four it's a whirlwind of
a weekend. I was more nervous for the open practice than I was for the actual
game.  
So I think that this year it will be I think for both teams, you know, a lot
more, okay, we're here to play a game instead of it's great, we're at the
Final Four, it's always fun activities going on. But I think it's more focus
and get down to business.  
  
Q. Jayne and Kayla, how is this a different experience than it was last
year, maybe from the moment you guys won that Iowa State game to sort of
getting back here?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think it was more of an expectation rather than some goal that
we hadn't achieved yet. I know Candace worked extremely hard during her four
years to get to that point.  
So I think this year we have the mindset we weren't going to be happy unless
we got here and had a chance to compete in the Final Four.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I think last year like after winning the Maryland game I was
ecstatic because nobody thought we'd ever get to the Final Four. But after the
Iowa State game we were all excited. But from the very beginning of the year
that's what we knew we wanted to do and we were capable of it. So it really
was expected.  
  
Q. How is the preparation and the emotion different going into a game where
you're the underdog rather than the favorite?  
JAYNE APPEL: We were the underdog all last year. And I don't really think we
really take that into account, we prepared exactly the same way. Our coaches
provided us with hours of film, scouting reports that have everything on it
that you could imagine.  
So I think that we go into the same preparation mode, the same energy amount
that we have with the past games. That's why we do it against the teams every
year or every game during the season, so we can know how to prepare for a team
in a game of that stature.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Yeah, I think if we were the No. 1 seed or the 16 seed we'd
still act the same way. We get the same amount of scouting reports on every
single team, handle every team the same way, pregame ritual is the same.  
So there's nothing really that much more special about being an underdog or
about on top of the world. So we just handle everything the same way. We just
want to play. It doesn't really matter what position we're in; we're just
going to play.  
  
Q. Jayne, can you tell us -- I'm sure you've told the story many times since
you've been back from Storrs, but what was that trip like for you and how did
your dad survive that trip on the way back?  
JAYNE APPEL: He's walking now. No, but it was a great trip. There's a bunch of
schools back East. It ended up the whole plan of the trip was to see Tennessee
play Connecticut in Connecticut. And we were walking the shoot-around, and
being from California my entire life and my dad grew up in Redondo Beach, he
slipped on black ice. I didn't even know it existed. He dislocated and
fractured his ankle when we were outside of shoot-arounds. He had to watch the
game I think it was about less than five miles from the hospital and I got to
go to the game and watch it. He was kind of mad he had to miss the game. He
stayed a few extra days and had surgery. He's fine now.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
JAYNE APPEL: UConn is a tremendous program. They put a lot of energy into
recruiting me, and I went through their entire process. I think it just came
down to me wanting to play with my friends and family and Stanford was the
perfect fit for me and I couldn't be happier with where I am.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Tara, could you just comment on the evolution of Jayne's season this
year? I think she started the year coming off shoulder and knee surgery and
has she not only played her way into shape but into the best basketball of her
career?  
COACH VANDERVEER: She had shoulder surgery last spring, was out for six
months. And she made the commitment that she was going to come back in great
shape. Last year for us she had to play basically 39 minutes a game and we
were watching last year's semifinal game and just the announcers repeatedly
talked about how gassed she was, how tired she was. She was actually sick when
she was here, too.  
But she said, you know, the funny thing about that, she said, I thought I was
in shape. And she really made a commitment in the off-season to really improve
her conditioning. She changed her eating, eating more nutritionally and she's
much fitter this year.  
And unfortunately right in the beginning of our practices, right in the
beginning of September, the beginning of October, rather, she had to have her
knee scoped. So she was out with her knee surgery a little bit. So she was
upset about that. But she has come back.  
She's really the focal point of our offense. We go inside to Jayne and we let
things happen through her. And she's a great passer. She's an incredibly
unselfish and smart player. And just depending upon how teams play her, then
she'll go with the flow. If she's doubled, she passes. If she's singed she'll
work on taking her move. She'll rebound. She plays defense.  
She's had some real extreme games. Like she's get six points in some games and
46 in another game. But she's the same person either way.  
  
Q. In late-game situations, I know you've said there were a couple of games
that felt more uncomfortable than maybe the scoreboard indicated they were.
But if this is a tight game, if this is a two-possession game with a few
minutes left, do you feel good about where your team is?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, probably as a coach you're probably more
comfortable if you're up 20 with a few minutes to go or one minute to go. But
I think Jayne said it, the Ohio State game was a close game. Came down it was
a four-point game. Maybe with three minutes to go.  
And this is what we work on every day in practice. We might not have that many
close games. But I don't think Connecticut does either. We have been in close
games with really great teams. And I think we've learned what to do and also
what not to do.  
So who knows. A lot of it comes down you have to make free throws. You have to
make maybe adjustments. But I feel confident that our players know what we
need them to do and will do it whether it's a 2- or 20-point game.  
  
Q. Could you comment on the development of Jeanette Pohlen, how she's
assumed the role of point guard and how her off-season helped prepare her for
that?  
COACH VANDERVEER: That's a great question. Honestly, we would not be here
today without Jeanette making the same decision that Jayne made in the off-
season to really maximize her potential.  
You know, a lot of players think you become a player during the season and
practicing with your team, and in fact it's just the opposite. And I think
that since the NCAA in some ways has the 20-hour rule they feel like we're
done with practice, we're done. And Jeanette, not only in the off-season in
the spring, but she changed what she eats. She eats much healthier and
nutritionally-sound food.  
She has improved her conditioning tremendously, worked on her skills, her
3-point shooting and ball handling and she was going to play for us no matter
who else came back. So she was either going to play the 1, 2 or 3 for us and
she was going to be out there.  
It just so happened that the 1 spot was the one that was really open. And she
has embraced it. And she's doing a great job running our team.  
  
Q. Coach Geno and his girls talked about how they wanted to really run and
run and run and how you all would try to slow the pace down a little bit. And
it sounded like your players maybe wanted to take on the challenge a little
bit. And you've mentioned your conditioning and that's obviously a real key
role in that. But whether or not how successful you are at slowing it down a
little bit, a game's that got that much transitioning and that much running a
lot of times can turn on not necessarily the starters but your bench. Tell me
a little bit about your depth and how prepared you think you might be for a
game where you are going to be having to run a lot of people in and out
because of the pace.  
COACH VANDERVEER: You never know what is really going to happen tomorrow. But
our team likes to play up-tempo. We like to run. And obviously Connecticut
does, too. We'll play people sparingly.  
So I'm not going to just substitute you go in, you go in, you go in, but if
Jayne needs an extra minute, we'll put Sarah Boothe in. If Jill needs it,
we'll bring in Rosalyn Gold-Onwude.  
We've played three people off the bench the most, Lindy La Rocque, Rosalyn
Gold-Onwude and Sarah Boothe. But Melanie Murphy can go right in. She's doing
really well. And we could play Michelle Harrison. I feel confident going 10
deep in limited minutes. But that's all depending upon the situation. And I
look out there and we have to run the floor with Connecticut. You have to do
some things and that's one of the things that's at the top of the list.  
  
Q. Could you look back seven, eight years ago and talk about the
differences, not just in the sport itself, but the Final Four experience and
everything that goes around this event?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Seven or eight years ago we weren't here. We had been here
and probably noticed a difference last year so much because it's just that
much bigger. There's so much more coverage. There's so many more things going
on. The arena's full. I mean, it's a great experience for -- it's always been
a great experience. But now it's just that much -- there's much more exposure
for women's basketball, and you see it at the Final Four.  
  
Q. I was wondering, Geno was talking a little bit about before Tina and it
seems like Jayne as well, they're two of the most imposing centers in the
country, but they're also just like such nice kids, like he picks on Tina
sometimes and says like carry yourself, but they're both such nice kids but
they're both All-Americans today.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I would include Courtney Paris. She's, of course, quite an
imposing center also. You know, these are women that are -- they're really
comfortable with themselves and who they are, and you can just tell being
around them that they love the game of basketball. But Jayne was wearing heels
like that big last night. I got on a chair to take a picture with her.  
And that's just -- I think that just points towards, I don't know, the
changes, the progressive changes that have come with women being in sports,
how they're very comfortable being out there battling and being aggressive and
being physical and then being off the court, painting their nails, and they're
kids.  
Sometimes we forget how young they are and kind of the things that make them
laugh. But they are really outstanding young student-athletes, and as you said
I think especially the three that are here in this tournament, the three
centers, are phenomenal centers. And how often do you get three that good
coming through the same time?  
  
Q. How would you sum up the senior season Jillian has had?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Thanks for coming down for the tournament. It's great.
Jill's had a phenomenal senior year, and I think a lot of it -- I know she was
Player of the Year in Oregon two times and led the state in scoring.  
She's really expanded her game. She was more of a post player in high school.
She's a 2 guard on our team right now. Her ball handling, her shooting. But I
think she's just had an outstanding senior year because of her summer with the
New Zealand Olympic team. That experience really kind of broadened her horizon
in terms of understanding how people play, how hard they work at the game, how
big it is internationally.  
And I think it's really helped her confidence a lot. But I'm going to really
miss Jill and to know I could only coach her for two more games makes me
really sad.  
  
Q. I know you haven't coached an undefeated team in college but you had the
experience with the U.S. team a couple years back. Could you talk what the
pressure is like of having to coach a team that doesn't lose or hasn't lost
and just what you've seen? I'm sure you've seen a lot of Connecticut this
year, not on film. What's it like and the pressure that as a coach to try to
get a team motivated every game and also the pressure of not having lost?  
COACH VANDERVEER: My hat's off to Geno and his staff and the great year that
Connecticut's having. I don't know. It makes me nervous. In some ways, you
know, with us, we've learned a lot from losing. And you remember we lost some
games early on. Or we even lost a game in the Pac-10.  
And when you lose, it reminds you how much you hate to lose. And it really --
I think it helps us refocus. So he handles it well. And he's coached national
championship teams that have gone undefeated and obviously they have great
talent.  
I was very nervous when we had the Olympic team and we kept winning and kept
winning, and I wondered are there things we're not doing, are there things
that we should be doing better?  
But, again, they're having a great year, and he seems to be very comfortable
with it. Maybe we'll be in that situation some day and I could answer the
question better.  
  
Q. What advice would you give to a young player who would want to play for a
team like Stanford?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Great question. First of all, I think that in order to play
at the collegiate level, Division I or Division II and Division III, you
really have to have discipline.  
And you have to be disciplined in your studies and disciplined in your
workouts. And really challenge yourself to use your time wisely. And that's
the thing that I see with our student-athletes, is that they really manage
their time well.  
They might have time for a little like maybe video game, but not a lot. And
they really manage their time well. They study. They are able to prioritize
their studying and their workouts. But that would be the best advice is be
very disciplined.  
  
Q. I know your answer to this is that's a stupid question. Do you expect to
win tomorrow?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I don't know that I ever expect to win. In any
game that we go into, I don't expect to win. I feel that our team has to do
the right things in order to earn the right to win. So I never go into a game
expecting to win.  
I anticipate we try to work really hard to prepare our team to do everything
possible to be in a situation to be successful. But I don't expect to win any
games.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could comment on the unique challenges facing the
freshmen players on your team, being that they weren't with you when your team
made this run last year, and also, if I may, the contributions you expect them
to have in tomorrow's game, particularly from Nnemkadi Ogwumike?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Nnemkadi was here, not playing, but she was here watching
last year because she was here with the WBCA High School All-Americans and in
fact played in the game that is going on this afternoon. But it is new for
them, and we are counting on them to do the things they've been doing for us
all year in Nnemkadi Ogwumike's situation: start the game, defend well,
rebound well and take care of the ball and play and contribute.  
And we don't have time for freshmanitis or jitters, whatever, it's one game,
40 minutes. We're also expecting great contributions from Sarah Boothe and
Lindy La Rocque. Those three freshmen have performed very well for us all
year, and we're hoping and expecting the same.  
  
Q. One, either Joanne or Charlie talk to you at all after playing UConn in
Trenton?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I've spoken with both, yes.  
  
Q. And second one is, did playing UConn last year early in the season and
getting your butt kicked help you prepare for seeing them in the Final Four;
that you've already played them once and had some idea what they brought and
knew what you had to do better as opposed to this year where you haven't
played them at all?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think last year's loss to them early helped us a lot. And
I thank them for us being in the Final Four because without playing them I
don't know that I could have gotten our team's attention in terms of how hard
we had to practice, the pace that we had to play at.  
Connecticut does a phenomenal job of just the pace they play at. They have
great athletes, and their coaches and players have played at the highest
level, and that's how they play.  
And our team learned a lot from the Virgin Islands loss. I think a lot of
players remember that, and they also remember last year. So we have the
benefit of knowing if we don't do the right thing what it could be in terms of
the bad side, and then knowing if we do the right thing what it could be on
the good side.  
So I don't know that it does -- the other two teams have played Connecticut.
We haven't. But we played them as close to last year -- as close to in this
year as you could.  
  
Q. How does the team feel different today than it did a week ago today?  
COACH VANDERVEER: A week ago we had just -- today's Saturday. We hadn't played
yet. So we were getting ready for Ohio State. And it was kind of the first
game of two games obviously at the regional.  
Honestly, I feel the same way. You want to come in and win two games. Our team
has been on this trip, like I think Jayne alluded to it a little bit -- our
team has been very business-like on this trip.  
I see just like really good focus on what we're working on, whether it's
video. And I think it's great that our team has finished finals. Last week at
this time people were kind of tired and they had been doing their finals this
week. They're well rested. They've taken care of their finals.  
They're very locked into our scouting report and doing the things we need to
do to be successful against UConn. And having been here and having played
them, I get a sense of calm. I mean, we know they're a great team.  
We know what they like to do. Everyone knows what they like to do. But our
team likes the challenge of saying, well, we're going to play our game. And
they're excited about it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Oklahoma Â– 74  
Purdue - 68

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Courtney Paris and Danielle Robinson and Coach
Coale. Coach?  
COACH COALE: Thank you. Proud of our kids, our second-half effort, the
resiliency, their refusal to go away. I challenged them at halftime, 22 points
in the first half, that means we better have 55 in the second, darned if we
didn't have 52, we got close.  
Defensively I thought we were really good all night long against a team that's
difficult to defend, and even though we missed quite a few in the first half,
we made the ones that mattered in the second, and we were terrific from the
free-throw line. And somebody will ask about those turnovers, we had 11 and
that's good for us.  
  
Q. Courtney and Danielle, talk about the first half when you could have
gotten frustrated because shots weren't falling for you and how you kept it
together and regrouped in the second half.  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think whenever shots aren't falling, that's the biggest
issue in a situation, and we knew we could come back second half and finish
plays and that's what we did.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: We knew we weren't shooting particularly well, but we were
playing great defense and points came from the foul line, so if we stopped
fouling, things would change.  
  
Q. Courtney, you played a complete game. Was it just the kind of desperation
to keep this season going?  
COURTNEY PARIS: Yeah. I'm a senior, I don't get another chance. It's the Final
Four. You want to make sure you give everything you can and leave everything
out on the court no matter if you're struggling or not.  
  
Q. Courtney, what's it mean to go to the Final Four?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I'm happy, I finally get to go with these guys, so it will be
a lot of fun. It's been a long four years, but it makes it all worth it. I'm
not surprised.  
I think we got here the way we've been playing and that's together. And just
having fun out on the court. At no time were we up 20 points, but it felt like
it, and I think that's the most important thing for us.  
  
Q. Courtney, there was a point when you made a pass to Ashley and she got a
3-point play. They had just cut the lead down to 4. How big of a play do you
think that was to answer that 3? They had come out of a time-out and got a
good shot and scored.  
COURTNEY PARIS: I thought it was a huge play. They kept trying to double with
the other post player so Ashley would be wide open. And I knew they were
helping with the guard, so she was able to get that shot off and draw the
foul. It was great for our momentum.  
  
Q. Danielle, Coach Coale talked about yesterday how during the off season
and during practices you bring a notebook and write down what you did wrong
and what you can work on to get better. Talk about that dedication and how
it's led to you tonight making the points and keying your team to go to the
Final Four.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: The Coach does such a great job with all of us, making sure
that we're getting better every day, and that's what makes the program
special, is buying into the system and that we do it together.  
  
Q. Danielle, seemed like your motor was running a little fast at the first
half, and I would assume the halftime the Coach talked to you about slowing it
down.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: She talked about not being surprised that I was open.
Malone was guarding, but then she would let up and I was surprised that the
room was there and I was open.  
So she said really just focus on the target and be a point guard. There was
only 20 minutes left in the game and we had to adjust.  
  
Q. Courtney, that's about as animated as I've seen in you a game,
celebrating during the game. Is that as animated as you've been, the magnitude
of the game tonight?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think we were having fun, and we weren't up by 30 or 20,
didn't have the game blown away, but it felt like it. We were playing as a
team and it's fun when you do that.  
  
Q. Courtney, could you talk about that run in the second half where y'all
ended up with the great defensive pressure to control the game, and it looked
like Danielle and Whitney were a big part of that run.  
COURTNEY PARIS: Definitely. We tried to go inside and get some shots and we
got a lot of little fouls and adjusted to it.  
And Whitney came out and knocked down that three off one of those magic plays
that Coach Coale has, and D-Rob hit some shots and got to the rim so fast. I
don't know, I'm just happy we have that one.  
  
Q. Courtney, what was the crowd like tonight and how much of a different did
it make for you guys?  
COURTNEY PARIS: It's amazing and I don't think they realize that. The other
team, when you were at the free-throw line and our crowd is going crazy and
that energy and they're looking and saying it's not just them you're playing
against, you're playing against all these people, too. So that manager was
amazing.  
But they're back there backing us up and keeping us going. I think we have
some of the best fans in the nation and I hope they stay like that.  
  
Q. Courtney, would you talk about your defense, you had six blocks, talk
about going up against the big players and being able to go head-to-head.  
COURTNEY PARIS: Lindsay is really good, I've had the opportunity to play
against her in USA basketball and she moves well off the dribble and has a
nice jump shot. I thought our "scout" was good and we were able to make a few
plays.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, good luck at the Final Four. Thank you.  
  
Q. Sherri, during this era of the Paris twins, there have been frustration
in some ways, Courtney was just named All-American, the first time a player
has done that, talk about the difference at this point, getting to the Final
Four a year in the making and the dedication that has gone into it at this
point, especially with the twins as seniors.  
COACH COALE: Sometimes it's going through the valley that makes standing on
the mountain top worth it. It hasn't been easy, hasn't been easy for any of
us. You have to earn your way, though.  
I think particularly at the close of last season guys had to make a
commitment, you know, either we're going to commit and do this thing, or we're
going to end up disappointed. And I think a lot of our commitment began with
Ashley's commitment to her physical body. And Danielle's commitment to
improving her perimeter shooting. And A.T. being in the gym.  
And you can't discount the addition of Whitney Hand and the spirit and the
life that she infuses us with, not to mention a good stroke from behind the
arc. So it's a lot of things and very rewarding.  
I wish I could think -- I'm still too emotional from what went on, but there
is a great quote by Tony Dungy that I have on the side of my computer that
talks about how being tough makes it worth it when you get there. "Quiet
Strength", that's the name of his book.  
  
Q. Sherri, when you hit the two 3-pointers, you guys were clicking, talk
about that.  
COACH COALE: I've said a number of times, true freshman. When she hits a
three, we feel like we're invincible, and that opened the flood gates because
at that point she hit the three, we ran a play for Danielle to get to the rim,
and turned around, ran a play for the post and then went back to Whitney and
she hit the three from the top of the key. It was huge and it opens up
everything and changes the flavor and complexion of everything.  
  
Q. Coach, Courtney said she felt like you guys were up by 20 the whole game,
I didn't get that impression.  
COACH COALE: I don't remember feeling that way.  
  
Q. I didn't think so. How tough was that game in general? The expectation to
win with all the fans here, was the pressure as much as maybe you've ever
felt?  
COACH COALE: No, didn't feel a single bit of that. Honestly, Purdue was good
and I didn't say anything about that in my opening comments, and I sure should
have. What a well-coached basketball team.  
Every time in the second half that we had a chance to put them away, they came
down and made an incredibly difficult shot. Possession after possession after
possession we could not stretch seven. We got it to nine once, I think, and we
could not stretch, five, seven, five, seven, and that's because they came down
and made big plays.  
They're confident, tough, and well coached and down the stretch they did
exactly what they had to do. They were fantastic from the free-throw line, 31
of 34, goodness, we need to quit fouling people, don't we?  
  
Q. Coach, would you talk about halftime. Were there a the lot of
adjustments, a little bit, could you not wait to get there to get to some
things?  
COACH COALE: Well, sometimes you don't like to see halftime comein' because
you're on a roll and you don't want to stop the rhythm, and sometimes when you
don't have any, you can't wait for it to get there so you can stop and
regroup. I felt like it was one of those.  
I think of Barry Switzer a lot when I go into the locker room, and he is one
of the most revered coaches in college coaching history, and he has a Super
Bowl ring, but aside from that, if you're not careful, you can convince your
team into thinking they can't win.  
And I remember that we played against Cal Berkeley, and tonight when I walked
into the locker room I knew there were a couple of adjustments we needed to
make offensively. I thought we were guardin' the heck out of 'em, they had 12
free-throws in the first half, and that's how they got to 27, so we were
really guardin' them.  
I thought it was the most important thing I could do was to convince our kids
that we could win, and that's what I spent my time talking about not much
strategy, we called a couple of plays to start the second half, told 'em to
continue to do what they were doing defensively, but spent most of my time
trying to infuse them with confidence and get them to believe that we could
win.  
  
Q. Sherri, congratulations. Comment on Amanda Thompson's contributions
tonight. She gave you guys minutes tonight.  
COACH COALE: Thank you for asking about her, and I told my team in the locker
room before we had our team prayer, "How about Amanda being ready when it was
her turn?" She handled this injury with grace and stayed engaged.  
We ran two new sets that we put in for just in the tournament in the last few
days, and she hadn't had an opportunity to do them because we've been limiting
all of her reps.  
We put her in to make the pass and she's just been watching it, and she went
in and threaded the needle and hit the exact pass. No jumper probably bigger
than her contested jumper that she made on the wing when we were making our
run. She plays with no fear. I said all year we get our toughness from A.T.
and she gave it to us when we needed it most.  
  
Q. Sherri, against Georgia Tech you were tied at halftime and not good on
offense, and after the game you said you were more annoyed than worried, was
it the same way tonight? Or were you more worried than annoyed?  
COACH COALE: I don't remember ever being worried, seriously, concerned, maybe?
Not worried. And I wasn't annoyed at halftime, not at all. I felt like we were
playing too fast. We would foul and then come down and try to make up for
fouling really fast.  
Everything was too fast, D-Rob's penetration was too fast, Whitney's three's
were too fast, finishes were too fast, no one caught it before they shot it, I
thought that was trying too hard. You don't get annoyed with kids for trying
too hard, you get annoyed when they're not playing hard. We were playing hard,
we just needed to calm down a little bit.  
  
Q. Would you talk about Courtney getting to this point? I know it's been the
one thing missing for her.  
COACH COALE: First of all, let me just say that it may be the one thing
missing, but winning a National Championship isn't the whole deal. I just left
a sea of players out there who gave us their guts for four years and didn't
get to go to the Final Four and didn't get to play for a National
Championship, who had wildly successful careers at the University of Oklahoma.
And they had experiences that have fueled them and make them some of the best
people on the planet.  
I think it's awesome that Court and Ash and Carolyn Winchester get to end
their careers with a trip to the Final Four, and I hope it gives us the
opportunity to hoist a National Championship trophy, but it's about so much
more than that in collegiate athletics.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about your two young guards stepin' up in a big way in the
second half. They played like seasoned veterans.  
COACH COALE: Whitney and Danielle have been fabulous and our team has taken on
their personality, their demeanor. Whitney, when I took her out, started
yelling immediately, "I'm going to make the next shot." It was the cutest
thing I've ever seen.  
She is 18 years of age and she started screaming at me, "I will make the next
shot ,"and I said, "I believe you, but you can rest for a bit now." She is
just wide-eyed and Jasmine and her think this is what you do, you practice and
go to the Final Four, this is what you do. That's neat, you have that mixed in
with the older guys who know what a climb it is and how hard it is and it's
been a nice combination.  
Danielle Robinson is the engine, there is no doubt about it. She runs the
game, manages the game, gives us our energy, gives us our confidence, give us
life. I can't say enough about the way she managed the game on both ends of
the floor in the second half. I thought she was fantastic, confident, tough,
resilient, all of those things that you want your point guard to be.  
  
Q. Nice hat. You came out before the game standing in front of the bench and
it looked like you looked around and you had this look on your face like "I
really can't believe this crowd." Do you remember that moment?   
COACH COALE: Yeah, I wanted to make sure that I took it all in. These things
are special and you can get so zeroed in that you can miss some of the neatest
stuff.  
I probably knew a lot of those people way up high that I couldn't quite see,
and I wanted to take it in because I knew as soon as they began to announce
starters, I wouldn't think about a single soul, it would be about what
happened between the lines. So I wanted to take a moment and make sure I never
forgot.  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, Coach, best of luck at the Final Four.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Oklahoma Â– 74  
Purdue - 68

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Purdue Boilermakers, Coach Versyp, our
two student athletes, Lindsey Wisdom-Hylton and Danielle Campbell. Coach?  
COACH VERSYP: I thought it was an incredible battle tonight. Oklahoma having
as many fans, hopefully they broke the record for how many fans you can have
at a regional, and the support that they have and how Oklahoma City has taken
care of all the teams.  
I want to thank all of them first and foremost for their hospitality, but a
very tough basketball game, came down to a lot of runs, they hit big shots,
were able to get some offensive boards and we knew that would be a little bit
of a problem.  
We came down and were knocking down shots and they kind of got that 4 to
6-point lead, we needed to get two stops in a row to turn the tide. We kept
battling, but in the end they won.  
I wish Sherri Coale and her team the best of luck in the Final Four. Most of
all I'm proud of our ladies, played very hard, never gave up. Obviously it's
an intense environment.  
I thought we didn't back down whatsoever and we can leave here holding our
heads high.  
  
Q. Lindsay, you guys were behind four points at the beginning of the second,
was that the critical moment?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I think they shut us down, they were able to come out
and run, and I think we put our heads down for a second and they were able to
get the lead and we started coming back and we couldn't quite get the couple
stops that we needed at the crucial times.  
  
Q. Lindsay, you guys talked all week about "us against the world" mentality,
was the crowd a factor or do you tune it out?   
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I feel like we tuned it out the best way we could. We
stayed well as a unit and communicated the best we could. It helps when you
have a crowd of this size, and I think the crowd helped them is what I think
was effective. But I think we were able to still tune them out.  
  
Q. Danielle, what was the feeling at halftime, up five? What did you think
you needed to do in the second half?  
DANIELLE CAMPBELL: Coming in the second half, we thought that we needed to
slow down the tempo and actually execute our plays. We were still up five, but
we weren't playing Purdue basketball, we weren't running sets and executing.
So that was the big thing we said we needed to work on in the second half.  
  
Q. Could you guys talk about what it's like to play against Courtney who
just seems to come at you, come at you and pretty powerful in the lane? Could
you talk about that?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: She's a great player. She got on the boards on us
early, and I think she was able to get us in foul trouble and that hurt us.  
She plays her game really well and she is very physical and it's tough to
defend her. That's what kinda hurt us, the boards early on with her play.  
DANIELLE CAMPBELL: Lindsay said it best, she's a great player and it's tough
to defend her and she did get us in foul trouble.  
  
Q. I know this is an emotional moment, but when you step back, can you
reflect, you guys got this far as a 6 seed, that's pretty amazing, wouldn't
you think?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: Yeah, it is, I think we're the 6th team ever to do
that, and I'm proud of what we've done. I feel like we could have taken it to
the next level, we just fell short.  
DANIELLE CAMPBELL: What Lindsay said. We played hard all this way, we left it
all on the floor, I'm just proud of our team.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on a great season. Thank you. First
question for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, just the ride they put you on these last few weeks and the
momentum they gave you and just everything they gave you this last month or
so.  
COACH VERSYP: This team has been amazing. You hope as coaches you get them
prepared to play in February and March, and we went through a lot of
adversity, handled them very well, really empowered our players. This group of
seniors have been amazing.  
That's what is so sad is now they're moving on to their next life, you know,
after basketball. I think the biggest thing is they totally believed.  
You always try to figure out -- everybody says how does the switch go on? And
a lot of that is confidence. You know, you can tell it, you can see the
swagger on the court, the shoulders are back and it's just a different
mentality.  
The mental imagery that we do, trying to keep it loose, all those things. This
ride has been phenomenal, I'm trying to get them to understand it's a journey,
it's a process, the end result isn't always great, but as you're enjoying the
process, that's what you learn the most and this team is one of the most
special I've ever been a part of.  
  
Q. They got a 7-point lead, you call time-out, you call a time-out, Brittany
hits the 3 and you get it down to 4 and then they come down and Courtney and
Ashley team up for another 3.  
COACH VERSYP: Our kids did a great job, every time I held up a card, they
executed and we scored. We knew we needed to get a stop and Lindsay was trying
to get them off the boards, but they're tall and they have long arms and have
an opportunity to get the boards.  
Didn't break our back because we're going to keep fighting back but, again,
you need to get stops and when we did we needed to make sure we scored and we
didn't maybe a couple of times in a row.  
At the end we weren't out of it, we kept going back and forth and still doing
good things, but we did fall short, obviously.  
  
Q. Coach, I wanted to ask you about those cards. I noticed that you were
flashing printed cards there with your plays on them. Is that because of the
size of the house and the noise?  
COACH VERSYP: It's not normal, but I think when you can -- you have hand
signals, but when people are running down the court, sometimes they're not
always paying attention and you're trying to figure that out.  
So when it started getting loud, I kept flipping the card and we scored every
single time. That was the biggest thing, it's kinda that confidence with them.
They knew exactly what they were going to run, they got into their spots and
they scored. It was effective. Obviously we didn't win, but it was a big part
of our success.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH VERSYP: No, I didn't run out of cards at all.  
  
Q. You came out at halftime, and the first three minutes you hung in there,
still up 7 and then five straight empty possessions. Do you see that as the
difference in the game right there? That's when they went on their run.  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, we had layups down low, didn't knock 'em down, you know,
and that sometimes is draining. But there were times when they didn't score in
the first half and that's why we had a 5-point lead, it just happened to be
the reverse in the second half.  
Theirs was 23% in the first half, ours was 30%, but they were able to do some
things, we were trying to execute, we needed to do that better.  
We were trying to go for the first option and then we got wrapped around it
and doing the things that we do well and that's when we started scoring.  
  
Q. You came into this game in the last three tournament games shooting well.
You picked it up late, but why was it a struggle for you to get that rhythm
early on?  
COACH VERSYP: I think both teams were playing great defense. They shot 30%, we
shot 23. They didn't allow a lot of three's, we didn't allow a lot of three's.
I thought it was a very defensive game.  
A lot of people didn't have good looks. The looks they had down low were
offensive boards and layups, but I thought it was a defensive battle that
first half.  
  
Q. Despite this loss, the runs you've made, it makes people have to
acknowledge that Purdue is among women's elite basketball?  
COACH VERSYP: Like we said before, we're the top-10 winningest team in the
country, 15 Sweet 16s, consecutive NCAA appearance, three consecutive Final
Fours, National Championship runner-up, and I think the stats speak for
themselves.  
The coaches before me and my staff has done a great job and we're trying to
keep with that tradition and being as successful as possible.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on a great season.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Coale, Whitney Hand is here, Courtney
Paris and Ashley Paris will be here in a few moments, Danielle Robinson and
Nyeshia Stevenson at the end. Coach your comments about last night?  
COACH COALE: Obviously very proud of our team, proud of our efforts.  
Excited to still be alive and to have an opportunity to face a very, very good
Purdue team tomorrow night in what we hope is a record crowd for women's
basketball in the state of Oklahoma.  
  
Q. Ashley, talk about being one win away from going to the Final Four.  
ASHLEY PARIS: It's amazing, and last night on the way to the media I was
talking to Danielle and Whitney about it. They just don't understand how hard
it's been since I've been here to get past the Sweet 16 and the feeling was
unreal. And for them it's like, "we're in the Elite 8" it's a huge deal, it's
amazing!  
  
Q. Whitney, your experience in all of this for the first time? What did you
take to heart from Ashley and Courtney?  
WHITNEY HAND: She told us that she was jealous of us last night as we were
walking up, because this is our first time and I mean this is incredible, it's
an incredible feat. There are eight teams left and we're one of the lucky few
that get to practice another day.  
We won and survived, and you can't take any day for granted because you don't
know how long you're going to be able to be here, so I'm just thankful to get
to play with them a little longer.  
  
Q. Ashley, following up on the first question, how much does it mean for you
to be an important part of it, the work you've put in in the off-season and to
have gotten to this point? What does it mean to you?  
ASHLEY PARIS: Personally it means a lot. Obviously to play for a National
Championship and win a National Championship is the dream I had when I was a
little girl, so to be this close to it is just amazing.  
Just being able to shed some weight in the off-season and working on my game
and my confidence, I feel like it's paid off for my team and I'm able to
contribute enough for us to be at this point, so it means a lot.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, Ashley and Whitney, what's the progress of getting better and
the focus you have to have to improve on what's already a good product?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: I would have to say focus on the little things, trying to
get to where we are now, focus on the things from November and focus now.
There is no trying to get better, you can get better anyway.  
ASHLEY PARIS: It's focussing on the little things and fine-tuning things. I
feel personally at this point it's more about how we are together and how we
act on the court and how we believe in each other. Just how we are together
trying to fight through this.  
WHITNEY HAND: Yeah, I mean, Coach always says there is no such thing as
insignificant bad or good days. And I think at this point every second
matters, every second that we're together as a team in the hotel and every
second we're out on the court as a group getting better, so I think they're
exactly right.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, your role has changed dramatically over the last three weeks,
first with the injury to Whitney and then the injury to Amanda. Talk about
shuffling in and out of the starting rotation.  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: It's been a little weird, it's not like I haven't played
this position. I just get to come out and do it a little earlier than usual.  
My teammates rely on me to step up and makeup for some of it, but I rely on
them also to help me and they've embraced me a lot in this role and I really
do appreciate them for that.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, Ashley and Whitney, last night you all played in front of 11,000
cheering fans. You will probably have more fans on Tuesday night. How much
does that help in a big-game environment like this?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: I think it means a lot. Our fans are awesome, and for them
to be here with us fighting the fight with us, knowing that we have one more
game just to get to the Final Four, it's awesome. And we really do appreciate
our fans and we love them as much as they love us.  
ASHLEY PARIS: I've always said it in general, I think we have some of the best
women's basketball fans. I think they would still show up even if we weren't
playing here. Walking out there and seeing 10,000 fans sitting cheering for
you, we're definitely spoiled, and I feel sorry for the other teams, really.  
I didn't know it makes a huge impact for us, but on the free-throw, one of the
girls was like, "we have to play against all of these fans, come on!" So they
do add to the game and it's so much fun to be here.  
WHITNEY HAND: I think it's a lot of fun. When you take visits to the school
and other conferences, they have 2,000, 3,000, you're like, this is all right,
it's girls' basketball, and at Oklahoma it's 12,000 people at every game.  
This is incredible, but it's not unique for us, we're used to playing in front
of this many people, because it doesn't matter if it's exhibitions or regional
finals, they're going to be here supporting us, that's what makes our fans so
special.  
  
Q. Whitney, for the thousandth time would you talk about dealing with your
finger? Does it hurt now? Do you change the way you catch the ball? Do you
think about it at this point?  
WHITNEY HAND: At this point no. I think when I first came back, I think I let
it affect me a little too much. I was weary, maybe, and we tried some things,
like putting padding on it, to the point that I couldn't dribble.  
And I think that I kind of overdid it maybe just being precautious, but right
now it's feeling great, I'm catching it normally, and it's not even really a
factor in my mind at this point.  
  
Q. Courtney and Ashley, when you guys decided to come to Oklahoma, it wasn't
too long after they had been in the National Championship game. Do you guys
recall watching that game in 2002? Had you thought about comparisons between
that team and this team?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I remember watching that game, but I had no idea I would be
coming to Oklahoma. Just thinking back on it, I'm glad to be in the position
we are now and hopefully we can get back there and do what they did.  
ASHLEY PARIS: Like Courtney said, I watched that game, but I never in my
wildest imagination did I ever think I would be here.  
I think what's similar between our team and their team, Coach talks about the
way they were together and the way they buckled down and got through it. I
feel like we feed off of that and learned from that, and obviously Coach has
been there and having her here to tell us how to do it is huge for us.  
  
Q. Courtney and Ashley, to follow up, was it the force of Sherri's
personality that got you here? It doesn't seem like it's a natural thing to go
from the Bay area to Norman. What was it about her that attracted you to come
here?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think there were a lot of factors in getting us to come
here. I loved the people that were here, the players and the whole staff.  
We were always watching the games, and I don't know who you guys were playing,
but this is when I was first sold as Coach Coale as a coach, and they were
beating somebody on the Big 12 and they were missing a ton of layups, and she
made a comment and I thought "I want to play for that coach."  
  
Q. Do you remember what it was?  
COURTNEY PARIS: It was just funny, it was funny but it -- they were winning,
but they were missing layups, but they were still playing well, and I can't
remember what it was exactly, but I just know I was like, okay.  
ASHLEY PARIS: I don't know what Courtney is talking about -- (Chuckles.) I
think just really more so than -- Coach Coale isn't the typical recruiter, she
is not going to tell you what you want to hear and all that great stuff.  
They're just honest and the people around them, and coming here, it's a family
atmosphere, I think that's what sold me. And I didn't know any of these girls
were coming when I first came here, but I had her faith in ability to put good
people around me and around the program.  
  
Q. Courtney, I wanted to ask you about Danielle. When did you see her
getting the confidence she is playing with now? Is there any way that you can
describe things that maybe people wouldn't see that shows why she is a better
point guard this year, maybe not in the box score, but how she leads you
guys?  
COURTNEY PARIS: Definitely, she came in from high school last year and had to
lead a team. That's a hard thing to do, in any position, let alone the point
guard position, and knowing what everybody else has to do.  
I know she has a lot of the little meetings, point guard meetings with Coach
Coale. (Chuckles.) I remember this summer her putting in time in the gym and
her confidence is the biggest thing. She is sure now and it's not just for
herself, but we look at her and she's okay, so we feel like, okay, we're okay.
So that's the huge thing.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think when we started preseason and practices we could see
the difference.  
  
Q. Courtney and Ashley, now that you guys have been here four years, talk
about how you've seen Coach Coale grow as a coach.  
COURTNEY PARIS: Could they get any taller? (Chuckles.) I don't know. I love
the way she deals with people and she knows how to read the situation. I love
what she's done with our point guards and building up D-Rob's confidence.  
I love our individual workouts and how she challenges people, and you could be
playing horrible and she tells you, "hey, here is what you need to do" and she
keeps you accountable and I love that.  
I don't know, I think of anything this year, I think this is for offensively
our assistants, but it may have been just me being younger, not believing that
things were going to work, but every single time this year we bring down a
scout, I'm like, "wow, I believe in this" and we just have to follow through
with the plan.  
ASHLEY PARIS: I don't know how she's grown, but I know that she has helped me
grow. Like Courtney said, she is able to adjust with you and help you with
just the next stage of your life and basketball in general.  
  
Q. Ashley and Danielle, talk about Purdue. Do they compare to any team that
you've played this year, whether in the Big 12 or nonconference?  
ASHLEY PARIS: I was talking to Courtney and another teammate about this, they
compare to like a Baylor, when Danielle Wilson was out there, they have the
Rayburn girl who comes off the bench and is able to contribute a lot, just
like Melissa Jones and a great post presence, athletic, good rebounders can
drive and play the high post and all around solid guards and obviously good
coaching.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Their point guard is quick, their shooters like to get out
and run behind her. Like Ashley talked about, they have a solid post presence
and two seniors that are leading them in the post and they play together. They
compete and play hard and that's what makes them so great and that's what got
'em here.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. Questions for the Coach?  
  
Q. Sherri, do you have a general job description for your point guard? How
does Danielle fit into that? Also, has that description changed?  
COACH COALE: The general job description is "everything is your fault ."
"Everything that goes wrong is your fault, fix it, make it right, you're in
charge."  
It's a big thing, because being a point guard is more than distributing the
basketball, it's more than getting your teammates in the proper place at the
proper time.  
It's a whole ball of intangibles that the really great ones possess, and it's
a way you walk and a look that you have on your face and a way in which you
communicate with others. You are the instiller of hope in your teammates.  
It is your responsibility to arrive at the gym with their best game in your
eyes. We talk about that in the most specific of ways, getting the ball to the
action, getting it below the free-throw line, being able to feed a post
player.  
The most specific things to the most general things, being the first one off
the floor to greet your teammates, all kinds of stuff. It's a big development,
leadership position and your work is never done. You can never get good enough
at it.  
  
Q. How does Danielle fit into that?  
COACH COALE: Gosh, I love the kid. If every kid were as coachable as Danielle
Robinson, you could do this until you're 99 years old. It's unbelievable, her
hunger and her sense of personal accountability, her willingness to take
things and learn from them.  
I always tell our guys the world is divided into two kinds of people,
learner's and nonlearner's, you either do or you don't and the learners get to
keep succeeding. Danielle Robinson is a learner, she'll make a list in her
notebook after practices, this is what I did well, this is what I need to do
better.  
And as a result of that, she is just a sophomore and one of the best point
guards in the country. And I'm excited to watch her because I don't think she
is near her ceiling yet.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the factors you think are prevalent in getting ready
for Purdue in such a short period of time? What's most important?  
COACH COALE: Well, I think maturity level is the first thing that I come to,
and that you have to be able to immediately switch gears and fine-tune your
focus and look at exactly at your opponent and what you need to do to win.  
At this stage in the game everybody is good. Everybody does a lot of things
that are difficult to defend and everybody give us problems on the other end
of the floor. What you have to do is decide what is that one or two -- maybe
those one or two areas where we can be successful, exploit something, take
advantage somewhere.  
And your players have to be mature enough to be able to grasp that and keep
that singular focus. It's not unlike some of the situations we've created for
our team throughout the year. We jumped on an opportunity to play a big Monday
game following a Saturday game for this very reason. So we could figure out
how to turn the page and go to the next opponent. Big 12 tournament puts in
you a position to have experience with this type of thing. It's not
necessarily out of the norm for our guys.  
  
Q. Sherri, Danielle has put together three really nice games in the NCAA
tournament, but probably what stands out for me is her assists and turnover
ratio, it's 2 to 1.  
COACH COALE: That is something that would make her grin from ear to ear, it's
a big deal for her and for me and obviously for us.  
What Danielle has done so well is she has played at the right speed, and it's
such an easy thing to say and everybody goes, "that makes sense ." It's a hard
thing to do unless you've been out there doing it, facing different types of
defenses. You don't understand what a big deal it is.  
Danielle plays at the speed she prefers to play at, not the speed that the
defense wants her to play at and that's all the difference in the world.  
  
Q. Sherri, maybe it's inevitable that I ask you this, but the only other
time you've been here is your run in 2002. Would you compare and contrast the
teams? How they approach the game and how they got to this point?  
COACH COALE: We got all the way to 2:04 before I got that one? I think that's
impressive. I think there are similarities because it's a hard thing to do.  
You don't get to this level unless you have leadership, unless you have
toughness, unless you have unity, unless you have chemistry. Those things, I
think, are consistent and you could probably look at the teams that remain in
this tournament and say they share some of those same qualities. Because I
don't think you can just get here by being good, that's not enough, you have
to have some special things.  
Other than that, there are lots of differences. There are differences in that
that 2002 team, we were scratching and clawing on the walls and saying -- it
makes me think of the gymnast who looked into the camera, you know, and said
"here I come, look out world."  
We were trying to get noticed, we were trying to get on the map, we were
trying to be for real. If you do this thing right, once you are for real and
you do get noticed, you're never in that position again.  
I was speaking earlier and talking about how much fun I had during my son's
high school basketball season this year, and they went into the playoffs and
they weren't supposed to win a game and they were "David" and everybody they
faced was the "Goliath ."  
And everybody they faced they were the underdog, and I had so much fun as a
mom. And I had forgotten how much it feels different, because we're always
supposed to win now, and this is where we're supposed to be. And I think it's
important that we remind our kids and our staff that it's a hard thing to do
and a special thing to do and we need to enjoy it.  
In that vein, I think the similarities are strong. These guys are really
enjoying their time together, here not finished playing basketball together.
That was the thing in 2002 when we sat in the locker room, we cried like
babies after the loss to Connecticut, but it wasn't because we lost, it was
because the journey was over.  
  
Q. Sherri, I wanted to ask you about Ashley. What was the genesis of her
deciding to get in better shape? Did she come and talk to you, did you talk to
her? How much of an impact do you think that had on the team in general to see
a player that had fairly good success kind of rededicate herself coming into
her last season?  
COACH COALE: It was a personal decision on her behalf. Doesn't matter how much
any of the rest of us had talked before or then or challenged or whatever you
want to say, it was a personal decision. And what followed that is the action.  
I tell our guys, sometimes if three frogs are sitin' on a log and one decides
to jump off, how many are still sitin' on the log? Still three, just because
you decided to do it doesn't mean you've done anything yet. And she did it,
and I thought it was incredibly inspirational to her teammates.  
Every time preseason got hard, they looked around and said if she can do that,
I can run the hill. The resonating affects go on and on and on, and when she
continues to keep it off and improve throughout the season, it deepens that
belief and that trust those guys have in each other. It's commitment, and
commitment is contagious.  
  
Q. Sherri, did you go to the Oklahoma games in the '89, '90 games when they
were averaging 69 fans, and when they dropped the program, did you raise hell
from your position? And what made you want to take the job, because Stacy Dale
said you recruited her saying you were going to win because somehow you knew
you were going to win.  
COACH COALE: First of all, my position, sitting at an English desk at Norman
High School, I'm not sure I had a lot of people's ear. I did go to some games
and I remember I went into the teacher's lounge to get my attendance sheets,
and some guy in the lounge said, "hey, did you hear what happened? They just
dropped the OU women's basketball program."  
And I said, "no, they didn't." And he said, "yeah, they did." And I said,
"trust me, they can't, Title IX, they can't." And I went back to class and
didn't think another thing about it, because I knew they couldn't.  
And the news went crazy, that's all you saw on the 5:00 and 10:00 news for a
few days, and obviously the program got reinstated. When you're a ball coach,
doesn't matter the level, you're so immersed in what you're doing. I remember
vaguely the Final Four and what was going on, but you know what I was doing? I
was teaching sophomores how to shoot left-handed layups in the gym at Norman
High School.  
The most important thing you're doing is what you're doing at that time, and
it was important to me because I wanted my high school kids to have a chance
to compete for a scholarship without going halfway across the country. I
wanted them to have the chance to stay here in Oklahoma and play for an
incredible institution, and I knew I had good players but that would be
difficult for a while.  
And I knew it would be a difficult choice for kids for a while, and I hated
that because I had good players that I knew would love to stay at home and
play for our institution, and they didn't have that choice for a while, but
now they do.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH COALE: Maybe I didn't. Maybe I didn't and that was the great blessing. I
didn't think a thing about it, really. I had several people call and groups of
people come to see me. You've got to get this job, and I'm like, what are you
talking about? I'm a high school coach. I can't get a D-1 job! And really
encouragement from Geno.  
I had a unique opportunity in that I had had college grade level kids in my
gym, so I had D-1 coaches in and out of my gym and talked a lot of basketball
with them and realized that basketball is basketball, and there is a whole lot
more to this job than that, but the court stuff, ball is ball.  
So that was a bit of it, and my afinity for the University of Oklahoma, I
don't know that I would have been interested in the position had it not been
at this institution. I grew up in a home where everywhere in the house was
tuned to OU football on Saturday, and you didn't make noise, you go outside
and play if you wanted to.  
When they sang the fight song, you stopped in the house and sang the fight
song, the whole deal. You know? It was a reverence, sort of, and my brother
graduated from the University of Oklahoma and it was the best.  
It was nirvana and so why not try? This is how I live, why not try? Just
worked out. Longest answer in the history of man kind, sorry!  
  
Q. Sherri, maybe -- one of the biggest wins since you've come along was 2000
at Purdue. Now Purdue is here and you're a heavy favorite. Just your thoughts
on the shoe being on the other foot kind of thing. On the David and Goliath
idea, is one of your challenges to play like or feel like that team felt in
2002, to play like an underdog, to play like the team that had something to
prove?  
COACH COALE: You always give questions with lots of clauses, so it takes me a
minute to figure out how I should answer offensively to it.  
A, it is a little bit -- what's the word? Ironic, perhaps, that it is Purdue
here, however there is a vital difference. When we beat Purdue, they were the
defending national champions on their home floor as a one seed, and we were in
our first NCAA tournament, maybe there was one way back when, but the first in
my regime.  
In that regard very, very different. This Purdue team is not unaccustomed to
being in the NCAA tournament. They have had tons of success, won conference
championships, obviously their program has a recent National Championship, 10
years ago they were the national champions, so some similarities, but
differences as well.  
As far as being the underdog and playing as if you have something to prove,
there is a mentality with all great players and great teams that every time
they step on the floor, they should play in such a way as no one has ever seen
them play before and they can go, "wow, this is what I'm supposed to do."  
  
Q. Sherri, I don't know what extent you have had dealing with Sharon, but
what do you know about her?  
COACH COALE: I've actually had very few dealings with her. I really like her
way, though. I'm incredibly impressed by her. And by that I mean I like the
way she handles her team.  
I have crossed paths with her on the road recruiting a little bit. She has
always been very kind and professional. She strikes me as the type of
individual that goes about her business and doesn't mess with any of the other
stuff. She is about coaching her team and putting together a product that her
University can be proud of. I see her leading them and doing special things
with those kids, and I think that's great for our game.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your comments. Good luck tomorrow night.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined on the platform by Purdue Coach Versyp, we
have student athletes, Lindsay Wisdom-Hylton, Jodie Howell, FahKara Malone,
Lakisha Freeman and Danielle Campbell. Coach, please give an opening
statement.  
COACH VERSYP: Just very pleased with our group of young ladies, how we're
representing Purdue University. We have worked exceptionally hard to get to
this spot and we have a great opportunity in front of us.  
Right now in the Elite 8 you have a lot of teams trying to get to that Final
Four. We have a good, quiet confidence about us and we're excited for tomorrow
night.  
  
Q. Jodie and Lindsay, many of your players have come through debilitating
injuries to get where you are. Has that done something to forge your team
together at all, made you guys stronger in some way? You all seem to have
recovered from very serious injuries.  
JODIE HOWELL: I think when injuries come into play, your team comes closer
together and it's more than just teammates having somebody to talk to and it
spills over to the court.  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I agree, just having someone to help you through that
and be there for you.  
  
Q. For Lindsay and Danielle, you guys played in the Elite 8 two years ago,
what do you draw from that experience?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: We've all been there and we don't want to feel like
that again, we want to draw on that experience.  
DANIELLE CAMPBELL: We are looking ahead and we're excited to get out there and
compete.  
  
Q. FahKara, the atmosphere will probably be a good one tomorrow night. What
kinds of things do you draw on in a situation like this, when you have 12,
13,000 fans, most of whom are probably wearing red and cheering against you?  
FAHKARA MALONE: The biggest thing I think the Coach stressed to us and is
communicating, constantly looking at each other and looking at the coaching
staff on offense and defense and staying in our own little world.  
That's what's gotten us this far and the fact that we get to play in front of
12,000 fans screaming against us is going to make us that much closer.  
  
Q. FahKara, their point guard is lightning quick, what's it going to be like
going up against a point guard that can probably match you in speed?  
FAHKARA MALONE: It will be fun. I've seen a lot of game film, and going left
or right she is extremely fast, she pushes the tempo as much as I do. Staying
in front of her is the key, and making sure I can stay between her and the
basket.  
  
Q. Lakisha, the men's team faced a similar situation when they played
Washington in Portland, Oregon, where they, Washington had the big home crowd
there. Did you learn anything from that experience, watching that game?  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: Our men's team did a great job out there and as everyone
said, we're going to use this as motivation. We've been here before, so we're
going to use it as motivation tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Lakisha and Lindsay, when FahKara had her injury, you guys had a tough
stretch, but you won a number of games in a row. How much did that help this
team to get through those games right after losing your point guard?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: You pull together as a team and we had to do that. I
think we did a great job, and FahKara was our captain, controls the tempo, but
we had other players who stepped up and filled her shoes.  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: I agree with Lindsay totally. Other people had to step up and
had to get outside of their box, people who weren't handling the ball had to
handle the ball. People who weren't talking as much had to talk a lot more.
Everyone stepped out of their box and we all came together.  
  
Q. Lindsay and Lakisha, is it better to play with 13,000 people cheering
against you or better to play in a quieter gym?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: No, not at all. It's more exciting playing in front of
fans than it is a dull environment. It's an us against the world-type
mentality that we have to go into the game.  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: Lindsay touched on everything, so I agree with Lindsay.  
  
Q. Lindsay, talk about the match-ups between Purdue and OU.  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: Oklahoma is a great team, they have the inside with the
Paris sisters, and they have a great point guard and it's going to be a great
match up, just a question between who is going to play harder and want it
more.  
  
Q. You guys played a complete game last night, great balance, speed, height,
I'm trying to figure out how you lost 10 games this year. What's the
difference? What's the difference between the team that was struggling earlier
and the team that is playing so well now?  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I just think we've grown as a team throughout the whole
season. We've had some bumps in the road early on, and we've learned from
them. This is the time where every team needs to be playing the best
basketball and I think that's what we're doing right now, which is why we're
being so successful.  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I think the biggest thing is the fact that we have four
freshmen who are playing amazing. They're coming off the bench and doing
amazing things. We have Natasha who comes off the bench, our bench has grown,
which is the reason we've grown so much. We have five starters here who get us
off to a good start, but if they didn't come off the bench, we wouldn't be the
team we are today.  
  
Q. This is for all five. You went line dancing the other night. Talk about
the experience of line dancing and who, in your opinion was the best line
dancer? Coach, you can chime in too if you'd like.  
DANIELLE CAMPBELL: I definitely was the worst! (Chuckles.) It was just fun to
do something totally different and totally new. Coach was on point. I was the
worst. She knew what she was doing.  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Like Danielle said, it was fun to do something
different, and I don't think I'll ever do it again, but it was actually a
pretty good workout, too. I'm going to have to go with Kiki, she was trying to
work it over there.  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: It was an amazing experience, I wanted to learn so bad, and
Coach was instructing us what to do, I have to go with me and Coach on that.  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: It was fun to get out and do something that's from this
area that we wouldn't experience in West Lafayette, and Kiki was calming
everybody down like, "I want to hear what he's talking about ,"so you have to
give it to her.  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: It was great to do something different while we were
here, Coach was good but Chelsea has done it before and she was holding back
because she is from Arkansas and she has done it before, so I know she knows
how to line dance secretly.  
COACH VERSYP: I was pretty good, but Chelsea was better. We call her "B.C.",
big country, so we're good.  
  
Q. Maybe on a somewhat more serious note, FahKara, do you feel like Purdue
needs a win like this maybe to garner better respect to a national level? I
think a lot of people are choosing Oklahoma to win this game pretty handily.
What are your thoughts?  
FAHKARA MALONE: We were here two years ago and we were in the top 10 the whole
year and we got no respect. I don't think this win is going to make or break
our program in any way. I think we're going to continue to play great
basketball.  
We do want to win this game not only for ourselves but for our University, and
hopefully people will take notice once we get the victory after the game.  
  
Q. FahKara, could you talk about the kind of things that Coach demands as
far as a point guard at Purdue? What are the things that you've got to do?  
FAHKARA MALONE: I just made a face because I don't know what she doesn't
demand, really. (Chuckles.) With her coming from the same position, it helps
me a lot. A lot of times, being my junior year, we have so much chemistry on
and off the court, we call the same plays, we know the same defenses, so it's
worked out really well for us, but communication is the biggest thing for her.  
Coming down the stretch, she just wants me to be able to control the tempo and
know who to get the ball to in the right times. So, yeah, pretty much
everything.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, kind of following up on the question to FahKara, what's your job
description for your point guard? What did you want her to do in general?  
COACH VERSYP: The biggest thing is she has to be the leader on the court. She
has to have the toughest mind-set, 'cuz I'm the toughest on the point guard
because they are the leader, they have to be, in my brain, which is kinda
crazy.  
They're the ones who are getting yelled at for everything, if something goes
wrong, so they have to be the toughest individual. And I think FahKara nailed
it, me being a point guard, I never did anything right, you felt like that,
but it made you mentally tougher and in a game it was so much easier.  
So I ride her hard, but with her being a junior, we're exactly on the same
wave length, that's exactly what you want. Her growth between her freshman and
sophomore year was amazing, but she is our high-energy kid, she is amazing,
offensively and defensively.  
  
Q. Coach, much is made of Courtney Paris and for good reason, but the last
couple of games Courtney hasn't really been the person that's stood out for
them. They seem to have grown as a team the last couple of games. Have you
noticed that? Other players on her team, Whitney Hand and Danielle Robinson
stepping up?  
COACH VERSYP: I think that's the key to any team right now that your other
players step up. If you watch other games, they key in on different players
like the one, two and three punch on certain teams, but it's the other
players, like for us, Kiki shooting 9 for 12 for us, that's a Whitney Hand for
Oklahoma, Danielle Robinson being able to score and get to the basket.  
So I think at this point people are going to key on the players that have made
them exceptionally successful, and right now other players have to step up for
your program.  
  
Q. Coach, the players have talked about no respect and getting a big win.
Yet your program has been here not so long ago, in the tournament every year.
Talk about the balance of where you feel like getting to the Final Four puts
this program.  
COACH VERSYP: I think the Final Four or Elite 8, everybody that's a coach
wants to go to the Final Four and win the National Championship, but we're one
of the top 10 winningest programs in the country, we've been to 8 Elite 8s,
100 Sweet 16s, our program is one of the top programs, and that's because of
the administration that allows us to be so successful and the type of student
athletes that we have.  
You've got to have a coach that stays at a program for a while. The programs
that are spoken about are people that have been there 10 to 30 years, 15 to 30
years, I've only been here three years. And there have been a lot of coaching
changes, so I think the story at Purdue is we've won National Championships,
to the Final Four, the Elite 8, Sweet 16, and we have a record with NCAA
appearances and you've had six to seven coaches within a span.  
I think Purdue is doing something right, but that's the biggest thing. Our
kids know that they're great student athletes, and we're one of the top-10
programs. When we recruit, we speak about that, we know how to get it done on
and off the court, but I think the biggest thing is you got to be somewhere
for a while.  
  
Q. With your team's experience, how do you expect them to be able to handle
the environment they will be in tomorrow night?  
COACH VERSYP: We discussed this, and you want to play in front of fans.
There's no question about that. You don't want to play in a dull environment.
I think the best preparation for us is Michigan State. It's very loud.  
But the "Barn" in Minnesota is one of the toughest places to play, it's 8,000
people, but it sounds like it's 20,000 people. We've been in that environment,
it's tough. Other teams have come in here and been able to be successful, so
the biggest thing is playing our game plan, not getting rattled, us against
the world mentality is what we have talked about pretty much all year.  
That's what we have to do, and you've got to feed off the fans. The fans don't
play the game, players play the game and we've got to make sure we do the
things we need to.  
  
Q. Is there a match-up tomorrow night or an area that you're concerned about
that needs to go your way?  
COACH VERSYP: Yes, we've got to be able to control Danielle Robinson. She is
the key, just like FahKara is the key to us. I have so much respect for her
game and her growth of her game and that's why they're playing well. Whitney
Hand, 25, we can't let her shoot the 3. We just can't let her have many looks
because she is the one who gets the crowd going.  
You hit a three, everybody goes crazy, but the 3-ball does something
different. We have to limit Paris' down low, limit opportunities there and box
out.  
  
Q. Coach, having played at Purdue maybe before the glory days of the
program, what would it mean for you to lead the program to a Final Four, and
if I could follow up, do you talk to Coach Dunn much anymore?  
COACH VERSYP: You know, I'm just -- I have so much pride of being able to be
the coach here. I'm very blessed, obviously, to have this opportunity and to
be able to do a lot of different things and bridge the gap and continue to
win.  
Hopefully I will feel that I helped fill that foundation and to continue this
program for a long time would be huge. I talk to a lot of former coaches that,
I guess, were after me, Lynn has e-mailed me and talked to me quite a bit,
Carolyn Peck, we had the '99 championship team way back.  
And all of those coaches and assistants, Nell Fortner, so it is a special
place, we have people out there in Purdue country rootin' for us. It's great
to be on the sidelines and being part of something that's really special.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Purdue Â– 67  
Rutgers - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Rutgers Coach Stringer, we have Brittany
Ray, Kia Vaughn and Epiphanny Prince. Coach, your thoughts?  
COACH STRINGER: I thought that Purdue came on sharp, hot, they understand that
they were looking to attack, I thought they rebounded extremely well.  
It took us quite a bit of time to adjust. And Freeman knocked down two or
three shots before we got it together, and that's disappointing because we
would expect Hylton, Howell, Rayburn to do that, but it was clearly Freeman.
And of course we know that in big-time games, big-time people step up on the
big stage, simple as that.  
Unfortunately, we had to have -- the rebounding had to be key for us, and it
just didn't happen, it just didn't happen. We needed to have -- and
unfortunately we don't have big people other than Kia, so we needed to have
rebounding coming from the guards, we were not effective in our 55.  
Why, because the little guard was quick, and the 4 was able to handle the ball
well enough so it didn't allow us to get into that trap situation, we were
wasting time.  
When we can't score off the defense, we've got to score other ways. One of
those ways is getting to the line, to see if we can get it done that way. I
don't think we could have done anything differently in terms of man-to-man
defense, but credit to Purdue, they did a great job and credit to our team,
given where we started and how we proceeded throughout the vast majority of
the season.  
You know, we're pleased that we were able to get here, but unhappy because we
know that we could have done some different things.  
  
Q. Kia, as you guys closed the gap, did you start believing "yeah, we're
going to actually do this?"  
KIA VAUGHN: Throughout the game there was no doubt in my mind that it wasn't
incapable of us to get the game done. Little by little, at the end when they
went to the free-throw line, it dawned on me that it wasn't in my hands
anymore. We just tried to stick it out.  
  
Q. Kia, looking at where you're sitting right now, can you take any
consolation in that?  
KIA VAUGHN: I'm proud of my teammates and how far we've come. We've fought so
long to get to where we are now. We started off really, really sluggish in the
beginning of the season and not knowing roles or what we were capable of
doing.  
We had the skills and the talent to do anything we wanted, but it seemed like
it was locked in a chest and no one knew where the key was.  
Coach kept telling us we were hot and cold and we had to keep working hard to
find it, and we finally did at the end of the season, it's just that today it
didn't work in our favor.  
  
Q. Kia, Epiphanny, that last pass when you pulled down that rebound and you
threw the outlet to Epiphanny, what were you thinking there, or was there a
miscommunication of some kind?  
KIA VAUGHN: I just overthrew the pass. I seen her going in for the fast break.
And I just overthrew the pass, that's all it was.  
EPIPHANNY PRINCE: I didn't know how hard she was going to throw it, so...  
  
Q. Coach, when you look at where this team came from and how it got here,
how do you feel about it going forward for next season, the freshmen that
didn't play as much as you probably expected, but over all?  
COACH STRINGER: Tell you the truth, I don't know, because we are losing a huge
-- we're losing the battery that is Kia and Heather, they are connected.
Heather and Kia read each other extremely well.  
Obviously I haven't been too impressed with our freshmen in terms of them
handling this kind of a situation. I heard someone make a statement that
Tennessee had all of these freshmen, and we had all these freshmen, and we
were able to get something done.  
But I think you would be fooled into thinking that because our freshmen did
not play a significant role in any of the game, any significant amount of
time.  
We've seen bits and pieces, but as an example, the Tennessee freshmen played
far more games and logged more minutes. However, the biggest issue with our
freshmen is for them to buy into and understand that there is a way to win the
game.  
This game started off today with, you know, you think that we know how to play
the team game. But for whatever reason, we began to take a shot with one or
two passes, we began to take a quick out, and what we know is that anytime
we've shot over 14 three's, we've lost the game.  
We start shooting quickly with one or two passes, that ball was rebounding
long and they were going back to the other end of the floor. I thought that
Dee gathered herself a little later, she is a freshman and she needed to calm
down and know how to attack, because while they were much bigger, they
couldn't be bigger and quicker, so when she began to attack, we got to the
free-throw line.  
That's what we needed from Epiphanny Prince, she goes to the free-throw one
time, there is something wrong with that picture, which means she is shooting
over 6-1, 6-2, 6-3s, which is unusual, because we knew we needed to balance
this out without going to the free-throw line.  
It wasn't for us as a group -- we seemed slow, maybe somewhat intimidated,
shocked -- I won't say intimidated, I think we were shocked with the size when
we really -- a lot of times sizes aren't inflated because they were the size
that they were and they were skilled.  
So I thought they were a little cautious and we started doing things that told
me that we weren't playing together as a team. When we did begin to play
together as a team, as someone asked, did we believe, and I do believe that we
did believe.  
Because we reverted to survival, self-survival, which is -- has been our
nemesis and that's what killed us at the beginning of the year. So our time
outs had to do more with, wait a minute, this is the exact same thing that
we've done in more than half the games, so why are we going crazy now?  
We don't have the direction, we're rushing things, can we slow it down and
become the team that believes and demonstrates trust and faith? But in a game
of this magnitude, it only takes about a good five minutes and that's
basically what it was, we lost a good five minutes.  
And then while we attempted to go back, playing team basketball and doing what
we needed to do to come back, my conversation with April Sykes, for example,
was do you understand what I meant by taking the drive instead of the outside
shot?  
In games like this you're always going to get a 3-point shot, we don't need a
savior, we didn't need to go one or two passes and shoot. And so they settled
down and they were like, "okay, we're going to do the right thing" and then it
was better.  
There was major miscommunication when there was a girl standing there at the
basket, we knew that we were taking switches. For whatever reason, Piphanny
and Dee, Dee did the right thing, she was taking the switch, Piphanny knew she
had four fouls and did not want to take the switch, she would rather play the
perimeter player and not be put in the post position, I understand that, but
they didn't trust.  
Because at that moment Dee said "switch" and Piphanny said "no, I've got to
stay," and in between that the girl was left free under the basket. When you
think about a game that could have been easily decided with one or two points,
that's what it is.  
She's got to come in sharp off the bench, Dee, but you have to be 30 seconds
sharp. We had watched that player at the high-post position do that step
through and backdoor hit a thousand times. Why would we get anxious?  
The only reason I took Kia out is because I didn't want her to kick up a foul
with 23 seconds left. We couldn't give up the points and it's all the little
things that make a big difference.  
Each player knows their strengths and whatever the patterns are, if you drive
better to the right rather than to the left, everything we were calling were
isolations. We needed to come even, or once we did go ahead and once we did,
we thought we would have control of Purdue.  
I thought we did everything down for those few seconds, yes, the turnover was
crucial, those things will happen, but we just got a little anxious and Purdue
was a better team today.  
  
Q. Coach, your team seemed to do better when they were able to run the ball,
drive and penetrate. Very often they seemed tentative, willing to stay out,
settle for a half-court game, pass the ball around and take those outside
shots. Was that part of the game plan or --  
COACH STRINGER: No, no, no, no, that's right. That's why you don't see any
tears in my eyes, I'm upset, more than hurt, I'm disappointed because we knew
what we had to do and we went out there and got foolish.  
Trust me when I tell you that, why would we stand out there and try to execute
when we're dealing with people that are giants, basically. Our advantage was
to get the ball off, pass the ball, like we did before, make the pass, all of
the sudden we got real -- all of the sudden we were going to stand out there
and try to execute and see what's going on and if there was -- several times
we took 4-point shots! You know?  
But I'm not too surprised, I'm upset, because didn't we know? Didn't we lose
like that doing the same thing? So there is a lot of things about us that, as
I share with the team, it is at the end as it was at the beginning, the first
day, the exact same things. It's behaviors, and I'm thinking, why are we here.
So, no, ma'am, absolutely not.  
You should have asked the question to them, what were you supposed to do? And
they would tell you, it was supposed to be drives. When we started doing that,
we would stop the clock -- they couldn't stop us on the drives but we couldn't
figure that out until late, and we wouldn't handle it on the 55, which is
surprising.  
And I think if we had a little more energy, a little sharper, we probably
would have been able to handle a 55 but it forsaked us today. But we didn't
then become smart with the other things that we needed to do. It's very
obvious if you look at the stats, Prince, for example, is an 87% free-throw
shooter, and there is nobody that can stop her. If she comes near a screen,
they're not shopping her, they're going to foul her, so how do we think? We
just didn't play very smart.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

Purdue Â– 67  
Rutgers - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Purdue coach, Coach Versyp.  
COACH VERSYP: It was a game of runs, and Rutgers had been playing such great
basketball and had balanced scoring and they were never going to be out of the
game no matter if we were ahead by 20 or 30. We tried to keep that sense of
urgency and our players stepped up.  
The rebounding for us was a big key and Rutgers gave us everything at the end,
going one-on-one to the hole and they were able to knock down some key shots
and we were able to knock some key shots down.  
FahKara and Danielle both knocked down shots, and our players stayed composed,
and I think there was a big reason we were able to be successful tonight.  
  
Q. Lindsay, you've had games this year where you've had second half leads
and let them slip away and ended up in a loss. What do you think was different
today?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I think learning from those experiences and those
losses helped us get to where we are today, and I think we gutted it out.  
And when we were only up with 2 with a minute or two left, I think if this was
three, four, five months ago, maybe we would have let it slip, but tonight we
were able to battle through and come out on top.  
  
Q. Do you feel like throughout the game you guys were able to sustain your
offense for longer periods than Rutgers?  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: Yes, I do feel like that. We had that inside/outside game
which was tough for them to guard.  
  
Q. Lindsay, can you talk about that shot that FahKara hit? It's probably not
often that you have seen her hit the fade-away shot.  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: It's tournament time, anything can happen. We had a
couple of buzzer beater shot clock shots, and when you're feeling it, you are
hot and she had some key buckets down the stretch. And we're playing well as a
team right now and anything can happen.  
  
Q. Lindsay, how important was it to get Jodie going today offensively?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: Jodie is awesome. She's playing so hard for us right
now and she is getting those outside shots for us, and she is attacking the
basket.  
And she did a great job with that today and her offensive and defensive play
has stepped up for us today.  
  
Q. Lindsay, I read where Coach said that you guys were not stressed, not
pressured, everybody has maybe overlooked you. How does this feel now to get
to the regional final and how much is it where you guys are relaxed and
playing and not under any pressure?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I think that's when we play our best basketball, when
we are relaxed and not tense and not worrying about things. We had nothing to
lose here, so we had to go out and play our hearts out. And whoever plays the
best wins the game, and we're playing our best basketball right now.  
  
Q. Lakisha, any nervousness at all when they kept closing the gap?  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: No, there was not. As Lindsay said, we learned from our
experiences. A while ago the team probably would have got the win, but we're
learning and today we were staying tough and we were able to knock down some
key shots.  
  
Q. Jodie, being in the Elite 8, a lot of you players have been here in this
situation before. Talk about being back in this spot.  
JODIE HOWELL: We're excited right now, we're probably going to enjoy this
tonight and get back to business tomorrow. But it's a great feeling to be
here.  
  
Q. Lakisha, three straight games now you guys have been shooting the ball
well. Everyone says you want to peak at tournament time, are you guys doing
that?  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: Yes, we have those who are starting the game and everyone is
scoring well, as well as everyone that's coming off the bench, and everyone is
scoring and playing great for this team right now and it's great.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll see you back here tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot will be made about your shooting percentage tonight. Talk
defensively what you guys were able to do to take them out of rhythm there for
the first 30 minutes or so of the game.  
COACH VERSYP: We started out in our one defense and we didn't look very good
there briefly, so being able to make some adjustments, you know, because of
how they set up, really working the deep corners.  
But I think the changes when we went man-to-man and they didn't score for 5 or
6 minutes and then we got into foul trouble, but our kids sustained it and
were able to knock down shots. But our defense has been our bread and butter
the whole time.  
I think that's been the key because we hope you shoot 50% or 60%, but that's
not going to happen all the time. That will always be a key to our success.  
  
Q. Do they seem to have a different look about them?  
COACH VERSYP: We just have a lot of confidence right now. Every time-out, we
say we're not going to let this slip away, every player on the bench. And it's
a mind-set right now, everybody is physically gifted, everybody is playing
great basketball when they get to that point. And right now it's mental
toughness.  
We talked about that mental toughness early on and now we have it. That's when
you want it to come out is in February and early March.  
  
Q. Your bench didn't give you necessarily a bunch of points, but I thought
they gave you critical minutes, Guyton especially in the first half. Can you
talk about that.  
COACH VERSYP: We need to be physical down low, Kia Vaughn is very, very strong
and we have respect for her. When Danielle got into foul trouble, Natasha gave
us great minutes.  
And Alex was able to bang because she is so physical and being able to knock
down that shot and calling the play for her, it builds her confidence. And I
think we brought our freshmen along well, but now they're understanding things
more and it's not always about offense.  
  
Q. Coach, the shot at the shot clock there at the end, what was that?  
COACH VERSYP: That was a player making a play, they took us out of what we
wanted to run, they did a great job. But at this point, sometimes the stars
align right, there has to be some luck in this, and as soon as it released
from FahKara's hand, I knew it was in.  
She stepped up big for us, she controlled the tempo, played amazing defense.
Our biggest concern was her boxing somebody out, but that was huge. She was
the one in the huddle saying "this is our game, this is our game," and she's
that leader for us.  
  
Q. You talk about your defense playing, again, you've been shooting 50% the
last couple of games and beaten two pretty good teams. Does the defense set up
that offense or offense is a nice by-product?  
COACH VERSYP: For us, our defense always sets up our offense, but when you
knock down a big shot, you don't have tired legs on defense. And I think when
Jodie Howell knocks down 3 for her teammates, everybody gets the energy.  
It takes the pressure off, but everybody is talking about our shooting, but we
almost lost the game on free-throws, so obviously that will be a point of
emphasis, which it always has been. But these kids are enjoying it, they're
enjoying the moments. We have talked about you can't get these moments back.  
  
Q. When Rutgers started making that run at the end and pulled within 2, was
there any nervousness? Did you feel like they were playing the basketball
you'd seen?  
COACH VERSYP: Rutgers or us? Both? Rutgers totally isolated and went one-on-
one. They have phenomenal players and we were able to take it down low and
play off the dribble, and we ended up going into a defense that slowed them
down with the key rebound we got, but we've handled that before, we've learned
from it.  
We've had a heart breaker when we played against Ohio State, and we're not
going to try to allow that to happen again, so our memories went back to us.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, Coach, congratulations, we'll see you tomorrow.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Oklahoma Â– 70  
Pittsburgh - 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the victorious Sooners, Coach Coale,
Ashley Paris, Danielle Robinson, and Whitney Hand. Coach?  
COACH COALE: First of all, I think every student athlete who competes in the
NCAA tournament should have an opportunity to compete in that environment that
we were in tonight, I just think it's special.  
I appreciate the people of Oklahoma for their loyal support and for the
support they give us, and the kids that come to Oklahoma get to experience
something special like that. I think it's unique and I'm very proud of our
state.  
Very proud of this basketball team, I thought our guard play was great
particularly early on, Shavonte Zellous is great on the perimeter, and I
thought we did a tremendous job of contesting her shots and being disciplined
enough not to send her to the free-throw line.  
We battled, did as good of a job on the boards as we have done all season
long, block outs, they are a very disciplined team. And up to the last 10, 12
minutes we took care of the basketball. We got a little lackadaisical at the
end, maybe a little antsy, but I thought we played cleanly, and I'll toss it
back to you.  
  
Q. Whitney, this is two games that you've had a brilliant night at Ford
Center, are you going to have the games moved here next year?  
WHITNEY HAND: I don't think that's my choice. I think it's the environment and
I was lucky enough to hit a couple of shots at the beginning and the way they
were guarding us, it left us wings open and I'm glad the shots went down.  
  
Q. Whitney, in regaining your stroke, do you have a better grip or regaining
confidence?  
WHITNEY HAND: I try not to analyze it too much. I think it has a lot to do
with mental, on how to shoot the ball. It's a matter of getting your feet set
and your elbows straight, a lot of things. I think I'm looking for it a little
more now, a little more confident.  
  
Q. Whitney, there was a moment early in the second half, I think it was a
9-point game, Courtney just got her third, the shot clock was winding down,
you got the ball out to Nyeshia and she made a three. Talk me through that
play a little bit.  
WHITNEY HAND: I'm sorry, I don't remember the play. It was huge. Getting past
the 10-point lead is a big step and I think Ny is always clutch like that.  
I don't remember honestly, but I'm sure it was a huge shot and I think Ny --
(Chuckles.) I don't know what else to say, I don't remember, I'm really sorry.  
  
Q. Whitney, with so many big plays, it's understandable on that. Talk a
little bit about in the biggest game you come up with your biggest games.  
WHITNEY HAND: Once again, it doesn't have a lot to do with the biggest games,
I don't think, I think it has to do with how they guard us, when they're
coming out and double-teaming Courtney.  
No matter where you are on the court, if I'm on her side, it makes it easy to
get a shot off. It's my job to hit shots, and I'm really glad they went in.  
  
Q. Whitney, maybe you'll remember this play, you hit a 3 and you come back
on the next possession and you're falling down and you threw it up in with one
hand, that was a big basket, y'all took control after that. Talk about what
you were thinking there.  
WHITNEY HAND: Really sorry. I do actually remember that one, because I
remember Ashley told me she was proud of me. I mean, I think our game plan was
to attack them, especially against their pressure.  
And at that time they were giving us heavy pressure, so I'm glad the shot went
in because it would have been a retarded shot if it hadn't.  
  
Q. Ashley, does your night start with rebounding like you did or scoring
points like did you? Talk about your night, please.  
ASHLEY PARIS: I think it started with a few offensive rebounds, and I wasn't
able to score a couple times, but I got in a groove and just for a freshman to
be playing like that, feeding off of Whitney's energy, she fueled me the whole
game and I started when Whitney started.  
  
Q. Ashley, in the Georgia Tech game you got off to an 0-6 start, tonight you
got off to a better start. Talk about that.  
ASHLEY PARIS: I know how to make layups, and I blew it in the Georgia Tech
game, and I think they say the guys believed in me, and they said you can
finish and it gave me confidence in this game. And I missed shots early, but
worked on leaving the misses and the passes and moving on to the next
possession.  
  
Q. "D," talk about your game tonight. You had a tough defensive match-up and
you had a good night offensively as well.   
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Zellous is a great player, six rebounds? And she is a great
player, and even though we contested pretty well, she got 7, 8 shots. And
being a point guard, you have to bring your game.  
And even though I got some fouls, I had to lead from the bench and talk to
people, make sure everyone is in the right spot. Even though I didn't play so
many minutes, you still have to lead as a point guard.  
  
Q. Whitney, the way you talk about the game, is it a blur to you at this
point? Are you able to take in what you did tonight?  
WHITNEY HAND: I don't -- I mean, I don't think it's about what I did. I think
we all had a goal coming into this game. It was a goal of making it to the
Elite 8, no one on the court had made it there yet, including myself.  
It was just a matter of taking advantage of how they were guarding us. I think
I had a good game tonight, but shout out to everyone else out there. Danielle
had a ridiculous match-up, that girl scored on me every time I tried to guard
her.  
And Courtney was getting double-teamed every time she touched the ball and she
was getting hacked, so it's not about how great I played, I'm just thankful
we're still alive and we get to play more games with Ashley, Courtney and
Carolyn, so that's great.  
  
Q. Sherri, help us out. Could you talk about Whitney's improvement in the
last couple of games, she's gone from 0 for the Big 12 tournament to finding
her stroke. Can you explain that?  
COACH COALE: Well --  
  
Q. Is it mechanical?  
COACH COALE: Less we forget she has a couple of screws in her finger, and
that's probably the 0-12 that you refer to.  
I disagree with Whitney a little bit in what she says, it doesn't matter the
magnitude of the game. I think she's an extraordinary collegiate basketball
player already, and you can spot the great ones because she shows up when the
lights are brightest.  
I thought she was fantastic, yes, she had great shots, she rebounded, played
great defense, made extra passes driving into the lane, made the leaping layup
that you guys were discussing. She just made plays, and guards have to do that
in order to survive and advance at this stage.  
So don't let her humility -- I love the kid and I love the humility and
appreciate it so much, but I can tell ya, she's big time.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH COALE: Obviously at the beginning, receiving the ball cleanly was the
toughest thing when she came back with that hand, had a splint on the outside
of her finger, but the actual reception, the tactile reception felt different
and unless she got a perfect pass, it was difficult for her.  
As her fingers continued to heal and she has gotten accustomed to adjusting
with that splint on, she's gotten better and better. A little bit is physical,
but a little bit is mental, you miss four games and every human -- Amanda
Thompson comes in tonight and you want to make up for all those games you
missed and you can't do it that way. Even though you know you shouldn't try
to, it's human nature.  
  
Q. Sherri, could you talk about how it feels to be on the doorstep of the
Final Four, and it seems like your team is firing on all cylinders at the
right time.  
COACH COALE: It feels great, the Sweet 16 had been a brick wall for us, and
Randy Pausch told us in "The Last Lecture" that it's -- a brick wall is there
for a reason. They're there to give us an opportunity to show us how badly we
want something. It gave us an opportunity to help drive us through something.  
  
Q. The three that Nyeshia hit with the shot clock going down, one play out
of many, but how big of a deal was that considering the situation of the game
at that point?  
COACH COALE: Considering the situation that we were in from a personal
standpoint, it was tremendous. But I think the biggest part of that play is
what it does to the opponent.  
You know, it's like -- we always tell our guys, offensive rebounds give life,
and when you don't block it out, it takes life away. Our guys were competing,
we're trying to stretch that lead, and Pitt is doing everything they can to
try to chip away at it and we hit that.  
And their the defense -- we've been on the receiving end of that before for,
the defense, it's sort of deflating. So as much as it fueled us and gave us
energy and life, it probably took that much away from them and it was
definitely a turning point in the game.  
  
Q. Sherri, as soon as I asked Ashley, where did tonight's rhythm start for
tonight's team, it seemed you had four people open on the defensive rebounding
side and that just started things from a rookie standpoint, but where did your
rhythm start tonight?  
COACH COALE: I think our offensive rhythm emanates from 3-point shooters,
honestly. When we make early three's, we feel good, invincible. It's like
lancing a wound and releasing the pressure.  
For everyone, okay, we're going to be okay. Whitney is making shots, we're
going to be okay. I know it's a ridiculous amount of pressure and I don't like
the word "pressure ,"but expectations, maybe, for a freshman, but she is
extraordinary and she can handle it. I always feel like when we hit early
three's we have great rhythm on offense and we feel like anything is possible.  
  
Q. Sherri, you guys did a great job of sharing the ball, five players in
double figures, talk about that.  
COACH COALE: At halftime we had 11 assists and that was one of our goals
because we knew if we shared the ball and moved the ball, we could have
success against the defense.  
We wanted to play inside/out and knew they would be focused on Courtney and be
able to get cutters going to the rim. In the second half we fell off in the
end, but we built on that early on.  
  
Q. It probably doesn't surprise you by now, but you're without Amanda, your
starting forward, Courtney doesn't have your typical production, but you're up
by 27 in the second half, could you talk about your team at this point
advancing to the Elite 8?  
COACH COALE: I'm proud of them obviously, and I think our depth and our bench
is something that has been talked about intermittently but never on a
consistent level.  
As teams across the country have been competing in the NCAA tournament without
key guys seems to be stuff talked about and written, and there hasn't been
much talked about us.  
Amanda Thompson is an outstanding collegiate basketball player. She is a
defensive stopper, we get our toughness from her. And all of the sudden we
don't have her, after not having Whitney and getting her back, all of the
sudden we don't have A.T.  
So I think it's been remarkable what these kids have done in terms of their
mentality and their intestinal fortitude, for lack of a better term, just
saying, "it doesn't matter, we're going to find a way to keep playing anyway."  
And one other thing, I think Amanda deserves credit for that, too, because the
way a kid responds to being injured and unable to play has a resounding affect
on her teammates. And for Amanda to not whine and be in a cave and not feeling
sorry for herself is remarkable, and she is a remarkable young lady.  
  
Q. Sherri, can you preview Purdue for us?  
COACH COALE: They're good. I wanted to be focused on what we wanted to do. I
saw 8 or 10 possessions, at the most, but I watched them earlier in the year,
watched them while their point guard was out and thought they were very good
in her absence.  
They can all score, they have great size, Sharon Versyp has done a great job
with them. I think offensively their rhythm is their key, and intangibly what
makes them special. And the reason they're alive in the Elite 8 is because
they're really a team, they're really together and you can feel that and we'll
have our hands full.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Oklahoma Â– 70  
Pitt - 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Berenato, Shavonte Zellous and Xenia
Stewart. Coach?  
COACH BERENATO: Congratulations to the University of Oklahoma. They have a
great team and obviously it was a great environment to play in. Little kids
dream of that, playing in an environment like that, but usually their dreams
are when it's their home court and it's their environment.  
But it was an opportunity for our ladies to come out and perform and to see
what we were made of. I think Oklahoma was the better team tonight. I just
want to congratulate Sherri Coale and her team and congratulate the fans of
Oklahoma, because you guys really did a great job.  
So I want to thank the NCAA and everybody here on the host committee and
everybody that worked with this tournament. Personally, I know what it takes
to run a tournament of this magnitude, and it's just a lot of work for years
in advance. I can't wait until we host next year, can't wait until the
Peterson Event Center is covered with blue and gold and we're home.  
I just want to say thank you to Shavonte Zellous and Xenia Stewart, two of the
most wonderful athletes that a coach could have the joy of coaching. They have
been wonderful representatives of the University of Pittsburgh, both on and
off the court, and they always have a home at the University, and I wish them
both luck.  
I think Shavonte will be a No. 1 draft pick and I told Xenia don't be
surprised if her name doesn't get called. They're class individuals, both on
and off the court, and even forget basketball and I know that's why we're
here, but really for me we're here because we're educators, and we're here
because of the game of life.  
I think that this team, they've been led by these two young ladies and we've
gone further than anyone thought possible. In the first game we played Texas
A&M, and in the first few minutes we lost our point guard, and honest to God I
don't know if we thought we would win 15 games, but we never changed our goal.  
And for us to get to the Sweet 16 and for Xenia to take over as a point guard
and go point guard by committee, this team has done a great job. Shavonte,
when things were rough, she put the team on her back. They've been like
sisters, we're going to miss them dearly, and it's a tribute to the University
of Pittsburgh and our community.  
  
Q. Both of you, can you talk about leaving this program better than when you
found it?  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: It feels great. We're so honored that we helped rebuild the
program, and we wish the University the best, even though we won't be there
next year and wish them the best of things to come.  
XENIA STEWART: We're proud of the progress that we have done at the
University. We've worked hard to get to where we were at and we're happy to be
there. We set a standard and we're happy to be role models, not only to our
teammates but also future ladies that we work with through our volunteerism,
and we were proud to play for Agnus and her staff and the University of
Pittsburgh.  
  
Q. Shavonte, early in the second half you hit a three, got it within 9 and
the -- on the next possession Oklahoma was scrambling around, they beat the
shot clock with the 3. That was deflating? How big of a play do you think it
was in the game?  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: It was a big play, we had the shot clock going down and
Nyeshia hit a big shot for her team and got the crowd into it, and I think we
had a defensive let down and didn't communicate and didn't have our hands up
against her shot, so it was a big play for them and congrats to her and her
team.  
  
Q. Could you guys talk about the first half, they got a lot of perimeter
shots, was it just not getting out there or was it the goal coming in to not
have them make those shots and they just happened to? Talk about your
defense.  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: I think it was a communication let-down, we knew they were
going to get their shots to the perimeter, it's not like we were going to shut
them down completely, but we wanted to be there and contest them and disrupt
them, but they got the shots and knocked 'em down, did what they had to do.  
  
Q. As a member of a student body of the University of Pittsburgh, as a
member of our WPTS and calling many games, I want to thank you for a
tremendous season. Coach, Shavonte, how do you guys use this, where do you see
this taking you in the future?  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: I would like to see me to the WNBA and Xenia. If I don't see
that, I graduate from the University of Pittsburgh and I have a degree in
Criminal Justice, so if I don't pursue my dreams in basketball, I go on my
degree, but I plan on playing in the WNBA.  
XENIA STEWART: I think for me the WNBA possibly, but for me to have the
opportunity to play and have the media interview me and I have a degree in
Communications, so you might see me on ESPN talking to somebody. I have a
degree in Communications. I'm going to get in front of the camera one way or
the other.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the fatigue factor and being able to maintain a
defense against a strong interior program like Oklahoma's?  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: Can you repeat that?  
  
Q. The fatigue factor involved in trying to contain the Paris sisters and
the strong inside game and at the same time trying to maintain your own
outside perimeter game.  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: It's not fatigue, the Big East has -- almost all of the
schools in the Big East have an inside/outside game.  
We had a game plan, I feel like our defense was not focused, our communication
broke down and there were holes where there shouldn't have been, and I don't
think it was fatigue. We've been prepared through the regular season with the
teams we played, Connecticut, Notre Dame, Louisville, even Maryland, they had
the inside/outside game, so I don't think it was a fatigue factor.  
  
Q. Coach, you said yesterday that you enjoyed watching Whitney Hand play on
film, the way she carried herself, do you still feel that same way after her
performance? Talk about how big she was in the first half for them.  
COACH BERENATO: I'm not a sore loser, there is a reason why she was the rookie
of the year in our conference, I'm not a sore loser. I think she banged those
shots in early on and that set the tone of the game.  
We tried, we were doubling down and getting guard help on Courtney Paris and
we thought that was really going to be a bigger factor. And give her credit,
she knocked the shots down and that's what you have to do is knock shots down.  
It's funny because she is a freshman and sometimes freshmen have no fear. They
don't realize what's at stake and as kids get older, they start to realize the
magnitude of a game like this when they're juniors and seniors. My gosh, I've
got to make this shot, but freshmen just go out and play. I like her game, her
size, her athleticism. Yeah, if she wants to transfer you could send her my
way. (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. Coach, what are your goals after how far you guys have gotten in the
tournament? What are your goals for next year?  
COACH BERENATO: I just want to go to sleep tonight to be honest with you.
First of all, I want to say thank you guys for coming from Pitt Radio. It's
awesome.  
The one lady here had a question about fatigue factor, I thought you were
going to say the fatigue factor of going to Seattle and turning around a day
later after getting home and coming back here.  
I appreciate the students and my hometown supporters and Karen and Paul, so
thank you guys. You know, I can't look to next year, I think right now I
really believe in -- I don't know if any of you have a philosophy, but there
is a philosopher Epicurean, and his philosophy is eat, drink and be merry
because tomorrow you may die, and it means to live in the moment and take
every day for what it's worth.  
And I'm not about looking to next year, because I might not be here, tomorrow
I might have a heart attack and die. I'm going to enjoy this team and our team
will never be the same because Shavonte and Xenia will go on their own and
their own paths and they will have their own lives and the fabric of the team
will be different, but then we will have freshmen come in and be new and our
team will go on. And you have to then identify your goals for the new course.  
But right now I would say I want our student athletes to graduate from the
greatest university in the country, University of Pittsburgh, and be good
citizens and great people to their families and good citizens.  
  
Q. Agnus, did you see breakdowns in communications like Xenia thought, or
did they just hit shots that you thought they were going to have to give up?  
COACH BERENATO: In the beginning when they came out, our rotation wasn't
great, we tried to go "man," and then we were in a 2-3 and then in the very
beginning the transition got us, which was surprising but I didn't think they
could keep it at that pace and then they didn't, they slowed it down and we
went with the zone.  
And I thought they did a great job of rotating the basketball, they moved the
basketball well. When we had a breakdown, we would help the helper and then
someone else would have to help the helper and they made that extra path.
Kudos to them, that's what great teams do, make that extra pass and they just
passed, passed, passed.  
And those two 3s they made with the time running out were back breakers, and
you almost say, it was a destiny for them to get those. We played great "D"
for 29.5 seconds, but you have to play for a 30-second possession and they
nailed those two shots. I think that's the way the game went, to be honest
with you, give them credit.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congrats on a wonderful season.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Stringer has joined us, we would like an opening
statement.  
COACH STRINGER: I would say congrats on a season that allowed us to be here.
The most unlikeliest of teams, given how things started, but we did get
started and we had a tough schedule.  
This has been an extremely trying schedule for me, and it's been gratifying,
because ultimately we were able to see some of the things that we were
teaching began to take root and to that extent we began to put things
together. We're excited and happy that we got here, it's like the tortoise and
the hare, and it didn't matter how quickly you get something done, but that
you continue to trod along, and we did that.  
So here we are, in Oklahoma City regionals, which is a great region. If
nothing more than the tremendous support that the Oklahomans have always given
to basketball and to sports period. We're happy to be a part of that.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm curious from a coach's perspective, the general wisdom is that
there is going to be a lot of people wearing Oklahoma gear in the stands.  
What's it like coming in with the possibility of facing an arena like that
that's supposed to be a neutral site. Is that good or bad? What's the
potential there for a coach?  
COACH STRINGER: I asked him to verify Oklahoma's colors and they're red,
right? Good. When you look in the stands and you see the colors, that's great.
In our case, we have to continue to manage it's the Scarlet Knight red. But I
would rather play in a crowded arena than to get home and play in an empty
arena. It is what it is.  
I think our women's game is about growing the sport and trying to get as much
support in different areas of the country. So you might say it's a home
advantage, but just as easily had we been placed in the Trenton region, which
I imagine had we been the No. 1 seed we would have been able to do that and
others would have had to deal with the same thing.  
The guys have gotten to the point where they can take on neutral sites and
that's great, but the women's game is not quite there yet. I'm just happy to
be playing basketball now, period. And I'm sure that the team is. We're really
happy to be playing and we don't care if the game was in Iceland, we're just
happy to play.  
  
Q. Coach, you've seen the kids take hold of what you're teaching, and before
we came here you said that Monday was the first opportunity for them to see
exactly what you've been preaching. Has it been a slow process? Or was there a
moment? Was there something where you said "now they get it? Now they see it?"
  
COACH STRINGER: We had a "now you see it, now you don't" moment most of the
time. You didn't know who you were looking at. I think you remember a game
where we had Tennessee down by 20, lost the game. We've lost several games by
two or three points.  
We have sputtered, and had various players that would show up in one game but
not in another. So we were never able to have all five hitting on the same
cylinder at the same time. We believed, as has happened in years past, that we
would come together.  
Generally our teams begin to play what we call Scarlet Knight basketball, but
with so many freshmen, I don't know that they knew what Scarlet Knight
basketball was, because if you did, you would know you address defense first
and you would do it day in and day out in practice and always.  
Then you're looking for offensive execution. But we didn't do those things and
it had to do with us in a lukewarm way accepting any of the things that we
were trying to teach. But I think that it got really desperate after we lost
our game to DePaul.  
We picked it up with Notre Dame, and it was obvious we had lost way too many
games, far more than what we were used to losing and we were losing them by
two and three points. Some days I was upset and took the team out, as was the
case for Syracuse and didn't put the starters in. As I said to the team, if
you want to lose a game, I'll help you lose it. And that's what I did.  
To me it's not that we win or lose, but that we play the game in a certain
way, because I've come to understand that it has to be played in a certain way
in order to win at a championship level.  
When we began to embrace the small things that make the big difference, that
is defense, rebounding, taking care of the ball better, recognizing time,
situation, and score, and that we would do anything as long as we won as a
team, it was important.  
I think that everybody felt so bad that we began to look at ourselves and to
see what could we do and how can we be a better team? Because no one enjoyed
losing.  
We were too many individuals without realizing it, perhaps. But when you get
desperate, you start to reach for a raft, and I just remember the moment for
me was when prior to our Seton Hall game, they had had a meeting and they had
a cheer that said "trust. We're all we have!"  
And it was important that we did understand that because prior to that, we
probably thought as individuals each person can do their own thing and we can
pull it out. But I thought they got really scared. And I came to be the bearer
of bad messages.  
So I don't know that they took what I had to say as seriously as they did when
they began to read, you know, in the paper -- you know how they do the
Internet and all those other things, and they began to realize they were in
trouble and we needed to step it up. From that point forward they have never
looked back.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH STRINGER: It has to do with youth. Even though we are split between
upper classmen, we have as many freshmen as we have upper classmen and we
needed leadership to win.  
  
Q. You see any similarities between the way that you play and the way that
Purdue plays?  
COACH STRINGER: Actually a lot of similarities. I think Purdue is aggressive
defensively. They push the ball down the floor and they have a lot of sets
that are similar, and Coach Versyp has done an outstanding job.  
And I remember her being a great player at Purdue and she does a great job of
motivating her players to play at the highest level. And I'm sure that it's
her own pride having been with Indiana basketball, they're playing at Purdue,
she now has a player or two that have been at Indiana, and of course the
Purdue fans give great support to their team.  
Offensively as well as defensively I see a lot of things that are similar, so
it's not going to be easy, but, yes, we are similar, they do take care of the
ball.  
  
Q. Coach, your team has played very well in the last few games. You've been
talking about playing hard against Connecticut and smart, but you didn't play
particularly smart against Louisville, but you played hard.  
Are you concerned, even though you guys have gone forward that the
inconsistencies that have dogged you all year might be lurking this weekend?  
COACH STRINGER: Well, I wish you hadn't said that, but you always have to know
that. It's almost like if you get burned once, you get nervous when you get
near the stove, even though you did pretty good before.  
Obviously that's always possible. But I'm hoping that we remember -- I have a
feeling that I didn't think we would play consistent long enough for us to
know that this is the way we play. When you play a certain way, as soon as you
start to veer off that path, you can correct yourself quickly and you know,
oh, we're in trouble, let's stop.  
I shared that in the Louisville game, I thought we played hard but we didn't
play smart. We did play smart and hard in Connecticut, but we needed
consistent play from people who had played consistently. For example, Kia had
a spectacular game. And if we had the play from everybody else playing the way
they can play, the outcome could have been different.  
Right now we need consistency, and it was important that I knew they felt a
certain way after our win. I was asking them what was the best game they had
played. It was interesting, it was going to be important to me that we didn't
say, you know, maybe a game, maybe five or six, seven games ago where we may
have scored -- they as individuals scored 10, 25 points.  
It was important that they knew they had understood their roles, and I think
that was one of the key issues, is that we didn't understand our roles.  
So when I asked that question, for example, one of them said their best game
was against Auburn, and I said you didn't score as much as you might have
scored, but she began to embrace the parts of the game that are necessary to
her role in functioning as a point guard, because the point guard's role is
never to be the outstanding scorer as such -- if it happens it does, but she
distributed the ball, it was obvious she was calm, she recognized time
situations and she almost had a triple-double because she took good shots, she
always rebounded and she was looking to make things go.  
It was important that I heard that. And from each of them, because they then
talked about the complete game, I bet if I had asked that same question maybe
two weeks into the season, they would have looked at their own individual game
where they may have scored big points but not realize that they had played
their roles.  
We now recognize our role. What's important is that we have amnesia about all
those other bad games we played and like what we saw and try to seek that out
again.  
  
Q. Talk about building the offense from the defense. Is that what happens in
the first couple of rounds?  
COACH STRINGER: We've always believed in our defense creating offense. We
have, as a rule, been confident with our ability to put pressure on opposing
teams and to get ourselves 10, 12 points on any given night.  
We have been down by 18 and come back and wiped that deficit out in about four
minutes. We are confident we can get that done. It requires a tremendous
amount of hard work, but, unfortunately, we also play a game, so we're halfway
going through it, and we look up and we're down by 20 and we have 8 minutes to
go. So we get into this hurry up mode, let's go into our press.  
But we've come just 20 seconds too late, you know? But that's always just been
a key part of our game. But I will say that in the last three or four games,
the press has not been what it has been before. It's not given us at least 10%
of our offense.  
We have executed better, and I'm happy about that, because I don't think that
the press -- the press has not lost -- we have not lost it and it hasn't left
us, but we're executing better and we're getting better shots, more settled in
terms of who is taking the shots. And when the wall is going inside to Kia she
is comfortable.  
She'll see a double when she can make the pass out. She's not trying to rush
it. Epiphanny in some games had to score 25, she is not a selfish player, she
just had to take the shots because nobody else was taking them. It caused us
to be disruptive in our offense and it caused everybody else to stand around,
there was no movement.  
If you look at the Maryland game, that's exactly what was going on. But
everyone has now collectively bought into the fact that they have got to be
offensively effective, each person there has got to do their part, no more or
less.  
So offensively they're all looking when they touch it, they're looking to see
is this me? Can I get this done? And that's important because now it looks as
though no one is under pressure, they're just, you know, they're under
pressure to execute and find the best possible person.  
So I do feel better. I would have liked for us to be able to have been
clicking two weeks ago, that would have been good because I think then we
would know our rhythm.  
I was telling the team the first time that I slept in the same way that I have
always was about two weeks ago. I can't remember the game, but it was a
satisfying win. It was the way that it was played, it wasn't about the score.
I just felt good because I knew that once we embraced that, we knew what it
meant to make good passes.  
You know, some of the strange things, when we're executing, for me to hear
them say, "that was a nice pass" "nice flow, look at the execution" that's
really Greek, had been Greek to this team before. But now they're appreciating
good passes and movement. When you appreciate the game the way it has to be
played then, you know that we'll be okay. We'll be okay in the future in terms
of at least ball movement.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your comments.  
  
(Players enter the room.)  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by our student athletes Kia Vaughn, Brittany
Ray and Epiphanny Prince.  
  
Q. Kia, after four straight Sweet 16s, is this old hat or is there still
something special about this? If so, how does it distinguish itself from the
previous three?  
KIA VAUGHN: It's always special, every year you get to go and attend, because
you know that it's getting smaller and smaller within the great teams. So
we're one of 16.  
This year it's different because I'm a senior, obviously. So we have to go out
and play hard and have fun.  
  
Q. Brittany, Coach keeps on saying you are the unlikeliest of teams and it's
a surprise you are here. Do you feel that way?  
BRITTANY RAY: Uh-uh. I mean, coming from where we did in the beginning of the
season, I can see why she said that. I don't know, it's like a repeat of
freshman year, she said we were the most unlikely team to get to the national
championship, you know?  
It's just been, you know, an up and down season, but I'm fortunate to be in
this position right now because, you know, we've improved so much as a team,
not only on the court but off the court.  
We have become so close-knit and I think that has translated on the court, and
I'm proud that we've gotten this far and I hope we can continue to go further.  
EPIPHANNY PRINCE: I think she said that because of where we came from, from
the beginning of the season and how we improved so much. I think that we knew
if we continued to work hard, then we would be able to get to this point.  
  
Q. Kia, was there a moment in the year where you thought you weren't even
get to the NCAA tournament let alone the Sweet 16?  
KIA VAUGHN: Yeah, definitely. I think throughout the middle of the season,
Coach Stringer kept saying we are not going to get invited, which to me, being
a senior, was like a dagger in my heart.  
I kept asking myself, what could we do? What else are we capable of doing, how
many more games do we need? Everything counted. No matter what, I wanted to
get here and we are.  
So no more celebrating, we have to deal with the business at hand because
we're a team that belongs here.  
  
Q. Kia, you guys had the home court advantage the first few rounds, now
you're coming to a situation, especially when you get through this round and
probably into the next round, you won't have a home court edge. How much of a
difference does that make to you as a player?  
KIA VAUGHN: Home court, first year, it's never been done with us, so it's
nothing new to us being somewhere else, having the opponents being home and
being a higher seed. It comes with mental toughness, and I believe our coach
prepares us well enough that our mind-set is to play the game of basketball
and focus on where we are and make every place a home away from home.  
  
Q. Do you see similarities in the way that you guys play and the way that
Purdue plays?  
BRITTANY RAY: I think we both take great pride in our defense and we like to
run the ball. They run the ball a little bit more than we do, but I think they
like to play a low-post game and then the outside game, and I do see
similarities there.  
  
Q. Epiphanny, the fact that you guys scored 80 in your last game, does that
take a load off of you offensively, knowing that you don't have to do
everything by yourself, knowing that your teammates are chipping and scoring
too?  
EPIPHANNY PRINCE: I think the last couple of games my teammates have been
stepping up and taking shots and giving the team a lot more, so, yeah.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. Best of luck to you tomorrow evening.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your comments?  
COACH VERSYP: We need to get out on the court and shoot around and then we
will be focused for tomorrow night.  
  
Q. What have you seen from Rutgers as of late that's led them to make this
surge?  
COACH VERSYP: I think they're playing very, very good basketball. They've
always been a great defensive team but I think they're clicking on offense
now.  
They have a system that they play but they have players that can make plays
and Prince and Vaughn and Ray is shooting exceptionally well.  
I think they're continuing to build confidence and for them to be able to play
at home was good for them and got momentum going and they had to beat some
tough opponents.  
  
Q. Coach, sounds like from the advance ticket sales that this is going to be
a highly attended tournament. It also sounds like there will be folks that are
OU folks in the stands. I know you don't have to concern yourself with that
the first game. Can you talk about having an arena that is heavily attended in
the regional, and maybe on the flip side is there any concern for a team in a
regional?  
COACH VERSYP: I think it's a huge advantage. I think you saw that around the
country. People said there were upsets. If you think Rutgers was an upset with
Auburn, Michigan State beating Duke on the home court 6 or 7,000 fans. It's
great for women's basketball but there is a home court advantage with that
when you have so many fans that are obviously cheering against you or for you.  
But everybody knows it is what it is. This is women's basketball and this is
NCAA tournament time. But I think if you're used to playing in front of big
crowds, and you're playing, you know, to battle for a chance to get to the
Elite Eight or the Final Four, you have to be mentally tough at this point.  
  
Q. When you were a player at Purdue, Coach Stringer was the Iowa coach. What
do you remember about her Iowa teams? Are you seeing a lot of that when you
watch Rutgers now?  
COACH VERSYP: Coach Stringer is obviously one of the greatest coaches in
women's basketball and has done so much for our sport. As players, you never
think you're going to be able to coach against people that coached against
you.  
She is an amazing person, done an amazing job, she has great point guards, has
great defensive teams. If my memory serves me, I don't know if I remember that
so many years ago, but she is a coach who knows what she wants. She has an
incredible system and she brings in players that do it justice.  
Her and the Rutgers team are playing great basketball right now and we have so
much respect for them.  
  
Q. Coach, Rutgers is known for their defense, they like to hold opponents
under 60. What is it about that defense that's so tough to score against?  
COACH VERSYP: I think they want to slow it down quite a bit. They like to be
in the half-court offense and use the 30-second shot clock, and that will
limit opponents to get fast breaks and a lot of points. I think that is a big
part of it.  
They can press you intently and it's aggressive. But I think they like to
control the tempo and they have held people under 60, and we have done a very
good job on our defense as well, so I think it's going to be a great defensive
battle.  
  
Q. You said that Rutgers is playing very good basketball right now. When you
scout, do you look at the earlier games? Do you look at anything they've done
prior to this period?  
COACH VERSYP: Absolutely. You go back to January, February, then obviously the
games that they've been playing. I think everybody -- you can't be playing
great basketball year-round, maybe UCONN, but we've had major injuries, and
you want to be playing great basketball in February and March because that's
when it matters.  
Even Coach Stringer said it's not where you were, it's where you are going.
And I think we've done the same thing. For them, you go back and see how they
played against the Big East in January and February and see their tournament
run in the Big East tournament as well, and you can just tell when players are
getting out there and playing with confidence and things are just clickin'.  
  
Q. Is that the only March difference, the confidence? Or can you sense that
there was some sort of change?  
COACH VERSYP: I think -- you know, I can't sense their team, I can only speak
of my team. It's a mental aspect, a confidence aspect, it's playing together,
going into second and third gear and I think that's what most coaches feel at
this time but, again, I can't speak for them, I can only talk about what I've
seen and what I've read.  
  
Q. Coach, the Big 10 has been taking a lot of hits nationally this year, but
the league has three teams in the Sweet 16. Your thoughts on the league
getting some credibility back?  
COACH VERSYP: I hope it does get a lot of credibility. I had someone say to me
"I didn't think they were this strong until now," so people didn't respect us,
we had to prove it.  
Now having three of our Big 10 teams in it's going to show that we are a young
league, and getting three in, hopefully people will start recognizing that we
are a power league. Hopefully we're not 5th and 6th in that power league after
this year.  
But, you know, we have to continue to worry about ourselves and do the right
things and hopefully those things will take care of themselves. But when you
have new, young coaches in a young league, and we can do it this year, what
we've done so far, I think it will make an impact in the future and hopefully
people will recognize us a little bit more.  
  
Q. Coach, I think it's a vogue thing on the east to say Purdue hasn't seen
this kind of defense. What would be the thing that you would say that Rutgers
hasn't seen that your team offers?  
COACH VERSYP: I would say our defense. You know, we've been ranked nationally
in the top 20 for our field goal percentage defense and we've kept teams with
56 points, 57 points, so we kinda do the same thing, we play a different
style.  
We've played Big East, ACC and different styles, and we try to do that
especially at Purdue. Our nonconference schedule we play one of the toughest
schedules in the country, and that's to prepare our players for the national
scene, just not the Big 10.  
So I think our defense and our style of sharing the basketball and having
great balanced scoring -- we don't have one go-to player, we have a lot of
balanced scoring.  
  
Q. It sounds like this is going to come down to who controls the tempo, just
to hear you talk and Coach Stringer talking.  
COACH VERSYP: Absolutely, that's going to be a big key. They know we like to
run in transition as much as we can. Last week, playing against UNC, we had to
control the tempo because they wanted to run more than we do, and here we've
got to push that a little bit but that stems with our defense.  
We have to defend and get the board so we can run, but I know it will be a
defensive battle, but I think both programs and both point guards are going to
have to really -- it's in their hands to control that.  
  
Q. FahKara had the nine turnovers, do you break that down in film or are you
confident she won't too it again?  
COACH VERSYP: No, I say a lot to her. Halftime or the time-out. She and I get
very close. But she is the key, she is our energy, our leader, our focus, our
defensive stopper.  
She brings so much to the table that a lot is on her shoulders and she plays
-- her and Lindsay play harder than anybody. She has to calm down and settle
down at times. So there is definitely -- she gets an earful whether it's a
time-out or halftime, where I can have more time to discuss things.  
She is going to make turnovers, we talk about "bad" turnovers, or if there is
such a thing as "good" turnovers, but if somebody picks her pocket and scores,
if it's kicked out-of-bounds, we can set up our defense and we have a lot of
confidence in our defense.  
  
Q. Coach, you told us you were the underdog, why?  
COACH VERSYP: Nobody talks about Purdue, no one thought we would be very good
a couple of years ago and we went to the Elite Eight.  
We don't have the stress, the pressure, we can relax and our kids have a quiet
confidence about them, they're determined. But I don't see a lot of stuff
about Purdue, so it's great.  
  
Q. Was it like that when you were a player?  
COACH VERSYP: Um, no, Purdue was in a major national scene and been there for
a long time, all in the '90s and the 2000s, I think it's media markets, a lot
of different things.  
But we're still one of the top 10 winningest programs in the country. It's
just continuing to have that respect and we're in the Big 10, I think that's
part of it. They always talk about the Big East and the ACC and doing the
things we did this year.  
I hope people will start recognizing the Big 10, now we have Ohio State, IU,
Iowa, Michigan, so many stepping up to the plate. We always talk about you
have to earn everything. Just because there is a name on your jersey doesn't
mean that much. We're playing for the people that played before us.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your comments.  
  
(Players enter the room.)  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by our student athletes, FahKara Malone and
Lindsay Hylton.  
Questions?  
  
Q. FahKara, Coach said she feels like you guys are the underdog. Are you
trying to take that mentality into this weekend?  
FAHKARA MALONE: Yeah, I think so. I think it's less pressure if you go in
there feeling like it's you against the world and to go out there and have fun
together and bond together closer. It's worked for us on the road a lot this
year. She tries to keep that going through the tournament.  
  
Q. Lindsay, do you know Kia from USA basketball? If so, give us a story and
tell us what it's going to be like going against her?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I love Kia, she is a great person. I played with her
for two years, in New Mexico City and in Russia, she is a great friend, it was
a great experience.  
She is very physical and I do know she is a great player. I'm excited to see
her and see how she's been and to catch up. She is a great friend. When I tore
my ACL, she was there to help me and I think it will be an interesting match-
up.  
  
Q. What is it about Rutgers that makes them so good?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I think they're athletic, big, long. Their presence of
being so athletic and large is that they're intimidating. If we play our style
of basketball and execute the game plan, we should be great.  
  
Q. Lindsay and then FahKara. When you look at Rutgers, do you see
similarities at least in mentality, what they try to do and what you guys try
to do?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: Yeah, I think they like to slow things down in certain
situations in a game and we like to do the same thing, we're not a fast-paced
team. There are times to run and times to slow down and execute your offense.
It's a balance of who is going to execute and take care of the ball, we're
both well coached.  
FAHKARA MALONE: Like Lindsay said, they do a good job of controlling the
tempo. They don't look rushed very much in the half-court, so our defense is
going to have to be huge and pressure them as much as we can.  
When they do a fast break, they're efficient at it and their pressing does a
good job for them when they're behind, which is what we try to do sometimes,
so there are a lot of similarities so it will be a battle of wills and who can
execute.  
  
Q. FahKara, when you look at that backcourt, what do you think are the
biggest challenges for you? The keys?  
FAHKARA MALONE: The keys for me are rebounding. They have two stocky guards
that are extremely strong and they do a great job on the boards, and for us to
be successful we have to box out.  
For most of the games, especially against North Carolina, it's the post
players that do a great job of crashing as does their backcourt. They don't
get too far out of control and we have to do a lot of pressure defense and a
lot of boxing out.  
  
Q. For both of you. Do you think your transition game is something that you
can utilize as a strength tomorrow night?  
FAHKARA MALONE: Absolutely. Coach has been stretching that, trying to get out
on the open court but being smart when we do it. Against North Carolina we got
out of control at the beginning, but second half we ran what we wanted to and
slowed it down when we needed to.  
We're very good in the open court in transition. Hopefully we can use that to
our advantage.  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I think it's a matter of knowing when to run, when not
to. Like FahKara said, at times we've been really good and other times we've
been out of control and taking care of the ball and slowing it down when we
have to and other times capitalizing, whether it's a turnover or a fast break.  
  
Q. When you get to this point, do you know the back stories of the teams
that you're facing? Do you read about them, do you know that Rutgers has been
anything in particular this year?  
FAHKARA MALONE: I don't know much about Rutgers, I know they've had an up and
down season, similar to what we've had. What I know is that I've seen them in
the national championship in the Final Four, and I want to be able to push my
team forward in that situation, knowing that they've been here as well as we
have, so we have the experience level that we both have is going to be big in
this situation.  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: Same thing. (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. Lindsay, in the year you were having a free-throw shooting slump, how do
you bring yourself out of it? Do you shoot 100 each day or -- FahKara says no,
but --  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: FahKara! Coach tells us certain weeks when she wants us
to shoot free-throws, to get there and shoot a couple hundred during the week.
Once you miss a couple, it's what makes me go down and you're thinking about
it too much, it's a confidence thing.  
Toward the end I've been able to step up and hit free-throws for the team, and
I think that's building my confidence. Hopefully it won't become an issue here
and in the future. But I was the only one that missed free-throws in the last
game.  
  
Q. FahKara, after you have a nine turnover game like you had Monday night,
what's that conversation like with Coach?  
FAHKARA MALONE: You know, it was weird because I got on the bus and Coach gave
me a hug and said "great game," so I don't know. Against a team like North
Carolina, I don't expect anything less from myself.  
I mean, the game is so fast tempo and that kind of atmosphere, it kinda
happens, even though some were just knocked off my foot, I don't know what
happened there. But I know I have to do a lot better job going against Rutgers
because of the way they play.  
With North Carolina you get so many different possessions that it doesn't seem
as big, but against Rutgers you may only get half of those. Taking care of the
ball is going to be huge for me as much as controlling the tempo for my team.  
  
Q. You talked about experience earlier. Y'all have five 5th-year seniors?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: No, three.  
  
Q. What kind of a difference does that make? What do 5th year seniors
bring?  
FAHKARA MALONE: A lot of stories. They bring experience because they've been
in the tournament almost every year they've been here, so they can tell us how
it is, and they can show us different ways to handle different situations.  
I know a big thing, not only from those five seniors but from the fact that we
have three juniors as well, our starting lineup has all been to the Elite
Eight and that's huge for us. Knowing that we've been here with all these
people helps us to be more confident in what we're doing.  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I think not only confidence, just helping out the
younger classmen and helping them through this situation because it's all new
to them. So helping them through it and teaching them.  
Sometimes they have the nerves and may not have a great game, but we're here
to talk to them and help them to just play their style of basketball.  
  
Q. Lindsay, the ticket sales for this thing are going through the roof right
now. As players, would you rather play in front of a crowd even though they
may be rooting against you? Or would you rather have a more neutral setting?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I actually like to play in front of fans no matter who
they are rooting for. A dead atmosphere is not good and it lulls us to sleep.
We've played in situations like that before.  
Having fans, you want to hush 'em up and you want to play better. Having the
fans is great, no matter what.  
FAHKARA MALONE: Like Lindsay said, it's nice because even against fans that
aren't going for you, you just get that shot and that quiets them for the next
two minutes or something. So it's exciting whether they're cheering for you or
against you.  
  
Q. FahKara, your coach, she seems to have a little bit of a chip that you're
the underdog because everybody keeps on talking about Rutgers and you don't
get the same media attention. Do you feel that way? Do you feel that the Big
10 doesn't get credibility, that people talk about Rutgers and not you?  
FAHKARA MALONE: I think so, she brings that to our attention because we don't
focus on the media or anything like that because one day they're for you and
one day they're not.  
We try to focus on ourselves and what we're doing. A lot of times I feel like
the other team gets more credit than we do, but I know it helps Coach and she
feeds off the rest of us to go out there and want to prove ourselves every day
to everybody.  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: I think just like she said, it's fuel to our fire.
We'll get some media information and she'll show it to us and use it as
motivation. Nobody thought of us last week, so -- and here we are. Anything
can happen. Even though we have the higher seed, that doesn't mean anything.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you for your comments. Best of luck to you
tomorrow night.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Coale from Oklahoma, your opening
thoughts?  
COACH COALE: Thank you so much, thrilled to be back in Oklahoma City. Thrilled
to be still competing in the NCAA tournament and excited about everything
except that weather we have outside!  
  
Q. Coach, I was wondering if you could talk about Pitt's size on the inside
and how obviously you have size with Courtney, but talk about that match-up
unfolding.  
COACH COALE: I think it's interesting that you asked me that question first
because we just passed by the Pitt team stretching in the hallway, seriously,
they're huge!  
You watch 'em on film and you see that they have interior size, but walkin'
past 'em in the hallway caught my attention. They're powerful, obviously they
play in a tremendous conference, so they're accustomed to facing big, powerful
centers, they know how to own the paint and guard their area and attack and
score there.  
We play in a great league as well, and we've faced some great centers as well,
so it won't be necessarily anything different from what we've seen, but they
are big.  
  
Q. Can you give us an update on Amanda. Can you talk about the challenges
that Shavonte poses to you?  
COACH COALE: Amanda is day-to-day, we will go through shooting today, as much
as we can limit her no nongame activity. The more extensive she can be in game
time activity.  
Shavonte is as good as any guard in the country. The greatest player
comparison would be Andrea Riley, she has a nice pull-up jumper, and she gets
to the pro line, if she is not number one in the country for attempts, she is
right there, averages around 10 free-throws a game, so a real conundrum for
you defensively to figure out how to contain and contest her.  
  
Q. Obviously Whitney is back, but I wanted to ask you about the fact that
when a player goes out of the lineup and say out for three or four games and
then comes back, maybe disruption is not the right word, but how does the team
go through replacing the player and playing without her and then she comes
back and you have to reacclimate.  
COACH COALE: You have to continue to manufacture rhythm, and that's incredibly
important at this time of the year. If you think about what Nyeshia Stevenson
has been asked to do, move into the starting lineup after having an effective
season in the role of the sixth man, she shared the award of the sixth man
with Melissa Jones in the Big 12 conference, move a kid to a starting role, we
need you to make threes, run the lanes, use your speed to get to the rim, but
it feels different. It just feels different.  
It's one of those subtleties about the game. So we asked her to move into a
starting role, and then when Whitney comes back we move her back into the six-
man role, and she gets accustomed to that, and Amanda goes out and we put her
right back into the starting lineup again.  
So there has been an assembly line of rhythm creation going on during our
practices, and Nyeshia deserves credit for the way she has stayed mentally
tough through it all. Whitney deserves credit for being the master of her own
confidence, her own state of mind.  
It is not an easy thing to be a true freshman, break your finger, come back in
and be asked to pick up where you left off. I think what we saw from Whitney
was a kid trying to make up for the games she missed all at once. Everything
went too fast, every cut, every shot, every use of screen, even every
defensive dig step, that was an over exaggeration of everything.  
Because of the minutes she has been able to log in the past three or four
games, she has played back into a nice rhythm and that's great news for us.  
  
Q. Sherri, I wanted to ask you about a couple of bench players who have
improved their play with injured players, and that's Vining and
Roethlisberger.  
COACH COALE: Absolutely, Jenny came in and anchored us from behind the 3-point
line at the close of season and in the Big 12 tournament as well. So I think
that confidence she gained in those minutes, very important minutes in big-
time games make us tougher here at tournament time.  
And I think Carlee's readiness, which stems from great, great practice to be
able to step in and give what you say we needed in Amanda's absence, we need
her size and length, that softened us at the 4 spot, even though Amanda
typically plays a three.  
As we brought and moved Amanda down, when we lost her, we lost a 4 as well, so
Carlee and Jenny continue to play big roles there, and I think their
performance tomorrow night will be critical.  
  
Q. Sherri, you talked about the kids being able to sleep in their beds an
extra night. Does it feel any different that you are playing so close to home
at this point in the tournament?  
COACH COALE: It feels a little bit different today because we just got her,
but the thing about it, it doesn't matter where you are, and to a great extent
it doesn't matter as much who you are playing as it does can you be the best
you can be? That's the whole sense of the NCAA tournament.  
If you can continue to call forth your continued play in the tournament,
that's the reason we're all here is because we have done that. I don't think
it matters where you do that. As soon as we take the floor, it will feel like
the Sweet 16 and we will know what is required of us.  
  
Q. Sherri, these crowds the next few games, if they are as big as they look
like they could be, you guys could shatter records for a regional. What would
that mean to you to see that possibly happening in Oklahoma City and in
Oklahoma?  
COACH COALE: Well, I hope you're right. I haven't seen any projections, so I
don't know what the attendance expectations are. I know what they are
internally. But it would be incredibly rewarding.  
And I speak for a moment as the president of the WBCA and not necessarily just
as the head coach at the University of Oklahoma when I say one of our
missions, maybe the center most, is to continue to grow this game in terms of
exposure and attendance, and at the top of that list would be student athlete
experience.  
When a student athlete wins the right to play in the NCAA tournament, and
especially earns the right to compete in the Sweet 16, you should feel it in
your bones. I watched the games on television this morning, and I felt sad for
those teams to have to compete in an environment where it doesn't feel like
the NCAA tournament.  
Hopefully the people of Oklahoma will fill up the Ford Center Sunday and
Tuesday. And for all of the student athletes competing at this site, they will
have the ultra competitive experience.  
  
Q. Sherri, talk about the second half you guys had against Tech and what you
hope will propel you into this game?  
COACH COALE: I felt like we got lost in every possession of the second half
and I thought that was the difference. So much at this stage in the game is
being lost in the moment.  
I think forgetting about trying to win and focussing on the play at hand is
important. I felt like in the first half we started off great and missed a few
shots. It sucked the life out of us and we looked around and start thinking,
oh no, what if we don't do this, what if this happens? Uh-Oh.  
And fortunately we could shut those up and talk about it at halftime, and I
thought Danielle's leadership, she and Whitney together, their body language,
their facial expressions, and the way they led their team was just fantastic.  
And we hung on to the lead and still missed shots down the stretch, shots
we're going to have to make Sunday night in order to advance, but I liked the
way we played together, the way we competed.  
  
Q. For those of us who don't get to see Courtney play all the time or hardly
ever live, talk about the things she does really well, how would you describe
her as a player? She has good size and whatnot, but what are the things she
exceeds at and makes her such a tough match-up?  
COACH COALE: Gifted hands, I always start there, she can catch anything. She
is a tremendous rebounder partly because she has the gift of touch and she can
tip it to herself and come up with it. Agile, graceful for a kid her size and
unbelievably strong and powerful.  
She is relentless, and if you commit to blocking her out as many teams have
done throughout this season and the previous three as well, many times we have
seen opponents to not even having the player responsible for Courtney try to
rebound, just guard her, keep her from getting to the rim.  
Even when you do that it, becomes a difficult thing to sustain because she
wears you out. She is so relentless in her pursuit of the basketball, and I
think that's what makes her most dangerous.  
  
Q. Sherri, tomorrow is going to be quite a day for Oklahoma University
basketball, your game in Oklahoma City, Jeff's squad in the regional squad for
a right to the Final Four, can you remember a day like this?  
COACH COALE: I don't know if it gets better than that, you might have to ask
Joe that question, we thought our men were fabulous last night, dismantled a
Syracuse team.  
We would like to be a little more focused on Pitt at the moment. They will be
playing U of Carolina, but that's why you have TiVo, we'll go home and watch
it later.  
  
Q. Sherri, maybe you can put your WBCA hat back on. It seems remarkable in
the men's tournament if somebody was playing an hour away from home, the other
team will be raising holy heck about that. And in the women's tournament there
have been some teams lose on another team's court. The fact about growing the
game and everybody kinda goes ahead and does it and there is no complaining,
is that a remarkable thing about the players and coaches, that they just say,
okay, this is what we got to do and they do it?  
COACH COALE: Well, remarkable, yes. I think -- I think first of all you have
to step back and understand from a big, open perspective what our mission is,
what we're trying to accomplish.  
We want a fantastic atmosphere for our student athletes, these young women
deserve that. At the same time we're trying to grow the game and increase
attendance, we're trying to televise games, we have a lot of objectives that
are trying to be accomplished.  
Here is what you need to look at, though. When you look at our tournament,
yes, people could be hollerin', if you will, about the fact that Duke had to
go to Michigan State and they got upset there. Well, you know what? Notre Dame
had to play in South Bend and they got beat there, too.  
The list almost evened itself out, and I think this is where the public makes
a case that's not realistic is if there are 15,000 people screaming in an
arena, it might become home court advantage.  
Sometimes they don't necessarily present themselves that way, so it's not as
if that particular scenario, the one that we hope happens tomorrow night, it's
not as if that is the case everywhere you go. But I think the important part,
Wendell, is coaches and student athletes are striving to have not a
competitive, equitable NCAA tournament, but we're striving to improve our
game.  
And you have to have parity, and it's a gingerly fence that you stride upon in
terms of building that. What we have seen this year is a lot of stuff we
haven't seen before, look at the upsets, home court or not, and that's not
really the issue. There were more new faces, more new teams going deeper in
the tournament this year than I can remember. That is a positive reflection on
the growth of our sport.  
  
Q. Sherri, talk about Shavonte and the problems she poses for you guys.  
COACH COALE: She's really good. Really good. I like her game, I like the way
she not only gets the production from herself and expects the production of
herself, but the way she involves her teammates with her.  
I think that makes her incredibly dangerous and she is not surrounded by four
guys that watch her play, she is surrounded by four guys that play with her,
which is why Pitt is in the Sweet 16. I think it's her ability to get to the
rim that gives you some problems, and I don't know that we've seen a kid
elevate on a jump shot quite the way she does.  
She is a good-sized guard, and when she stops on a dime and jumps up, she is
over you and you have to bring help that has size. She is a total package,
particularly offensively, and she competes on both ends of the floor, but
offensively she is a problem.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your comments. Good luck
tomorrow.  
  
(Players enter the room.)  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Danielle Robinson and Courtney Paris,
Whitney Hand will be here momentarily. Questions for you're student athletes?  
  
Q. Danielle, talk about you guys playing so close to home, sleeping in your
own beds, does it feel different being at this point in the NCAA and being in
the comforts of home?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: We're definitely excited to be in the City, but then again
it's like being on the road, because we're not sleeping in our own beds, we're
in a hotel, but we have the comfort of having tons of our fans in the stands,
and I think that's what makes this section so different.  
  
Q. Courtney, if you are able to, can you go through the season in segments a
little bit, preconference, conference, the postseason and chart the team's
progress along the way?  
COURTNEY PARIS: Oh my gosh. Well, I think -- this is going to be general, but
we started off pretty well. Our defense, I know startin' off we had a little
bit of defensive pride issues, and I think we've improved on that as the
season has gone on.  
Had some hard games up front, lost to UNC at home by 1, had that Connecticut
game, learned a lot about ourselves there. I don't know, we just keep trying
to get better every day.  
  
Q. Whitney, what was it like having the injury, sitting out and then coming
back? Was it as much a mental challenge as getting healthy and getting your
hand healed to come back?  
WHITNEY HAND: I think so. Anytime you're out of the season, it's more
frustrating and you're chomping at the bit to get back.  
At the same time, it was good for me personally to get things back in
perspective. I think for everybody we just -- I mean, we have all grown
together these last couple of weeks through the injuries, and we had many
injuries and having to fight through those mentally and getting over that made
us stronger as a whole.  
  
Q. Courtney and Danielle, talk a little bit about how important the bench
play is going to be this weekend.  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think that's real important and it's been our X-factor,
Jenny has been knocking down shots and Carlee had two really good games. We're
going to need that.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Especially in this game, it's going to be great for us, for
Nyeshia to hit shots.  
  
Q. Whitney, Coach said when you did come back, it was like you wanted to get
all of those games back at once. Was that the feeling? It was tough to get
back into the rhythm that you were playing in before?  
WHITNEY HAND: Yeah. The first couple of games were terrible, and I think it
was just because I was going so fast and trying to speed things up, and it was
the Big 12 tournament plus not playing for two weeks and the adrenaline, so it
was obvious that I was inexperienced in that. But I'm glad we are here now and
it's a new start.  
  
Q. Danielle, talk about Shavonte Zellous, and Coach Coale compared her to
Andrea Riley, is that what you would say?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I think she has a great shot like Andrea Riley, she is a
great player, been through it multiple times, and she is a leader for her and
they feed off of her, so I think her demeanor and the way she plays definitely
sparks their team.  
  
Q. Danielle, the Noble Center, you are probably excited about the men's
performance last night, are you going to get to watch the North Carolina game
tomorrow?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: We get back like four from somewhere and get to watch the
game. Definitely excited, they played extremely well last night and we're
proud of 'em and ready to join 'em.  
  
Q. Courtney, you obviously are one of the more dominant inside players in
the country. Can you talk about Pitt's size and whether or not you like
matching on them, 6-5, 6-6, and 6-1, do you like matching up against players
like that?  
COURTNEY PARIS: Definitely not going to have a choice tomorrow. We were
walking by 'em in the hall and they're bigger and taller than I thought they
were, but we have that size in our league, Kansas has a really tall girl so
we're used to that stuff.  
  
Q. Whitney, you're sitin' up there with a couple of cagey veterans, a year
ago you were in high school and now you're sitting in a press conference in
the Sweet 16, what does that feel like?  
WHITNEY HAND: It's weird, my mom called me last night and she was cryin', and
she was -- I remember we were -- don't quote me on that, please --  
THE MODERATOR: It's a little late!  
WHITNEY HAND: My sisters were sad that Kansas State lost out because they are
huge fans, and I remember -- all of us remember -- it was weird because I
didn't make a bracket this year, and she was getting emotional and it was a
little weird. (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. Danielle, how does this team play a 40-minute game in the postseason? You
had two first halves you would like to have back in the tournament and two
fantastic second halves, but what can you guys do to turn it on from the
start?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: It's more mental than anything. From the beginning you have
to mentally focus and prepare. Our coaches do a great job scouting the team,
it's all about us making the decision to come out there and get a good jump.  
  
Q. Danielle, is it a distraction playing this close to home?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I don't think so at all. It's great that our families get
to come out and be here to support us, along with the thousands of fans that
are going to come out. I think we are excited about the opportunity that we
have to play so close to home.  
  
Q. Courtney, you guys talked about wanting to get back here because of the
fans and after the way you went out in the Big 12. Talk about that.  
COURTNEY PARIS: That was last year, we wanted to get back here. I think we
have great fans, not just our fans but women's basketball fans in general, and
it will be cool to play in front of them and it's great that we have this
opportunity.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much and good luck tomorrow night.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Coach Berenato from Pittsburgh,
congratulations on a great season. Your opening comments?  
COACH BERENATO: On behalf of the University of Pittsburgh, we are excited to
be here. It's great to make the Sweet 16 the second year in a row. It's
something that a lot of people are surprised about but we aren't.  
We feel that we have a really good team, a team that really doesn't have any
stars. We are just a well-balanced program. I just want to thank everyone here
in Oklahoma as well as we just came from -- where did we come from, Seattle,
right? Yeah, Seattle. And the University of Washington. The NCAA committee and
all the schools and the host communities. They've been great.  
Our host, Caroline, has been wonderful, so to whoever picked here, and she has
been a blessing for us and we had great soul food last night, we treated her,
it was definitely out of her realm, but we like doing different things. We are
excited about the game tomorrow night and excited about being here and we
appreciate all of you being here.  
  
Q. Coach, Shavonte was lightly recruited out of high school. Why the heck
was she so lightly recruited and what did you guys see in here that put you on
to her?  
COACH BERENATO: My associate head coach Jeff Williams is the one who found out
about her. He saw her and he has a great eye for talent. He can look and he
has great vision.  
He just said this kid was going to be special. She was a great track athlete,
M.V.P. of her track team for four years in a row. He had been in touch with
her and said we have to go see this kid. So we saw her in open gym and we took
a chance, but you have to remember that we only had six wins when I got to
Pitt, they had three wins, so we doubled it, but it was a whopping six wins.  
We told her she could come and make the program and develop the program and
she was into it. She was like, "how many games did you win?" And I said "six."  
But it's not like, for us, anyone -- my eighth grade daughter could have
helped me. We had to get recruits, it was in the spring, we were starting a
new year and we needed people to take some scholarships.  
We love her personality and she has a smile the size of California, so we
thought we would like her.  
  
Q. Agnus, I guess by this point you're used to playing on the road almost in
these games. Would you talk about coming to Oklahoma City to play Oklahoma?  
COACH BERENATO: I mean, you know, we knew we were -- you have to go on the
road if you're not hosting, so we knew we were going on the road and the
thought of being close wasn't even a possibility for us. We just -- I really
thought we were going to go back to New Mexico, that's where we went last
year, Albuquerque, I never thought about Seattle, but when it came on the
board -- and honestly we couldn't see it, you couldn't see where you were
going.  
When we found out it was Seattle, it was like, okay, fine, and then where do
you go from there, Oklahoma. Okay, fine. And my team has done exceptionally
well because the Seattle trip was a six-and-a-half hour flight out and it's a
3-hour time difference. Then we flew back home and the kids went to classes.  
And then to come here, I missed geography in school and I thought it was an
hour flight, it was almost three hours. We had a charter, it was three hours,
and it was like "are you kidding me?" It has been rough.  
When you look at other teams, they've had home seeds or been up the road
apiece and they've come back home. Honestly, it's all part of the NCAA, but it
makes it exciting and special. We handle whatever we're given, and I think
that's what you do in life.  
Basketball is just like the game of life, and businessmen and businesswomen,
we travel all the time. We travel to California to see a two-hour basketball
game of a 17 year old and get on the red eye to come back home, so why not do
it to get into the Sweet 16?  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the match-up between Pepper Wilson and Courtney
Paris.  
COACH BERENATO: Obviously Courtney Paris is an All-American and averaging 16
and 14, and Courtney has a twin sister that's her side kick and she is playing
at home. Pepper Wilson is a freshman and she doesn't have a sister that's a
side kick, so what is there to talk about?  
I think that Courtney is really good. I like Pepper, she is a freshman, she is
learning, getting better every single game. She has played in the rugged, Big
East conference and played against some of the best talent in the nation, Tina
Charles, Candice Bingham, Tina Vaughn are some of the best in the nation.  
She hasn't played against Courtney Paris, but I don't think it's a Courtney
Paris show, it's her team against our team.  
  
Q. Coach, as you've looked at Oklahoma, what do you see Whitney Hand, how
she fits in and the things she brings to the table for Oklahoma?  
COACH BERENATO: I think Whitney is a great player and she adds a lot to their
team and she gives them the balance of the outside threat.  
When you listen to these games, and I saw the game with Georgia Tech and they
talked about she was all that, and I guess she was a rookie in her conference,
rookie of the year, and she was shooting well and the game before she hurt her
hand. She was like after that 4 for 16 and by a lot of people's standards,
that's not so bad. She cracked it open against Georgia Tech, and I think she
allows them to have an inside/outside threat, and any good basketball team has
that.  
So as a freshman, she has stepped up and Whitney looks like a kid that enjoys
the game. I've only seen her on video, but I like watching her play because
she has fun, smiles, I think that's really nice, and she has a hell of a shot.  
  
Q. Coach, when you've dealt with a player going out four or five games as a
starter, I think people don't understand what happens to -- because you bring
somebody else in and that person was a reserve and somebody takes their place.
Can you talk about in general when a team loses a starter, they adjust and
then that starter comes back, how disruptive that can be in general?  
COACH BERENATO: Well, I don't know that it's disruptive, I just think it's
probably -- you went a couple of nights without dessert, and all of the sudden
you got dessert again. It's kind of like you're in time-out, maybe. I don't
look at it in a negative way.  
Things happen for a reason. I feel like maybe there was a reason her being
out. I know it killed her, it probably killed Sherri Coale, but maybe the rest
of the team was like, hey, we need this kid. And I think what happens to group
dynamics, you're right in that they continued to build and grow, but
unfortunately the person that's injured is on the sideline.  
So they're kind of feeling a little left out and they're not in on all the
little jokes, and do you know what I'm saying? They can't be, every time the
coach gets mad, "get on the line and run" and the kids are like, what, your
feet aren't broke? Because there are group dynamics like that. I'm just
sayin'.  
So the people that are working hard are like "you're so lucky" and she's like,
"you're kidin' me!"  
It's almost like the co-worker that is sick, you're like, yeah, right,
whatever, but you really need them. You need them to come back in, and your
team has to move on, but the coach has to do a great job in the balance of
reintegrating that person within the system, because women have feelings and
those feelings get in the way.  
  
Q. Coach, I think you and Gary Blair went to the same media school by the
way.  
COACH BERENATO: I love Gary Blair.  
  
Q. He comes here for games.  
COACH BERENATO: Gary Blair, we have vacationed before, without family and
stuff. It's like on "You Tube," know what I'm saying? I can tell you a really
funny story about Gary Blair.  
  
Q. My question was going to be about the guard match-ups, because you have
veteran talented guards, Oklahoma's guards are more youthful. Talk about the
match-up and how you see that playing into tomorrow.  
COACH BERENATO: I think that D-Rob is an awesome player and she makes Oklahoma
go. She loves the transition game and pushed it into the paint. She likes to
penetrate and kick, or if she gets into the paint, she is going to create
things.  
At the same time, Xenia Stewart for us is so focused and driven, and she has
size that maybe can come back, like D-Rob has to offer, the key for us is to
limit her explosiveness in the paint.  
And I think Shavonte Zellous is playing at the top of her game, she is an All-
American. My sports information person, Mindy, told me she has scored more
points in the NCAA in the regional or the first and second round than any
other person in the NCAA. She doesn't even know that, you know what I'm
saying?  
It's like she plays because she loves the game. She really enjoys our team.
It's not about her, she'll do whatever the team needs her to do. That's how I
look at the guards from Oklahoma. I think their team is good as well as Hand.  
She'll do the same thing, she likes that 3-point shot, she is going to hangout
there and shoot that, but if they need something else from her, I think she'll
do it. I think they're going to be a great match-up.  
  
Q. In these first two games you talked about the tempo of the game and how
you guys would like to speed it up. Do you feel the same way going into this
game? Or is this a different theme athletically? How do you see the pace and
the tempo going?  
COACH BERENATO: Paul, it's great you're here, so to my Pittsburgh people, we
give you a special shout out! How about this weather, it's worse than home!
We're not happy about that you guys -- no, I'm just kidding.  
I think the tempo is going to be really important but you know me well enough,
Paul, to know that we are who we are. I am who I am, I'm not going to change.
Somebody might tell me to change, and I'm like okay for a second, and then I
go back to who I am.  
Both teams like to push, play up-tempo, push in transition, we're both
aggressive defensive teams, whether it's man-to-man or a combination of zones
and man-to-man and I think that's -- when you get to the Sweet 16 and you get
to this level, I don't think anyone is changing the way they're playing
because the way you play got you here, so why are you going to change?  
You've got to go with it and you're going to try to adjust to what Oklahoma
might do or Oklahoma might make adjustments to what we do, but at the same
time to change tempo, no, because that's not what got us here.  
  
Q. Are they similar to anyone that you played in the Big East? Do they
remind you of anyone?  
COACH BERENATO: You know, that's like when my kid asks me to tell her about
patterns, I don't know. I don't think like that. I don't know, you know? I
just think in the Big East we're the best conference in the country. Bottom
line. We play against everything. Running teams, against slow-down Villanova
teams, against inside/out teams, Louisville made it to the Elite 8, we have
four teams in the Sweet 16 and we have one that has advanced.  
So I would say, sure we're playing against someone like that, like I'm trying
to think -- no one is like Connecticut, they're really good. We play some
teams from out here, we played Texas A&M, we lost by 2 possessions, we played
Maryland, beat them by 30, here in the Sweet 16. We've played a lot of teams
that are here, Louisville twice.  
We've played Rutgers, beat Rutgers there, that was a tough environment and I
will say that the Big East has prepared us for our environment. I think that's
one thing that's important, you know.  
You go to Connecticut and it's sold out, whether it's 11,000 or 17,000, you go
to "The Rack," which is Rutgers, which was in the top-three toughest places to
play in the nation, and we were able to get a win there in a hostile crowd.
Louisville had 12,000 people. Of course, all for Louisville!  
We played Gonzaga and Montana with their home crowds, but my 28 people were
really loud! We brought the house down. It was awesome! So I don't know, but I
think every team in the Big East has good guards, people coming in off the
bench, that's why I think we're productive and that's why we have four teams
left.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your comments.  
COACH BERENATO: Thank you to all of you. On behalf of the University of
Pittsburgh but also for our game and unless you guys take your time and your
time is the most valuable thing you have, unless you take your time to write
about women's basketball, our game won't grow and our game is an awesome game.
So thank you very much for being here.  
  
(The players enter the room.)  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by our student athletes from Pittsburgh.  
  
Q. Shavonte, I was asking Coach about your recruitment, and I was curious if
you might be willing to reflect a little bit. You're on this four-year
journey, not done with it, but when you think back on it, can you talk about
your development as a player, lightly recruited and now where you are in your
senior season?  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: I would say my freshman year was a long year. As you know, I
didn't play due to the transition of high school to college. But I think I
learned, and I had to learn really quick. I think my maturity level has grown
from my freshman year to now.  
I think my success comes within my teammates. I think they're being here with
me for all four of my years has helped me. Xenia helped keep me on track, and
I think the coaches have done a great job with that, too.  
And it was a matter of me getting into the gym, working on my game day in, day
out. And Coach Shea, who is now at the University of Connecticut, helped me,
too, when I was working out over the summer, and she helped guide me into
doing things the right way.  
  
Q. Shavonte, it seems like you guys are playing a string of road games. Talk
about what it's been like in the tournament and when you expect facing
Oklahoma so close to their campus?  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: From a team standpoint, we're used to it. Coming to the Big
East we had to travel to UCONN, Rutgers, Louisville, so traveling is not a big
thing for us, we enjoy traveling, to be honest.  
We're well prepared, we come into the game with confidence and we know
Oklahoma is a great team and they have a great post player Courtney Paris, and
she has a great supporting cast. We're just glad to play. That's it.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the match-up that you guys are going to be facing
tomorrow? You obviously have experience and talent at guard. Oklahma is more
on the youthful, talented at guard. Talk about the match-up of guards in this
game tomorrow.  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: I think the match-up is going to be something to watch. Both
players get to the free-throw line, very active on the defensive end, there
will be a lot of pressure, so I think it's going to be a good match-up for
everyone to see.  
A lot of explosiveness, a lot of quickness, a lot of leadership and key play
among the guards in the perimeter and trying to get the post into the game as
well. It's all going to be something to watch.  
  
Q. Xenia, when you've watched film to get ready for Oklahoma, what have you
seen from Whitney Hand and what does she bring to the table for Oklahoma that
makes her a good player?  
XENIA STEWART: Whitney has a very good shot, we got to know where she's at.
From the videos we watched we can't let her get a shot off. But I feel as
though she can't get the ball without the point guard penetrating and drawing
in the defense, so if we can know where she is at all times, we can limit her
touches.  
We're not saying we are going to shut her down completely, and she is wanting
to score, but we're going to try to disrupt her a little bit in her game.  
  
Q. Shayla, talk about the prospect of playing -- sounds like it's going to
be a packed crowd, but chances are good it's going to be people wearing
Crimson not Pitt colors. Can you talk about that?  
SHAYLA SCOTT: I think Washington helped us prepare, playing both Gonzaga and
being in that environment, when you have a lot of people rooting against you
helps you to stay together as a team, helps you be calm and listen to your
coaches.  
We're well prepared for that and we've played at Louisville and Connecticut,
where a lot of fans aren't rooting for you, and I think that's helped us to
become prepared.  
  
Q. Shavonte, could you talk about your men's team and y'all are here. Do you
have much contact with them? Are you watching? Are they watching you? Talk
about that.  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: I don't know if Shayla wants me to say that, but she keeps
in contact with the men's team pretty good. (Chuckles.) But we keep in contact
with them every blue moon, they're focused on trying to make it to the Final
Four and we're trying to focus on getting to the Elite 8, so there is not that
much contact besides Shayla, but that's about it.  
THE MODERATOR: Shayla, did you want to follow up?  
SHAYLA SCOTT: My boyfriend is Gilbert Brown, so I talk to him about the game,
give him pointers, and they're always in the background being loud, and
they're screaming, but we're all in the same position and it's exciting to
both be fighting for a national championship.  
  
Q. Shayla, for a long time Pitt's men's team has been growing in popularity
and y'all have been doing the same thing. Has that been cool to be a part of,
as they've grown and gotten attention, or are you trying to aspire to the same
level that they have?  
SHAYLA SCOTT: We have come so far, they had six wins when I came here, it's an
enjoyable thing. We have media people coming to interview us, our games are on
TV now, Shavonte being an All-American is exciting and getting into the
tournament three years in a row, it's great.  
I'm just happy that we have made the program as successful, and
congratulations to our men's team, who are doing well this week. We're happy
for them as well. But I think mostly our fan base has grown due to our success
and I feel like we're getting to the level that they are at.  
  
Q. Shayla, follow up on the women versus men deal. If there was a men's team
playing Oklahoma -- like if the Oklahoma men were playing here in Oklahoma
City and it was the Pitt men, they would be screaming and hollering about the
home court advantage, this is terrible, there were a lot of teams that end up
-- Duke gets beat on Michigan State's court. How do you guys approach it
mentally to say, hey, it doesn't matter, we've got to go out and play. I know
the Big East prepares you, but this is supposed to be a neutral tournament and
a lot of folks end up playing on a home court, how do you deal with that?  
SHAYLA SCOTT: We just try to go out and play our game. We like a lot of people
rooting against us and we're like, hey, why not? We want to go out there and
upset them. You know what I mean? They're close to home and we want to be
like, you know, we can play in this environment and we can take care of
business.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, best of luck to you tomorrow.
