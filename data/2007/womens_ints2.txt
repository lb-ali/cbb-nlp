# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 3, 2007

  

### [Essence Carson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17191)

### [C. Vivian Stringer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16227)

  
_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Stringer and
then go to questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH STRINGER: What can I say? Tennessee played great. I think that we played
hard. Tried to play hard a little bit too late. We needed to come out maybe a
little more aggressive and it might have made a difference. But just it's all
credit to Tennessee. They have a great team. If you want to ask me how do I
feel if we had to lose, something to someone, you know, would it be Tennessee,
um, I think most of you know that she and I are personal friends so I have
respect for her as a professional and certainly as a coach.  
Would we have liked to have won? Yeah. Yeah. I've been coaching a long time
and she's won about eight or nine of them so we would really like to have one.
So it hurts a lot. Because as I said, I was saying to the team, you get to
that point -- you don't get to that point often in life, and I'm a living
testimony. And wish that we had maybe seized the moment right from the tap,
you know, and played it the way that we had from the beginning of the year.
That's what defined us. For some reason, I don't know that we believed that.
Now, notwithstanding Tennessee was big and all those other things, but they
killed us on the boards. And it was a matter of blocking out. We have played
against other big people, blocking out is an effort thing that anybody and
everybody can do.  
When you look at a team as big as that, you have to do it. And we just didn't.
We tried to jump with them. And we just didn't. And I'm sorry for the young
ladies because it would have been something that -- I know that this whole
experience is something that they will never forget. But I'll always know that
we are just that close. And I'm sorry for the great coaches who worked
extremely hard and did a great job. But I don't want to put such a damper on
it that it defines us and we're nothing.  
I think that just so much credit has to be given to the young ladies who came
from nothing to do so much, and basically stun everybody and everybody in the
world, to the point where people could actually believe that we might be able
to do some things. And I think that probably for the most part when we saw the
light at the end of the tunnel that we actually believed that too.  
But for some reason, maybe we read the headlines, maybe we realized that it
was a national championship game. We looked like we were a deer stuck in the
headlights. Simple as that. And by the time we rocked from that, just decided
to settle down, it was a bit much. And that's -- I'm sorry about that for the
players. And for us and so many other people. That they would have liked to
have shared that.  
But I still love my team and I think they did a wonderful job and I'm really
proud because they gave me a lot of confidence and young people who struggle,
I think that as a coach what you want to see is you want to see the
opportunity to mold young people's minds and the character and all those other
things. And this was no doubt the most rewarding year that I have had. So I
guess I'm good for awhile. I feel good about that.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes first.  
  
Q. E, did you feel that way? Did you feel like y'all kind of weren't
fighting from the start, that you were unsettled at the beginning?  
ESSENCE CARSON: I just believe that we did a horrible job on the boards and
from the beginning. And that's pretty much what she said. By the time we
thought about rebounding it was all over. It was too late. It was the
rebounding that really did us in.  
  
Q. Can you say what prompted that? Were y'all out of sorts? Do you think
that you finally realized, hey, we're on a big stage?  
ESSENCE CARSON: I looked at it as another game. I know that I tried to put as
much as I could into the team. I know Coach did. But I don't know. At this
point and with that kind of question I can only speak for myself.  
  
Q. For any of the players, I know it's tough to think about next year, but
you guys could be a pretty good team next year. Do you feel that this is
something that you can build on for next season?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Wow, once one season is over and another season begins it
starts all over. You can bring -- you can have the same team and not get
anything done. You can fall out and in the second round of the NCAA tournament
or you can try to repeat what you did the previous season. Like Florida.  
I mean, but this is the hardest stage to come back to for any team. Just
because of different competitors each and every season. Teams, just as much as
we grow, other teams that we go against grow. So it's definitely hard to tell
but I really do hope that we can build on this.  
  
Q. They seem to have two players attacking the ball every time you came
across mid-court. I guess do you think they were just trying to deny the
3-pointer as much when they saw what happened with LSU?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Wow, I don't know. They have always done that. Just watching
games. It was our job to handle the pressure. And we definitely didn't do a
good job of that tonight. Usually throughout the second half of the season we
did a great job with handling any type of pressure no matter what team that we
came up against. But tonight that definitely didn't happen. So it was a great
game plan from Coach Summitt and unfortunately it didn't work in our favor.  
THE MODERATOR: Great. Thank you for joining us. Take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about what was behind the decision to go to the zone in
the first half and to stick with it through the end of the game. What was
behind that?  
COACH STRINGER: No one was going to handle Candace Parker. So the only thing
we were trying to do was initially -- I won't second-guess myself on that.
Trust me when I tell you that. Because we already played Candace, the best
thing we could do was -- we really were playing her man as she was in the
perimeter position. The only person that could play her with that size and
challenge her shots was Essence Carson.  
But what was happening is once she came into the key area we did pick it up
and went to the zone. Now, maybe y'all didn't recognize what was happening.
But what we were trying to do really is to -- if you notice the first time she
went through the lane, you saw her not get to the box where she would have
liked to have been, that was because she was being switched off by Kia Vaughn.  
She's a great player. Personally, our team does not play zones very well. If
they did, I would be the happiest person in the world. We just don't seem to
have the mindset for that. But the time comes when you do need to be able to
play a zone. So the best thing we could do is in a short period of time is to
manufacture something that could be simple enough to -- it's a drill that we
do every day, so box and one. So we practice just because it's not a zone. But
what we were trying to do is basically pick up Parker. And if we hadn't she
would have eaten us up. Trust me when I tell you tell you that.  
At that, when she caught the ball she always looks to weak side blocks, the
reason why I was upset is I guess maybe six out of the first ten points was
that exact same thing. She caught the ball on the left block, she reversed
pivot and looked to hit that. We for some reason we were a step slow. I don't
know whether we were tired, excited about the game, we knew that hit. That's
what was so frustrating. We knew the hit that she had to take. And we did. We
in other instances, although obviously Tennessee's the biggest team, everybody
else knows that too. But unfortunately for us we did not put a serious body on
any of those players and really box them out hard. We did not do that.  
  
Q. How did you address the team after the game? What did you say to them in
the locker room?  
COACH STRINGER: I really don't know what I'm thinking right now. As I was
sharing with them, I appreciate as I do them, we went some places that nobody
thought we could go. I'm not in position because, quite frankly, I didn't
expect to lose the game. I really didn't. I was very calm. But what surprised
me is I just thought we were very quiet and that scared me a little bit. We
just seemed to be quiet. And I was thinking would somebody tell us that we
were playing a national championship game because as long as we have been
playing we haven't really focused on that. It's just like let's just go ahead
and do what we need to do.  
So I don't know what it was. We just seemed to be a step slow and very anxious
to get started. And maybe it was because we anticipated the size of Nicky
Anosike and Parker and the rest of these guys, we're five-nine and they're
six-three. Maybe that's what it is.  
But as Essence said, we still could have done a much better job in my mind. So
I'll talk to them more. I'm kind of numb as I have been really through this
whole thing. I don't know what I think right now.  
  
Q. Could you comment on how Candace played and were you satisfied with the
job you did? I mean, she -- I think she had 17 but didn't shoot great, 5 for
15, something like that.  
COACH STRINGER: Yeah, yeah. Think about that. Candace is capable of a 50-point
performance. You are a witnessing the best player in the world. There's nobody
that comes close to her. Think about what we're trying to do. We're trying to
play a quick, a good quick player in the perimeter, but when she goes back
down, Essence is not strong enough to handle her in the post position. So
that's when Kia plays her. If we had taken her out, Kia wouldn't have been
quick enough to play her outside. So we took a half of this and a half of
that. So it's almost like -- but I tell you what broke our backs, it wasn't
Candace Parker, I think we could have withstood that. The person that broke
our back was Bobbitt. I was upset because Epiphanny came out and we told her
that the girl has four-point range. What else do we need to say? She's
standing at three-point range and now you let people who are streak shooters
more get happy and be convinced that that's what they can do, that' what
happens. She came down with her hands down.  
Epiphanny has been suffering a cold. I had to talk to her. She's -- that's not
the reason. She seemed to be very sluggish today right from the beginning, so
I was very upset and she said, dang, I didn't know she did that, she knew
that. But she wasn't registering. And I think that's all part of the
atmosphere and everybody else was delayed in their reaction.  
  
Q. You kind of just touched on it the threes. How much did that kind of
break your back, those three threes in a row right there when you got it back
to I think like six points or something? She hit three threes in like a matter
of a minute and a half?  
COACH STRINGER: Yeah. You know what? Here is what's incredible about it. First
of all, she's a midget on the floor. So all you had to do was be relatively
close. So that's disturbing. But it might speak to the respect that she
commands also because she is so little and then so quick with the ball. So we
stayed off way too far. And in retrospect maybe I should have played Essence
on her. But no one would have thought that she was going to drop threes like
that. She is one of their better 3-point shooters, shooting players, but that
very clearly broke our back.  
But when I get visions of this game, I see Shannon Bobbitt knocking those
threes down and us really not coming out and playing her. Which is unusual
when you are playing for a national championship you play anything and
everything. If you see a gnat moving on the floor you try to stomp it out. You
don't second-guess, you react. This was kind of strange.  
But also the second opportunities there were a number of times that they get
three and four opportunities at the boards. You cannot win with that kind of
relentless, pursuit. And that's what they did. Now, for a smaller team, then
with the smaller teams, what they have to do is instead of trying to jump with
them you're not going to jump with them and we will never jump with them.
They're too big but what we should have done is stepped in and blocked out.  
That's about a will and a focus and at one time I was saying to the team and
at the time-out, if I told you how to win a national championship would you be
interested in listening? And can we all get on the same page? This is how we
must do this. And one of the things that we spoke to was just getting in body
contact. Strong physical contact to back them up. It was clear that the
officials weren't going to call anything and that's good, that's fine. I don't
have any complaints about what the officials were doing. But we needed to go
ahead and be physical and we weren't.  
And Pat did a great job. They played well. As Candace said, it was nice for
them to return. And I'll never know why. We just seemed to be a little just a
little off. And yes, we would like to come back next year, but it's not that
simple. So we know what it took to get here this time and I appreciate the
team and the support that we have gotten and if we end up here, that's good.
If we don't, wow, I won't be 25 more years, I'm going to tell you that, doing
it.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH STRINGER: Thank you.

_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement by the coach and then go
to questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH SUMMITT: Before our game started we talked about the importance of
playing defense. And rebounding the basketball. And I've always believed that
obviously rebounding wins championships. And today or tonight I think we saw
the effort on the board was significant in this win. And our defensive play
was obviously a difference maker. We have struggled to knock down shots. We
struggle because Rutgers has a fine defensive system. And it was probably two
of the best defensive teams in the country going at it.  
Obviously the boards really separated us out and it was great to see us
execute when we had to and be able to take some time off the clock and
obviously get to the free throw line and make free throws down the stretch.  
I am so proud of this basketball team. It's hard for me to put into words what
they have meant to me personally, to our coaching staff, to the university, to
our fans. They have just been one of the best groups because they decided they
wanted to be good in the off season and worked really hard and came together
and they have been very, very coachable and we have just grown as a team and
obviously our goal all along was to win a national championship. I just felt
like they were a team that did not want to be denied and they did what they
had to do to make it happen.  
THE MODERATOR: And questions for the student-athletes first.  
  
Q. Candace, you said all along that this was never a one-woman team and
sometimes we didn't believe you. But Nicky Anosike's 16 rebounds and Shannon's
four three-pointers and Auguste's play off the bench in the first half and all
those 3-points by Shannon, is this the best proof that perhaps Tennessee could
have given that this was a whole team effort?  
CANDACE PARKER: All year it's been pick your poison. I think if you take one
option away we have four others and I was just proud at how everybody came
together and fought and made corrections and adjustments and we just took it
to them.  
  
Q. Candace, can you just describe your feelings overall? Did they kind of
just run the gamut of everything from joy to relief, I would imagine too. I
mean, this is a big thing for you to accomplish in your career.  
CANDACE PARKER: This is something that we have wanted from day one. And we set
our minds to it and Nicky said on the way over here, it's weird because we
said take it one game at a time and we really did just that. Our focus was
just one game and then the next and the next and then we looked up and we were
in the national championship game. And I can't describe the feeling. It's
amazing. It's something that we have all wanted and I'm just happy that we did
it.  
  
Q. Candace, about the 12-minute mark in the first half you started really
calling for the ball. Did you see something and did you really want the ball
to go through the low post to work your offense a little bit more?  
CANDACE PARKER: Our philosophy is inside out. And I think that we did that.
And it opened up things for outside. I know when we did shoot the ball from
outside, Nicky did a great job of getting early position and rebounding and
things like that. So we really tried to run the ball through inside out,
whether it's paint points, whether it's us ducking in and posting, things like
that. So it worked out.  
  
Q. Candace, could you just specifically talk about their defense against
you. I guess they had Carson and pretty much playing you man-to-man at the
perimeter and maybe kind of switched off when you went in the post to kind of
a zone.  
CANDACE PARKER: We knew that Rutgers is a great defensive team so they were
going to throw a lot of different looks at us. Sometimes they came out and
doubled when we got the ball in the post. And sometimes they came out and
zone. So I think we did a good job of just moving the ball and just finding
the open person. Once we settled down.  
  
Q. Candace, will you be back next year and how difficult of a decision has
it been?  
CANDACE PARKER: Yes, I'll be back. I answered it. I've answered like -- I have
answered it a bunch. I'm coming back to Tennessee. I answered it like a lot,
so I guess I'll just say it one more time. I'll be back wearing orange next
year to hang the banner in 2007. So that's all I can say.  
  
Q. Nicky, was there something in particular that you saw in Rutgers, was
there a soft spot that allowed you to get position all these times and get all
these rebounds, especially on the offensive glass?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: No, I don't think there was anything like that. I just think
that Coach said before the game, offense sells tickets, defense wins games,
and rebounding wins championships. And that really just stuck with me
throughout the whole game. And I just tried to go out there and rebound to the
best of my ability.  
  
Q. Sidney, being the senior up here, speaking for you and Dom and Elizabeth
being seniors, what is it like going out on top like this?  
SIDNEY SPENCER: It's definitely a dream come true. Right now the feelings are
all surreal and I haven't really let it sink in, it hasn't sunk in yet. But, I
mean, it's just amazing and I'm so glad for this team and all the hard work
has really paid off.  
  
Q. Shannon, talk about those sequence earlier in the second half, seemed
like you hit a 3-pointer, got a couple plays that not just ignited your team
but yourself, you get a steal, couple of -- just a that whole little fury
there that really allowed you guys to separate and get some breathing room.  
SHANNON BOBBITT: First, I would like to say God is good and I just took what
the defense gave me. And I just wanted to leave everything out on the floor.
And that's what I did tonight.  
  
Q. Candace, can you tell me what was the first thing that went through your
mind when you realized you guys were going to win?  
CANDACE PARKER: Just I think that at first it was just excitement. Realizing
that we won. Obviously relief, obviously, because we ever done so -- we worked
so hard to get to the point where we're at right now. We're just really
excited that we're national champs.  
  
Q. Alexis, can you talk about just the commitment to offensive rebounding
you guys made tonight and could you sense a frustration on Rutgers' part
because of that?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: Well, I think Nicky said it best. When Coach said -- just
emphasized that rebounding wins championships. And we have to allow ourselves
to get second and third chances. We're not -- we hadn't shot the ball last
night too well and we didn't really expect things to change. And if you go in
like that, you're going to get the offensive rebound. Rebounding is not all
about the height or who can jump the highest, it's about the heart and hustle
and who wants the ball the most. And that's how we approached it.  
  
Q. Shannon, Coach Stringer was a little bit frustrated that Epiphanny Prince
didn't close down on you after you made one three and two threes, but she said
the girl was shooting from four-point range. You better get out there on her.
Were you surprised that you wound up with that much room after you started
getting hot?  
SHANNON BOBBITT: I just definitely took what the defense gave me. I felt like
I had enough room to release the ball. I stand five-foot-two, so I definitely
got to create space. And I felt like I had enough space to shoot the ball and
that's what I did.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. All five of you. Take questions for Coach now.  
  
Q. Rutgers prides itself on their man-to-man. Were you a little bit
surprised that they kind of fluctuated back and forth in the first half and
the second half primarily went zone?  
COACH SUMMITT: I expected to see some zone. I think that our basketball team
just with our offensive execution versus man has been pretty sharp. And I
really anticipated that we would see zone. We spend some significant minutes
on just working and rehearsing all of our zone action. And because I told had
our team even before the game, it won't surprise me at all if we see a lot of
zone.  
I think we'll see man in the initial stages, because with Candace Parker, in
the offensive schemes that we have for her, she's much more difficult to
defend if we're going against man. Because we can play her at all five
positions. And get some good screening action.  
In the zone, it's a little more difficult because they really packed it in.
The good part of that is that's when Shannon hit her threes. I thought that
was a key time in the game to really take some pressure off of us. And then
our defense stayed where it needed to stay. But I wasn't surprised we saw a
significant amount of zone.  
  
Q. Do you think it's possible that next year we could see Candace elevate
her game to a even higher level simply because she will have this whole
pressure of winning a national championship off her back, she will have that
relief and be able to play more freely even?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think Candace is very serious about her game. So I think she
will get better. I don't know that the pressure really affected Candace in a
negative way.  
I think she got a little frustrated today, but I think that had more to do
with Rutgers' defense. We had some possessions where we really couldn't get
her on the block. They did a nice job of playing from behind and forcing her
out somewhat. And she's accustomed to -- and that came more in the zone than
the man. And I think that probably caused her to face up more and fade a
little bit in her shooting.  
But Candace will be better next year because Candace is very serious about her
game. And she's constantly working on it. And that's why this team sat here
tonight and won the national championship is because of their dedication in
the off season. And I just preach that over and over and over last spring
before they went into their summer school that if you want to win a national
championship, you're going to do it in the offseason.  
  
Q. That said about Candace obviously not having a great offensive night,
what does it speak to her maturity that she found open people, she rebounded,
she did everything else despite her frustration?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think that's a big part of her maturity as a player. A year
ago she might have been more frustrated by not being able to be as efficient
on the court and having double-team action on her. Her composure this year is
-- has been significant to the success of our half court offense when teams
elect to double team her. It's like pick your poison if you're going to double
her. She will find players and get the ball into the open hands and it's very
unselfish in that regard.  
I think that that's been a big part of her maturity and not getting
frustrated. There have been some -- there were games early on that Candace got
very frustrated because she would not only get double-teamed, she would get
triple-teamed and people would really bring physical play against her. And she
just matured as we have gone along and our schedule has had a lot to do with
our success in post season.  
We played North Carolina and having played North Carolina, I think that helped
us on this stage. And obviously having played against LSU and the North
Carolina team, I thought about going into this game against Rutgers, who they
reminded me of from just a defensive standpoint and their ability, obviously,
to run the floor and make plays, and those two teams came to my mind.  
  
Q. You had said yesterday that you had been back so many times to this Final
Four and you hadn't had the best player. Is that what happened tonight? You
still had the best player, is that partially why you won?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think Candace Parker is the best player in the country. And
she makes everyone else better. And having Candace Parker, yes, you got a
Candace Parker, you got a chance to win a national championship. But it's not
because she's the only player on our team. It's because she makes everyone
else better. And this team takes a lot of pride individually and being a part
of the plan of attack and the success.  
Nicky Anosike has great pride in her game. Alexis. Alexis didn't shoot the
ball well in recent -- in our last three games in post season. But just her
leadership. We needed her leadership. Shannon got open looks because I really
think because they paid more attention to what was going on on the inside than
the outside.  
  
Q. Two things: One, Alberta Auguste in the first half and, two, while you
talk about all your sets and all the things you played, a couple one-on-one
plays, one by Alexis, and one by Sidney Spencer really there late went
baseline and just kind of pulled up. Can you kind of address those, because
those kind of separated you as well.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well first of all, Alberta Auguste had a great game. She's had
a great tournament for us. And she's -- I probably have been harder on her
than anyone else on this team. Other than Dominique Redding. It's been
Dominique and Alberta. As coaches I guess sometimes you just got the ones that
you think you have to stay on. But the reason I stayed on the two of them is I
knew that one of those two players had to be ready to contribute and
contribute in a very positive way for us in post-season. And Alberta was the
one that had the biggest impact. And I think that she played with a lot of
confidence and I kept telling her, I'm on you for a reason because I really
think that you can make a difference. And if a Alexis is in foul trouble or if
we want to go with our quickest lineup you're going to be on the floor. So
obviously she did a great job.  
  
Q. The steal and the --  
COACH SUMMITT: You know, I think that both those players understood that they
had to step up and contribute. Obviously they had not shot the ball
particularly well. But I thought that we got really aggressive when we had to
be aggressive offensively, and those were big plays for us.  
  
Q. From a personal standpoint, is this one a little sweeter or more special
because of the time that had past since the last one?  
COACH SUMMITT: Actually, no. And I'm just being honest with you. This is not
about winning No. 7. This is about this team winning their first. And I think
-- it's different for me now. And all I can tell you it was like another game.
When I came here today it wasn't like we were playing for a national
championship, it's like we went through our same routine. But my thought was,
and I told them, we sat in the center court and in Stokely in our hot gym that
we practice in, because we're not in our main arena. And I told them, I said,
I want this so much for you all and our staff is going to work hard for you.
My assistants have just been incredible in their preparation, their
motivation, and just how they have helped manage the game as it went along.  
But for me tonight it was all about helping this team. And that's why in our
game against North Carolina I said we're not leaving here without a national
championship because I really believe this team deserved to be national
champions. And so it's, you know, it's obviously great for the university, the
state of Tennessee, and our fans, and I'm proud, very proud.  
  
Q. Given the parity that's gone on in women's college basketball in the last
ten years, did you ever think it might be almost impossible to get that 7th
one?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I knew it was going to be difficult. And I think that
it's going to be difficult to win another championship. Because there is more
parity in the game. And certainly on a given night, I mean, if you're in the
ready to play, in post-season, you look at all of the upsets this year, and
certainly I recognize the fact that you just can't count on it every year by
any means. And we had some great runs at Tennessee. And obviously in '96, '97,
'98, I don't know that we'll see that in the women's game again.  
  
Q. When you pulled Bobbitt in the first half, didn't look like you were real
happy with her. What did you say and how did it help turn her around?  
COACH SUMMITT: I just wanted to get her focused on what we needed to do and I
wanted a little bit more structure and leadership from her offensively. And I
-- I think Shannon just really needed to kind of calm down. I think she was
pretty hyped up. And she did a great job from that time on. And she wants --
she aims to please and wants to do exactly what you want her to do.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. Congratulations.  
COACH SUMMITT: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2007

  

### [Sue Donohoe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15066)

### [Judy Southard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16910)

  
_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's get started. We welcome to the podium Sue Donohoe, vice
president for Division I Women's Basketball at the NCAA, as well as Judy
Southard, who is the chair of this year's Women's Basketball Committee
Division I. Let's go ahead and let you guys do an opening statement. Sue, if
you want to go first, followed by Judy, and then we'll take questions.  
SUE DONOHOE: Sure. First of all, just like to say thank you for all of you
coming out this morning. Certainly we have had a championship that has been
remarkable. A lot of great stories with a lot of great teams. A lot of
exciting play and so we're certainly pleased with the last three and a half
weeks and all that's happened in the game of women's basketball.  
I think certainly that we know that we have some challenges and I believe that
the Division I Women's Basketball Committee, the NCAA, is ready to address
those challenges and continue to grow our game. Because truly we have
something that's very valuable. We have got student-athletes that play at the
highest level. That compete on the floor. That are excellent student-athletes
and great role models. So it's our commitment to continue to grow the game
both at the championship level and at the institutional level and at the
conference level.  
I'll let Judy make a few comments and then we look forward to your questions
and dialog.  
JUDY SOUTHARD: Thank you. And some of this will to some degree echo what Sue
just said. I had an opportunity to visit with the Coach's Association this
morning and I shared some of the same comments with them so I'm going to kind
of give some opening remarks and certainly we'll take your questions. We
appreciate the opportunity of course to be here and first thing that I would
like to do is certainly congratulate the Cleveland folks for what a great job
they have done, the Greater Cleveland Sports Commission, the organizing
committee, the Mid-American Conference, as well as Cleveland State University
of course served as our host institution. All of the folks at the Quicken
Arena, these are only a few of the people who have helped make this truly a
memorable championship. And I think we're all looking forward to the
championship game tomorrow night.  
With that said, let me just kind of turn to what we're really here about and
that's to talk about women's basketball and our championship. And I think I
can say that in general we're pleased with the competitive environment of our
championship. As Sue said, we have some very solid performances by teams that
you would expect solid performances from and then of course we had the
unexpected strong performances by some teams that gave us a exceptional ride
through somewhat of a dramatic and a magical tour of the bracket this year.
There was some great stories to be had with some of the games that we saw this
year and all in all I think that it's been a great championship event from
start to finish.  
I would like to say that we understand that we're going to have some questions
about attendance and I would first want you to know that our attendance
actually increased by 25,000 fans at our first and second round sites this
year. As compared to the attendance figures for last year.  
Now we are concerned of course with the fact that the attendance dropped some
at the Regional level. We have had to take a step back though and realize a
little bit about of what happened at the Regional level. And we're trying to
some degree evaluate what the elimination of Duke Texas A & M and Stanford may
have meant to the attendance figures at Greensboro, Dallas, and Fresno. And of
course what might have been if those teams had in fact advanced. But we do
know that we have got a lot of challenges ahead of us. We certainly are
working hard as a committee and as a group to do the best we can to grow our
game and to try to do a better job of cultivating the casual fan and finding
or cultivating those folks who will be women's basketball fans. Not just fans
of a certain program. And I think probably therein lies one of the of the
greatest differences between the men's and women's game right now is that we
do have basketball fans on the men's side, whereas on the women's side we tend
to still have more fans of the specific institutions as opposed to fans of our
game.  
This is the 15th consecutive year that we have had a sell out. And we have
sold out 16 out of the 26 years that we have hosted this championship. And
overall of the 26 year history of the event we have averaged 5,000 people per
session. Which we feel like is certainly not a figure we want to stay
stagnant, but we do feel like it's a impressive figure at this point in time
in our history.  
The other thing that we know is a issue for some of you and it is an issue for
our coaches and our fans are our TV times start times, our game order. And we
certainly expect to have some questions about that and we'll be happy to
answer those. I would like to tell you that the NCAA national office the
Division I women's basketball and ESPN all collaborate to try to determine the
game times and the game orders for all rounds of our championship. And
obviously there is a careful balance and strategy at that that we must strike
in doing that. We are, of course, trying as diligently as we can to avoid as
many head to head conflicts with men's basketball as we possible can. And that
certainly creates a lot of challenges for us. But we are, we do spend a lot of
time on that. And incidentally, this past year we only had three situations in
which the home team played a start time or had a start time after nine o'clock
p.m. on their home court and that was at Pittsburgh and in the first round and
then at Connecticut in both the first round and second round. That 9: 30
window and trust me, I understand the late window, because I was in Dayton for
the regionals there and then stayed up until 1: 30 in the morning to watch LSU
play before I got up at 4 to catch a plane the next place I was going. So I
certainly understand as a fan of the game what the TV windows are doing to it
us and we certainly know that we have got some challenges there and we're
going to take plenty of time to study that a and work on that. At this time
I'll just open the floor for questions and Sue, if you'll help me and jump in
we'll both take questions.  
THE MODERATOR: Let's open it up for questions.  
  
Q. You had mentioned that you met with the coaches association. We have
within been hearing from several coaches who are concerned about what the
attendance has been. What did they say to you and did they have any
suggestions for the problems with attendance?  
JUDY SOUTHARD: We met with them this morning at 8:30 the Coaches Association,
and we certainly had a representative group there. We had some people there
that certainly are very interested. I will tell you though we did not get a
lot of questions from them which did surprise us very much. We pretty much, I
pretty much went over the same type of things that I just finished going over
with you. We had a few questions from the floor from them as it related to
some of the issues regarding the selection seeding or bracketing process, but
honestly and truly we didn't really get a question about that from them.  
SUE DONOHOE: If I could add to that, one thing as we were meeting with the
coaches this morning we told them that we really wanted to have some good open
dialog. And they did ask a question to us about if the committee would
consider selecting eight cities throughout the country that are strong hot
beds of women's basketball, and taking the first and second rounds into those
cities and keeping them therefore several years to try and build some equity
into the market.  
And certainly I think that we're very much interested in doing that. We are
doing that at the Regional round level. Greensboro was a pilot test for us. We
have pilot tested out at Stanford. We had Greensboro this year as a Regional
there going to serve as a Regional site for us next year and hopes to building
that equity in that, in and building women's basketball NCAA women's
basketball in that market. Same thing at Stanford we're piloting that program.
So that's something certainly that the coaches brought to the table this
morning that I think we would be very interested in having further discussions
about.  
  
Q. For either of you, can you talk about what ESPN is doing tomorrow with
that total coverage where all its not network is going to have something on it
and do you think that maybe that's going to create a little bit more interest
for the game?  
SUE DONOHOE: I think it's a great sign of commitment by ESPN. Certainly this
is the first and only ever women's sporting event that they have done the full
circle coverage on. And to, if you had the chance to watch the Miami-Florida
State football game, and look at the different platforms that they used and
the way that they activated those platforms, it was great coverage for that
football game. And again, this is the first time they have done this for a
women's sporting event. So that shows the commitment that ESPN has to try and
promote market and showcase this championship. And we're very fortunate that
they have elected to do that. It has brought in a lot of interest from a lot
of different areas and we're excited to see it put into place tomorrow night.
We think it's a great initiative for us and we're appreciative of ESPN
bringing it and making it available to us.  
  
Q. You do have that all the coverage from ESPN you have now on the crawl it
says NCAA M, and W, as opposed to basketball and then well the little women
over here, so that's what they changed.  
SUE DONOHOE: That did not go unnoticed.  
  
Q. There are lots of things, Title IX clearly is here to stay so it's not
desire. But so you get all this, you get this platform, all the games on ESPN,
here's your big stage, and any concern at all about how it looked last night
50 turnovers in the second game, lowest score LSU 35 points by nine points the
lowest total score ever in a women's Final Four. I asked Pat and Vivian and
they both said, well, it's defense and the game and blah, blah, blah, I
understand all that, any concern though, this is your big showcase and it
looked pretty kind of ragged out there.  
JUDY SOUTHARD: Well that's a tough question. I don't want to sound trite when
I say this, but it is what it is. We don't have anyway to balance guessing or
trying to know in advance. We don't have the crystal ball here that's going to
really tell us. Those of us who love basketball and who know basketball and
have been involved in it a long time, there are things that you can find in
those games that were really fun to see. I just thought the Rutgers kids
absolutely shot the lights out and it just, if you weren't -- I was sitting
there dying all night. Obviously, because I'm from LSU, but just as a person
who loves basketball, to watch what those kids did from the 3-point line and
the way their crowd just rows to the atmosphere in the Arena it was electric
during that game, even though it was a, you know, not a real pretty game in
some regards. But I think that we can find great things in our game and I
probably haven't answered that question for you but as I said it really is
what it is. There's really not a whole lot -- we can't predict how that's
going to be from year to year and certainly we would love for everything to be
perfect from both sides, and a down to the wire, 72-71 final. But I don't
think you can anticipate that and I would just simply say that we, our game is
growing and it's getting better and better and I think if nothing else the
quality of the student-athletes was certainly on center stage last night
because there was some great young women athletes out there competing.  
  
Q. The fan base and even some of the game's most prominent coaches including
Coach Summitt and Coach Hatchell we did this too soon in terms of
predetermined eight sites. And so people keep saying is there any chance of
bringing back 16 home sites. Can we, should we just put that to rest that it's
never going to happen or is there any chance in the future that might happen
if the attendance doesn't pick up in the next few years?  
JUDY SOUTHARD: I don't think I would -- I would never say never. Because I
think that part of our mission as a committee and the mission of the staff at
the NCAA that works with women's basketball is to do everything within our
power to try to find the best solutions to what we need to do to grow our game
and make our game attractive to the public and to again as I said a few
moments ago, to grow the fan base to a level where people enjoy watching
women's basketball whether it's Duke playing North Carolina, Tennessee playing
LSU or Stanford playing Connecticut.  
So I don't think we would ever say never. Because we are in dialog every time
we sit down as a group to meet we're in dialog about what do we need to do? We
are in the business of wanting to accept any and all creative ideas for what
we can do better for our game. And I told the coaches that this morning. I
said just come to us with whatever idea you have. It may seem like it's off
the charts, but we will sit down and we will talk about it. Because what we
want to do is and it's a trite, I said it over and over, we want to grow our
game. I think we have to be very careful that we don't lose sight of where we
are in our history. And I used this analogy before, you got to crawl before
you walk. You got to walk before you run. And you got to run before you can
make the track team and run the 50 yard sprint. And if you want to go back and
compare our game to the men's game, we are still somewhat in our youthful
stage. And I think that what has happened to our game in the last ten years
and everything that surrounds our game is absolutely tremendous. But we are
still a very young sport by all measures from an historical perspective of
where we would compare with our men's counter part.  
SUE DONOHOE: I would add to that, I think in -- and we shared this with our
coaches did -- and certainly with our membership. Folks are not going to wake
up on Tuesday morning after Selection Monday and say, you know what, I'm going
to become a women's basketball fan today. That's a developmental process. And
it's got to start at the grass roots level. It's got to extend into the
conference level and then certainly at the championship level. I give a lot of
credit to our host sites they work extraordinarily hard for about 18 months to
prepare to market and prepare for the championship rounds. I think that we
have got to continue to work at that institutional level to develop that fan
base so that when a institution has the opportunity to participate in the
championship that fan base is there and that fan base will travel with them.  
To talk a little bit about a commitment that we have made from a NCAA
standpoint, as many of you know Doctor Miles Brand pulled together a
discussion group a ad hoc committee, if you would, of the brightest and best
minds of women's basketball. We brought coaches to the table, we brought media
representatives to the table, we brought administrators to the table to talk
about what are for or five real key initiatives that we can look at that would
possible help us to grow the game. And one of the initiatives that remains on
the table that we feel confident that we'll put into place over the next
months is a matching grant program. That we can work with our conferences and
our institutions to grow that fan base at that grass roots level. Because we
know if we grow at the grass roots level we grow at the championship level and
vice versa. And that's got to be a collaborative effort for all of us in the
women's basketball community. Certainly you as media representatives do a
great job of helping us promote the game, but as we continue to grow, it's
going to be a effort for all of us all the stake holders in the game.  
JUDY SOUTHARD: Let me say one more thing about that. The only reason I think
that, not the only reason, one of the reasons I think that we're so intent to
continue to try what we're doing is because we feel like it's one of the only
ways that we can grow our new fan base. I'm not sure that it would serve our
game well to just be isolating ourselves to the five or six communities in the
country that have demonstrated their support for the game because then we're
not really spreading ourselves out and exposing our game to potentially new
fans. So there may be a delicate balance in there and we may have to look and
find that balance, but certainly again repeating what I said a moment ago, I
think we're open to any and all creative solutions or suggestions for ways to
solve our problem.  
  
Q. How long are you locked into this format and could you possible consider
moving the dates to not conflict with the men's tournament, go earlier or go
later?  
SUE DONOHOE: That's another initiative that remains on the table with this
discussion group. There are a lot of pieces to that puzzle. But I think that
from a women's basketball community I think it's worthy of consideration and
worthy of good thoughtful discussion. Right now for our first and second
rounds regionals, we are named through 2009, 2010. For the women's Final Four
we're named for 2011. Where we are with that discussion and dialog, certainly
the discussion group has spent a great deal of time discussing it. We have
sent information out to our conferences asking contractually what are your
obligations right now, how far are you out, what is the format of your
tournament, men's and women's together, men's and women's in the same city,
playing at the same time in different venues. So we asked all those questions.
We compiled the responses to those questions and the discussion group will
gather again here in the next several weeks via tele-conference to say, here's
what we have learned, here's what the status is of our conferences and their
conference championships, now what other information do we want to gather and
what feedback do we need to receive? The other piece that we still have to do
from our championship perspective is to talk with our first and second round
Regional hosts, Final Four hosts for the next years to say, if, if we were to
make this kind of change, what is your availability, what's the hotel
availability, so those are a lot of pieces that we need to get a lot of
answers to. The other things that are really critical about this decision
aside from is this the thing that will help us grow the game give us some
opportunities from for us to visit with ESPN about some television windows and
work on the end venue attendance the other pieces that we have to look at a
decision like this is going to impact the timing of conference championships,
it's going to impact the timing of practice dates first practice date it's
going to impact the first playing date. It's also going to impact the
recruiting calendar. So it's not a very simplistic evaluation of the issue,
it's pretty complex. But I would say this: I think every one believes that
it's very much worthy of the discussion and consideration.  
  
Q. Culture and all these issues, since we're on that topic, the use of the
adjective lady, they don't of course call them the Gentleman Vols, and it's
2007. And with all due respect to the Regional aspect and the branding, Vivian
just said you know let's drop the lady and play ball. Would there be any
thought at all, especially in light of what's gone on with mascots, of having
the NCAA say, this is 2007 and let's just be Volunteers or Wildcats or
whatever and drop the lady thing.  
SUE DONOHOE: I would say this: I think certainly Tennessee and what they have
done with their branding of their women's program, it certainly is a very,
very strong brand. There's no doubt about that. I think that through our
governing structure and membership if there was some push from our membership
up to the national office to consider that and have any kind of discussion
through our committee structure, certainly that would be the appropriate way
that it would come to us so it would have to be something certainly that would
be driven from our membership up to be activated and discussed on a national
platform.  
  
Q. Some coaches have made the case that because of ticket prices and TV
times you're driving away women's basketball's core audience senior citizens
and families with young children. What are your thoughts on that?  
JUDY SOUTHARD: Not sure I disagree with that. And again as I said, we have got
a tremendous television partner with ESPN. I think the same coaches who are
concerned about that would also tell you in the next breath that TV exposure
is extremely important to them as they build their programs, market their
programs and of course it's a very valuable recruiting tool for them.  
So again, I think that the challenge lies with us working very closely in
concert with our partners from ESPN. There's a unique partnership there
because the ESPN viewing demographics are obviously quite different and I
don't think I'm off base when I say this, are quite different from what we
characteristically consider the demographics of our women's basketball fans to
be. And again it's a delicate balance and it's a balance that we have to work
very hard to try to achieve. We are seeing some meeting of the minds there. We
have in recent years this past year particularly have worked closely with ESPN
on reducing the number of late windows. We had late -- we had less late
windows this year than we had in previous years. We certainly -- and they're
very interested in listening to us and they're very interested in trying to
work with us. At the same time keeping in mind that ESPN is a business, that
they have to make decisions that are in the best interests of what they have
invested in our game also. So I know I'm -- I -- it may sound like double
talk, but again it is what it is. It's a delicate balance that we are
continuing to work closely with ESPN in trying to come to grips with that
concern.  
  
Q. You talk about growing the women's game and when you look at the LSU
situation, with Pokey Chatman and the Penn State situation with Coach
Portland, is there anything that's good that comes out of that for the
coverage of women's basketball because it's been covered so much even though
they're negative stories?  
SUE DONOHOE: I think certainly in every sport and in every probably in every
walk of life there's things that can have aim pact on our sport. I think that
it's incumbent upon the stake holders of women's basketball to determine how
do we turn something that might be a negative into a positive. And how do we
learn, how do we educate from experiences and situations that might arise. I
think that the WBCA made a very, very strong statement on their web site about
the role of coaches as mentors and role models. And I think they feel very,
very strongly about that. So as a women's basketball community, I think
certainly the situations that might occur whether it's on the Penn State
campus or LSU campus are best left to be handled by those institutions and
their administrators. But then those of us that are in the women's basketball
community must find ways to continue to educate, to continue to help our young
professionals learn and grow and serve in the capacity and the role that they
should.  
THE MODERATOR: Sue and Judy, thank you very much.

_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with a opening statement from Coach Summitt and
then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH SUMMITT: I'll be very quick. Obviously delighted to be working today. It
was an incredible finish for us. I was asked if we had been in a situation
like that, and it was -- it seemed a little ironic that the '98 team in order
to get to the Final Four in Kansas City we were down with 7:19 going, 7
minutes 19 seconds, we were down 12. And against North Carolina.  
So it's hard to come back against a team like that that is playing the way
they were playing. But really proud of our basketball team and their composure
and execution to finish out that game. So we're delighted to be here and
preparing to play against a great Rutgers team.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For Nicky Anosike, seems appropriate that two of the best defensive teams
are playing for the title tomorrow night. Can you talk a little bit about
defense and why it matters so much at this time of year?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: Coach always says defense wins games, and I think it's evident
that the two best defensive teams are the in championship game. Especially
Rutgers, who, like Vivian said, didn't even expect to be here, but their
defense carried them through. So I think it only makes sense that the two of
us are in the championship game.  
  
Q. Candace, Rutgers obviously knows the challenge that you present them, but
can you talk about what you think they're going to do that will challenge
you?  
CANDACE PARKER: Rutgers is a great defensive team. Hadn't really had the
opportunity to really focus and see the different looks that they have done
against their different opponents. I got to see briefly on the highlights of
the LSU game on how they collapsed on Sylvia Fowles and really wanted to make
other people beat them.  
I think it's just us, we played one of the toughest schedules in the country
and we have seen a lot of different looks, so I think it's just coming out and
playing Tennessee basketball is what's going to help us in that game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Candace, Nicky Anosike was saying last night that she considers herself
somebody that's always going to have your back in games. Just want to know,
what is it like to know that you have that kind of support that you don't
always have to be the show every single minute you're on the court?  
CANDACE PARKER: I don't feel like I ever felt like that, to be honest with
you. Because at Tennessee we're different people who are able to step up at
different times. And it may not always be on the offensive end. I know Nicky
was huge for us last night, playing 40 minutes and just having that warrior
mentality and always leading by example. And as well as Alexis and Sidney as
well, and Shannon coming in and really frustrating the point guard and
creating trouble.  
So I think that it's really good for me to know that I have a lot of people
that have my back. And I'll have their back as well.  
  
Q. Nicky, can you talk a little bit about you picked up two pretty quick
fouls, but you never looked to the bench and of course Coach never even took
you out, which she did with several other players. Can you kind of -- is that
normal? She had mentioned afterwards something about that.  
NICKY ANOSIKE: No, it's definitely different that she left me in with two
fouls. But I was focused on the game and I was really set on not getting into
foul trouble and not getting that third foul. I think she just trusted me and
I trusted myself not to get that third. And I just wanted to do it for my
team. I think I'm a lot smarter than I used to be.  
  
Q. Alexis, this is now the third year in a row that you'll see Rutgers and I
guess try to end their season. What's different about this team from the
previous two?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: I think they have a lot more offensive weapons as a whole
this year than the previous two. Cappie led their team the first two times
that I played them in the tournament and I don't think that Matee's game was
as developed then as it is now. And Essence has elevated her game as well. So
it's like they're having a more balanced attack.  
  
Q. Why is that so dangerous?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: Well, obviously it's hard to stop five or four, even four
people from scoring. It's easier to concentrate on one or two, but when you
have a balanced scoring option it's a lot harder to continue to get great
stops.  
  
Q. Nicky, at one point last night it looked like Shannon was just screaming
at you and you had a kind of quizzical look on your face. Is that -- she
obviously is an emotional player, but is she always that emotional and does it
amuse you or do you have to calm her down sometimes?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: We all yell at each other. Nothing different. I yell at
Candace, she yells back. Alexis yells at me. I might yell back. We just yell
at each other. But we all know that we have the same goal and we're just here
to help each other. So I might have looked confused when she was yelling at
me, but I love her to death and I'm going to listen to what she has to say,
and I hope she will listen to what I have to say also.  
  
Q. Shannon, what can you tell us about Epiphanny. How is she different from
high school? Are you excited to go up against her or pretty sure you got her
number, since you're older?  
SHANNON BOBBITT: Oh, it's definitely going to be a great game to watch. And
Epiphanny is a great player. I'm just going to respect all of them and not
fear any of them.  
But it's been great playing with her in high school and I'm sure she's gotten
better and smarter. But we definitely are going to stay tuned on all of them
and play our hardest and leave everything out on the hardwood.  
  
Q. Did she try to convince you to come to Rutgers with her?  
SHANNON BOBBITT: Yes, she has. But I had to follow my heart and do what's best
for my career.  
  
Q. Candace, you guys haven't won a -- Tennessee hasn't won a national title
since 1998. What would it mean not only for the team but for you in particular
to win a national title for your legacy, not only at the school but in the
women's game.  
CANDACE PARKER: Well, I think that it would be huge for us. That's something
that we came to Tennessee to do, to win a national championship. And I
remember in the locker room yesterday earlier in the season some members of
the '87 team came back. I didn't know what year it was. '87 team came back.
And the first championship team. And they were sharing their stories and
different things like that. We were just like, In 20 years we want to be able
to come back and have our banner in the rafters and be able to celebrate and
tell famous Pat stories and things like that. Roll her in in a wheelchair.  
(Laughter.)  
COACH SUMMITT: That was my suggestion. I just want to be there.  
CANDACE PARKER: She will be there.  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: Yes, she will.  
  
Q. Sidney, you're the only senior up there, can you talk a little bit about
how special it is to get back to this game? You were there as a freshman and
now you're back as a senior.  
SIDNEY SPENCER: Just to be able to contend and play in a national championship
game as a senior it's a dream come true, and I wouldn't want to do it with any
other players than the ones we have on this team. And I think that this team
has worked extremely hard in the summer, fall and up to now and just getting
better and just being committed to one another. So it's definitely a dream
come true.  
  
Q. For any of the players up there, do you ever think about the history of
the game with the two coaches that are in this game, Coach Stringer and Pat
Summitt, and what it means to have these two coaches going up against each
other for like the future of women's basketball?  
CANDACE PARKER: I get to answer it. It's -- our game has grown a lot. And it
has to do with the two coaches that are going to be facing each other in
tomorrow's game.  
Coach Summitt and Vivian Stringer, they have meant a lot to women's basketball
and its growth. And it wouldn't -- the game wouldn't be where it is at right
now without those two women. So it's just a great thing and we're really
excited and I know Coach Summitt and Coach Stringer are very good friends, so
it just makes it all better.  
  
Q. For any of the players. Can you talk about the aura that is Tennessee
women's basketball and do you feel like not necessarily you have a advantage
with that, but it kind of is tough playing against Tennessee because who you
guys are and the tradition and everything like that.  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: I think it's not as tough as it used to be because the
parity in women's basketball game has grown so much that people don't really
fear Tennessee just because you have Tennessee written on your chest. But at
the same time it is a advantage to play for a school such as Tennessee where
you have great fan support which helps us and makes it difficult for our
opponents in post-season. But I don't think it makes it any harder to play us
now.  
  
Q. What was the most impressive thing you saw Rutgers do yesterday?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: I think how they stopped Sylvia. A lot of teams haven't been
able to do that. Even as good of a defensive team as we are, we still didn't
hold her to five. They did. So I think that's just a tribute to how committed
they are to defense and how great of a defensive team they are. But that was
the most impressive thing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you to all five of you. We're going to take questions now
for the coach.  
  
Q. Do you see Shannon as being kind of a missing piece of the puzzle and how
many junior college players have you ever had? I assume it's very few.  
COACH SUMMITT: First part of your question, Shannon has really been terrific
as a competitor, as a teammate, and she has been one of the most coachable
point guards in my career. I think she came in just wanting to learn the
system, wanting to do things the right way.  
I've just really -- I've just watched her day-to-day develop into a very heady
point guard and she obviously is a very fierce competitor. She came out of the
junior college ranks having to score a lot for herself and to create for her
own game. But what she's been able to do is to create for others on our
basketball team. Which has made us a much better not only transition team but
I think specifically in the half court game.  
I've had three junior college players. Obviously Alberta Auguste and Shannon
Bobbitt came in together. The only other junior college player I had was
Zandra Montgomery. And Zandra was from Tennessee. And actually when she came
to play for me she was 26 and if my memory serves me right, I was 26 also. So
it has just been a situation where we haven't needed to do that, we had some
transfers which obviously triggered we got to have more quickness and speed in
the back court and we definitely need a point guard because I think Alexis
benefits and we benefit as a team when she can go the off guard.  
  
Q. How much is having won six times before since 1998 helped you through the
last nine years and when Vivian -- and not having won for nine now. And when
Vivian says that she just wants to know what it feels like ones, can you
imagine that void of never having won?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, we were in seven Final Fours and four championship games
before we cut down nets. So it's not like Tennessee just won championships and
it was easy. It is one of the hardest things to do in sports.  
After we won six and in looking now at not having won, I think that is a
reflection of the parity. If you just look at what we are seeing in women's
basketball in terms of the caliber of play and the caliber of go-to players
and just how our game has grown, the landscape has changed. And we have better
post play, we -- you had to think back when -- somebody asked me this the
other day, who was the best post player we faced, it was Lucia Harris, and
that was back in the late '70s. So the game has now evolved into more of a
power game as well as outside shooting, the 3-point shot has been great.  
But I certainly will tell you that winning a championship is special for any
team and any coach, but I don't think it necessarily defines that you are
better than anyone else. You just usually it means you have better players.  
  
Q. Can you just -- when Nicky says that she's a lot smarter than she used to
be, can you just sort of trace for those of us who are ignorant just a little
bit of the evolution of her game over the last couple years?  
COACH SUMMITT: Nicky Anosike is very bright young woman. She's the type of
person that when you challenge her, whether it's to work on her low post game,
which she has done, this past summer she devoted the majority of her skill
preparation to her face-up game. I think that you have to really credit her
because whatever she wants to do -- I mean, academically she's one of the best
students I've ever had in the program. She's very serious about her academics,
very serious about her game.  
I think now her composure, she used to get -- she picked up two, three fouls,
I couldn't get her out fast enough. Why I left her in last night is because of
her maturity and her composure and I knew she knew when Candace went out that
she had to keep herself on the floor. And that's where her basketball IQ came
into play. I just felt like she would do what she needed to do to help this
team and to keep herself on the court so we would be able to at least hold our
own. We just wanted to hold our own by half-time.  
  
Q. Back on that evolution of the game theme, you were in the first NCAA
Final Four. How was it different then than it is now?  
COACH SUMMITT: When we went to the first NCAA championships, I thought that
the people involved, the players probably didn't realize, the coaches
realized, I'm not sure the fans realized, that going under or being taken
under the umbrella of the NCAA was the best thing that ever happened to our
game.  
We got instant credibility, exposure, and respect for our game. That to me was
just the very beginning of what you see now in women's basketball. And without
the NCAA, I mean, we would not have made the great strides at a relatively
fast pace. It seemed a little slow at times, but just having that opportunity
for the national championships to be on national TV and for our players to be
seen and our coaches to have a chance to really help showcase the game with
the help of the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the genesis of your friendship with Coach Stringer and
having knowing what she's gone through personally over the years, what she's
put into this through the decades, how difficult it's been to beat her in
decisive moments, truly decisive moments in the tournament and what it might
be like to have to do it again tomorrow night.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, Vivian is someone that I consider a great friend first, a
colleague next.  
When obviously Vivian was at Iowa we visited for a long time. I remember she
called me one night -- Vivian can talk. And I don't mean for a few minutes. I
think that we were on the phone for like three, three and a half hours. And it
was in the wee hours of the morning. And she was talking about making the
decision whether to leave Iowa.  
I just know when she made that move, it took a lot of courage. But what she's
been able to do at different programs, it just speaks volumes for who she is.
It doesn't matter. You could take Vivian and put her in three more programs
and in the next 15 years, and she would be successful.  
She has great passion. And I think that the woman has handled adversity better
than anyone else I know in this profession. And just the personal adversity
that she's faced, and I know at times even professionally. And she just keeps
the student-athletes first. She's obviously given back to this game. A lot of
coaches give back to this game, but Vivian certainly has.  
I'm excited for her. I really am excited for her. And as I go into this game,
I just -- it has to be Tennessee and Rutgers, not Pat and Vivian. We're going
to work hard for our teams, but the players are the ones that will have to lay
it all on the line.  
And obviously I remember when she lost her husband and we played them in Iowa
as a No. 1 seed there. And the building was absolutely packed and it was --
the volume was something that I haven't probably heard before or since.  
Her team obviously advanced to the Final Four, and I just remember that
moment. And I think the people were there because of Vivian and what she had
meant to the program and to the community. And she's a special lady. She's had
tough times, but let me tell you, she's a tough lady. And she's also a great
person.  
  
Q. With all the attention that Candace gets, how do you feel the other girls
on the team, particularly the starters, have handled that? And also could you
give us maybe a couple of off-the-court anecdotes about Candace that kind of
describe her personality and what she's like as a person.  
COACH SUMMITT: It's interesting. A year ago I think that we probably did not
have the kind of chemistry that we have now. Because we had a lot of high-
profile players coming in. And then here comes Candace Parker back from her
injury and I'm not sure that they were committed as a team to really accepting
what each person could bring. Candace included. And we just didn't have good
team chemistry.  
Losing last year to North Carolina was a defining moment for this team and all
the players that were returning. Because I think they realized how much they
needed each other. And then in the off season they went to work. And I think
that they respected Candace at a different level because Candace has changed
her work ethic.  
They talked about calling each other out. After the SEC game in which Candace
only had four points in the tournament and we had our meeting, I mean they
just spoke their mind. And they just said to Candace, and I said to Candace,
if you pull this in post-season we lose, we can't win. And the big thing that
Nicky challenged her to do was to be a defensive player. She said, You have
got to step up and be a defensive player.  
So I think that the fact that they hold each other accountable because they
respect each other, they respect the fact that every one worked on their game
in the off season.  
It's just a great thing to see them have the maturity and obviously the
confidence and the communication across the board as a team. And, I don't
know, with Candace off the court -- Candace, I think she is the type of player
she doesn't necessarily want attention. And I think she likes just being with
them and hanging out and having fun and taking the spot light and turning it
off. That's pretty much how this team has been.  
  
Q. Can you remember when you first met Coach Stringer? Was it at the first
Final Four in '82? And how do two people from two different corners of the
earth and two different types of programs develop a friendship like that?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think it was through our USA basketball. We had the sports
festival and all that. And we served on a committee with USA basketball. I
know we went out to -- I think it was actually the University of Illinois and
we roomed together on that trip. And that's when I really got to know her and
we were there to select a team from that particular area of the best young
players in the game to play in the sports festival. If my memory serves me
correct. And that's when I first really got to know Vivian and I spent time
with her.  
We just stayed in touch. It was a lot just through the USA basketball
experiences at that particular time.  
  
Q. A year ago Coach Stringer told us that one of the most encouraging things
that happened after losing in the Big East tournament was your phone call. She
talked to us about how this season was her bleakest and she expected the
worst. Have y'all talked a lot this season? When was the last time you talked?
And did she really say to you, What am I going to do with these freshmen?  
COACH SUMMITT: No, we didn't talk early on. But we talked -- I guess it was
right after the Big East tournament and right after the SEC's. And it's never
a short conversation, as I said.  
(Laughter.) And when she called me, Girl, what are you doing? And I thought,
well, hopefully nothing for the next hour and a half but talk to you.  
(Laughter.) You know. But we had a great time and we just kind of caught up.
And she was talking about her team and now I tried to call her after both her
big wins and I called even before the final horn sounded and her voice mail
was full both times. So I told my assistant, Nikki Caldwell, who is great
friends with Jolette Law, I said, Tell Jolette to tell her congratulations,
and I at least tried to call. But she's got a lot of people, obviously, that
have her phone number.  
  
Q. When you spoke to her after the Big East tournament, did she express
pride? Did she saying, My team's going to do something?  
COACH SUMMITT: She was excited. Just unbelievable. Unbelievable. Couldn't
believe it. You wouldn't believe what they were like, and even she said at the
Salute dinner she sent all her assistants to go out to recruit. She said, Go
get me some players, these people can't play. And obviously they must have
heard her.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the drought between championships, has it motivated
you, frustrated you, and are you hungrier now like back when you were for your
first title or are is it different?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think it's really different for me. Obviously at Tennessee we
have a goal every year of winning the SEC championship. And winning a national
championship. And the fact that we hadn't won one since '98, you know, the one
thing that I just tried to evaluate is why.  
I think you have to have -- in order to win a national championship, I think
you have to have a go-to player. And that's -- that's something that we didn't
always consistently have. We had balance and we have won championships with
balanced teams. But I do think it makes a difference when you have someone
that can step up and make the big plays and make everyone else better on the
floor.  
That's what Chamique Holdsclaw did. She's one of the best I ever coached at
that, but that's what Bridgette Gordon did. I went to four Final Fours with
her and we tested her heart in every game. She made big plays for us. And we
won two championships while she was there.  
For me, it's not about me feeling pressure, I just want to help this team. I
just want to help every student-athlete that chooses to come to Tennessee, I
think they come therefore a reason. And I think they come there believing that
they will have a chance to win a championship. And I feel like my job now is
to be the best leader and the best motivator and put together the best staff,
which my staff's just been incredible, to try and help these young women win.
Because that's why they came to Tennessee.  
Candace Parker could have gone anywhere in the country, so could Alexis
Hornbuckle, Nicky Anosike. We won recruiting battles because they felt like
they would have a great chance to win at Tennessee. And because of the great
fan support and the environment that they would play in.  
  
Q. Just to get back to Shannon, she really hasn't been the typical Tennessee
recruit with her size and the junior college aspect. Can you talk a little bit
about what you saw before that made you decide, okay, I'm going to offer her a
scholarship and bring her on board.  
COACH SUMMITT: One thing I learned is that it's not about the size of the
body, it's the size of the heart and the toughness and the mind and the
skills.  
When I saw her play at the junior college tournament of course I had seen her
on film, and Dean Lockwood had been the one to go down and watch her play and
just watching her on tape. I mean, you can't really appreciate what she brings
in terms of her speed and her quickness. But watching her play in the national
championship, I just felt like she was a player that could get other people
the ball. She was a hard player to defend. And in the open court I really
liked what she did with the basketball and that she was in the attack mode.
Very confident. Self-assured. A self-assured point guard. And I just felt like
this is a player that could make a difference for us. It was just a matter of
-- it wasn't a matter of how hard she would work, it was a matter of how long
it would take her to really fit in and learn the system both offensively and
defensively.  
And she -- I mean, she would watch film with me every day. If I would let her.
She would just -- we watch film on our North Carolina game before the North
Carolina game last night we watched in the afternoon. And she really is a very
committed player to learning and trying to do it right.  
  
Q. Since '98 have there been any years that haunt you, that you feel like
you should have won as opposed to teams that you ran into and just ran into
better teams?  
COACH SUMMITT: It's always tough to be on that stage and lose. But quite
honestly, I don't know that we had a team that was really favored during that
time. We got some teams to a Final Four and to a championship game that a lot
of people didn't think could get there. And in a lot of cases we overachieved.
But the missing ingredient was just having the players that on that stage
could step up and make the big plays. And that's where maybe we got -- we lost
out on a couple of those players in the recruiting, but that's why when
Candace Parker said I'm going to Tennessee, I felt like we got -- we got a
different situation now just because of what I had anticipated she would bring
along with obviously Alexis and Nicky, and in particular those three.  
  
Q. You've had a lot of great players come through Tennessee. Where does
Candace rank among them, what makes her so special, and does she need a title
to validate her career at Tennessee?  
COACH SUMMITT: She would tell you she definitely needs a title to validate her
career and her place at Tennessee because people compare her to Tameka
Catchings and Chamique Holdsclaw. If I had to say today who has been the
player that's had the greatest impact on championships, it's Chamique
Holdsclaw. And Candace knows that and understands that and she said, Don't
talk about Candace Parker along with Chamique and Temeka until Candace
Parker's a part of a national championship. Which I think is -- I think that
that speaks volumes for who she is and she's willing to put it on the line and
right or wrong, that's how people will most likely define her career.  
  
Q. Little bit out of left field, but would love to get your thoughts on
this. The use of the term lady, the adjective lady, Lady Vols. Of course
there's no Gentlemen Vols and it is 2007 and with all due respect to the brand
and what you have created there, is it time to get rid of that adjective and
just have every one be Vols or Wildcats or whatever, understanding that it
could be seen as a bit demeaning or somehow having to need a adjective as
making it somewhat less than the whole.  
COACH SUMMITT: I don't think that will ever change at Tennessee.  
  
Q. Should they?  
COACH SUMMITT: That started back in '74. No. No. Because that's who we're
known as, as the Lady Vols. I think our players would be the first to say we
don't want to change it. That's who we are, that's how people know us, and
most of these players up here -- Nicky Anosike would be the first to tell you
that we're proud to be called ladies and Lady Vols.  
  
Q. Do you understand though at least the --  
COACH SUMMITT: I understand.  
  
Q. -- the conversation?  
COACH SUMMITT: Yes, I do. I understand the question and the conversation. But,
I mean, I just think within the state of Tennessee and nationally, that logo,
the Lady Vol logo, is known throughout this country and throughout the world.
And I don't know. I just -- I can't see that changing.  
  
Q. 1982, I hate to take you back that far, your recollections of the
tournament and maybe any interaction you had with Vivian at the time.  
COACH SUMMITT: My recollection of the tournament was we were playing against
Louisiana Tech. And the biggest thing I remember is we could not make a entry
pass into our offense. And we got killed in that game.  
It was a long, miserable game. And I remember telling Sonja Hogg, I will stay
in this profession until we beat Louisiana Tech. Count on it. Because they
were pressing us, even in the last two minutes and, I mean, we were down. And
down by a significant margin. And I just -- it was a tough -- it was just a
tough weekend for us. It was really tough. And I do remember thinking that
this is going to really change women's basketball and just a great crowd and
great environment for women's -- for the women's game.  
And it definitely did impact, but it wasn't a great weekend for Tennessee. And
it's -- I hate to tell you, but that's what you remember so much is how you
end and we know only one team ends with a victory. But we had hoped that we
could make a better showing on national TV and we didn't do it. But I was
proud for the game to be on that stage.  
  
Q. Was there any interaction between you back then?  
COACH SUMMITT: Oh, yes. Yes. Vivian and I, we certainly talked and I was
really proud for her. I thought her team had played well and she's -- it
doesn't matter. I mean, she could coach any team that someone wanted to sign
her to and say, go win with this team. She figures out away to win.  
  
Q. Along the theme of staying in the game until something is achieved, Bob
Starkey was in here the other day talking about how he didn't want -- wasn't
interested in head coaching job because of all the demands and the pressure
and all that stuff. Was there ever a point in your career where you kind of
felt, I'm accomplished, I've done a lot, built a program, and started to
question how long you wanted to do it or even continue at all? And if there
was a point in your career when you kind of had felt yourself getting a little
sideways in it and how did you overcome that?  
COACH SUMMITT: This may seem a little strange, but I've never thought about
not doing what I do. I love it. I live for it.  
My most favorite part of my day is the time I spend in practice. I prefer
practice over games because it's -- that's where you teach. That's where you
hopefully teach and lead and impact how these young women will then take over
when they get on the court.  
And I just -- when I go in the gym and it's no longer fun for me or I don't
feel like I'm connecting with these student-athletes, then I obviously would
make a change.  
I will tell you, there was a time that I did not feel that I had the energy.
And that was in 1985 after coaching the Olympic team and also playing for the
national championship and losing to USC. And I went right from that experience
to coaching the Olympic team in Los Angeles and I had never felt that -- now,
that was pressure. That was -- in my opinion, I probably put more pressure on
myself than I should have for us to win the gold medal. And it was even more
pressure when the Russians decided not to come, to boycott. Then we had to
win.  
But when I came back I did not have as much energy then as I've had since
then. And I think that was just because of the demands and all of the stress
that I felt in winning the gold medal.  
  
Q. Some of the kids upstairs were just talking about the manifesto that
Nicky came up with before you guys played UCONN, the one that they signed, I
guess it was something that they said that was done among players, not the
coaches. I just wondered what your reaction was when you found out about it?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, obviously all I knew is that they -- they did it. But I
don't -- I haven't seen anything. That's off limits to the coaches. I know
that they pretty much made a pact for how they wanted to come together and
stay together and play together. And that's been the difference this year. I
think Nicky and Alexis have been probably the two players that have provided
the kind of leadership that is necessary for a team to really have that
chemistry and togetherness. And they have -- the two of them have been
terrific in that area. Even when Alexis is struggling last night, and in there
with -- at times in the past she would have thrown in the towel. Nicky wasn't
going to let her do that. They just hold each other accountable. And I think
that's probably where it all started. Because I think that was our big road
game that they felt like, hey, we got to win on the road and we got to win
against a great opponent.  
  
Q. Coach Stringer last couple of weeks has used the words team of destiny
quite a bit when describing their run through the tournament. Have you found
through the years the concept team of destiny? Is that viable? Does it have
any place in the game? And if so, how do you game plan against such an
intangible?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, if you believe it and you make it happen, then it is
viable.  
And obviously with what this team has done I can see where Coach Stringer
would go in that direction and inspire her team.  
At the same time, I told our team we're not leaving here without a national
championship. So I think you have two teams that really feel it and believe
it. And that's why I think you're going to have a great game and obviously
it's going to be the kind of game where players have to make plays. And they
have to make stops. They have to score. To me, it's two teams that want this
and in such a way that I think you're going to see a basketball game played
with tremendous intensity and competitiveness.  
  
Q. Was Cait's enthusiasm and exuberance easily accepted by the older players
on the team? And even last night when she didn't play, she still kept that
energy level up court side. Can you talk a little bit about that.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well Cait's -- Cait's high energy every day. And I think this
team just knows that Cait's going to speak her mind. She's probably been the
one player on the bench that has inspired others more than anyone else with
her enthusiasm and she's obviously speaks her mind. But I think that she's the
kind of player that gets this team fired up. And she's willing to do whatever
it takes. And she's handled the role very, very well.  
We talked about the bench before we went out last night. And obviously when
the game was over I talked about how much energy the bench gave the players on
the court. And the players all responded. They felt it. And you have to have
that. But it starts with Cait McMahan.  
  
Q. I was talking to Sidney last night and she had mentioned this magic six
running program that you guys do, I guess in the preseason. She thought that
was very appropriate that because the last run of it is the longest and the
hardest, and that now you're in the national championship game, which is the
hardest thing to accomplish, could you talk a little bit about what prepares
your players with this program and how they will go up, Rutgers is equally as
conditioned?  
COACH SUMMITT: Sure.  
  
Q. And how does this make it better? Does this make you guys better than
them or is it sort of just one more thing that will help you get over the
top?  
COACH SUMMITT: Heather Mason is our strength and conditioning coach. And the
best I've ever worked with. And Heather designs her program so that it is --
it's very, very competitive and very tough. And within our sprint work you
have an opponent. And your opponent might be Georgia, it could be Vanderbilt,
we usually have SEC, we usually take outside opponents as well. I mean, with
our schedule having played North Carolina and Duke, that's certainly names
that come up. But it's like who we're competing against today. And we have to
win this.  
I think that the way she presents it and challenges this team and holds people
accountable is, it gives them a mental toughness, if you will. Not that we're
going to be physically stronger, but in the huddle last night we talked about
we can do this. This is -- we're down the home stretch. And I felt like their
energy stayed at the level it needed to and they do feel like they're the best
conditioned team in the country.  
There's something to be said for what you believe in. And they believe that.
But it's -- we have obviously progressed significantly with Heather's -- just
her discipline. If you don't -- if everyone doesn't touch the line the right
way and turn the right way, then we start over. So and in everything she does
-- I mean, you to have the discipline. She's better at that than I am. I'm
learning from her.  
  
Q. You addressed this last week, but in watching -- of course there was a
great crowd here last week, Lady Vols enjoy tremendous support. But as you
watched the other regionals last week there were a lot of empty seats. What
does -- when this game is over, what does women's basketball do to address
that?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think we have great leadership in our game. And I do think
that that is something that we have to carefully examine and try to figure out
what is the best plan to implement to make sure that we have people in the
stands in post-season. We have a lot of -- we have a lot of teams throughout
the country that draw well. And I went and supported the neutral sites.  
I now question whether or not our game is ready for that. But I do think that
we can look at some venues that are regionally positioned to allow us to see
teams and to seed teams and obviously we're seeding a lot of teams
geographically to draw more fan support. And then marketing. Marketing is so
key. And we may have to look at the marketing efforts not only for our
respective institutions, but also what we're doing in the post season to try
and generate more fan interest. And have people in the seats.  
  
Q. Alexis said that this is the most balanced offensive team of the Rutgers
teams that you faced in the last couple years. How much of a threat I guess
does that pose to you when they do still play defense like a Stringer-coached
team?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think this is a great team because of that. Because they are
committed to defense and board play. But they have a lot of confidence
offensively and you've got the big four that are scoring. And they can make
shots. We struggled last night offensively. And I am hoping that we got that
out of our system.  
But we also understand it's going to be very difficult to score against
Rutgers defense. And also that we have to defend at all positions. But
typically when you're, when you're in this position and you're competing for a
national championship, you're going to have to guard people and you're going
to have to make plays. And that's true on both sides of the ball. We have to
do it.  
  
Q. Shannon said she likes your swagger. And maybe we can relate. Do you see
something about -- of you in her confidence level that she has?  
COACH SUMMITT: I never thought of myself having a swagger.  
  
Q. There's something New York about you too in there somewhere.  
COACH SUMMITT: Hardly. I think that the one thing that I've tried to do to
help Shannon is to help Shannon realize how good she is. Before the game last
night when we talked I just told her, You're going to be the best point guard
on the floor. And you have to believe it and you have to make these things
happen.  
I think Shannon has a lot of confidence. I think she came in with a lot of
confidence. Candace Parker has a lot of confidence, Alexis, Nicky Anosike,
those in particular come to my mind right off. And I do think that that's
filtered throughout our team.  
But with me, I just -- my objective is just to be strong for our team and to
stay focused. And think of how I can help them. And the one thing is not --
and this is where I've changed over the years, is not to get frustrated
because of what I'm feeling, but to try to stay in tune with what they're
feeling and what they need from me at that moment. And with Shannon I tried to
stay extremely positive. I can't really think of many times that I've ever
been tough on her in a game.  
  
Q. Along the lines ever fan interest, while there was intensity and good
defense in both games last night, there was also an inordinate amount of air
balls and turnovers and missed layups. Is it somewhat troubling to you that in
this big showcase event that there would be bad basketball like that?  
COACH SUMMITT: No, I think that's part of post-season. Watch the men's games.
And you're seeing obviously struggles, particularly early on in those games.
And a lot of the men's games and the women's games are very similar. And what
happens is that you don't necessarily shoot the ball that well. There's a lot
on the line, there's a lot of pressure. And for whatever reason defense goes
to another level. And I think that just the defensive intensity that we have
seen in the women's tournament as well as the men's tournament, that sometimes
it's made for ugly basketball.  
It's just a matter of just battling it out and trying to improve as you move
through a game or as you go through a possession. Because that's -- teams are
going to bring the intensity. Last night I thought with North Carolina, the
intensity between our two teams was terrific. At times the game looked ugly.  
  
Q. This question may have been asked, I've been floating around. Did you
know about this manifesto or paper that the players signed? When did that come
back around to you and what did you think of it and have you seen it?  
COACH SUMMITT: I didn't know about it until the players wanted their time in
the locker room before we met as a team. And this was when we were at
Connecticut. So up until then I knew nothing about it. And I've asked nothing
about it. That's their deal.  
I'm not going to get all up in their business. I don't want them all up in
mine. We do what we have to do as a staff. They do what they have to do as a
team. I just trusted them. I guess over the years it's -- I pick and choose
what I've really wanted to know. So they did this and that's their deal.
That's their plan. But obviously it's been effective for them.  
  
Q. I'm just curious how you would compare your coaching philosophy and your
personality with Vivian Stringer. You are both legends in coaching basketball
but you seem to have different personalities.  
COACH SUMMITT: I think there's a lot of similarities because we both believe
strongly in defense and rebounding. Very committed to it.  
I don't know. I'm not around Vivian in her practices and -- but I think that
she does a great job communicating with her teams and getting them to believe
and I would like to believe that our players believe in our system.
Personality-wise, I don't know, I'm obviously a -- I talk a lot slower but I
don't talk quite as long. But that's okay. She's very effective. And I think
she's a great motivator. And I think her kids just -- they bring it. And they
bring it for her. I think they really -- they love their Coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the aura that is Tennessee basketball and do you agree
with Alexis that maybe it's not as intimidating as it used to be or what do
you think about that?  
COACH SUMMITT: I would somewhat agree that because we haven't won national
championships in recent years that maybe we're not viewed as big of a threat.  
But I will tell you, just having the schedule that we have and traveling
across the country, I'm amazed at the number of fans that come out, Tennessee
fans or fans when we travel on the road. So obviously I think Tennessee has
been around for a long time. And I do think that our national -- not only our
national schedule but our national exposure has allowed our Tennessee teams to
enjoy a lot of support on the road as well as obviously at home.  
But I don't think that when you get on -- you know, in this situation,
competing in the Regional or Final Four, that teams are going to be
intimidated. I think if anything they're going to be more motivated and
focused.  
  
Q. Coach Stringer has said that this is her best coaching job in her career.
You've seen a fair amount of her teams. Would you go as far as to agree with
that?  
COACH SUMMITT: I've seen a number of her teams and it's hard for me to
compare. Obviously she says it, I'll agree with her. But from where they
started, absolutely. I mean, when I saw them play Duke I was like, oh, it's
going to be along year for Vivian. If she can't get this young group to really
step up and believe in her system. But knowing Vivian, I'm not surprised.
She's very persistent. Very persistent.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
COACH SUMMITT: Thank you.

_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with a opening statement from the coach and then go
to questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH STRINGER: We're excited to be here. We have got a busy day today. We
hope to get some rest tomorrow because we recognize that we're on stage with
the biggest game in women's basketball.  
It seems only appropriate that we would have a opportunity to play Tennessee.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Essence, I wanted to ask you about Katie Adams. Coach said the other day
that she's been sort of a person who goes unheralded as kind of a great leader
for you guys and do you think you would have -- I mean, it's kind of a strange
question, do you think you would be here without somebody like her?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Not at all. Katie, she's definitely -- she was a big help in
the preseason. Throughout the entire year as well. Especially with the
freshmen. There are five freshmen. So without any upperclassmen we would have
never gotten this far. Without Katie especially, because she's just so
inspirational. She shows you what hard work is all about. Even if you don't
get a chance to come on the floor she never gives up. She's always on the
sidelines cheering you on, telling you what you're doing wrong and how you can
fix it: And those are definitely the people that you need on your team.  
  
Q. Epiphanny, what can you tell us about Shannon from high school and did
you talk to her about coming to Rutgers with you?  
EPIPHANNY PRINCE: Shannon is a great point guard who likes to score, in
transition and run the team. And, yes, I did try to get her to come to
Rutgers, but I guess she liked Tennessee better.  
  
Q. Any good stories about her?  
EPIPHANNY PRINCE: No. Sorry.  
  
Q. Have you ever taken her on in practice? Did you play her one-on-one?  
EPIPHANNY PRINCE: No, we just used to shoot around after practice to get -- to
try to help our jump shots get better.  
  
Q. And who was the better shooter?  
EPIPHANNY PRINCE: I don't know.  
  
Q. Question for Kia. Your team did a good job, you and your team did a good
job defensing Fowles. Can you talk about the difficulty you'll have with
Parker?  
KIA VAUGHN: That I would have? Or we will have? As a team?  
  
Q. Well, the team, because she's a little more versatile player than a
Fowles.  
KIA VAUGHN: Well, the team, we're going to play her like we normally play
anybody else. No difference.  
  
Q. For Matee, I wanted to ask you, Candace has said that it wouldn't be
complete if she didn't win a national title at Tennessee. Do you feel that
same way about winning a national title at Rutgers? Do you need that to
complete your career there?  
MATEE AJAVON: Of course. I think that every one who comes to college has a
goal of one day winning a national championship. So in her perspective, yes,
you know, that may fulfill her. Yes, in my perspective it may fulfill us too.
But we just look to play a hard 40 minutes and may the best person win. Best
team, that is.  
  
Q. You five and your teammates, how did you sleep last night? Have you
talked about that? Did you get a full eight hours? Were you too excited? How
did you sleep?  
ESSENCE CARSON: We slept pretty well.  
(Laughter.) The tournament isn't over yet. For us, yesterday was a great game
for us. Yes, we can be excited, but we can't be overly excited because we
still have a goal that's still ahead of us and we're still trying to reach
that.  
So we won't -- after tomorrow's game, you know, if the outcome is positive on
our part, then we probably won't get any sleep. Probably be out celebrating
amongst each other.  
But we still have a job to be done. And we're looking to be well rested,
bodies and mentally, and looking just to go into the game and just play the
game, the game of our lives.  
  
Q. Did anybody else not sleep well last night? Everybody got their eight
hours?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Yes.  
  
Q. E, this is now the third year in a row that you'll play Tennessee here on
this stage. Why are you more prepared for them this year, and how do you just
feel about constantly seeing them?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Yes, it's the third time that I've gotten a chance to play
them. And especially in the NCAA's. I feel that we're well prepared this year
as a team, as a whole. The players, one through ten, I believe that we're all
prepared. We have all gotten the chance to experience some type of game time
during this NCAA tournament. And especially since we're -- we have a more
balanced scoring team and we are playing defense just as well as any other of
Coach Stringer's teams.  
And right now we're just working together. We're rolling and we're just
believing in ourselves. And I believe that all ten of us believe in ourselves.
And I believe that's something that we might have lacked in past years.  
  
Q. For any of the players, curious how often or if there's times in which
Coach Stringer has referenced the 1982 team that -- the last team she took to
a championship game at Cheyney? Just stories or something she's pointed to. Is
that something that comes up often for you guys?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Well, Coach Stringer references a lot of things?  
(Laughter.) But she has brought up the 1982 team. She has brought up the Iowa
team that she's coached. She has brought up many things that has happened to
her in her life to show us that no matter when you're struggling, or how much
you're struggling, that there's still light at the end of the tunnel. So we're
just as motivated. We have talked to past players and we use them as
motivation as well.  
But most importantly Coach Stringer's our motivator just simply because we
exemplify her character. She definitely let's us know time in and time out
that it's not where you come from, it's where you're going.  
  
Q. Kia, can you give us an idea how tough Coach Stringer's practices are?  
MATEE AJAVON: No.  
(Laughter.) I think that's impossible.  
KIA VAUGHN: It really is. You really can't tell. Each and every day is
different. Very different. It depends on how you react and how you turn out
and how you start the practice. So what she may throw at you there.  
Basically we just go in there with an open mind and we're ready for anything.  
  
Q. For any of the players, can you talk about the underdog role and do you
guys sort of kind of like that role going into this game?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Honestly, we never really pay attention to the seedings,
rankings, or whichever you may call it. But we just look to go into the game
and just play the best game on that day to be the best team on that day.  
Throughout this entire month -- well, it's April now, and throughout the
entire month of March, there's been upsets. Any day can be any team's game.
And we're just looking just to take that and just to continue to play the
basketball that we have been playing throughout the second half of the season.  
  
Q. I talked to some people last night back in New Jersey and this morning,
and they said there is no way this team can not win tomorrow night, based on
the play of what they saw last night versus what Tennessee did with North
Carolina. Do you feel that?  
ESSENCE CARSON: You can't make a definite prediction at this point. It's going
to -- you're going to be able to tell when the ball goes up in the air
tomorrow. For me to say that, no, that we don't have enough power to face a
Tennessee team, that would be wrong. And for me to say that, yeah, we're too
strong for them, that would be wrong as well.  
It's a 50/50 chance here. And it just goes by how well we play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Last night Governor Corzine was here, Coach Schiano was here, Coach Fred
Hill was here. Can you just talk about like playing this game for like for New
Jersey and for Rutgers.  
HEATHER ZURICH: It definitely meant a lot for us just to have such big people
from New Jersey come to our game. It's just been a great opportunity and
representing the state of New Jersey, we're just really proud. Even having
like Coach Schiano here, what the football team did this year, we're just
happy to carry on and be in the championship game.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you. You can head to the break out room. We'll
take questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Your teams throughout the years have developed reputations for not
letting one player beat you. You did a great job on Fowles in the semis. Can
you just talk about the challenge Parker will pose in the championship?  
COACH STRINGER: Well, I think that Fowles is probably the most dominating
center with all that she could do. And clearly Candace Parker is the national
Player of the Year.  
There's nothing that she can't do. I think everybody's always impressed with
the beautiful athlete, the beautiful body. I mean she can rebound, dunk, shoot
the ball, play the point. I mean, how many players in this world can do that?
None.  
She's Candace Parker all by herself. But maybe between today and tomorrow,
whatever time the game is played, we'll try to figure out something to make it
a little less easy, and right now I don't know what we're going to do. I've
been up all night thinking about it and looking at some tapes and I'll be
talking with the coaches.  
But I think that people should remember though Candace Parker's a great
player, but that's not -- that doesn't define the Tennessee team. I think the
Tennessee team is a huge team. I mean across the board. Once you deal with
Bobbitt, who is a 5-3 player, then you jump 5-11 and then 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 across
the board. Remember, these are all select athletes that Tennessee picks. They
have first choice on the blue chip athletes. There's not one player that's not
a first team All-American or a probably a national Player of the Year.  
These young ladies have a great deal of pride, they're extremely versatile.
They can flat out get it done. Some players are this-and-that players. They
can either do this or they can do that. These players are this and that. They
can do this or that.  
And Pat, you know, is just the greatest coach in my opinion, period. So they
have got the great players and a great coach and a great tradition. They're
used to playing in pressure situations. They have been to the Final Four. This
group of young people haven't been, but the team has. So Candace says that her
career isn't complete, I imagine that that's the way she feels, and that
should be.  
But we'll have to figure out what we're going to do. I know it's not going to
be just one person that's going to handle her.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Shannon Bobbitt, the player you saw in high school to
the player you're seeing now, how close you came to getting her. Just in
general terms what she's added to the Tennessee team over the team that you
saw last year.  
COACH STRINGER: It's a much needed piece. I think that was the smartest move
that Tennessee could have made. Because they have always had the giant
players, what I call pro sized guards, and we all have seen that. But they
have never had the quickness that they have needed.  
So you add the quickness of Shannon, few people can take the ball away from
her and what's so great about her is she's so extremely intense and
fundamentally sound defensively. She probably went to one of the best junior
colleges in the country that definitely emphasizes great offense and great
defense, and it's a real tribute to Coach Landers. We were aware of Shannon
earlier in the year and obviously she went to the junior college for a variety
of reasons, so I'll say it like that.  
But I remember my nephew sending me a tape because there was something online
with her handling the ball. She was just as smooth as Allen Iverson. She's
just a little itty-bitty person, you know. And I sort of lost track of her.
And then realized where she was in the junior college. And I would like to
have brought Shannon to Rutgers. We did have her visit and I'll leave it like
that.  
A long story short is by Final Four time she decided to go to Tennessee. And
that's good for them. Because she did improve her shot which she didn't have
as consistently in high school. But she's doing it all right now and she
brings fire and fight and she's a true point guard because she's unselfish and
she doesn't care who gets the job done as long as they win. And that's what
you want from a point guard.  
  
Q. You talked last week about the six player game. Is that what you grew up
playing or do you just -- you were aware of it? And also in the 25 years since
your first Final Four, some of the things that struck you as how the game has
evolved.  
COACH STRINGER: Well, no, I always played with the guys down -- no, I always
played with the boys all the time. And most of the time I was the one that was
choosing the team. So I don't know. The six player game -- although, in my
high school we didn't have sports for girls and that's so unfortunate. I was
so excited to go to college because I figured I could put my talents to use
and we started off that way. With the 3-up and 3 back. My reference had to do
more with when I went to Iowa the entire state was a six on six and of course
that's where they would average 15- to 20,000 people at the girls high school
game. I was in awe of that. So it was difficult and I knew better than to try
to get the state to change. E. Wayne Cooley, who was the head of the Iowa
Federation, was the -- the politically correct thing would have been for he
and I to get together. I was explaining why we needed to have these athletes
from Iowa play for the University of Iowa. I thought they were the best
shooters in the world and fundamentally sound, but when it came to facing up
with the basket and seeing all this other movement that it was going to be
difficult. So Pat Summitt called me and we talked about that because Tennessee
was one of the few last states to change from the six on six game to the five
on five game as well.  
And Elaine and I continue to remain friends. But it was just a matter of
things eventually evolving. And the statement was that girls couldn't run as
much because they may have a heart attack. And they just couldn't -- their
hearts couldn't take it. But we see now that they can and now they're even
dunking. So the game has evolved quite a bit. Quite a bit. The athleticism on
the part of the centers is incredible. So right now it seems like a center is
not the complete player if she can't shoot the ball well at the three point
range and go inside and pretty soon it's going to come down to, hey, how many
players do you have that can dunk. And that's what it's going to come to.  
  
Q. Between you and Pat, fuzzy math, maybe, I got 1,700 victories, 68 years
combined coaching experience, is it a mistake to reduce this kind of a game,
say that it's a chess match between two of the greatest coaches in women's
history? Is there overemphasis on that at the college level or is that the
correct way to look at the game?  
COACH STRINGER: It probably is a chess match. She has her pieces and I have my
pieces. And we're trying to, at the right time, make the move. There will be
moves and countermoves. And as you may know, Pat and I are very good friends.
And I've enjoyed coaching -- I just enjoy these kind of games. And I know that
she does too as well. The players, I mean, there's a lot of things. That's why
I thought Essence answered someone's questions brilliantly because you can't
tell what's going to go on. It depends on how calm the players are and what
moves they make and basically how calm we can be and the skills of the
players.  
But basketball is a game of chess. You just don't throw it out there randomly
hoping and react to it. You hope to make a move and cause someone else to
react and you look at players that are put in and you consider what you need
to do with that. The decisions you make with regards to the patterns has
everything to do with how well people handle certain kinds of offensive
schemes. Whether it's a screen and roll or a post pattern or whatever.  
So every time -- if you notice every time someone comes in, as for me, my
coaches, I'll think more in terms of the patterns, my assistant coach, whoever
did that game, will think more in terms of the matchups. And sometimes you get
the matchups right and sometimes you don't.  
  
Q. Just a quick follow-up, there's a scene in a movie Patton where George C.
Scott's character is having a battle with Rommel's Panzers and he says,
Rommel, you magnificent bastard, I read your book.  
COACH STRINGER: I love it.  
  
Q. Have you read Pat's book? Has she read yours? Is there anything that you
guys do that the other doesn't know backwards and forwards?  
COACH STRINGER: I can tell you this: Yeah, her book, "The Summit," to go into
her mind and in terms of what was happening at the time that we were going to
play them, I think it was for the -- it was either at the Elite 8 level --
yeah, it must have been. What was going through her mind. Yeah. Most coaches I
think read or admire Rommel and Patton and all the great generals. I think
it's appropriate that they call Bob Knight "the general." Because he is a
general.  
You move; it is a chess match. It is that very much. It's important to know
the mind, the player. Sometimes you might even know from the clothes, the
decision of the clothes that they might wear. It's really very interesting.
You must know the mind because the players may change, the names and the faces
of the players, but I study the coaches. Other tendencies that they have.  
We say that all the time. Because you can't change. If you have been
successful you may tweak and come up a little more here or there. For example,
this year I tried to allow the team to run full blown for all out. We have
never had offensive players -- and that's the mistake I think that so many
times people think, well, Vivian just likes to walk the ball up the floor. At
championship times we have been known to turn the ball over four or five times
and that's an incredible statistic. But it's not that I want to walk the ball
up the floor, I much prefer to run like I would much prefer to press, the
problem is we have not had the players to run in too many instances and better
still we haven't had people that have been consistent with their shooting.  
But I couldn't -- it was against my own -- it was against my own grain when we
were out there scoring a thundered points and other people were scoring 80 and
85 points on us, so someone should have known that pretty soon Vivian would go
back to herself. You know. And not lose my mind and go ahead and do the things
I'm most comfortable with. But it's great.  
  
Q. You've told us in the past when Coach Summitt has called you at trying
times and things like that. Can you tell us when she called you this season,
when was the last time y'all talked and do you kind of feel like you owe her?
That you're due a win?  
COACH STRINGER: She owes me or I owe her?  
  
Q. You owe her.  
COACH STRINGER: Depends on what you want to say about that.  
  
Q. It's been a long, and a lot in a row now that she's kind of gotten the
best of you.  
COACH STRINGER: You know what? I think that for me I would be wasting energy
and stressing out too much. I sort of like the way I'm approaching everything.
I don't know why. The same thing with the players. The players alluded to all
of our -- so many of the Cheyney, Iowa and Rutgers players came because
they're a part of the same family at a reception and so many of them gave
testimony and they spoke because it is one large family.  
To me it's overwhelming the cumulative affect of all of that. It's like a mom
watching all of her children come home and you love them and see the things
that they have done. With regards to Tennessee, it always seems that we always
are playing one another. And we're such good friends. I'm sure that we -- I
know that we prefer not to play. But on the other hand, we continue to want to
make ourselves worthy to be considered in that elite company. To have an
opportunity to play them time and time again. And so for those schools that
avoid great competition, it's like this, you can run, but you can't hide. You
can run, but you can't hide. Because ultimately if what you say you want is a
national championship, they're going to be there. Lurking somewhere.  
That is what we want. We want -- so we want to play the best. I'm excited
about playing them. I'm not going to get hung up on, well, they just keep on
beating you. I've lasted this many years, you know, so I got it in me. That's
one thing about it. I can persevere. And thank goodness we have an opportunity
to play now and we have been on them, if you want to go by the numbers, but it
doesn't matter, because unfortunately, you know, the things don't work out
quite the way that people want all the time.  
Who would have not wanted, for example, North Carolina State to win their game
against Connecticut just because they would be the sentimental favorite. It
doesn't work that way. So we just -- I just got to think with a clear mind and
let these guys play and be free of any of the burdens of the past. They just
need to deal with here and now.  
  
Q. Two questions: One, Nicky Anosike, was that somebody that you recruited?
And if so, could you give us a little background there? And, two, what is it
about her that coaches seem to appreciate that maybe the casual fans don't?  
COACH STRINGER: Of course we would have wanted to recruit her. We want to keep
every player in New York and New Jersey. I think that if we could really just
recruit there, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., the
parents would be happy, we could win at the highest levels. And that's what we
have attempted to do. We need to own the Eastern corridor. We don't even have
to go down the coast, if you will.  
I was at a lot of her practices and talked to her coach at length. Long story
short is that the name Tennessee and its rich tradition, and let's say Pat,
was too much for me. I couldn't have recruited anyone harder. I love her
because she's 6-3, she's got unlimited energy, she's quick, she runs the floor
well, she is just a fundamentally sound player. I try tried to call her at the
last second to speak -- do you want to speak to her mom or someone to explain
to them why they should come to Rutgers. And we are the program that needs
people, you know, we're careful with the people that we select. We're very
careful, that's why you don't see large numbers of players. Because it's a
certain kind of player and, first of all, it's a player that is not looking
for stardom.  
Nicky is not that kind of a player. She went to Tennessee not because it was
Tennessee; I think that she was excited to go there. We probably needed her
more. We always do need her, I think we always need players more than what
Tennessee has. They got people in the cupboards getting ready to come out.
Really, they just dust them off and put them on out there.  
But as you can see with us, we take advantage of every player that we have and
so when we say to you, come to us because as a freshman you'll play, I mean,
what could be better? But Nicky, you know, she went to Tennessee and that was
our loss and Tennessee's gain.  
  
Q. You may have answered this in bits and pieces, but when you said in your
opening that it's appropriate that you're playing Tennessee, could you
elaborate on that as to what you meant and also how unfulfilled have you felt
that you haven't won a national championship to this point?  
COACH STRINGER: I think that it's important every year that I have an
opportunity to Coach because it burns so much in my soul. It being coaching. I
think that when the day comes that I regret sitting down and writing out a
practice or going over a tape. I get excited, during the season, my nanny will
tell you, I never eat, just eat. I will take -- I have a huge bathroom with
televisions in there and all that. Huge. I mean huge. So I'll just sit in
there and eat. And so it's almost like it's a treat. I sit there and I smile
and I really enjoy breaking things down. Breaking tapes down. I enjoy
developing and putting things together. Every year I approach it, every year
believe that we can win a national championship. This year, different. I
really didn't think so. I didn't know if I could even last as a coach.  
So to be here now I'm not going to spoil it by being obsessed with it. I
really haven't been obsessed. I'm always hurt more often, I'm hurt because I'm
losing young people and I won't see them again. I still have pain in my heart
when I looked at that last shot the time that we played Tennessee and Cappie
Pondexter just played her heart out. And the rest of the young people tried to
play as well and we just came up short. And I remember looking at the clock
and looking so deflated that it's almost like it's like a -- it's really like
a noose on a neck and it's a mental thing and I wanted to cry for them. And
because I take it so personal and I do cry. It means everything in the world
to me because I don't want to see my kids' hearts broken. They play too hard.  
But somehow we have come to a little balance that we really can't appreciate
all of what we have gotten out of the season, and we're going to do everything
we can to be fulfilled. Pat has won a lot of times. I really would like to
know what it feels like and I don't need her to tell me what it feels like. I
want to experience it myself. You know. And who wouldn't?  
But in this you have to be good and you also have to be somewhat lucky. There
are people who have won a national championship that you probably would have a
hard time remembering their names now. Because it's a flash in the pan. It
just happened overnight. I think most people will think about me because
somehow we're that team that you're going to always have to mention because
we're going to be somewhere there that's dangerously close. And even if we're
out of the numbers, as you can see with the rankings, you always know that
sometimes, somehow those Scarlet Knights are going to be a team that needs to
be counted on. Somehow they're just going to find it, they're going to get
that fight and they're going to be able to put it together.  
So ask me that question, you know, Tuesday night. When do we play? Monday
night? Tuesday night. Yeah. Ask me that question Tuesday night. I sure hope
that I can tell you that I no he what it feels like. I just want to experience
it. It would be nice.  
  
Q. And would it be appropriate to play Tennessee?  
COACH STRINGER: It is appropriate that we would play Tennessee because
Tennessee has been that team -- it's kind of interesting, the year that my
husband passed, it was Tennessee that came to Iowa. I think we at the time we
were a No. 1 seed or whatever. Tennessee I think was considered one of the top
teams, if not the top team in the nation, and certainly the SEC was the
strongest team and so the NCAA selection committee found it appropriate that
Tennessee and Auburn would come. And to our good fortune we emerged from that
and we went on to a Final Four. When we went to Philadelphia, no matter what,
Pat and I are connected at the hip. This year she called me just before the
thing and says, Vivian, I promise you we're not going to be in the same
region. But somehow Rutgers, me, let's say it like this, not me, not Iowa and
not Rutgers, not Cheyney, because, you know, the first Final Four it was
Tennessee, although they were on the other side of the brackets, I think they
won their game against Maryland or lost their game against Maryland and we
were with Louisiana Tech, so we have always been in that company.  
But appropriate because I can think of no other team that on a more consistent
basis or no other coach on a more consistent basis that has always been that
person that says, I'm standing here, you have to come by me in order to get it
all. And Pat is such a great competitor the great coach that she is, a great
competitor, that if she has 50, she wants 60, and I don't blame her. She works
hard and the team deserves that.  
It's appropriate. That's the team that it should be. Anything short of that
probably is like, well, but you didn't play the mighty Tennessee. So you know
we get a chance to play them and if we're not good enough, we're not good
enough. If we're good enough you'll find out Tuesday night. You'll know.  
  
Q. Can you remember the circumstances the first time you met Pat and why the
two of you hit it off?  
COACH STRINGER: I can't remember. I was a little fish at Cheyney. We only had
1,500 students and about $3,000 budgets. A budget and I thought, wow, here we
are playing in the first Final Four. And we were in Norfolk and she and I
never got a chance to play one another. I just -- Tennessee seemed like this
far, distant land. Unfortunately being from the East, some of us tend to think
that there's nothing going on west of the Mississippi.  
And where is Tennessee? Where is it? Okay. Ohio, Iowa, whatever. And we're
just focusing on the East Coast. So I really didn't know. I just know it was a
huge school and this coach had done great things. But, remember, television
didn't bring those games and these situations to the front.  
I think that Pat and I had a casual conversation because we met there for the
meeting that they would have just before the Final Four. And I would come to
hear her name so many times and took pride in saying that she was my friend.
But what I do appreciate about her most is that contrary to what people think,
they might see her as a powerful person and arrogant, but she's a very warm,
caring coach, mother, and woman. With everything that she does.  
We were standing on the sidelines and in our game at Madison Square Garden
talking about clothes, believe it or not. We talk about our children. She's
been great to my sons who have been in college and needed to get reports done
and that. And she's been that person that will take time and call you and I
know that she would do anything for me. If I'm down, hey, Vivian, you know,
get your head up. We had a game where I just -- I tend to, you know, implement
a lot of things and sometimes the players can be overwhelmed. And she was
saying in our preparation for your game, I noticed that you guys were running
a lot of patterns, Vivian, maybe you want to let them run it three times in a
row because you know these kids today don't think quite as well or they don't
remember quite as much. And I thought, you know what, that might make a lot of
sense.  
And I've talked to her about very personal things. So we're coaches, but we're
people and human beings. And I appreciate that we relate more as a personal.
But I will try to do my best to take her out Tuesday.  
(Laughter.) You can bet your last dime on that. As she will me too. And we'll
hug afterwards and it hurts. It will hurt her if she wins, but you think that
she's going to take a break on me? Not at all. You know. And I love her still
afterwards. But I will do my best. That's why you see bags on my eyes. I'm
tired. But I will -- I'm going to go at it, believe me.  
  
Q. Earlier Essence spoke about -- spoke very highly of Katie Adams. What
does she mean to the girls on this team and how important is it to have
someone of that character on a team that's so young?  
COACH STRINGER: Katie's been the mom to these players. During the summer when
we were recruiting, Katie has been the person -- well, Katie, Katie told me
this or Katie gave me extra workout. Or Katie said I better not do this. Katie
has been like a mom.  
Katie is as important as you think Kia is or as important as you think Essence
is. Katie is every bit as important. What she says goes. She takes us through
the warmups, they're going to warm up and they're going to warm up the right
way. Why? Because she's a player of truth and of honesty. She has the right to
say anything to anyone. At times it's as -- a simple example, she and Mat are
extremely close. They have been roommates from the beginning. Sometimes if Mat
-- let's say that I'm jumping on Mat about something, and Mat's looking like,
dang, she's just on me. And Katie would just say, you know you're wrong. And,
you know, she can say anything to anyone of these players. She is the most
respected player of all players.  
Why? Because she always does the right thing. She's going to work extra hard.
Several players were able to go to Virgin Islands only because of Katie.
Because while Katie had done her letters and her suicides and all that, when
others mentally were so doggone weak that they couldn't meet minimum
standards, Katie would run the extra time. I would have to say, Katie, just
don't. Or if Brittany is struggling with her shot, it's Katie that's going to
take her out and continue to work on her shot. She's the most giving person.
She knows that as she prepares other people, if you want energy and fire on
your team, that's who you have.  
You want someone that's going to simulate what the other team is going to do.
Knowing that that person's going to get better. Katie deserves and I would bet
that if all of them were to vote and say who do we give the greatest heart
award to, who is the most valuable player to, not talking about the points,
the most valuable player on this team, there is not a doubt in my mind beyond
anyone it would be Katie Adams. Katie is necessary for any team, coach,
organization. She's the ultimate team player. She really is.  
  
Q. I'm sure you can find some artistic beauty in last night's games, but how
would you rebuff critics who said those two semi-finals were ugly
basketball?  
COACH STRINGER: Two semi-finals? I guess that includes ours too.  
(Laughter.) You know what? I really don't care. Because writers write and
coaches coach and players play. It's kind of interesting. Too bad coaches
can't write also. It's just like sometimes people come to our games, I tell
you, one of the most difficult games for us to play is the game to be played
against Villanova. Now people are bored to tears, but as a coach I am so
rewarded because it executes so well and I love the way our team plays
defense. You have to be so exact with angles and all that. I'm a purist, Pat
is a purist. You know, notwithstanding turnovers and things of that sort, most
people want to be entertained. So you want to see a dunk, see the breaks,
well, you can bet your last dime we're going to try and make sure you don't
see dunks and you don't see breaks.  
But, I mean, that's why they write the way that they do. I could care less. I
would hope that everybody could be happy but at this particular point since we
worked so hard we just want to be happy. And happy is winning. I know that Pat
would probably say it was an ugly game, but she's glad she won. I don't know
what everybody said about LSU, it was a defensive game. And we all should he
know that defense wins championships. We know that. So that's what they have
to say, it's too bad.  
  
Q. Just a follow-up to the question, when you started out you talked about
the showcase. This is such a showcase for women's basketball. Not any concern
at all, 50 turnovers in the second game, first game the lowest to score ever,
35, which was your defense, of course, and congratulations on that. But not
any concern as a pioneer of women's sports of how that looked on TV last
night?  
COACH STRINGER: Well, I hear what you're saying but you need to ask yourself
what are you saying? Because at the beginning of the game you hear them say
"star watch." Sylvia Fowles with the beautiful hook the most dominating center
in the country. She can dunk any time. She's finger rolling over the top. You
have to appreciate the athleticism and the beauty of that. So why can't people
get a lot more into, if she does those things, what are they going to do.
Everybody here asked me what we're going to do about Parker. What do you want
me to do? Let her dunk? Would everybody be happy? Then Pat would be sitting
with all the people with orange on, everybody's excited. Hornbuckle is going
behind the back and Shannon Bobbitt is giving you a New York show. Everybody's
happy. But Coach Stringer and crew are not happy. So you know what the star
watch is. I know what that is. If I didn't do something you would say, she's a
dumb coach. Guess what? I can't win. I cannot win. So I'm going to win. Doing
and winning the way that we need to do and get it done.  
So it's about the show, but, I mean, all I can say to you, and most of you
know that during the NBA games the guys don't play any defense. You know they
don't. All-Star Game, everybody's happy. 125, 135 points, did you see what
Kobe did? Kobe did this, he did that. When it gets down to the championship
you see some real basketball because the game is offense and the game is
defense. And so the turnovers, I mean, as you can see those teams were
pressing, they were playing so hard. They were pressing so hard. I don't know
what else you can do. Now maybe you would say on the official side of it that
the officials need to call it much tighter. Maybe they call it earlier. I
don't know. But I just hope that whatever the heck they do, they go ahead and
are very consistent with both us and Tennessee. That's all I'm asking for. If
you're going to be loose, let it be loose. If we're going to have a slugfest,
let it happen. If it's going to be smooth, but make sure it's on both sides,
and you can't tell it, and let the chips fall where they may.  
But I think you have to appreciate the beauty of the great athletes that are
there, and yet you have to appreciate the real determination on the defensive
side of the ball.  
  
Q. In a different topic, when you got to Rutgers, I believe they were still
called the Lady -- were they not called the Lady Scarlet Knights, I believe?
And you ended that immediately. What do you think about this Lady thing, this
being 2007?  
COACH STRINGER: Well, let me say that I understand that that's something more
regional or southern in that respect. And with all due respect, then that
should be the way that it is. If that's the way everybody likes to refer to
it. I just believe that basketball is basketball. And you don't need to make a
distinction. I think that we should be good enough, Coach Chaney and I used to
practice together. And we never made a distinction between the girls, this and
that. He and I were -- when I say practice, we would run 10-minute scrimmages
of the matchup zone. And the guys -- a guy by the name of Andrew Fields, who
was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers would tell the press that he learned his
jump shot from Valerie Walker, who was probably one of the finest jump
shooters in the country. She was shooting at four point range when she was way
back when. And here she is 6-1, 6-2, handled the ball like a point guard. He
didn't have any shame of that because Coach Chaney as a male taught him to
appreciate basketball is basketball.  
And so I just believe in equality of people. Not male and female. I don't
think that -- for example, that a woman should be paid less or more. I think
that you should be judged strictly on the quality of the work that you do. No
one could work harder than these young ladies when I'm practicing them at
4:35. We have had to get up at 4:00 to practice at 5:30. And they need gas and
food in their bellies and it doesn't say, well, you only weigh 120 pounds so
you only have to pay 99 cents a gallon for the gas. It's the same.  
So I just don't see a distinction. If we're going to play basketball, let's
play basketball. If our game isn't nice and pretty or as is not as it should
be, if we're not making passes, we don't need to see jump, throwing the ball
all over the floor, rolling all over the place. But, likewise, I just want
people to be respected irrespective of black, white, purple or green, male or
female, to be paid and appreciated in the same way. And the thing that I would
do most for everybody is I wish that more fans would come out and really
support women's basketball.  
We do have a responsibility to make it entertaining, and that's what I'm
saying, that, no, I'm not talking about a slugfest because this was not poor
basketball; it was just great defense and it was just a bit much. But I think
that people should come out and just support the sport. There would need to be
a lot more promotions and I think that some of the numbers and the attendance
that you saw at the other Regional sites has so much more to do with the fact
that fans as a rule with women's basketball tend to support their teams rather
than have appreciation for the sport. And you when you look at a Connecticut
executing and a Tennessee executing and as so many of the teams across the
country, at Duke, you know, there have been so many great teams and I just
think that it's time to, on my side of it, just me, you know, just me, just
drop the Lady thing, let's play basketball.  
  
Q. Let me take you back again to '82. You played Rutgers twice that season.
Manufacturers Hanover Classic, they beat you and they lost to Louisiana Tech I
think in the first night. You got them again two months later and you beat
them up. What do you remember about that Rutgers team and a 32- or 33-year-old
Theresa Grentz?  
COACH STRINGER: Well first of all, in the Manufacturers Hanover Classic, I
don't think that I was coaching. My daughter, Janine, was in intensive care
for six months. I was in the hospital. That was probably -- and I didn't leave
the hospital. That was probably in Madison Square Garden. We found out that
she had contracted meningitis in November or Thanksgiving. So I wasn't with
the team. It was amazing, too, because so much of the dreams that I had I've
not been able to be a part of. I remember my team coming to the hospital to
see me. But no, wow. So that hurt me because I would love to have coached and,
yeah, I think it was at Madison Square Garden. Vivian was never there.  
  
Q. What about Theresa, what do you remember?  
COACH STRINGER: She was great Coach. Fiery. She's living and she's doing a
great job. In fact, I think it was her game against Purdue or someone that was
impressive and just great. She's been Rutgers basketball, the spirit of
Rutgers basketball, deserves all recognition. She was the first female that
was ever paid. I thought that Fred as an athletic director had tremendous
foresight and that was the first time they ever paid a female coach.  
So many of our women coaches and men's coaches have been pioneers. She has
been. She's been a leader. And I was stunned that she left Rutgers. Actually
she and I talked and she was thinking about that. And what I remember about
her is being a very considerate and kind person. She and Rene Portland brought
their Rutgers and Penn State team, their teams to the hospital to see me. And
we go back and I really appreciate that. Because I didn't leave the hospital
and I knew that she was genuine. That was a time when coaches could be a lot
more human beings. Right now you can't do that. You got to look at tapes. But
she showed me the kind of support that she had, she and her team had for me.  
And really I think that people -- unfortunately I think people, writers, all
these people from the outside try to battle this and battle that. But I really
-- I work hard to try to help everybody to remember that we're still people,
human beings. She's a great coach. A good person. And I'm not surprised about
her having a stellar career. However, I remember her even more as a great
player at Immaculata because I started coaching -- like Cheyney was the first
job I had, so I never coached anywhere else, but that was the most dominant
center, she was mean. She was just mean. I always saw a scowl on her face and
she just took care of business. But I had a lot of respect for her and always
have and always will. And, you know, I'm glad to continue to try to keep the
connection between the Scarlet Knights and what we're trying to do going.  
  
Q. Would you talk about Kia and her development since she's been there and
how important she's been through this tournament run for you guys.  
COACH STRINGER: Kia has been incredible. I think that she's much more
confident. Kia's heart starts to flutter and her eyes start to blink and you
really have to settle her down. I am very careful when I speak to the team
because I have been known to be a motivator to the point where the players can
feel like, wow, we could just accomplish all things. But sometimes if I can
fire you up so much that someone like Kia might be too emotionally strung out,
so I try to just try to tone everything and speak specifically of what has to
happen. Because she takes a tremendous burden. I can't even tell you. She --
there were a few things -- and let me give you a example. There were a few
things that I wanted to do a little differently because Kia can shoot the ball
very well. But she can probably move around the 3-point range and just stroke
it and I probably put as much matchup zone on her as I would some of our
guards, let's say it like that. You all have not seen that.  
So but in this one game to take the post away from the basket, I was going to
have her come to the high post and start hitting those shots and bringing the
four down. Heather just reversed the positions. And she was so upset, tears
started coming from her eyes because we had changed something and she just
wanted to be -- she just wanted to do the right thing. And I said, Relax,
whatever we're doing, we're doing, we'll do it. Next year you'll see a lot of
other things. But Mary Anne has done a great job in helping her to understand
herself more as a player.  
And, again, a great credit goes to her. To the to all of the assistants who
have helped the guards to deliver the right passes, Kia, to really finish with
her. She's a much more confident player. Much more confident. I was really
pleased at the way she held herself with Fowles. She pump faked, she let her
come down and took her time. And believe me, she has great range and you'll
see a lot more from her and a lot of that has to do with her work against
Courtney Paris. I remember Essence Carson calling me from Mexico saying,
Coach, you're going to be pleased with Kia because Kia really hasn't in
practice been able to bang against someone her size and to know. Courtney
Paris, I'm sure really helped her a lot. By the time she got finished knocking
her around and by the time her arm got dislocated I think that Kia knew that
she had got to get tough and tougher. And that's the difference.  
  
Q. You mentioned before a little while ago how you got athletes or a little
bit more willing to run this year and push tempo. But it seemed like last
night after you guys got the lead, half court defense and especially on the
offensive end a lot of half court offense kind of shortened up the game like
that. If you guys can get a lead on Tennessee tomorrow night are you going to
try to dictate tempo like that again or do you want to run with them?  
COACH STRINGER: We will do one of two things. We will either put our foot on
the gas and get in the car and drive you out of control, you know, or we'll
get back we're not going to become a passenger. We can't become a passenger.
We got to dictate some things. And there's several ways that we can do that.
Either by the half court defense presses or the full court defenses and
presses. We need to know whether or not we run, we have to run at our own
speed but we can't try to run faster than what we have control of.  
I think that Matee just naturally likes to get out and go. Now, I don't know
what the heck she was thinking about last night because she started putting --
instead of her just one or two and kicking it up to the wings, she wasn't --
she was keeping her hands on the ball. Way too long. And we wanted to try to
push the ball up the floor. We will always try to do that. We'll try to score
in transition. That's what we do. But we're trying to not go out of control.
We'll just go ahead and go at the speed that we need to go and try to either
speed them up or slow it down.  
I think smart teams will do what we did. They will milk the clock and take the
shot with the lead. That's going to allow them to either drive to the inside
or like as Coach said, as you may have seen, we've jacked it up a couple times
real quick. But that's not what you do to win games. You're trying to win a
game. So we'll shorten it up of course.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the aura that sort of surrounds the Tennessee program
and how you kind of -- do you think your team will be affected by it or
because your team is so young they may not realize?  
COACH STRINGER: This team is very young. I have to remember sometimes some of
the words that I use. I mean, I look at them and they look real blank. So.  
(Laughter.) Really, you know, Coach will talk to me and say, Vivian, they
don't know what you're talking about. And they're very innocent. I mean,
people that I know to be great, they don't know. Tennessee, see what they do
is they relate -- like, for example, Epiphanny's best friend is the young lady
at UConn. They call each other after every game, the center, you know and the
other power forward. They're all great friends. I'm not surprised about the --
by the time in this day and age the way it's happening now these kids are
playing together during the summer. They may compete against each other during
the AAU's. Sometimes they encourage each other to go to each other's schools.
But in the summer they spend time going to Argentina or whatever. It becomes a
for USA basketball, it becomes a matter of them having a appreciation so they
have to become teammates. Also so they just have an appreciation for one
another and it's our job just to give them information and go fight for their
school and they will be technically -- they will just be technically sound.
They will just be technically sound.  
  
Q. When you were talking about Shannon Bobbitt she said she gives you a New
York show. Describe what a New York show is. Describe it in terms of both
Shannon and Epiphanny, the point guards, the particular thing that a point
guard gives you as a New York show a point guard or a two guard?  
COACH STRINGER: Well, we don't see a New York show from Epiphanny Prince. You
don't even see a high five. The girl barely raises her arm above her shoulders
when she's going through the line. You know how everybody does a 360 and hit a
hip or something like that? Epiphanny is very shy, quiet, drops her head. You
have to -- she's very smart so she will you have to catch what she just said.
But she doesn't -- that's not her.  
Shannon, you know, that might be Shannon's thing, you know. So she will do
that and talk some stuff. You have never seen Epiphanny say boo. You haven't
seen Epiphanny -- in fact, you know, she will be -- one day she was running
down the steps and trying to get to downstairs and one of the coaches said,
why are you running? Well, Mat's going to get on me if I'm one minute late.
She's the kind of person that is going to ask you, can I go to the bathroom? I
really have to go. Can I take a shower in the other place because it's too
cold in the other spot? She is just is a very -- she more or less is like the
person that comes off of Walton's mountain with John-boy, Walton's mountain,
you know. One of the writers referred to something about Ferris Buehler's Day
Off or whatever. She didn't know what they were talking about.  
These kids are young. They're into other things. I don't know what to say
other than the fact that if it's a New York show it will be Shannon. I think
that Epiphanny will give you a very solid, intelligent basketball game in the
purest sense. We'll see her running her. We won't see her running her mouth or
anything. Matee, you never seen her one time look at somebody like look what I
just did? You know you're not going to see her pluck her shirt. You know
you're not going to see that. Essence Carson, that's not in her nature. I was
stunned because she's the spokesperson for this group. We have worked for two
years for her. She's a straight-A student, but she never spoke. I said that
she texts 90 percent of the time until she realized that I wasn't going to
play her until -- unless she started talking to me.  
So probably the person that has the most outgoing personality is Kia. And with
Kia, Kia, Kia is so strong that you can see the fight -- you know the proudest
moment? You know when I knew she had arrived is when I saw a picture in one of
our newspapers and you could see Essence's finger, the hand's clenched, and
she said, Finally. When I saw tears coming from her eyes when she shot a foul
shot, when I saw Kia jump in the air and you could see that fight, teams that
I've had before have always shown their emotions. This group really doesn't.
You see Mat, you never see a change on her face. She might make a 360 pass.
You never see -- she got these oval eyes, she sees out of the side of her
head. She's like a snake. She's looking at you like this and she's just like
this. I mean, it's amazing. You don't see any change in expressions.  
Most of the time I think that they're not ready to play because she got this
little -- Heather, Heather will not try to lift her head up because she got
real little eyes and keeps her head down like this. I said, Heather, I know
one thing, you better not be going to sleep on me. Her as well as Mat, they
just look like they're sleeping. And then you say what you say and they say,
okay, let's go. You know.  
But they're very subdued. This is a very much like no other team that I've
coached. So I decided to fit more to them than them trying to conform to me.
Because they're not the kind of people that show much emotion. You'll probably
see it at the end of the game, but there's not one Brittany Ray, if I don't
say Brittany, tap her on her shoulder and make her answer, she's, yeah, no,
whatever you want to say. That's how they do. So it's just the style. Just
this group of kids' style and it's probably good for me and for them too.  
  
Q. You kind of touched on this a bit earlier, about how playing defense
isn't glamorous especially in this day and age. How have you been able to
impress upon your players that this type of defensive mentality is the right
way to go, the best way to go?  
COACH STRINGER: Because every time we see a team play and they look like the
next coming of Michael Jordan, the next question, and I'll run that clip back
and say, Now let's consider what's going on here. If this player got the ball
and they got a finger roll they got a hook shot, this or that, let's determine
whether or not there was any pressure. Was there? No. Somebody comes up they
just like bend over, get their head down, and so let's apply pressure when you
want to win. So this is what we have got to do if you just stand behind
someone and when they have got nice moves like that, then they're going to be
able to do that.  
But you need to play a side, force an angle and force the target to be a
moving target. Not something just standing there. And letting things happen.
So in wanting to win, and in trying to protect one another, knowing,
recognizing the Sylvia Fowles' show, we're going to have to drop two people on
her. Okay, but if they start to have the four starts to hit the shot, then we
got to be able to rotate. We're prepared. We have gone over these things a lot
of times. But right now it hurts so bad to lose that it doesn't take much to
figure out that we want to win and we'll do what we have to do.  
  
Q. Vivian, in the book that the season has begun, is it appropriate that
Tennessee be the last chapter? Of all the teams that you could be playing?  
COACH STRINGER: Wait a minute. Are you -- did you write a book?  
  
Q. No, I didn't write a book yet.  
COACH STRINGER: Oh.  
  
Q. I'm just saying if you looked at the season as a book and every game is a
chapter, is it appropriate that the final chapter be called Tennessee and not
something else?  
COACH STRINGER: Yeah. This is going to be for a great story line, isn't it? I
mean you should get together and collaborate. You'll benefit from all of this.
Over the years.  
But as I said to you before, it's only appropriate -- it's appropriate for so
many reasons, and they're too numerous to mention. It's only appropriate that
we should play Tennessee. And it should be the last chapter in the end story,
the end. I think that all of us have seen so many coaching greats retire and I
have been personally hurt to see so many of our coaches who have just been the
fiber of this profession leave. Pat is a staple. And I hope that we continue
to remember that. And some of us have just been around to do the right -- to
continue to stay. But I think it was a passion and a drive in your heart. I
can think of no more appropriate team, honestly. It started with Tennessee, in
my mind, you know, and it should end that way. So, yes, the end. You and I can
come up with a book and we'll work on it.  
  
Q. Two part question. You alluded earlier to attendance for women's
basketball games. Can you speak to your experience in the Greensboro Region
Final and during and your impressions of the turnout when you played Arizona
State. And, secondly, your thoughts on the discussions of moving the women's
tournament back a week to give it more visibility?  
COACH STRINGER: Exposure. Yeah. That's probably the reason why I mentioned
that. Because the fans were just great. It's kind of interesting. I thought
that it was interesting all the clips that I continue to see of Rutgers team,
not very many and they should have shown us all the time. Because every venue
that we played in it has been packed. Whether it's Michigan State, or whether
it's at North Carolina -- they keep showing these clips and I see empty seats.
I think that basketball fans unfortunately are fans of their particular team.
I think that men have a lot more following of basketball is basketball. So you
don't have to be from Georgetown, you're still going to come and see a
Georgetown-Ohio State game played. You know what, I mean, and that's what we
got to draw. And I really want this to be a direction and I know the NCAA
knows this, but whether they have to put more matchup zone or try to encourage
our athletic directors, our presidents and that to do a heck of a better job
of promoting teams because it's unfair. There is not that push the way that it
should. In the meantime, all you can do is take care of your particular fan
base. Duke, Rutgers, Connecticut and the likes. But when we played Arizona
State, you got a chance to see that. Because, I mean, I know they were
hurting, but still they didn't come to see Rutgers and Arizona state play.  
So that's why I said that. The idea I think that's been kicked around with the
ESPN about moving the game back so that it doesn't compete with the men's
game, I think that that's possible. They're concerned about going into the
golf and going into the start of preseason baseball. There are a lot of things
to be considered. But for sure we need our own show. We need our own show. And
as the game continues to grow, Candace Parker is good for the game. Sylvia
Fowles is good for the game. Ajavon is good for the game. So many players.  
I just think that we really got to have the good minds and the people to
promote the sport the way they should to really get together and talk about
how. Because all of you are here obviously care enough about what's going on
but we have got to do -- I think I could be real happy to see that we are
enjoying the same kind of attendance once we -- where would we go, wherever we
go. And that becomes the coaches have a job to coach, we're doing that. The
players are continuing to work to get these players to be better because we
have a job to entertain.  
But I do think that the administrative side of everything, NCAA, the
universities, have got a much more of a responsibility to promote this sport.
The matchup zone can be made in women's basketball. If other people would
believe and work to support it the way that it should. But it's not being
done. And I just have to say that and I'll take this opportunity to say that
we need to make a much bigger step because whatever we're doing is not enough.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH STRINGER: You're welcome. Thank you.

_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with a opening statement from
Coach Summitt.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, obviously to win at this level I think you have to have
great defensive pressure and influence. And I thought our defense was the key.
And the fact that we played them tough on the boards, I think, what, we
outrebounded them by one. And going into the game and we just kept talking
about the importance of stopping their transition, making them spend more time
in the court-to-court offense and just rebounding, rebounding, rebounding.  
And defensively I thought a big key for us was Sidney Spencer's defense on
Erlana Larkins.  
The fact that Erlana, which is their go-to player, was 2-4, I think that's a
very telling stat. And I give our inside people a lot of credit, as well as
our perimeter people for pressuring the basketball. And at the 8-minute mark I
basically said, We don't want to go home. They didn't want to go home. And I
said, We're not leaving here without a national championship.  
And I just saw a different -- I just saw a whole different attitude with this
team, the defense, and it started with Alexis and obviously with Shannon in
the back court. But it filtered throughout our team. Really, really excited
that we have a chance to be in this national championship game and play for a
championship.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Candace and Alexis, both, if y'all would just address, was it frustrating
for you in particular thinking the ball was never going to drop for you there
for the longest time?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: Well, it's frustrating as a player to get so many open
looks and I had a lot of long layups that just rolled out. But at the same
time I'm not the type of player that dwells on my offense. I just decided to
pick it up on the defensive end and crash the boards and try to be a emotional
leader for my team.  
CANDACE PARKER: And I feel like without my game against LSU, where I shot
2-15, and had like five rebounds, I feel like I hurt my team. And I knew that
although the ball wasn't falling for me, there's other things that I'm capable
of doing. And I feel like I'm thankful that I learned my lesson previous to
the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. When the game goes the way this one did for 34 minutes, when it may have
seemed like you were slugging your way uphill, what changed in those last six
minutes? What did you guys say to each other, what did Coach say to you? What
changed?  
CANDACE PARKER: To be honest with you we just did not want to go home. I mean,
we were looking back and at each other and just saying all the stuff that we
have been through to get to this point and not seize the moment would just be
a total waste. And we just really wanted it. And everybody on the floor, on
the bench, everybody in the stands wanted it. And when you have that, I mean
it's hard not to fight for your team.  
  
Q. To any of you, is that the kind of game you expected after having played
them before? The turnovers and -- between two teams that are averaging like
close to 160 points or more?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: It was the type of game we expected. In December I know
Tennessee was a different team. We were the type of team we relied on our
offense and we let our offense affect our defense and we just learned from
that throughout the season and realized this team is beatable. They have
weakness. We just need to exploit them. And we relied strictly on our defense
tonight and let everything else fall into place.  
  
Q. Candace, talk about the crowd and how much that helped with the momentum
when you guys started cutting into that lead in the last couple minutes
there?  
CANDACE PARKER: Our crowd is huge for us. And they have been there for my
whole career and for this whole season.  
You always look up in the crowd and you can see a whole bunch of orange. And
they were very big in our comeback.  
  
Q. You guys are very familiar with Rutgers. Candace, could you talk about
some of the special challenges that they present and especially defensively.  
CANDACE PARKER: Rutgers is playing some of the best basketball right now. They
have peaked at the right time. I haven't seen them play a lot previously to
the NCAA tournament but I know that they're a very defensive-minded team. And
they shot the ball great today. So obviously they have a lot of weapons in
Matee Ajavon and Essence Carson and Kia Vaughn. So we have our work cut out
for us.  
  
Q. Candace, you said on TV that there's a drought, you mentioned a drought.
Is that something you've talked about that it's been too long since Tennessee
won the championship?  
CANDACE PARKER: I think everybody wearing orange will say it's been way too
long. It's been way too long since Tennessee has won a national championship.
And I'm tired of going into Thompson Boling Arena and playing on the Summit
and not looking up and seeing a banner that has all our names written all over
it.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll take questions for the coach.  
COACH SUMMITT: Nick, you got off. You did a good job playing defense, so.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Both games today, you at the outset talked about defense, but I think the
word suffocating defense might be the right word for both of these games. In
fact, you may not know this, but your shooting percentage was the lowest ever
for a team that won a Final Four. All four teams out there today just --  
COACH SUMMITT: So we're in the record book again? I like that.  
  
Q. Well, I probably should have brought that up.  
COACH SUMMITT: It ain't pretty, but we're there.  
  
Q. But what about -- I don't think there's a coach on the face of this
earth, male or female, that doesn't always talk defense first. But is it a
cliche or does it always come down to defense at this time of the year?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think it is really two-fold. I think that it comes down to
defense and rebounding.  
Obviously I really feel like in some of the championships that we have won we
have not shot the basketball particularly well. But we have influenced how our
opponents played and how they shot the ball as well.  
Defense is obviously given us a lot of offensive opportunities and it did in
this game. It gave us a chance to make the kind of run that we made. Again, I
just -- I felt like we had a influence on North Carolina in this game. We
didn't have any influence on them when we played them at North Carolina. They
pretty much had their way with us.  
I would say this, I just thought our team about midway of the season decided
that they were going to allow their defense to be a number one priority. More
than their rebounding.  
Fortunately, that's what's happened for us. And without that, we couldn't have
beaten this North Carolina team. They're a great basketball team and we did
some good things, if you look at the number of shots that some of the players
got and also some of the percentage, they struggled like we did to make shots.  
  
Q. We can talk about withering defense all we want. But it was kind of ugly
out there. Both games. And this being the showcase for women's sports, the
nation watching, what have you, is there any concern that this is except for
those last few minutes which were very exciting but even then still a little
messy, any concern that you have as a -- one of the legend of women's sports
that this would be what would be displayed for the nation today?  
COACH SUMMITT: I am not the least bit concerned about that style of play. I
think people that understand basketball would have a great deal of respect for
the intensity and the defense that these two teams brought to the court. And
also understand that we influenced each other because of our defense.  
And it seems like I watched the men's game last night that wasn't quite as
fluid early on. But I think that if you understand the game, then you
understand what happened tonight. Yeah, people like to see a lot of points put
up on the board. But they may not be people that really understand the game.  
  
Q. Obviously you faced one of your best friends now for the national
championship. It's early, but any thoughts about what it would be like to go
up against Coach Stringer with these stakes on the line?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, Sylvia Hatchell was on my staff at Tennessee as a grad
student. We're both in grad school together and she coached my junior varsity
team. Sylvia and I have been great friends. Vivian and I are great friends. I
have tremendous respect for both of them and really have just enjoyed the
friendship that we have shared, but certainly I know Vivian is going to have
her team ready and prepared. I know how much that she wants to win. And she
wants her team to win a national championship. And I feel the same way.  
Regardless of what happens in that game, we'll be friends. I'm proud for what
Vivian has done. She's been great for this game, she's won and brought teams
to the Final Fours from three different programs. And I've stayed at the same
place for 33 years. So she's done a lot more things than I have, but at the
same time it will be great to see Rutgers in that game and see Vivian Stringer
on the stage because she's certainly deserves it with the job she's done with
a young basketball team that she has just really brought along and she has
them believing they can win a national championship. And obviously their
defense is really, really tough. So it should be a great game.  
  
Q. With, what, little over eight minutes it's 48-36, at that point the way
the scoring's going there's not going to be much scoring, you're down 12, are
you thinking it's still doable? And to get back you practically had to shut
them out and that's what you did. And kind of a follow-up to that, where does
this rank in the comebacks you've seen your team have and in high-stake
situations like this?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I really felt like that at that time there was a lot of
time and a lot of possessions left. And I knew that we had some players that
were a little frustrated, but we just -- we brought a lot of energy from the
bench. Our staff, my staff was tremendous. We kept talking about we can do
this. We will do this.  
As I said, we just talked about what we had to do on the floor and they
responded. And in trying to keep everyone really positive, because Alexis was
really struggling. She struggled in the last couple games with her shooting.
But I said, We have to win this with defense. We're going to have to win this
with our defense. And our rebounding. In order to get easy scoring
opportunities. And at that time I definitely thought, I mean, I thought it was
doable and then I started to feel with our defensive pressure that it was
beginning to be effective and we were starting to see the momentum change.  
  
Q. Where does this rank maybe in some of the comebacks?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, you ask me today, it's probably one of best wins of my
career, since you asked me today. But it's all part of getting to the national
championship game. And obviously this was huge today. The main thing is I'm
just proud for this team. Because they have played the toughest schedule in
the country, they have been tough, they have been together, they're committed
to defense and rebounding. And they're committed to each other. And I just --
I want it for them.  
More than anything, I want it for them. And they know we're working hard as a
staff and I've got a tremendous staff to help not only teach and coach, but
inspire these young women and we just got to be ready to play and hopefully
we're a little more efficient.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for joining us. We'll see you tomorrow.  
COACH SUMMITT: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2007

  

### [Sylvia Hatchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15656)

### [Ivory Latta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15658)

  
_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with a opening statement by Coach and then go to
questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH HATCHELL: I'm extremely proud of my team. I felt like we should have won
the game. We have never lost to a team when they shot 27 percent. I feel like
defensively we did the job when you hold a team to 27 percent.  
I'm really disappointed. And just really proud of my team. So that's really
about it.  
THE MODERATOR: Again, we'll take questions for our student-athletes first.  
  
Q. Ivory, what was it like to sit on the bench there in the first half for
so long and just not be a able to be out on the court affecting the game
there?  
IVORY LATTA: It was very -- I was just hurting because I couldn't be out there
with my team and help them get through it. But Alex did a great job of leading
the way and it just hurts so bad right now.  
  
Q. Ivory, can you talk about the defense that Tennessee put on you guys in
the last eight minutes?  
IVORY LATTA: I could just say they played aggressive defense. We was trying to
get the ball to Erlana in the post. They was definitely fronting her and
doubleteaming and they just played aggressive defense.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much for joining us. You guys can head back to
the locker room. Take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Was there anything that you saw that in the end of the game that reminded
you at all of the final regular season game against Duke where you had the
lead going into the last couple minutes and then couldn't score down the
stretch?  
COACH HATCHELL: Were we at the same game? No. They put extreme pressure on us
and we -- it's hard for us whenever Camille and LaToya are sitting on the
bench with five fouls.  
We got all of our subs in there because we don't have our regular players out
there because they have all fouled out. So it's hard to execute. So we were
trying to get the ball into Erlana and then we just started driving and I wish
if I had it to do over we had just every time just drove straight to the
basket and at least tried to get on the foul line a little bit. Because they
shot 26, we shot eight.  
At least I would have at least tried to get us on the foul line a little bit
and maybe that would have worked some.  
But they, again, we were trying to get ball inside but it's hard for us to
function whenever LaToya and Camille are sitting over there on the bench.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit LaToya and Camille, the job they did on Parker
for most of the game.  
COACH HATCHELL: Yeah, I thought they did a great job. The best offense she had
was the foul line offense. So I thought we did a great job on her defensively.
So I was real proud of the job they did.  
  
Q. You scored some -- to take that lead in the second half you scored some
fastbreak points that seemed to help you get such a big lead. Can you explain
maybe did Tennessee maybe do something to take that away near the end of the
game?  
COACH HATCHELL: We got some steals and we got some fastbreaks off the steals.
And we got the ball out. We were running the floor pretty good, especially
Rashanda McCants. And then when Camille and -- I think that we were -- we
might have -- we should have been more aggressive.  
Like I said, if I had to do over we would have just taken the ball to the
basket and not tried to get the ball inside. We just brought it down the floor
and then would have taken it until they -- if they picked us up defensively
and tried to draw some fouls and then get some just some kickouts. Because it
was hard for us to run anything because they were denying everything,
especially the passes into the post. And we were dribbling the ball too much.
We weren't passing it, moving it around. We were dribbling the ball too much.
But again, they had us a little bit out of synch and that's usually what we do
to people. But again, they shot 27 percent. So I was really proud of our
defense and the difference in the game was on the foul line. Let's be honest.  
  
Q. I was just wondering if you were surprised when you looked at the stats
being how physical the game was, that you only shot 8 free throws?  
COACH HATCHELL: Yes. I was very disappointed more than anything else. But, you
know, it's just the way it is.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH HATCHELL: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2007

  

### [Sylvia Fowles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15650)

### [Bob Starkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17183)

### [Erica White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16371)

  
_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with a opening statement from Coach Starkey and
then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH STARKEY: Well first thing I would like to do is congratulate Rutgers. I
thought they obviously had a game plan that was very well executed, let the
kids play hard.  
Obviously I hurt for our team and our fans and our administration. But I
couldn't be more happy for somebody like Coach Stringer, who I have a great
respect for a long time and realize tomorrow or Tuesday will be the first time
that she will have a opportunity to play in a championship game and that's a
good thing. I'm extremely proud of our kids. We talked about a couple things
in the locker room. The most important was they didn't need to judge
themselves based on this one outing. That they need to look at the entire body
of work.  
I told them that you don't have to win championships to be champions. And in
my eyes they're champions. We talked a little bit about the Apollo 13 movie
that we used for motivation, and even with that, their goal was to go to the
moon and I guess ours was too but what sometimes things happen and change and
the crew was supposed to bring the ship back safely.  
And I thought that's what our team did. I thought we brought our program back
to LSU, we have accomplished a lot of things and we have done it in a positive
way and I'm extremely, extremely proud of them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sylvia, Coach Stringer did pay you nice compliments and said that she
feels that you're the best center in the country. I imagine you don't feel
quite like that tonight. What did they do to you to take you out of your game
and have you had a game that you can recall that was like that?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Not taking anything from Rutgers defense, but I don't feel that
they, I don't feel that they had to do much. I just think I had a sluggish
game from the get-go and couldn't get in rhythm and I couldn't do anything to
help my team out from the jump ball.  
  
Q. Erica, they made a lot of shots early. They made a lot of shots with
hands in their face. They made a lot of 3s. Were you guys you were out there,
it wasn't like you didn't get out there. What does that do to a team? I don't
want to say does it deflate you or does it have at least a momentarily
depressing effect or did you guys just play through that?  
ERICA WHITE: A we just tried to play through it. And our saying tonight was we
want to keep an even keel and don't know any negative emotions. If they hit a
shot with a hand in their face you just say good shot. And you just come out
and try to run the offense. And I commend them, they hit tough shots tonight.  
  
Q. Sylvia, you said you couldn't do anything from the get-go from the jump
ball, it looked like you were still kind of tying your shoes when the jump
ball went up and it was like that almost set a whole mood for the team maybe
she basically took that jump ball without any opposition, were you kind of not
ready, not into the game the way you thought you would be?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I was into the game. Just couldn't get into a rhythm.  
  
Q. Sylvia, how physical was Kia Vaughn against you and how much did they
surround you with extra players?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Kia Vaughn is a tremendous defensive player. She gave her all
and she did all she had to do to keep me off the box and keep me off the
boards. And about doubling and triple teaming, what are, but it really don't
matter. I saw that all year and it didn't play a big effect.  
  
Q. Erica, after all you've been through since March 8 or March 9, do you
think it finally caught up to you, all the emotions that have been going
through your head that all of a sudden after playing so well to this point
that it all caught up to you you just came out and played plat flat?  
ERICA WHITE: I don't think so. We didn't play our best tonight and they shot
the ball extremely well and I think that's what happened here tonight and
nothing else.  
We just had a bad game. And it happened at the worst possible time. But I
don't think we have anything to be ashamed of and I told my teammates, you
know, people will say LSU has gone to the Final Four four years in a row and
have lost, but we're getting to the hump, so the fact that we can't get over
the hump, I think we should be proud of getting here and we definitely have
nothing to be ashamed of.  
  
Q. Erica, a couple of the stats that are obvious not in your favor in this
game, obviously the shooting, and then Rutgers out rebounded you guys. Could
you just talk about those two things and what was going on during the game.  
ERICA WHITE: Rutgers hit tough shots. They hit shots with a hand in their face
and I commend them for that. They shot the ball extremely well tonight. We
definitely had our nights like that, not tonight. But when a team's shooting
the ball that well, there's pretty much nothing you can do. We tried to
contest it and I think we did that. They just hit the tough shots. They out
rebounded us and we wanted to own the paint but we obviously didn't do that.
And yeah, I just commend them, they played well tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you to both our student-athletes. We'll take questions
for the coach.  
  
Q. All the screens they were able to set with their big people outside it
made it really tough for your defenders to get around. What did you try to do
to combat that or to adjust to that. But even when you got a hand in their
face they were still hitting them.  
COACH STARKEY: I want to go over a couple things first, because I think it's
really important along those lines. I think that one of the things that got us
off to the bad start was our game plan. And I'm responsible for that.  
One of the things we wanted to do is we wanted to play inside out on screens
and take the dribble penetration, the paint away. So in playing that way we
allowed them to get some open looks early that I didn't think were contested
and they weren't contested because we weren't trying to contest them.  
They came out and hit those shots early and it gave them some confidence.  
After that they were hitting some tough shots. One of the things that they did
bother us with was the ball screen plays up top. Early on we were sliding
through and I thought we made a adjustment to trap and I thought we hurt them
a little bit, but obviously the damage had been done.  
  
Q. What do you think happened to Sylvia?  
COACH STARKEY: That's a good question. Every now and then Sylvia gets
frustrated. She doesn't hit her first shot or she doesn't get a call or and
sometimes for whatever reason it's difficult for her to play through.  
She's done that in the past. She doesn't do it nearly as much as she used to.
And I think that's a positive thing.  
But obviously the goal next year I would think would be for her to work
through that on a consistent basis where it never affects her.  
  
Q. Did Rutgers do anything different defensively against her that you hadn't
seen or anything or just did it better?  
COACH STARKEY: Nothing new at all. They played man-to-man. They blocked off
our four player which was either Ashley Thomas or Porsha Phillips and doubled
her up and we probably have seen that nine out of ten times when we play. And
I thought they did a good job of it. I don't think we were necessarily
mentally sharp in terms of what we needed to do offensively. When teams play
us like that we need to reverse the basketball a little bit more and get a few
more people some touches, make them guard us. The best possession for us was
the first possession of the second half when we told our kids that we wanted
five passes and two ball reversals. And we did that and we got the dump into
Sylvia and she got the lay-up. It was just a little frustrating that we didn't
try and go about that a lot more often.  
  
Q. What's next for you? Did you say good-bye to the players or how does that
work with the head coach not being here and you not being interested in the
job?  
COACH STARKEY: I haven't given much thought obviously to that. My next thing
is to go back to the hotel and pack and get on the plane with the team
tomorrow. I did tell the team that if I never coached again that I was
thrilled that this was the last team that I coached. And if I coached for 20
more years, I would never forget what they had accomplished.  
So I think that's important for them to know. And I don't know what's ahead
for me. But I was tickled to death to be a part of them. I told -- my high
school coach was here tonight and I made the comment to him that I didn't take
them to the Final Four, they took me. And there really is a lot of truth to
that. I'm awful proud of them.  
  
Q. The fact that you have everybody or LSU has everybody coming back next
year, how do you think this team will remember tonight and use it as
motivation?  
COACH STARKEY: Let me tell you something. This was a great thing I thought. It
was a very emotional locker room. Every kid was crying. And this is the fourth
Final Four we have been to. We have lost three previous Final Fours and I
never seen a tear in there. This team really cared about each other. I think
they were not just crying for themselves, but crying for each other. And I
think it will be a great motivational factor for them. I think you'll see that
they will have a great off season, Sylvia leaves on Friday for Italy to go
work with USA Basketball. We, there's a lot of great things in place at LSU
from our strength program to our trainer and these kids, they're wonderful.
They're going to work hard. I think that obviously this team's best days are
ahead of it.  
  
Q. The question was asked of one of the players, do you think that at times
like this it can be a relief to finally be done or do you think any of that
factored in the way you guys played tonight?  
COACH STARKEY: No. I don't think that factored into it at all. I really think
that we came out and played poorly on a night against a good opponent who
played extremely well.  
I think if there was relief that it was over, the locker room wouldn't have
been emotional, there wouldn't have been all those tears. I think it hurt and
I think that's a good hurt. I'm glad they hurt. I think that's important in
terms of them being competitive and being able to take that next step. I think
this team is more prepared to take the next step than any team that we have
had prior.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH STARKEY: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL

_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with a opening statement from Coach Stringer and
then we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH STRINGER: Wow. That's the best word to describe what's happening right
here. I am so proud of these young ladies. The great effort. You didn't see a
fight. We talked at the beginning about only believing what -- only believing
in what we know. And I think that through the course of this year we were a
team that had faith but we also believed because of what we saw.  
We had an opportunity to play before great crowds and against the No. 1 and
No. 2 team in the country. And some of the most difficult situations. How
could this be any more intimidating than this opportunity. So we took this
more as a opportunity. No one expected us to be here. But the long story short
is that the people of the state of New Jersey, these players first believed in
themselves and as a result I thought that we executed extremely well, focused
on the defensive side of it and didn't really read any of the hype.  
We're happy to be here. That's why I'm so very proud of each and every person
here. And just continue to keep the ball rolling. So I guess we'll see you all
of you guys here on Tuesday, right?  
THE MODERATOR: Let's take questions for student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kia, you essentially muscled Sylvia Fowles into irrelevance tonight. Can
you talk about from the opening tip you were on her right away. Could you talk
about what you were able to do?  
KIA VAUGHN: I just basically played her well. Tried to be tough with her. She
was a strong body and I just tried to physically make her move and keep her a
away from the basket as far as I possibly could.  
  
Q. Essence, could you talk about the development of your offensive game, you
worked on your jumper over the summer and what really worked and what really
got that thing going for you and when did you maybe during the season feel
that confidence?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Well, I really didn't take the time to work much on my jumper
over the summer. And I got to apply what I worked on during USA basketball.
And I played another summer league as well. And with that experience in
summertime it really helped me out. It's one thing to practice it but once you
get to use it in a real game situation that's when you really gain the
experience and learn how to use it effectively. And that just really helped me
throughout this entire season. It's really helped my team out that we do have
balanced scoring from four or five positions.  
  
Q. Essence, can you just describe what happened to your leg in the second
half and are you okay for Tuesday?  
ESSENCE CARSON: I'm perfectly fine. It was a cramp. Typical of athletes. Just
a little dehydration. But I'm all fine and dandy now. Walking around and
running on it. So I'll definitely be ready for Tuesday.  
  
Q. Was it your right leg?  
ESSENCE CARSON: My right quad.  
  
Q. How much of the game plan was to shoot like that from outside or were the
shots just kind of falling and were you surprised at how many went down?  
MATEE AJAVON: I think it's just it was just there. We didn't plan to like
shoot 3s. The shots were there. Which opened up for the inside. So they just
went in.  
  
Q. Kia, could you sense how frustrated Fowles got in the first half?  
KIA VAUGHN: I really didn't try to feed into that. That's her problem or
anything else. She stayed calm to me when I watched her. I just tried to do
and maintain what I was doing. And at that I was watching help and everything
else. But she's still good, I'm not taking anything away from her.  
  
Q. Essence, Coach Stringer is in the Hall of Fame and this is the first time
she's gotten this far. Can you talk about what it feels like to get her
here?  
ESSENCE CARSON: It feels great.  
  
Q. Second time. Sorry.  
ESSENCE CARSON: Well, that's okay.  
(Laughter.) It feels great to have gotten this far. But you can't give up.
When you're this close, why just settle for this. We have worked so hard this
entire season. We have come from nothing and basically built our foundation
from scratch. And to give up now would just fall short of what she's really
trying to achieve. Especially this year with this team. We're just going to
keep on believing. There's one more game left.  
  
Q. For any of the players. Coach talked a lot the other day about belief.
And a lot about where your journey has taken you this year. But with full
benefit of hindsight, if I would have told you when you were 2-4 that four and
a half months later you would be in the national championship game, would you
have believed it?  
MATEE AJAVON: Honestly, no, we wouldn't have. We probably would have looked at
you like you're crazy. But like you said, it was just belief in us, just
believing in ourselves, the coaches always believing in us and just applying
what we learned in practice to the court. So I think that's basically where it
came from. And I give a lot of thanks to the coaches who have been doing a
remarkable job of preparing us mentally and physically for what we're going
through now.  
  
Q. Kia, you looked into the in the first three or four times where Sylvia
touched the ball today you just absolutely put the body on her, took her off
her feet a couple times. And it didn't get called. Did you feel that the
officials were letting you two play and letting you -- the word was used
"muscle her" before. Have you ever muscled somebody like that off the floor?
And not gotten called for a foul?   
KIA VAUGHN: I didn't realize I lifted her off the floor. I'm sorry.  
  
Q. Kia went out with her second foul nine minutes into the first half. E,
who is the leading scorer, goes down seven minutes in into the second half.
Why did none of that matter tonight?  
MATEE AJAVON: Because we prepared for these things in practice. You got to be
prepared for it all. And no matter who is on the floor, you got to have --
everything has to flow. So I think that the coach he's did a great job
substituting and knowing who to put in at certain times.  
  
Q. Essence, and Mat, that point in the first half there was last five
minutes of the game where it was score, 55, turnover, score again, 55,
turnover, or a missed shot for them. And I think you guys had pulled away at
that point. And LSU just didn't know what to do. Is that the point at which
you guys thought, okay, this is -- we're going to go to the national
championship game?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Not at all. Because LSU, they're a great fighting team.  
At this stage, in the post season, you can't declare victory that early.
Especially in the first half. They're there's still 20-plus minus left. And, I
mean, if we were in that position we would definitely wouldn't give up. We
would keep fighting, keep fighting, keep surviving. Until our hearts pounded
out of our chest.  
So we knew that they were coming back in the second half and they would be
very strong and try to come out really intense. And they did come out second
half pretty strong. And we knew -- it wasn't over until it was over until that
horn went off.  
  
Q. For Mat, I noticed you were the fourth leading 3-point shooter on the
team. Did you -- have you ever had a game like this before and what was going
through your mind when your shots were falling?  
MATEE AJAVON: I'm not sure if I had a game like that before. It was just in
the flow of the game. My teammates did a great job of recognizing that I was
hitting the shots and passing it back to me. So I just give a lot of credit to
my teammates.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll now start with questions for Coach.  
  
Q. When Kia went out at 11:22 to go in the first half, Sylvia only got one
shot. What did you tell Rashidat? What were your instructions to her?  
COACH STRINGER: Well, if you noticed even we only have 10 players but we have
been using all 10 of those players and each person has had a game where they
have made a huge difference. They have had significant minutes. So it's not a
front. Just to go ahead when we have got a 10-point lead or whatever, Rashidat
has been in games where she's had to make a difference. So we were trying to
tell her at the beginning, you don't have time for a 30 second, you're trying
to find yourself and someone picking up a foul or have somebody get the
rebounds they're not supposed to. See yourself through every move that Kia is
involved in and that time will come. Because I only anticipated playing Kia
about three to five minutes if she didn't pick up a foul and taking her out.
So that Ra got a feel for how the game was being played to the inside any way,
so Ra knew that. So when it happened, it's like a relay, this is the
opportunity that you've been waiting for. So step in and let's go. You got to
cover it, you're not missing a beat on this. The same thing, Mat was a little
rattled at the beginning and we needed to bring in --  
What's interesting about that is they're freshmen, you know. But they seem to
be oblivious. We haven't really pounded it into their heads this the Final
Four, my God, it's the Final Four. We just tried to deal with the game in a
technical sense. We understand history, that we are fourth seed. We're not
supposed to be here. No one expected us to be here. That's all right with us.  
What we're looking to do is to feel good about ourselves. And so, you know,
when Brittany was able to step in there and spell Mat for a couple minutes,
she got a chance to talk to her, settle her down. So that gave me a good
sense. Now Brittany is ready. Now we put her back in but then of course E goes
down.  
For some strange reason in years past I have been in, you know, games that
lead to a Final Four and you've got a loss of crucial player and your whole
team tends to reflect those minutes that that player has been gone. But what's
interesting about this team is that, as Mat said, they really believe and know
that they're a team. They're not individually looking for accolades as you can
see we got none. The only thing that we're looking for is a respect -- well,
that's true. All you have to do is look at that. That tells you something
right there. But all you have to do is recognize that we're just playing
together as a team and one person asked, well, what makes us so dangerous, is
I don't know if it was going to come from E or if it was going to come from
Mat or from Brittany. You don't know where it's going to come from. They have
functioned all year long doing bad and doing well or doing good and doing,
good and bad. But they have done it together. So.  
  
Q. Can you go back to '82 and think about what it was like back with Cheney
State back then, and did you think it would take 25 years to get a shot at
another, to play for another national championship and can you just describe
the feelings now reaching the championship game as opposed to then?  
COACH STRINGER: Well, I think that if anyone were to think that -- of how long
anything would take when you're trying to excel at those levels, I don't think
that we could probably make it. I think that -- but because each year I really
love what I do in coaching and I look at it from a technical sense of
considering where the players are and molding them into the players that you
hope them to be, that the years kind of pass.  
No, I didn't think about 25 years. I do know this, my heart was broken when I
did have to make substitutions, much like what happened with Kia. And as I
shared with some you, when I took my 6-4 out I had to bring in a 5-11, and the
meantime the game was against Louisiana Tech. It was the first championship
that the NCAA put on. I was bringing a 5-11; they were bringing a 6-2, Dennis
Rodman's sister who was mad she was coming off the bench, so you know it was
just rough.  
So this was nice it was a different feeling. I really have confidence in all
the players and I don't know why other than the fact that as I said to some of
you, really do believe that our steps are in order. I do believe that this is
the team of destiny and there's a sense of calm. I was really nervous and
anxious. I had been very, very calm. Sometimes I have to ask myself, what the
heck am I doing? You know. And it's almost as though I'm free to coach and I
feel very good about it. I feel very good about the coaches that are around
me. I feel good about the players that are there. And as you know, Rutgers
athletics, our football team had such great success, and our so many of our
other programs and I just wanted to carry that ball and we know that it's
about hard work. I think I saw with the guys what they went through, the
football team, and we knew what we had to do and our men's basketball team,
too, and we believed it. Gymnastics and every other aspect of soccer,
everything that is about Rutgers, we want the people throughout the country to
know what it means to come from New Jersey and to a great extent both New York
and New Jersey are combined, joined together forces, and we really do feel as
one. This team is real proud of the fact that our governor was here, the
president of our university. Of course our athletic director was here, but our
football and basketball coaches were here. That spoke volumes. So many of the
fans that are here and perhaps they're the only people that believed in us.
We're grateful. We appreciate that. We just want to make everybody proud and
we'll continue to work hard.  
  
Q. Coaches make plans but players have to execute the plans. And have you
seen two players, your two posts ever do as solid a job as those two? You
don't ever completely stop Sylvia, but I'm guessing that that's as stopped as
she got this year.  
COACH STRINGER: Let me ask you this. Where are you from?  
  
Q. Cleveland.  
COACH STRINGER: Cleveland. Okay. But your observations are very good. Because
I'm going to tell you something, not only that, not only that, I thought that
the key to that believe it or not was Heather Zurich. Heather recognized who
she was playing, and she basically stepped to the four player and then backed
off and that made a difference, you see, because in order for Sylvia Fowles to
get into what she likes to do best, as all of you know, is that hook shot. But
in order to have a hook, you have got -- it's got to be extended to the
outside. So that the recovery was back down to the inside. So that took away
that.  
I don't think maybe she has worked this hard to get that because she wanted
that but in the meantime Kia kept pushing her up she caught her high in the
lane and kept her up. So that goes without saying that's perhaps something
that you didn't see. Or know.  
LSU is as good a team as I've seen all year. And Sylvia Fowles is the best
center in America. Period. We were on high alert and I didn't know that we
were going to do this good a job. We did. But I can honestly tell you that I
just know that this team as a whole executed the way that they did.  
And what I'm most impressed with Kia about is that normally Kia gets a little
anxious when she gets in the post position, especially with a shot blocker
that's as intimidating as Sylvia Fowles was. So my mindset was to give her
lead passes so she didn't have to do anything other than to take it to the
hole. No reads, no nothing. Catch it and make the pass that will lead her to
the basket. But I was stunned because Kia -- not so much stunned. I should say
it like this. I am so proud of the continued development of each and every
player including Rashidat, each and every -- they're so young that they grow
and learn every day. What was very significant for me was to see her catch it,
keep it tight, look over her shoulder, not get anxious, and hold the ball and
in a controlled position. And then go up over the top of her and take that
shot. Or be able to bounce the pass back out. So there was a lot of growth
that we saw today.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for joining us, we'll see you to tomorrow.  
COACH STRINGER: Thanks, every one.

_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement by
Coach Summitt.  
COACH SUMMITT: First of all, I would just say that we're excited as a
basketball team, staff, and the University of Tennessee to be back in
Cleveland. Obviously we were here for the Regional play last year and
certainly I thought we had great fan support.  
I'm looking forward to another matchup with North Carolina, a team that's
enjoyed success against us, and certainly I think they are a basketball team
that we know we have to be ready to play and bring our A game. And I think
it's going to be a great matchup and just look forward to the preparation and
obviously to game time.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sidney, it's the -- it is your last chance, it is your last trip to the
Final Four. Do you feel any sense of -- more sense of urgency than you would
when you were underclassmen or is it about the same?  
SIDNEY SPENCER: I guess as you grow up in this program or just as a college
athlete when time is running out I guess I do feel more of a -- like this is
my last opportunity. But I love this basketball team and I wouldn't want to be
here without this team. And I just think that we have a great chance at
winning it.  
  
Q. Coach Hatchell said she felt like one of the areas which you guys have
improved the most is the guard play. How do you think your play has improved
from a year ago and also how having Shannon has helped in the back court?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: Well, my game personally has improved since last year and
offensively on efficiency I worked hard this summer at getting my jump shot
together and trying to get it more effective.  
As far as having Shannon on the team, it's a great addition. Being moved to
the wing and being able to just get a rebound and get out and run and not
worry about coming back and getting the ball, and Shannon does a great job of
just pushing tempo.  
  
Q. Candace, North Carolina does a great job of rebounding, they obviously
have a bunch of tall girls that can jump. Can you just talk about you matching
up with that front lane and the challenge and what you saw in December and
some of the things you guys will have to do differently this time.  
CANDACE PARKER: North Carolina is very athletic and they pride themselves on
rebounding the basketball on the offensive end. As well as on the defensive
end.  
In December I don't think we did a great job. We allowed them to have second
and third chances. So obviously we need to limit that. And just box out.
Because you're not going to jump with especially this. They're very athletic.
So we're going to do a better job of that this time I think.  
  
Q. Alexis, how long did it take you to get comfortable again with your hand
after last season? And you had a lot of assists in the tournament, has there
been some reason why? Five or six a game. Something opening up for you that
wasn't?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: Well, as far as the question about my wrist, I wasn't
really released until about June. And so I just took all of June, July and
August just working on my jump shot and rehabbing and getting my hand, my ball
handling back together. And as far as passing, our team has done a great job
of moving. And we're just hitting the open player. We're moving, better
screening, so a lot more people are open and I just take it upon myself to hit
the open man.  
  
Q. Candace, the first player I think I've ever seen who is listed as a guard
forward and a center in the media guide. Which position do you play best? And
what do you consider yourself?  
CANDACE PARKER: I consider myself a forward. I think that that's my natural
position is at the four. And for this team that's where I spend the majority
amount of my time. But luckily in the Tennessee offense and especially in
transition, all five of us can bring the ball up the court and we fill the
lanes equally.  
Sometimes Lex can run to the paint, sometimes even Shannon can run to the
paint. So I feel like in transition it's -- we're all very, very strong.  
  
Q. Alexis, Ivory was able to make so many plays down the stretch against you
guys last year, how do you slow her down? What's the best way to stop her?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: Well, a player as versatile as that you have to play her
straight up. You have to respect her game whether it's the three ball or
driving. You just basically have to have great one-on-one defense and if you
do get beat you have to rely on your teammates to give you that help. So you
just have to leave it all on the court and realize that you do have help and
just go all out and don't hold anything back.  
  
Q. Candace, what does the Player of the Year award mean to you?  
CANDACE PARKER: It's a tremendous honor and I wouldn't be here without my
coaches and my teammates.  
But that's all put aside now because we have a goal that we came here to the
Final Four to accomplish. So that's all behind me and hopefully we can go out
and on Sunday and take care of business.  
  
Q. Sidney, how tough was that loss last year to Carolina and are you glad
it's them again here?  
SIDNEY SPENCER: That loss last year was really hard. I think. Coming in this
summer and just talking about what we want to accomplish for the year, our
team really made it a point of emphasis to become that Tennessee defensive
team that we used to be. So we wanted to step our defensive pressure up this
year and I think we have done a great job of just really focusing on defense
and our defense leading to offensive points and scoring. And in transition.  
So I'm definitely glad that we get to play them again. I think it's great for
women's basketball to have a matchup like this.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We'll take questions for Coach Summitt now.  
  
Q. How has Candace improved? What's been her biggest area of improvement
this year?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think she's improved both offensively and defensively. I
think the offensive aspect has been her development and getting in the gym and
working really hard and also just devoting time to her skills, her offensive
skills. She's worked on her post moves, she's worked on her face-up game.
Worked on playing off the dribble and her pull-up game is a lot better.  
I think just the versatility from an offensive standpoint. And then, secondly,
I think just playing with the World Championship Team, I think just the
maturity there of playing with the pro players and being around Tina Thompson
and Temeka Catchings and understanding you have to play both ends of the
floor, and I think the -- probably the biggest upside to her game of late has
been her commitment on the defensive end.  
I thought she was in our Ole Miss game she was terrific, I mean that was by
far the hardest that she's worked at both ends of the floor. But I think
that's because she really wanted to be here in Cleveland. And I just think
that she's just much more committed to her team and to the Tennessee defensive
system.  
  
Q. What are you planning on changing from your December game plan against
Erlana Larkins?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think Erlana is going to get her points and obviously
she's shooting the basketball exceptionally well. Yet I think that we have to
do a better job. You always want to try to limit touches. There's no guarantee
that you can. But we would like to do a better job just one-on-one defense. In
the paint.  
I thought she totally dominated the paint in that game. And I think that just
being able to somehow influence how many times she touches it and where she
gets it. But she's a player, you're not going to stop her. You hope you can
have some luck in containing her game, but she is just a great player. I think
she's been the real key for them.  
  
Q. The whole topic of is Candace going to leave or is she going to stay came
up this season and I'm just wondering, as a coach, how do you advise players
in this situation? I don't know if you had many or not, maybe just Candace,
but how to weigh this decision. Obviously it's a very different thing than
what the men's players have to go and decide?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, actually, I haven't even talked to Candace about it and
asked her if she was going or staying. I think there's only one choice. If you
want to make the sound choice and you're a college student-athlete, I think
these are four of the best years of your life. I think Candace right now is on
the biggest stage in women's basketball. And she understands that. But I read
in the -- I actually read that she was staying. And I just -- we were
practicing and she came down on a lay-up drill and shot a lay-up and I said I
enjoyed what I read in the paper today, Candace. And she just smiled. So we
have had no discussion.  
I think she's very intelligent. In the classroom, in her decisions off the
court, a lot of maturity. And I think she understands that it's not that she's
turning down millions of dollars. I wish we could get to that point in our pro
game, but eventually we might. But certainly I think she understands that the
college game right now is the place that she's really excelling and getting a
lot of recognition and having a lot of fun.  
  
Q. Two questions, Coach, one, game-wise, are you looking to get another post
presence other than Candace? Seems to be a lot of post presence in this
particular Final Four. Something that maybe would offset her or at least open
her up a little bit. That's game-wise. And then, two, somewhat on what you
just talked about, a lot of coaches lately in the women's game the last --
even within the last couple days have really gotten some hefty pay raises. And
there are a lot of big job openings that seem to be headed that way as well.
Could you just kind of comment on that and what you see in that regard too.  
COACH SUMMITT: To answer your first question, Nicky Anosike has really picked
up her inside play. And in post season. And then I think that's helped her and
she's also benefited from the double teams and triple teams that Candace has
seen throughout this tournament.  
She's a player that we do rely on inside. Certainly Alex Fuller has been off
the bench and done some good work for us and helped our basketball team.  
So I do think that because of the type of player that Candace is, that we can
get other people involved. The defense usually allows us that opportunity if
they want to play us straight up, then Candace will go to work on that. But I
think that we're a little bit better in our post play and have been in our
tournament games.  
I'm excited about what's happening in women's basketball in terms of the
commitment on the part of universities throughout this country to really
support the game. And because of a lot of job openings, I think it's had quite
an impact on universities making decisions at the top to provide the resources
for their teams and also the contracts are in place and the financial
opportunities for these coaches are where they should be.  
I mean, let's face it, we're seeing in a lot of programs and I have a lot of
respect for what Tennessee did because they didn't have to step up and do what
they did, but I think they recognized the popularity of women's basketball on
our campus and the attendance and just the competitiveness across this country
now. It's created a different atmosphere because of I think the whole
landscape has changed because of the commitment on the part of administrators
to pay coaches at a different level, different pay scale now.  
And it's going to become more competitive. And you're going to see coaches
move. And it's going to be interesting to see what happens between probably
now and in the next three weeks, with some of the coaches that are considering
making changes.  
  
Q. I know it's been a long time since you had signed a junior college player
and I wanted to ask you about Shannon, and first just what made her such a
match for what you needed in your back court this year, and then second, just
what she does to change games in terms of imposing a tempo on a game.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well the thing about Shannon when I saw her play is that I just
loved her style of play. She pushed the basketball really hard and that's
something that is very appealing to myself and a lot of coaches in this game
that like up-tempo basketball. I liked her handles, I thought she was very
efficient. Shoots the three ball well. And really and watching her at the
junior college level I thought she was a great creator, but a lot of those
opportunities, because she was one of the best players on her team, she
created for herself.  
But I saw the potential for her to create for other people and that's where
she's really improved her game and the thing that has impressed me is just how
much she has been willing to learn. And her ability to do so and learn our
system and run our basketball team. She's like a freshman in our program, but
she plays like a veteran.  
I think the fact that she has been so appreciative to be at Tennessee and
she's had a great attitude. I've had a lot of great point guards, but I don't
know that I've had a better relationship with any point guard that I've
coached because of her willingness to listen and learn and try to do what you
ask her to do.  
Second part, her tempo and her speed, that's had a great influence. And it can
be a difference maker in the course of a game because she can be very
explosive and again be able to create shots for herself as well as for her
teammates and she will tell you every time she goes into a game, oh, Coach,
I'm really, really nervous. I've decided that's a good thing. Because every
time she's told me she's nervous she's played well. So I hope she's nervous
when we play on Sunday.  
  
Q. Understanding she's not your most immediate concern, but could you
compare Sylvia Fowles to other low post players you've seen in the game's
history? Is she almost a evolutionary talent?  
COACH SUMMITT: It's hard to say, I think there's only one Sylvia Fowles. But
she is just a very imposing player. It's like Lucia Harris, Delta State, was
the most imposing offensive player that I had seen in the paint.  
Sylvia has been one of the most imposing defensive players and now her
offensive efficiency is -- has really allowed her to be a player that's very
difficult to stop and also to go against. She makes players alter shots, she
is a great shot blocker. And obviously in the paint she can have her way with
most of the people that she goes against. And they get her great looks.  
If you look at most of her shots they come right in front of the rim. So she
can pick and choose I want to go left, right, I want to shoot over the top of
the rim.  
But I think a lot of that is their offensive system. And she's just a great
athlete and a hard worker. You got a lot of skill post people that are good,
but her greatness comes from how hard she's willing to work and her
competitive drive.  
  
Q. Could she be near the best ever you've seen or close in that category?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think she certainly has the potential to be one of the best
everyone the inside. When you talk about low post presence at both ends.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the LSU, what they have been able to overcome in the
past few weeks, just their focus in this situation?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think through adversity you learn a lot about your
basketball team. And there's no question that they have faced adversity. But
the way they have come through this and the focus that they have had I think
it's made them even stronger. And certainly I know they're even more
determined. I think that Bob Starkey's done a great job. But you have to
understand, Bob Starkey's been teaching the offensive system for years and
he's as good as anyone in the game. Men or women. Men or women's game. On
teaching motion offense.  
Watching them in the Regional finals, I just thought they were so in synch and
so together and so inspired, and it's clearly a team that has come together
and they're playing with a purpose.  
  
Q. I know you and Vivian have been close friends for many years. What do you
think of the job she did this year?  
COACH SUMMITT: It's a incredible story, I think, when you look at the
beginning and with Vivian, I'm sure what she was feeling was that, as she said
last night at the Salute dinner, she sent her assistant coaches out and told
them to go get some players. She needed players. She didn't think she could
win with these players. Obviously they must have heard her because they took
it to heart.  
And she was dealing with a lot of youth. But Vivian is so persistent on
bringing out the absolute best in her players. And I have a lot of respect for
her. She's one of the most patient and persistent coaches in the game. She
will try to be patient, but then when she runs out of patience, then I think
that's when she just says, We have to do it this way.  
It's amazing what she has done and the fact that she's done it in three
different programs and obviously enjoyed success at this level in all three.
It just speaks to her ability to adjust, adapt to whatever environment she's
in and bring out the absolute best in her student-athletes.  
  
Q. To piggyback on that, what would a national championship mean to Vivian
and would that sort of complete her career, do you think?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well let me just say that Vivian Stringer is a great coach. And
I think that sometimes people document coaches and their success by whether or
not they win a national championship. You can look in the women's game, in the
men's game, some of the greatest coaches of all times have never been
fortunate enough to win a national championship.  
Would that obviously be a exclamation point on her career? Yes. But she's a
great coach regardless of whether or not that happens. And I guess I'm
oftentimes amazed that that's the one standard that people look at as to
whether or not that coach is legit. Vivian is a legit leader and great coach
in this game. Regardless of whether or not she ever cuts down the nets.  
But that lady's probably going to cut down some nets.  
  
Q. What was it that made you take a chance on Shannon Bobbitt?  
COACH SUMMITT: We needed a point guard. When Gatewood transferred from our
program, I just felt like that Alexis could run the point, but also I felt
like Alexis could make a greater impact if she didn't have to run the point
all the time because she's a great rebounding guard, she's a great penetrator.
We could post her up and play her at multiple positions.  
And Shannon, I never worried about her size after I saw her play. And I just,
seeing her on tape is one thing, but actually seeing her play, I thought she
has the speed, the quickness, and the handles on it to really do what we want
to do in this program. And that's put pressure. Pressure by pushing tempo and
putting pressure on the other side of the ball.  
And, again, I just loved her personality. I've had so much enjoyment and I
just am watching her have a opportunity to do what she's done at Tennessee and
she is so appreciative of everything. I mean, you know, coming from the junior
college environment and coming into Tennessee and then obviously it's a whole
different environment as far as fan support and we're on charter planes, and
she's --  
One quick story, and some of you obviously I'm sure are aware of this, but the
managers came to me and said that some of our players were taking socks. Out
of the locker room. And that they were running out of socks. And so I called a
little meeting and I said, What's the deal with the socks? You know you have
to leave the socks for the managers to wash and leave them there. And Shannon
goes, Coach, Coach, my bad. She said, I just never had socks that nice. So she
was taking them home and wearing them to class. I said, You got to bring the
socks back here and you got to leave them here. And I said, But you can wear
them. You can wear them in practice. And she was like, Coach, I've never had
anything like this. A pair of socks. How about that?  
  
Q. You took a trip down memory lane with the question about Sylvia and I was
thinking how much do you remember about 1982 and your first trip to the Final
Four and does it seem like 25 years have gone by the board or not?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think not really. It's gone fast. Going into that first
championship -- and I don't really want to talk a whole lot about that
weekend. That wasn't the most pleasant for us. But I know how excited we were.
To be under the umbrella of the NCAA and know that women's basketball was
going to have a opportunity for greater exposure and have the opportunity to
really showcase our game, and certainly that was -- that was something that
generated so much excitement and enthusiasm for players and coaches and it
really changed our game.  
  
Q. What do you think needs to happen to take the game to the next level?  
COACH SUMMITT: I guess my biggest concern right now, and it's probably because
of we have just gone through the tournament and we are here now at the Final
Four, is I'm not sure we're ready for neutral sites. And I've been supporting
that all along. But I think that we have to put our best foot forward in our
game.  
To really showcase, not only the teams, but also to create atmosphere at all
of the sites. And I think we have to strategically figure out what the best
way is to arrive at that. And that right now is probably my biggest focus. I
think players are better, coaches are better, budgets are obviously in place,
and we're seeing our game grow significantly in that aspect.  
But now we have got to grow our fan base. We have fans that are fans of their
teams. And I think that the difference in the men's game is that obviously you
have men's basketball fans. And we need to increase our pool of support, if
you will, for people that just love the women's game. And they're going to
support it regardless of whether it's their team or it's a great women's
basketball team.  
  
Q. Two quick questions, a follow-up on that. One, why do you think it is
that women's basketball hasn't been able to get to the point where they are
fans of the sport and not just fans of the team, where most sports are like
that. And also, North Carolina, LaToya Pringle, can you tell me what she's
added to their inside game?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, first of all, I think in the women's game we don't have
the long history of the men's game in terms of exposure and just the overall
opportunities that television has provided throughout the years for people to
watch teams and get familiar with players and we're still playing catch-up in
that regard.  
We talked about '82 being the first time that the NCAA took over our game and
provided championships for women.  
So we're growing our game, our exposure is better, but it's still lagging and
if you compare it to the men's history.  
Pringle has done a great job, I mean, you look at their inside game and
players that could come in and impact, players that make Larkins better, I
mean, it's like Candace Parker has made Nicky Anosike better. And I think the
same is true with North Carolina in that regard.  
THE MODERATOR: Great. Thank you, Coach, for joining us.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 31, 2007

  

### [Sylvia Hatchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15656)

### [Erlana Larkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15661)

### [Ivory Latta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15658)

  
_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement from
Coach Hatchell.  
COACH HATCHELL: We're glad to be here, like all the other teams. We have been
on the road quite a bit the last few weeks, but we're glad we're still on the
road.  
We're excited about our opportunity to play a great Tennessee team and -- but
mainly just to be back in a Final Four. We were here in Cleveland last year
and it was fun and exciting and we have seen a lot of the same people and even
the doorman at the Marriott, he hugged my neck this morning and was glad to
see us.  
So it's -- we're glad to be here and have an opportunity to play in another
Final Four.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For Ivory, I'm sure you're frequently matched up with bigger guards that
maybe try to post you up or whatever, but Tennessee, you're going to be
playing against two small point guards. How does that impact the game for
you?  
IVORY LATTA: I'm definitely going to use that to my advantage somewhat.
Bobbitt, she's definitely a quick guard. So I'm going to have to control her
penetration. But my size, which is not that much, over Bobbitt, I'm going to
use that to my advantage.  
  
Q. Erlana, what do you think the things were that allowed you guys to beat
Tennessee the first time, the first two times actually, and what are you
hoping to carry over from those games?  
ERLANA LARKINS: I would have to say, number one, rebounding. We talked about
it this morning and it's very important that we win the rebounding match
because they're a great offensive rebounding team and Nicky Anosike and the
taller guards like to rebound. And I think that just -- I guess starting I
guess we jumped out of the cannon first, we usually tend to have a slow start
in most games. But we got off to a great start and maintained that. So that
and rebounding.  
  
Q. Ivory, I remember watching the Regional final and it looked like in the
last five to seven minutes of that game you found another gear. It was
obviously a hotly contested game and I'm sure folks were getting a little
tired, but those last five, seven minutes you just were going right by people.
What happened? Is that running drills since October or were you just on a
adrenaline high?  
IVORY LATTA: Adrenaline high. I just know that Purdue started making a run and
next thing I know in my head I just said I had to do what I had to do to get
my team back into the lead or whatever. So I just had to go up to another
gear. I don't know what was going on. But I definitely hope it's going to
carry on to the game on Sunday.  
  
Q. Did you come off the court after the game thinking, wow, what just
happened out there? Because it really did look like you found something there
that just carried you right up to a whole another level.  
IVORY LATTA: When I came off the court I was pretty much tired. I pretty much
wasn't thinking about anything. But I was just happy that my team got that
win.  
  
Q. Ivory, how has your leadership on and off the court grown over your four
years at North Carolina?  
IVORY LATTA: My leadership has definitely grown over the years. And that comes
from the confidence that my Coach has in me. She tells me every day that I'm
her best point guard, that I'm a great leader. So confidence in me definitely
gives me the confidence to go out there and lead my team. And off the court
I'm just trying to be like the coolest person, you know, I just try to crack
jokes, make sure everybody is loose and things like that. And I'm just trying
to do what it takes to help my team win the national championship.  
  
Q. For both girls, some of the Tennessee players were saying it's a little
freaky being back here, same locker room, same building, same opponent. You
guys had any d eja vu since you've been back?   
ERLANA LARKINS: No, not really. I didn't even notice. We know we played
Tennessee last year and in the Regional finals in the same gym but I would
have never thought same locker room and things like that. But that was last
year. And we can't really focus on that. It's about this year and doing what
we have to do to win.  
IVORY LATTA: No. Everything Miss Larkins said. That's all.  
  
Q. Ivory, you're in the Final Four a year ago as a junior, back now for your
last run at it. Can you share a little bit, is there a greater sense of
urgency, greater sense of expectation this year or can you still just go out
and play the game?  
IVORY LATTA: It's definitely a sense of urgency for me since this is my last
year. My main thing is I'm just trying to focus on what Coach Hatchell wants
me to do and I'm trying to go out there and do it to the best of my ability.
I'm just going to lay everything out there on the line, just any game now
could be just my last game and I'm just trying to go out there and just keep
my focus, keep my team up and make sure that everybody's loose and just go out
there and have fun. That's the main thing is to have fun.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you guys both for joining us. Take questions
for Coach.  
  
Q. You said after the loss to Duke that you were encouraged just because you
felt your team hadn't played its best yet this year and there weren't a lot of
teams in the country that could say that. What do you think has allowed your
team to play its best since that loss?  
COACH HATCHELL: I think that because we knew we had not played our best. And
that we had more to give and we could do better than we were doing, even
though we had only lost those two games, I guess, to Duke and we lost the one
to State. But we knew that we had not played as good as we could play and so I
don't think any of my players disagreed with that. And that we just had to
keep pushing buttons and that we could elevate to a higher level for
tournament time.  
That's what I challenged them to do for the ACC tournament. And I think it
started there.  
  
Q. Candace Parker does everything well. In your mind what does she do
best?  
COACH HATCHELL: Wow, I don't know if there's one thing that you would say. I
think a quality or characteristic about her. The number one thing would be
that she's so versatile. That she can score outside or score inside. And she's
just such a tremendous athlete. But just I think she's so versatile. She can
play about anywhere on the court you need her to and whatever assignments you
give her, she can do those well. So I think just probably her being so
versatile.  
  
Q. For about the last couple weeks on the network of record, TV network of
record for this event, they have been playing a promotional commercial that
prominently features you giving a -- it looks like a rather energetic
immediately pregame address to your players. Is that something that you always
do and have you heard much from people who maybe hadn't seen that side of you
before?  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, I've done that every game as long as I've been at North
Carolina, so.  
  
Q. I mean people from out in the rest of the country who don't follow you
UNC basketball that close.  
COACH HATCHELL: I had a lot of people when I'm walking down the street and
somebody will holler, Are you ready? A guy in the front of the hotel this
morning is hollering at me, Are you ready? And actually I walked into the
Kodak this morning and they had all the players in a holding room and they had
the four coaches and we had -- signing some balls and different things in
there, and when I walked in one of the players came up and she said, looked at
me and said, Coach, are you ready? And I said yeah. She said, I just had to
come talk to you. She said, I love that. That's my favorite part of all the
commercials. When we got back, Ivory came up and said, The girls were talking
about that, Coach. And I don't know, it's just something I've done for the 21
years I've been at North Carolina and it's the last thing out of the locker
room and just to make sure that we are ready. And, again, to show as players
my enthusiasm for the game and what we're getting ready to go out on the court
and do.  
But again, it's just something that I've always done. I mean, it's nothing I
did special or did it for the television, it was -- I didn't realize they were
in the locker room, tell you the truth, when it happened, but I try to be calm
on the side so the players will be. But I can get feisty if I need to.  
  
Q. Has that risen to the level -- I mean, is that just part of your coaching
pregame or has it become kind of a superstition, that you won a whole lot of
ballgames doing that before?  
COACH HATCHELL: No, it's not a superstition, but I've just always done it. The
biggest thing is we do it in the locker room right before we come out. We have
a huddle and it's very quiet and silent and we actually have a prayer. And
then I bust out with, Are you ready? And I do it three times. And we actually
we have had a lot of irate coaches and dignitaries and people like that that
we're trying to influence and everything like that. We have them in our locker
room lots of times. And when we do that, actually when I holler out, they
jump. It scares them and they jump. They don't know what to expect, and
they're like, What's going on, you know, what's gotten into her? Because it's
sort of like a different personality I guess.  
But it's just something I've always done. And the players enjoy it, I guess.
It's nothing that's special or anything like that.  
  
Q. Have you ever had a player perhaps with a well developed sense of humor
when you did that say, you know, like flat-lined and say, Coach, you know
we're ready.  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, we do it where I say, Are you ready? They say, Yeah.
They holler out, Yeah. And I say, Are you ready? And they say, Yeah. And we do
that three times. And then I, you know -- we come together and we huddle and
we say, whatever the school is that we're playing, Beat so and so, and then
the last thing is rebound. So that's just the way we always come out of the
locker room, so it's nothing to make a big deal out of, trust me.  
  
Q. Could you talk about what Bob Starkey has done over at LSU kind of under
a not so ideal situation, taking over the team and leading them here.  
COACH HATCHELL: Yes, I'll be very happy to say some things about that
situation because, first of all, I think he's done a unbelievable job.  
I did not -- I knew Bob, but I didn't really know him. I've known about him I
knew people that knew him. I knew he was a great X-and-O man. And behind the
scenes did a lot of the scouting and those type of things.  
Not only is he a good basketball person, but just the things he's done with
this team to keep them focused. And I've had a few conversations with him the
last couple days and I'm extremely impressed. Very, very nice person, I saw
him out in the hall a few minutes ago. I just can't believe he doesn't want to
be the head coach there. If I was one of the people doing the hiring, I would
do everything I could to try to get him to take that job, because he's just
done a tremendous job. And he's a very -- as I've talked to people, I've
learned that he is a well, well thought of person. And players really respect
him.  
And I just -- I mean, I'm just -- I'm not surprised or amazed, but I'm very
happy that he's done the job he has for the players, first of all, for the
players, but then also that they have got such a quality person that's in
charge of that team now. And I just can't say enough great things about how
he's handled the situation and what he's done with that team.  
  
Q. Going on to the rematch from this year, you beat them last year in the
Regional final and this year, how do you compare early in the year right now
where you were playing, where you think they were playing, to where you are
right now?  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, first of all, that was back December, what, 3rd, 4th?
Somewhere along there. It's been awhile. We have both played a lot of games
since then.  
I don't think you can look back at previous games really. Especially when it's
been so long since you played another team. But when we played in December I
know both teams played great defense. I thought. It was a little bit of a
sloppy game. But again, I think that -- but we made each other look that way
because both teams played excellent defense.  
And I think that offensively we have both played three or four games to start
the season. So our -- it was sloppy. Our timing was not good. A lot of things
were sort of out of synch. But I just remember that it was a great defensive
game and that it was for a early season game, we had a sellout crowd, it was a
national television, and I thought it was great for women's basketball.  
So I think both teams are better now. I think my players are younger players,
and have really come around and that I think our players know their roles on
their team. What we need them to do. I think that probably both teams know
their roles a little better than back in the early December time.  
  
Q. I don't know if you would ever be upset if Duke lost its coach, but do
you think Gail's going to stay in Durham?  
COACH HATCHELL: You got to ask Gail that. I saw her this morning I didn't get
a chance to talk to her. I saw her across the way at the Kodak. She wished us
good luck. You about you got to ask Gail that. I don't know.  
  
Q. Would you hate to see her go? I know you guys have become friends and
good rivals.  
COACH HATCHELL: She's done a tremendous job at Duke. There's no doubt about
that. And with Duke and NC State and Carolina, we're all right there together,
I mean we share the same newspapers and television stations and we see each
other at the mall and different things like that. So but -- and because we're
right there in each other's backyards every day, we make each other better.  
Because it's sort of like when you grow up and you got brothers and sisters
and you're always playing out in the yard and stuff, hey, if you want to
compete, you got to work at it and you got to stay on the same level as
everybody else. Or you get left behind. So again, we make each other better.
There's no doubt about that.  
I think you can look at Duke's success, our success, NC State's success and we
have all had a part in helping each other with the success because we got
three great teams in the triangle area. So but I think -- I don't think Gail
can go wrong with whatever she decides. She's done a tremendous job at Duke,
but I think it's just whatever she feels like is best for her at this point in
time in her professional and in her personal life.  
  
Q. Could you talk about how you're going to plan to guard Parker? Will
Pringle be a big part of that and what does she have to do to limit her going
off?  
COACH HATCHELL: Candace Parker, I mean, she gets my vote for Player of the
Year in the country. I think she's just -- she does so many things. I
mentioned how versatile she was. She does so many things so well. I think that
we have got to -- I don't really mean throw, but we will throw different
people at her as far as who defends her, different looks. Maybe different
sets. As far as what we're doing defensively. But I think you just got to
throw a lot of different things at her. And hopefully find something that
works. And maybe keep her from getting in a rhythm and a flow and off balance
a little bit.  
But because she's so, so dynamic and so good, especially when she gets down
inside on the block. And but we'll -- we have got lots of good defensive
players on our team, it could be Pringle, it could be Erlana, it could be
Camille, it could be Rashanda. It could be two of them at one time. You just
never know. But I think you got to throw a lot of different things at her. But
also the Tennessee team is not just Candace Parker. They have got a lot of
great players on that team. And so I think you've got to have a great game
plan defensively for the whole team.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH HATCHELL: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 31, 2007

  

### [Sylvia Fowles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15650)

### [Bob Starkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17183)

### [Erica White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16371)

  
_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with a opening statement from Coach Starkey and
then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH STARKEY: Obviously we're very pleased to be here. This is our fourth
time in four years. And I don't think the excitement changes at all.  
I think it's one of the few things certainly in my lifetime that you've been
involved with that lives up to the hype. And the NCAA does a wonderful job of
organizing everything. Everything is right where it's supposed to be when it's
supposed to be. And then what's neat is each city is different.  
The people in Cleveland have really been nice and opened their arms out to us
and we have certainly enjoyed our experience to this point.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Erica, you were teammates with Essence Carson this summer, right? What
was it like and what sort of challenge will she be tomorrow night?  
ERICA WHITE: Essence was a great teammate. She's a big shot player and she did
the same thing for us at USA basketball. One of the best things she did for
our team was defense. She played well. She will be a challenge because she's a
big shot taker and if they need a basket they're going to go to her. But I'm
sure our defense will defend her.  
  
Q. Erica and Sylvia, this is both for y'all. Talk about the way y'all play
defense and it's just really come on strong, especially in the tournament. You
look relentless out there. What kind of mindframe do you get into and what
kind of pride does this team take in their defensive performance?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It's like our second nature. We take pride in our defense and
anything it takes just to get out there and get under somebody's skin, we're
willing to do it.  
ERICA WHITE: I think that we just pride ourselves on our defense because it's
been there for us and it's been solid for us all year. It's been the one thing
that we can hang our hat on if the shots aren't falling or not playing well
offensively, I believe that you can always give your best on the defensive end
of the floor. We just are relentless and it looks like it's six people out
there sometimes, but I think the biggest thing we do, we, Coach does a great
job of scouting our opponents and we take them out of their initial sets and
then do a good job of guarding the basketball when the shot clock runs down.  
  
Q. Sylvia, there's been a lot of talk about how much you have really had a
strong tournament and how well you've played. Do you feel within yourself that
your game is, quote/unquote, elevated or do you think this is the way you've
been playing and how do you feel about your efforts over the four games so
far?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Every year my game improves. And I have to give credit to my
coaches and my teammates for helping me get to that point. But I feel that my
game has improved during the tournament time. And I feel that it's only going
to get better.  
  
Q. In any particular way? Seems like you're scoring a lot, rebounding a lot,
blocking a lot of shots?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Just being consistent with everything that I do. If that's what
it means, crashing the boards or taking more shots or getting my teammates
into the offensive set.  
  
Q. This is your third Final Four. Can you kind of speak to being here again,
Sylvia, but you don't have Temeka Johnson and Seimone Augustus and kind of the
challenges that it poses this time going into the Final Four.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Well, you just named two great players. But our coaches do a
great job at recruiting and they know who to pick, the right people to pick to
fit in the system. But just going into the tournament without them I think
it's kind of different, but it's also a plus for us because we also just are
one team. It's not a one-man team. Everybody can get out there on the floor
and perform what we're asked to do. So I say that's kind of different this
year.  
  
Q. Sylvia, being back here your fourth straight time, I guess -- well, not
you, but as a program, does it give y'all any of an advantage that you've been
here before, you've been here, done that, you know what to expect? What kind
of advantage does that give you over a Rutgers or over any team that's here
right now?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Truthfully, I don't think it gives you no kind of advantage. We
always made it here, but we never made it to the big stage where we wanted to
be.  
Just having the experience under your belt doesn't mean anything because any
opponent could come out any given night and be on. So I don't think it gives
us an uplift at all. We just got to be focused and be ready to play.  
  
Q. For Erica and Sylvia, what do you guys have to do differently to get to
that bigger stage that you haven't made the last three times?  
ERICA WHITE: I think the biggest thing that's going to help us this year is
we're playing well right now. I remember last year's tournament run the best,
and I said this before, you just look at those games and getting here we
struggled every game, we came out and it took a second-half effort to win the
game. It finally caught up with us in the Final Four.  
But this year every game in the tournament we're playing better. We're getting
better. And we believe that. Our confidence is high. And we know we're playing
good basketball. So I think this is the biggest thing that's going to help us
right now.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I say there's no room for error. You just got to come out good
on a good note from the get-go. So I think that's what we need to do.  
  
Q. Erica, has Coach changed at all since becoming the head coach from being
the assistant to the head coach?  
ERICA WHITE: I wouldn't say he's changed. He's doing some different things.
Standing out in front of the program and speaking to the media more, but as
far as the basketball goes, he's pretty much the same guy. He's just -- I
think he's been sensitive to the situation and he's done a great job and given
the team the things that we need. A lot of positive feedback and taking good
care of us. So he's doing a great job.  
  
Q. Erica, they're known for their ball pressure and the things they try to
do against the other team's point guard. What can you do? What can your team
help you to do to prepare for the kind of defense they're going to try to play
on your position particularly, and what help can RaShonta give?  
ERICA WHITE: I think that RaShonta can give a lot of help being that she's
played point guard. So she has the same mentality that I have. And can handle
the ball. Our offense is sound. Our principles are in place to handle the
pressure. Personally, I don't shy away from it. I know that I can handle it.
So it shouldn't bother me too much, and like I say, our program is sound and
we can handle the pressure.  
  
Q. Sylvia, are you seeing more double teams and how are you handling them?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Yes, I'm seeing more double teams, but it's nothing new. To me,
I just have the mindset that you are going to shut me down or you're going to
give up a three or give up a shot on the perimeter. So either way it goes it's
a 50/50 chance for me.  
  
Q. Sylvia, do you think that Kia Vaughn could be a challenge and if so, what
does she do that might make her a challenge?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Most definitely I think Kia Vaughn will be a challenge. She put
the ball on the floor very well and she can also get out and run. She can step
away from the paint and she can rebound. It's going to be very competitive
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Do you look forward to that more when you know you're facing another
center who is not easy to back down?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Yeah, I like a challenge. I think my best game is when I play
against challenging people.  
  
Q. I haven't seen you dunk very often in games, but I guess you did it today
and it got a rise out of the crowd. Is that just something that you did for
show today or was it something to fire you up or just something you always do
in practice? Talk about that?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It's something I always do in practice, it just so happened we
had fans in there to be able to watch and see it. So that's something I do
every day in practice.  
  
Q. Any reason? Can you talk about why we haven't seen it much in games? Is
it just the circumstance or talk about that.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: To tell you the truth, I really don't worry about it as much as
some people think I should. But I just worry about doing what I have to do to
help my teammates out. And if a opportunity for me to dunk comes, if I get
one, I'm pretty sure I'll knock it down, but that's not my main focus right
now.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we'll take questions now for Coach.  
  
Q. You guys played I think the lowest scoring Final Four game ever against
Tennessee. This game certainly looks like it could have the makings of a game
similar to that. Just talk about the importance of winning the, as you said
before, the hollow possessions. But you know they're going to come for both
teams and how much you have to value each possession because the points could
be at such a premium?  
COACH STARKEY: I think the hollow possessions come about more from us not
executing. But when you play against a team like Rutgers, you may not even get
deep into that possession if you don't take care of the basketball.  
I think that's certainly a concern for us. That's something that we have
talked about with our team when we're watching tape and when we're practicing
is the ability to handle their pressure. Sometimes they don't let you get very
deep into your possession. That's their whole goal is to disrupt your team and
to make them run their offense faster than what they normally do.  
So we need to value the basketball and I think if we value the basketball and
take care of it, I think we'll be able to get some good shots just based on
that is what comes when teams pressure you like that. It's a little bit of a
gamble and obviously they're extremely good at it.  
  
Q. With your team's defensive ability, and Rutgers, very similar on the
defensive sides, what kind of similarities do you draw defensively? And I
guess the way your team has played through the tournament defensively it's
something special.  
COACH STARKEY: I think the biggest thing that I see is both teams enjoy
playing defense. And that can be sometimes rare. If you watch their kids play,
they get excited about it. And I feel like our kids do too. I think both teams
have the athleticism to do a variety of things. Theirs is a little bit more
full court where our ours is a little bit more half court.  
I think they're both very good at taking dribble penetration away. I think
they're both very good at getting passing lanes and I think both teams need to
play a good defensive game in order for their teams to reach their potential
when they're playing other good opponents.  
  
Q. Could you first just maybe describe what this tournament has been like
for you and then also just talk about have you had to work on focusing with
the team to get through this tournament?  
COACH STARKEY: The tournament has been exciting and it's been hectic. But it's
always been like that. You travel, you play, you come home. You travel, you
play, you come home. And that's been a good thing for me and it's been a good
thing for the team.  
We haven't did anything more differently in terms of focusing our kids and I
think that's a compliment to our kids. We were playing good basketball before
the things that unfolded after the SEC tournament, so it wasn't like we had to
re-invent the wheel or do anything new, it's just to make sure that the kids
still understood what their goals were, and fortunately and obviously that
they did.  
So I think a lot has been made of me being in this position, but these kids
have been phenomenal. They have been focused from day one and you can see it
in practices, you can see it when we watch film and certainly you can see it
in the way that we're playing right now.  
  
Q. You've been quoted as saying that you're not interested in the job
permanently under any circumstances. And even more so after the taking over
and going through the first few rounds of the tournament. Can you explain what
it is about the job so far that you've experienced that would make you more
convinced than you were even before you started doing it? And also why do you
see yourself or is there ever a point in your career where you're convinced or
at what point during your career were you convinced that you were always going
to be an assistant coach and didn't aspire to be more?  
COACH STARKEY: The things that I enjoy doing the most and, equally as
important, the things that I think I do fairly well are things such as
teaching, running practice, and watching film.  
And while I've been able to do that, through this process, it's meant me
staying up a lot later, getting up a lot earlier, being away from my wife a
lot more and being a lot more tired because of all the other things that are
going on with my job.  
And I'm still -- we haven't did anything with he recruiting. I haven't had to
go out and fundraise, I haven't done any public speaking, so there's a lot of
things that a head coach has to do. And, number one, I don't feel it is my
forte, I don't feel like that's what I do best. And, number two, I think it
takes away from the things that I do do well.  
And I just think it's important that you understand your limitations, your
strengths and your weaknesses. I'm not sure there was ever a time where I made
up my mind that I just wanted to be a assistant coach, but I just think
certainly at this point I'm 47 years old and I've always been a assistant
coach and really never given it much thought or had necessarily very many
schools come after me and offer me those type positions. So it's really never
been something that I thought about until now.  
  
Q. 47's pretty young.  
COACH STARKEY: I don't know. In coaching it's kind of like dog years.  
(Laughter.) I think I aged about two years in the last three weeks.  
  
Q. Erica mentioned that you had been sensitive to the situation, sensitive
to how you came into this position, what have you done, is it something you've
done consciously or is it just kind of -- I mean, what have you done to be
more sensitive to how -- to the team?  
COACH STARKEY: It's been said that I'm very patient. And that's probably --
that's not true. I'm very impatient in terms of coaching and teaching. And if
anybody that's watched us practice knows that I can get after individuals or
get after a team pretty good.  
I think that probably in light of what happened it's going to get more
attention than what it needs, but I think in the post-season I think that you
need to be more positive. And I think I've been able to do that. And I think
maybe they have just noticed it a little bit more because I'm the single voice
at practice right now.  
I think once you get in the post-season, you have either -- there's an old
saying the cake's in the oven. Everything's been mixed and that's it. We have
either taught our team how to play or we haven't. So when you get in the post-
season it's -- I don't think it's a time necessarily for you to be impatient
and I think that I've probably -- I've certainly been more patient with them
but a lot of credit goes to them too. They really haven't given me much
opportunity to get on them too much. So, again, they deserve a lot of credit.  
  
Q. Being here fourth straight time in the program's history, does that give
you an edge, an advantage that you have been through this process, you know
what to expect? Or does it put any pressure to say that we need to come home
with a championship or make a run?  
COACH STARKEY: I think that in some ways there's a small advantage in terms of
all the things that are peripheral that go on before you play. For instance,
the autograph sessions, the open practice, yesterday we had to do some things
for ESPN. And our kids are all aware of that. And they're all aware of how
that stuff flows into the game.  
But I thought Sylvia's point was, you know, once the ball's thrown up, I don't
think it matters. If experience would have been that important, we wouldn't be
0-3 in first round games. It still comes down to playing. And we have a
different team this year. And I think that's important. That's good and bad
and all the teams can say that. But it's -- I think each one is different, and
I think it will come down to who plays well.  
  
Q. One of the things that's been well documented is that there's not many
people who have ever been in your position, taken over this late in the season
or in the post-season. There's so little to use as a guide for yourself, or
has that been difficult or do you just kind of try to rely on the things that
you have, that you've done in the past and not try to -- you said you haven't
tried to change much, but has it been difficult with nothing to fall back
on?  
COACH STARKEY: No, not really. I think that again, I'll go back to the fact
that post-season play is so hectic. So I haven't had much time to think and
that's probably been good for us and me.  
We wanted to make sure that we had as normal a setup for our team as possible.
Practices have been the same, our preparation in terms of breakdown and
scouting have been the same. Travel has been the same. Part of that was we
have had a really good year this year so there wasn't a reason to change for
anything that we weren't doing well. So we have kept things as normal as
possible.  
  
Q. You've kind of been very humble about how this has all happened to you in
the last month. I just wanted to ask you just about the challenge of falling
into a Final Four as a head coach now with three coaches that have the
experience that the other three coaches in this Final Four have.  
COACH STARKEY: Those are three great coaches. I was joking with my staff this
morning, that when you're in junior high and you have one of these aptitude
tests and there's the four pitch pictures -- there's the apple, orange, the
banana and the rock -- and you kind of have to check off the one that really
doesn't fit, I would be the rock.  
Those are just absolutely three great coaches. But I really can't think about
that. Because I'm not going to be playing against Coach Stringer. My kids are
going to play against her kids. And that's where the focus is is making sure
that they're comfortable and that they're prepared and that they're ready to
play. It was the same thing with Connecticut. I think a lot was made between
Geno and I. He's a great Coach and just because my team was more successful
that particular day doesn't change that. So I think the focus has to stay with
the kids and how they play.  
  
Q. Three straight years LSU has not got past this game. It's different, your
team is different, of course you play a different team each time, but is there
any common denominator that you learned from experience that you can a play
that as you look back on it that can help you get over the hump this time?  
COACH STARKEY: Each time we came here, the first year that we went, I don't
think anybody expected us to go. And we played Tennessee down in New Orleans
and we played really well. We just happened to fall a couple of points short.
Tennessee made a play and scored at the bucket and that was the ballgame. But
we played great.  
Then the next time we lost to Baylor and we played really well the first half
and had a great opportunity to win that basketball game and had a bad spell of
play where we allowed Baylor to get in the game and get the momentum and beat
us.  
Then last year was a third game that was completely different where we just
didn't play well at all. And I think Erica touched on that. We didn't play
well at all in the post-season. The three games leading up to the Final Four,
all three of those games we were behind at half-time and we were a No. 1 seed
last year so we just weren't playing well.  
And we feel like we're playing better right now. And I think that helps. Does
it get us over the hump? I don't know. Rutgers is an excellent basketball
team. When you get to this far in the season and you play the people that you
play, you can play well and still go home. And that's our goal right now is
just to play well and see what happens.  
  
Q. In 1989 Steve Fisher took over the Michigan basketball team and went on
and won the national championship. Now you said you're not interested in being
the coach, what are you going to do next year?  
COACH STARKEY: I haven't given that any thought at all. Right now. Things have
been such a way in terms of our schedule and our team that the only thing I
had to concentrate on is is just making sure these kids are having a good time
and that we're getting prepared to play basketball. And when that's done then
I'll probably sit down and look at my options.  
  
Q. To follow-up on a earlier question, have you seen any difference in
Sylvia's game or approach from the regular season to the tournament?  
COACH STARKEY: She's really played well on the big stage but she's done that
all year. She just went through the SEC season where she had a double-double
every game. And within the SEC season we had a couple open dates and we
plugged them in with Connecticut and South Florida. She had double-doubles
with them.  
She's had a great year. We weren't on television as much this year, so I don't
want to say she's a secret, but it's just not like she woke up against
Connecticut and decided to dominate a game for the first time. She is a
remarkable kid. For somebody that's as special as she is to be as humble as
she is, I thought it was interesting here listening to her talk, and you
mentioned Temeka Johnson and Seimone Augustus and she talked, she said, wow,
there's two great players. This year we're a team. She doesn't even realize
that she's one of those three now. That's kind of her mindset. And I think
that makes her special. And I think it's really healthy for our team.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Sylvia's hook shot and how much you have worked on her
with that. It looks quite different from most women's hook shots. It looks
like more of -- a not trying to be sexist, but more of a male's hook shot.
That is full extension and wrist related instead of slinging it. Can you talk
about what you have done with that?  
COACH STARKEY: Well, it's something we started working on. She got here as a
freshman and we put a lot of emphasis on it before her sophomore year. And
basically if you ever come to our practice we the first 30 minutes is a pre-
practice period where the post players are on one end and perimeter players on
the other and we spend a lot of time on fundamentals. And it will carry all
the way through the season. We might only practice for 30, 45 minutes late in
the season but we'll still have that 30 minute pre-practice period to work on
individual things. And that's certainly one of the things that we have worked
on. It's a jump hook. We think that's the best shot for her because at 6-6 she
can extend, it's a very difficult shot to block, probably the biggest thing
this year is we started to work on her left hand and she's got a nice left-
handed jump hook now. Two summers ago she paid her own way and went up to Don
Meyer's post camp and I know he spent some time working with her on her jump
hook as well. So it's something that I think she feels comfortable with. She
certainly knows how to use it very well and it's been really successful for
her.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us, Coach.

_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with a opening statement from Coach Stringer.  
COACH STRINGER: First of all, I'm excited to be here. When we started our
journey at the beginning the of the year, certainly when we started our games,
no one would have thought, including myself, because it was a difficult thing
to see the light at the end of the tunnel. But I think the players here and
the team you will see is a testimony to what it means to persevere and
continue to believe when all others doubt you.  
And when you work together, as a team, realizing that one person by themselves
cannot do it, but that we address the team things first, which is defense,
passing, helping to see each other, helping each other and to remember that
we're all trying to do the same thing for the same purpose. And that when all
10 members persevere throughout, that dreams can come true.  
So it doesn't matter where you come from, but it is where you're going and
what price you're willing to pay. This team paid the ultimate price. And while
I've coached many teams and I've had the good fortunate to come to some Final
Fours, there has been no team that I've ever coached that has accomplished so
much in such a short period of time that has been so young and yet, as they
learned each and every day, continue to get stronger. And I don't know that I
recognize how strong -- I tend to say maybe halfway through the season, closer
to January. But as a rule, teams that I coach generally peak like in February.
But this team began -- we were so far back that we just made a gradual
improvement and what we finally got to -- the point we finally got to is the
fact that we were not making the same mistakes, we finally embraced defense.
And we understand and learned how to win games. We played some of the toughest
teams in the country, if not the toughest teams in the country in the toughest
arenas, and I couldn't be happier of five freshmen, three players who had
played before, two young ladies while they're sophomores and juniors, really
probably logged about an hour and a half all total. So in effect you have
before you about seven freshmen.  
But you have fearless players that are happy to be here, but truly have earned
it. Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Again, we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned -- and this is for Matee. Coach mentioned there was a
point at which you guys picked up on defense. Can you identify what that point
was in the schedule?  
MATEE AJAVON: I don't think it was a particular point, but I think it was
brought to us every day in practice. Coach, she stresses defense a lot. And
you guys might have heard about it in the paper, but we were feeling it every
day in practice. So it started from the beginning. We gradually worked our way
into becoming a defensive team.  
  
Q. Essence, we heard from you know one of the ESPN commentators today about
how hard Coach Stringer worked you guys to get in shape. That she had, shall
we say, exactingly high standards. With full benefit of hindsight, how
difficult was it? And were you surprised pleasantly or unpleasant by what she
wanted in terms of your physical conditioning?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Well, I'm a junior, so I'm a veteran. So I wasn't surprised by
what she was asking for. She asked the same thing of each and every team she
has coached to her career.  
I'm -- I may say that maybe the freshmen were surprised, but we try to prepare
them as much as possible. But they were still young so they still didn't
understand the entirety of it.  
I believe once they got here, it really did hit them and as veterans, we knew
that what she was, what she wanted from us was going to make us better. I
believe that physical conditioning that she put us through in the beginning of
the season really helped us, not only physically but mentally, to withstand
anything, especially when you're tired, that's when you make poor decisions.  
So in the long run it really helped us out with decision-making as well as our
physical conditioning.  
  
Q. Rutgers hasn't won a team national championship in about six decades as a
school. What would it mean to for you to win the first one for in that long,
for Rutgers?  
ESSENCE CARSON: It would mean a lot for us to win a national championship. Not
only because Rutgers hasn't won it in, like you said, about six decades, but
just because it is a national championship. Each and every year that's each
and every team's goal. That's what every one wants to achieve at the end of
the season.  
So not only would it be special for school history, it would be special for
ourselves and special for Coach Stringer, it would be her first.  
KIA VAUGHN: Basically exactly what Essence said. It would be the same thing.
I'll be excited and not only for the school but for ourselves, for our
teammates and coaches.  
  
Q. Kia, you had a lot of success against Alyssa Hahn, Allison Bales and
Audrey Johnson. Tell us what's different about Sylvia Fowles and what's the
biggest part of the challenge that she is.  
KIA VAUGHN: You named all post players. Basically I go out and play each and
every post the same. I make them work for what they want to get done.  
Sylvia Fowles is a great player. And with that you just work with great
players and you can't really stop her, you just try to control her and
maintain her.  
  
Q. Kia, you've redefined your body since coming to Rutgers. You got in
shape. How hard was it and how has it affected your game in going up against
these girls, these post players?  
KIA VAUGHN: Hard. It wasn't hard at all. Basically because it's just the
process that I went through. Running and practicing with Coach Stringer each
and every day. The weight just dropped dramatically. And it seemed like as I
ran it just fell off. And I was running. But I was happy with all the weight
that I lost. It defined my body, it made me move faster, feel more better
about myself and confident.  
  
Q. Can you tell on the court? Is it different? Do you feel different on the
court?  
KIA VAUGHN: Yeah, I feel much faster. Healthy, yeah, I'm always healthy, I eat
everything, but it's just that the running is just what maintains the weight.  
  
Q. Had you not done that in high school, the running?  
KIA VAUGHN: College and high school are two different things. Can't really
compare.  
  
Q. You guys really don't have one super star on the team. Do you consider
that to be a strength for you guys?  
MATEE AJAVON: Actually, yes, I think that's what makes us dangerous. Any time
you have five people on the floor that could possibly score, rebound, assist,
it makes the team dangerous. So I think it's a plus for us.  
KIA VAUGHN: I think it's a plus for us too.  
  
Q. What do you think when you think about young girls who look at you as
role models? How do you want girls to look at you?  
KIA VAUGHN: I would say that if you put your mind and your heart to it you can
do anything. Nothing is impossible. Everything is possible. You just have to
work well with others and basically have the will to keep on going. Even
though you fail sometimes. And when you fall down, just have the strength to
get up and wash it off and keep going.  
  
Q. I read something about the coach stopped wearing the school colors early
on in the year when you guys were struggling. What was that about and how did
that make you feel?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Well, in the beginning of the year after we were struggling,
Coach not only didn't stop wearing the school colors, she threw us out of the
locker room and took our practice gear and everything else that said Rutgers
on it. That was just her saying that we weren't living up to the Scarlet
Knights' tradition. We weren't the warriors that she was used to coaching. And
she said she wouldn't give us our stuff back and she wouldn't wear school
colors until we proved that we played as a team and let go of all
individuality and come together. And not only buy into the defensive concept
she was trying to push on to every one, and after awhile we started playing
together. Started playing the defense that you're used to seeing by Scarlet
Knights. And she started wearing red and black again and we have our sweat
suits back.  
KIA VAUGHN: And our locker room, which I'm happy for.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Can any of you talk about the legacy that Cappy Poindexter left because
you all played with her last year and years before?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Cappy, she left a great legacy. She was a great leader. We
learned greatly from her. We learned how to manage a team, how to keep
everyone together when it feels like everything is falling apart. She was part
of the 9-20 season that Rutgers had. So she knew what it felt like to be down
and out and have no support from anyone.  
But all in all she still kept a belief in herself and in her teammates and the
coaching staff. And that's one thing that really helped us out this year.
Especially starting off struggling. And we just kept believing in ourselves,
even if no one else out there might have thought that we would make it this
far. As long as we kept the belief in ourself, we just kept pushing and
pushing ourselves and we have arrived here at the Final Four.  
  
Q. Essence, have you noticed a -- has there been a noticeable change on
campus with the success of the football team and then what you guys have been
able to do? Is there more Rutgers pride?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Yes. Definitely is. Especially with the football program doing
so well. I believe the school was used to a woman's basketball program doing
well over the years, but we were never blessed with a great football team. Not
only this year but last year they did pretty well.  
So there's a lot of pride going around, especially in sports areas. There's a
lot of fans, student fans coming out. You always have the alumni coming, but
just to see the student support is great because those are your peers and you
get to see them every day.  
THE MODERATOR: Great. Thank you all. The student-athletes may return to the
locker room and we'll start with questions for Coach Stringer.  
  
Q. On the same theme, I have friends that went to Rutgers that actually
admit they went to Rutgers now. Can you just talk about what the boost has
been like because of the football team and then obviously what you guys have
done.  
COACH STRINGER: Our football team has just instilled a level of pride unlike
anything I've ever seen within the state.  
When I left Cheney University I went to the University of Iowa where
everything, the telephones and everything else, were gold and black. And that
was just their pride. And it was like a cultlike spirit here, an obsession.
That's what I thought initially going in there.  
But I come to understand that my children, all they wanted was a Hawkeye
jacket. That's all they wanted. And I wondered, you know, as I left there, to
come here to Rutgers, why there wasn't that level of pride. There's no
question that the kind of respect that Rutgers gets across the country as an
Ivy League school and as a great academic institution is without question
there.  
But no one knows and unfortunately I guess in this educational -- in these
educational situations or institutions everybody knows about Michigan, but do
know what they're most famous for, academically, physics or astronomy or
whatever, everybody knows they've got a great football program and blah, blah,
blah. The same thing with Rutgers. What Greg Schaino has done is nothing short
of a miracle, to see the Empire State Building -- can you imagine that? What
do you think that causes that, the buildings in New York to be red or to walk
downtown and -- with Madison Square Garden where people come from all over the
world, millions of people each and every day and you see Rutgers Scarlet
Knights. They did a sidewalk interview, with people from New York. They didn't
even know Rutgers was there. And we're less than 30 minutes from New York
City. How is that? Before. Now I understand that they even had
"Congratulations Scarlet Knights Women's Basketball Team. Go Rutgers."  
And so people are identifying, and it's almost as though the two states, New
York and New Jersey, are combined as one. And it doesn't hurt when you have
people from the Sopranos out there supporting you as well.  
We have got a lot of famous people that have gone to Rutgers, but now people
will hear about it and will know about it and we are benefiting from that.
Nothing can be greater than the football program and I don't think it's going
to be long before you hear about our great men's basketball program as well.
Your friend will be talking to you a lot.  
  
Q. Having been around the game as long as you have, could you compare Sylvia
Fowles to other great, big women in the game that you've seen.  
COACH STRINGER: I probably saw one of the greatest Lucia Harris. That was at
Delta State. And they started the Wade trophy and all that behind her. I don't
know if there's anybody that can compare to her. She is phenomenal. And all
credit to Coach Starkey and certainly to Pokey, because they have done a
phenomenal job. You always want to look at players -- a lot of people can
inherit great talent and you move them and put them into a position, and but
let's be real about that. And no coach is great when you just have -- you got
to have players. Anyway you shake it.  
But there are also tremendous potential in the ability to mold that and bring
out that talent and create the kind of great player that Sylvia Fowles is. I
think that every coach that has touched her, i.e., Starkey and Pokey and Carla
Berry and whoever the other coaches are, should be really proud, because,
yeah, she did work hard, it's a testimony to her, but with all this great
talent -- but now she's got a shot that she looks extremely confident with.
Hook shots left and right. No one that is quicker. Bigger. She's like a guard.
And you've seen her grow. She was just raw before. But to see the kind of
talent that is there now is just really special. I have not seen a player grow
so quickly as I have with her.  
  
Q. Without giving away any secrets, do you have to double her, what's the
general plan?  
COACH STRINGER: We have to try to figure out how she -- she can't come out of
the locker room.  
(Laughter.) To tell you the truth. They should watch her food and make sure
she doesn't get sick.  
(Laughter.)  
I don't know what we're going to do yet. But as you know, it's going to take a
lot more than -- there's a lot more than just one person, that's why you see
teams change. She's one of the few players that she will change your scheme.
She will make you change. You can't be business as usual with her. Because
she's not a usual player. She is very -- if you even look at the offensive
rebounds you realize she's got something like 130 some offensive rebounds, the
next closest person has 40. You know what I mean?  
It's just this is a one-woman wrecking crew. I think she could play on the
vast majority of Division I men's basketball teams. She's very good. And I
just want to give her nothing but compliments. She's worked hard and the staff
has worked hard.  
  
Q. Do you see NCAA title as something that would complete your resume as a
coach?  
COACH STRINGER: Yeah, how could I not? It's something that we all pursue. I
would not start the season if I didn't think -- but as I'm saying this year,
you know, it was very obvious to me that when we couldn't pass the test and
how we broke down this team, it seems to be extrinsically motivated. It seems
that most of the time we're able to get players that are driven from within.
Essence, who has so much pride within herself, she would dare not come up
short in her work ethic. This group very clearly is stimulated when they know
that there are consequences. And having said that, I didn't think that we
would be here now. I would be lying if I told you that.  
But who wouldn't -- I just want to know what it feels like. And I worked hard,
and everybody else does. But I should tell you that for the coaches who have
had a opportunity to experience it, even if it's been once and you never heard
from them again, and we have some of those, you know, and they just sort of
fade into the sunset, I think that the measure of a coach's success has to be
the people that they have worked with, what they have been able to accomplish,
and basically where you come from and what you did with what you had.  
So within that, I can feel really good, really good. Because each year I'll
say you need about eight players, you need eight players, you need eight
players. You know. And you consider what the talents need to be and all things
need to be right. But along with that, you have to be very fortunate that
someone doesn't get sick, or you don't have something, there are always -- you
have to be lucky on the other side of it too. And I would just like to be
lucky and good and all those other good things.  
I'll always pursue excellence. And excellence is a national championship. So
I'll pursue it. The first coach we played for the national championship with
Louisiana Tech, and I just remember I had to take -- it seems like we were
matched up with everything until we started making substitutions. I was
substituting a 5-11 and Louisiana Tech was substituting a 6-3. You heard of
Dennis Rodman? He had a sister and you know how great a rebounder Dennis
Rodman was, right? Well, he had a sister named Debra Rodman, who was as good
as he was and mad as heck because she was coming off the bench at -- with
Louisiana Tech and she came in and rebounded everything. So, you know, I would
love to do that. But I'll just do the best I can and the team will as well.  
  
Q. Would you talk about how Epiphanny Prince's legal troubles may have
affected your recruiting of her and talk about the struggle or if it was a
struggle for her to overcome that as a freshman and how she's played.  
COACH STRINGER: No, it wasn't a struggle at all for me. Because I think that
everybody got a half a piece of information. Because I got the whole thing.
Only thing I was concerned about Epiphanny Prince was two things: One is
whether or not she could handle the way that we practiced and I had her
specifically come to a practice where Matee and Cappy virtually knocked each
other done down. They were going at it really hard. I wanted her to see that
it was not soft and I questioned whether or not she was tough enough.  
Two, she's darn near genius in math. And so I didn't think that it would be a
problem. She had many talents but she tests off the charts. She probably is --
probably, you know, the Waltons you hear about on a mountain top? I don't know
how you come from New York City and you come with that kind of innocence. But
that is who she is.  
Very shy. Pitifully shy. And just a wonderful, wonderful young lady. A great
human being. I really know what happened and she was more of a observer and it
was a teacher who stepped in to explain that Epiphanny Prince whose name was
big as New York City itself across the country, was a young lady whose name
was drawn into this. This incident with this other little kid and this other
kid that got into the fight. So I was clear. I was very comfortable knowing
how she was and who she was. I was very comfortable.  
I should tell you that 119 points was not the issue. Now, it might seem like
it to most people. But honestly, I told Epiphanny the night before that she
should not sign with Rutgers, should not sign with Rutgers, and the reason
that I said that is because she had come to the practice and I -- she just --
I just didn't know that she was going to be tough enough. How is that?  
And so she didn't sign the papers yet, so I said what happened and she said,
well, I don't think you really want me there and I said, no, that's not it,
that's not it. I just don't want -- I want tough people. I just want hard-
nosed basketball players. We are blue-collar workers. We're not silk-suit
people. And she said no, I always wanted to come. She thinks the world of Kia.
It's not that far. And aside from that, her mother probably keeps her in
church about six or seven hours a day on Sunday. And so her mom wanted to be
sure that she was close enough. So, you know, it worked out well. And it
hasn't been a problem. At all.  
What I will say is that Epiphanny along with another freshman probably are two
of the brightest basketball minds on the floor. There's nothing -- anything
that she does, all things that she does, how is this, all things that she
does, she will walk past you and say, well, the reason why I did this is, was
that okay. She was a young lady when we took everything away she said, Coach,
can I please run to the locker room for a second so I can shower because the
other showers are really cold and I already changed my clothes and I got to go
a class. And I said okay.  
She's a great basketball player a innocent person, great student, and we're
fortunate to have her. And I'm really happy because I didn't believe what I
saw. I came to understand another young lady.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about Sylvia Fowles a little bit, and USC played her
tough and was going to let the other players beat them. And they did. The
supporting role players, like Allison Hightower, Ashley Thomas, how do you try
to balance stopping Sylvia and stopping their shots from the perimeter?  
COACH STRINGER: You might look at the percentages, how often does Hightower or
Chaney or these other people shoot, where they shooting from, who the person
that is feeding the ball to Fowles is. What are their contributions. You play
the odds. If you got to put another player on her then that's the way it is.  
Now I'm not sure exactly how we're going to handle this. We're a little
different team than Connecticut. I think that we do apply a little more
pressure than what Connecticut does.  
So it will be interesting. We can either just go set it up one-on-one and then
apply a lot more pressure on the ball handler and make her make a difficult
decision. But we do need to protect Kia Vaughn. And so it poses a problem,
there's no question about that. And what's great about the LSU team is that a
lot of players will -- a lot of teams will have great players, but they don't
have guards that can get it to her, nor do they have people that are smart
enough to know that you have something that no one else has. If you look at
the second half of the UConn game, I would say 95 percent of all passes, it
went into her. Against West Virginia, they were down, West Virginia, we beat
them. They played them as well. So who are the common people?  
Well, in the first half, Fowles didn't touch it much. Second half, just chart
the number of times that she touched that ball. To finish it up. She shot 8-9.
And I can tell you that she touched that ball 95 percent of the time. Sylvia
Fowles is the board for LSU. But don't make a mistake, because Hightower,
Erica, you know, Chaney, all of these players can get it done. They're
powerful and they complement each other well. And Bob Starkey was right about
this.  
What also is exciting about the LSU team is they're very bright. It's very
difficult for us to know the patterns, which we generally do. 99 percent of
the times we can probably run a pattern as well as the team that we're
playing. That also is what helps us to be there a little bit quicker because
we have run -- we run so many patterns ourselves that we can anticipate, we
know, but this team, it makes it very difficult because they read. You cannot
guess anything. They read, they understand spacing extremely well. They're not
turning that ball over. They do and can apply pressure and they will play you
according to what you do.  
For example, if Matee is a 3-point shooter, they will play her close. If
Epiphanny Prince doesn't take drives or takes drives, then they're going to
back off. This team plays personnel and they should be given a lot of credit.
Smart team, excellent offenses, execution and playing together as a team and
they're playing for a purpose.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you very much, Coach, and we'll see you
tomorrow.
