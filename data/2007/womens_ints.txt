_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Cyclones from Iowa State. Coach,
congratulations on a great tournament and a great year. Your comments on
tonight's game, please.  
COACH FENNELLY: First of all, I want to congratulate Oklahoma. That's an
amazing team. We knew they were good. And they played that way.  
I want to thank everyone in Oklahoma City, the Big 12, just a tremendous,
tremendous tournament. It was an honor to be here all week and represent our
university. And I told our kids before the game, I told them at half time and
afterwards, that championship people, it's not always about trophies.  
And I would not trade our players for anyone. I thought they played as hard as
they possibly could play in a very difficult environment.  
And I think that anyone who saw the game and watched the game can appreciate
how competitive our team is and how special these young people are.  
So it was a great event. And we were fortunate to play as hard as we did and
wish we could have made a couple more shots. But we got beat by a better team
tonight. And that's what this tournament's all about.  
But the good news is we're not done playing. So that's the best news.  
  
Q. Bill, will you talk about, they really just didn't give up. Looked at one
point OU took, had a nice run and looked like there might be some gas out of
the tank. But really they came back and hit the 3s late.  
COACH FENNELLY: I think I told them, too, there were a lot of teams across the
country again, against a good Oklahoma team in this environment that would
have given up a number of times. It's 11 to nothing. I don't know if I've ever
called two timeouts in the first three minutes of a game in my life. We gave
it back in half time. And the second half we were doing fine then missed some
shots. They go crazy.  
Kendra Moore steps up and makes huge plays. We're down 57-42 and call timeout.  
I really thought in the last three weeks there was one time that we quit
playing one possession. One possession. And that's where I challenged them in
that timeout. We come out, hit three 3s in a row and go from 15 down, and
we're back playing. And most teams couldn't have done that in this environment
at all.  
So you're absolutely right. To come back two or three times from big runs by
the great Oklahoma team was something that really -- we knew we had to score
and we just couldn't get enough baskets in.  
  
Q. Bill, you know they're a team that runs like you all. But have you seen a
team score 15 points like they did in about three minutes? Ever had a blitz
like that lately?  
COACH FENNELLY: No, we haven't in a long time. And retrospect, I probably
should have called one timeout earlier. But we'd already used two and I knew
we were getting a little bit tired. They made some shots. We got confused one
time defensively and gave up an open look. They made some shots.  
And we told our kids at the shoot-around we'll have to keep scoring. We
couldn't stop them from scoring. There were too many options. They spread us
out. And during that run, when the other guy's scoring, sometimes you gotta
make a shot.  
And I thought we had three, four good looks at the basket maybe they outscore
you 15 to 6 or something. But we couldn't make enough shots.  
You shoot 33%, it's tough to win, and we went 3 for 17 in the post and that
hurt a little bit, too. But, yes, they scored in bunches and we just couldn't
-- we couldn't stop it quick enough. Really couldn't.  
  
Q. Bill, I thought you did a great job of spreading the court at one time,
especially late in the first half and allowing your players to try to take
Oklahoma off the dribble. Could you talk about the strategy and how it worked
for you?  
COACH FENNELLY: We felt sometimes when they went big we had to go small,
spread them out, beat them off the bounds, kick for 3. We were struggling to
score in the post.  
We had to shoot the 3-ball a little bit maybe get to the free throw line a
little bit. But and plus we were getting in a little bit of foul trouble in
the first half. So we were trying to limp this to half time. Spread the court,
use the clock. Get a one-on-one move to the basket and maybe make a couple of
shots.  
I thought the kids handled it pretty well. We worked on it this morning. It
was something we talked about and thought we had to do, because their size
advantage, we just couldn't handle it at times.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the lift Kendra Moore gave them,
especially during the 15 run.  
COACH FENNELLY: No question those were probably maybe the two biggest 3s in
the game. She's not a kid who played a lot. She's not a great three-point
shooter, but she's a senior and made some big plays. I think when you have a
team that wins tournament games, wins championships and NCAA tournament games,
you often see someone that shouldn't be doing it.  
But she's a senior. Coach Coale made a great decision to put her in the game
and add another defender, I think, against us. But there's no question those
two shots were really, really big during that run, and especially the one that
was 47-42. She hit the three to make it 50 to 42. That was maybe the biggest
shot of the game as far as the way the game was going at that time.  
  
Q. Could we talk about Nicky Wieben play a little bit. Looks like she fought
in the post and gave up --  
COACH FENNELLY: I thought our post did the best they could. You're playing
against the best post player in the country. We did some things, we just asked
them to do the best they could. We knew you couldn't stop them from scoring.
We need to get more points out of them. That hurt us a little bit. We -- when
you look at the 3 we played, we were 5 for 22 in the post. We need a little
more there. But again, they're playing against good defenders, they're
defending good players and being defended by good players.  
So our kids battled them really hard. We told them we couldn't double team a
lot. They did the best they could. I don't think there's any question that
their experience tonight will try hopefully make them a better player because
they're not going to play against a better post player. They're not.  
If there is one, I don't know who it is.  
  
Q. Lyndsey, what happened early in the game when you guys got behind and
then what happened when you got back into the game and actually took a lead?  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: They hit some big shots coming out. We had some defensive
mistakes right out of the gate. I think Leah Rush hit some big shots for them
to start the game.  
But it's something that this team's been pretty good at all year. We've been
down on Iowa. Down on the road a lot this year. And we called the timeout when
it was 11-0, and I think everyone -- no one freaked out at that point.
Everyone knew it was about trying to get some scores and getting the stops.  
And that's how this team has played all year long is not giving up. And so I
don't think it really hit anyone or it didn't really faze anyone until the
second half when we got down by 15.  
But in the beginning of the game, it's as -- loud as an environment, which I
think is good not only for our two teams but for Big 12, for women's
basketball in general. But I think the way we responded was a good sign
hopefully for future tournament games.  
  
Q. Coach, earlier in the game they get out to the 11-0 run. Midway everybody
gets a drought. But the best part out of that situation was Courtney was still
having a bad shooting night and you all were staying in the game. Talk about
that point up to the half time.  
COACH FENNELLY: Yes, I think there's no question when you're down 11-0 in that
situation, nothing short of a miracle to be ahead at half time. Both teams
were struggling to score. We tried to go inside early and get some shots we
needed to make. And they made their first couple.  
So all of a sudden it's 11 to nothing. And we had to find a way to survive the
first half. And we made a couple of shots after that. They missed a little.
Courtney was missing a little that maybe she doesn't normally miss, and the
pace of the game got a little better for us.  
And we hit enough 3s to compensate for being so far down. So that was
important. But, yes, to be ahead at half time, I'm sure a lot of people were
getting the (indiscernible) ready on TV, Oh, my God, the biggest massacre in
Big 12 history and all that kind of stuff. Luckily we showed a little bit of
courage, tremendous amount of courage, and kept playing.  
  
Q. Coach, what type of case did you make to the NCAA with this effort this
week?  
COACH FENNELLY: Well, I hope that the NCAA committee looks at us as a team
that's as hot as any team in the country. We played at a very high level. We
won eight games in a row. We lost to a great team in a borderline home game
for them in the Big 12 championship game.  
So I would think that they would look at us as a team that they would like
representing the tournament. We have great fan support. So I think that we're
a team that would represent -- it's the greatest sporting event in our
country. And it's something that every single day, besides my family and our
players, the only thing that keeps my heart beating every day is the NCAA
tournament.  
And for Iowa State to be in that tournament, if we're lucky enough to be in
it, it's great for our school. And to be honest with you I think it will be
great for NCAA tournament to have our team in it.  
  
Q. Similar question, but what do you think you did maybe for your seeding
for this run?  
COACH FENNELLY: Well, I think we had to help it a little bit. When we beat the
teams that we beat and we lost in a hard-fought game tonight. So you don't
know how other teams fit the bracket and all that kind of stuff. So to be
honest with you, I'm not really worried about if we get in the NCAA tournament
where we're seeded. I just want to -- I want to get a match-up that we can
handle and I hope that we can get our fans there.  
  
Q. Megan, can you talk about what this last three weeks, this winning streak
has been for both you and Lyndsey and the whole team, just kind of how
everything just kind of turned around and kind of just how fun and maybe
magical it's been the past three weeks?  
MEGAN RONHOVDE: Yes. The turning point -- we talked about that last night --
was Valentine's Day against A&M. And I think if someone would have told me
that we would have won eight out of our last nine games, I probably would have
told you you're crazy with the way that we started out, the conference play.  
But it's been an amazing run. We're playing our best basketball, and that's
what you want to do come February and March. And we put ourselves in a very
unique position where hopefully come Monday night our name is going to come up
across the TV.  
But it is special for Lyndsey and myself and Abby, when every game that you
play is your last and if we're lucky enough to get into the tournament, every
game from here on out will be our last. So we're just hoping to carry this
momentum with any post-season type of play that we do get in.  
  
Q. Bill, you're not going to play in the NCAA tournament in this type of
atmosphere being so hostile. How does it prepare for that and does it give
your team enough confidence when it comes tournament time?  
COACH FENNELLY: There's a possibility that could happen, that we could play in
a hostile environment. But our team has handled that situation very well, from
K State to Texas Tech to here, but this is a NCAA tournament, regional kind of
atmosphere, I thought. It was tremendous. It was fun to coach in it. Fun to
play in it. That's what these kids do. They watch this on TV all the time.  
Now they get to be a part of it. I thought it was great. Any environment we
were in, no question we've been in it the last three weeks and it's got to
help. It's got to help and hopefully our kids can build on it and I'm sure
they will. And our seniors will make sure they're ready to go whenever that
happens.  
  
Q. Coach, you touched on this at the very beginning, but this city's never
hosted this event before. Just your thoughts of your overall experience of
Oklahoma City and whether you'd like to see this tournament return here in the
near future.  
COACH FENNELLY: There are not enough words in my vocabulary to thank the
people of Oklahoma City. It was an absolutely phenomenal event. They did a
tremendous job in every area of the event. And I think what they did was they
made it really, really hard not to bring it back here. I think they did that.  
So we had a great week. It's a week that I will always remember. Our players
will remember, and I sincerely want to thank the people of this community
because it was a lot like home. Everyone you saw was, "Hi, how are you doing?
What's up? What do you need? What do you need?" And it's the environment that
these young people deserve to play in and be a part of.  
So it was truly special and I can't say enough thank yous on behalf of our
program to everyone in this community for all the work they did, not just --
the amount of work you do to get to this point. I mean, we're here for a week
and the people here who did it, did it for years. So unbelievable experience.  
  
Q. Bill, can you just talk about the tournament that Alison Lacey had as a
rookie? She hit some big shots for you and played very well as a freshman.  
COACH FENNELLY: Alison is developing into an outstanding college player. She's
extremely skilled. She shoots the 3 ball, gives us another ball handler. I've
challenged her a lot. Alison is going to be as good as she wants to be. If her
commitment to the game and commitment to effort every single possession
matches her skill sets, she will be scary good. And that's what freshman go
through. And the environment that she's been in and to learn from these two
and to be in the environment that she's been in over the last three weeks,
especially, and be put in that kind of position can only make her better.  
And now the challenge is up to her to make that decision how good she wants to
be. She's so skilled with the ball and has an understanding of the game, but
obviously a very, very good tournament.  
  
Q. Megan, talk about the two 3 points you knocked down in the first half to
tie the game up and then get the possession again and you knocked down the
score and you get a free throw. Now you're up and you're going in half time.
Just talk about that point on.  
MEGAN RONHOVDE: Well, it was huge momentum for us, and our teams, we really
thrive on momentum. I think if you witnessed last night's game, you know, I
think we went on a stretch where we hit eight 3-pointers in a row, and that's
obviously an important part of our game. And we were really fortunate to be up
at half time considering the start that we had at the beginning of the game.  
  
Q. Lyndsey, Jenna Plumley came up with some big steals there when they were
making the run. Can you talk about her quickness, maybe?  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: Much like Alison, she's as good as any freshman I've played
against, I think. Yesterday she passed the ball to Courtney Paris better than
anybody on the team. I think that helps out a lot. Defensively she was able to
get around and get some steals. It definitely helped their run.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Lyndsey and Megan a little bit, what they
brought when you took them out at the end of the game? You were kind of asking
the fans to get up and show a little respect. Can you just kind of talk about
them a little bit?  
COACH FENNELLY: I took them out of the game -- I took them out of the game
because I wanted to thank them for getting us here. And I took them out of the
game because I wanted the fans and I wanted the Oklahoma fans to recognize two
of the best people I've ever been around in my life and I thanked them for
everything they did for me, and I told them they were still stuck with me for
a little bit longer, because the one thing they'll help me get through the
night is knowing that I get to see these two in practice next week.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MODERATOR: We're joined by the victorious Sooners from Oklahoma. Coach,
congratulations, not only on a big win tonight but on the big tournament.  
COACH COALE: Thank you. I'm so proud of the State of Oklahoma right now. It
just would have almost seemed wrong to not win this for the people, for all
sports association, for the mayor, for everybody who was involved with
building the excitement that revolved around this entire tournament.  
I'm just so proud of our city and proud of our state and I'm pretty proud of
this basketball team I coach.  
  
Q. Sherri, I want to talk about two moves that you made. One on Amanda
Thompson, great freshman for them, slowed her down the second half. The move
to put Kendra Moore in, you told her she's got to be ready and she can win
games for you and helped you tonight.  
COACH COALE: Kendra was terrific. Obviously toward the end of the first half,
they were aware that Erin Higgins' legs are 96 years old. So they were just
isolating her. We were afraid to help out the shooters for obvious reasons
that you saw all night along. It was one-on-one in the paint there. Lacey is
tough. She's a good little player and she's going to make a great hand for
him.  
So we made some changes there. And I felt Jenna and Kendra, because all of
their guys can step out and shoot the 3s, and our lack of size there wasn't
such a factor because we weren't defending in the post, we were defending on
the three-point line.  
I felt like Kendra's aggression could make a difference. And the offense was
going to be a bonus. I put her in to help defend the 3-point line. She did
some great things offensively, obviously the big shot she had. But getting
organized and getting the ball to the right place at the right time, huge
minutes. I thought both the seniors, Kendra and Leah, were both just terrific.  
  
Q. Sherri, to get where you all want to go, could this game tonight be the
best thing that could happen for y'all?  
COACH COALE: How do you mean? Oh, to come from behind?  
  
Q. With the crowd and everything in your favor, to fight back.  
COACH COALE: I don't know. I just think that you gotta figure out a lot of
different ways to win games. That's what we've had to do throughout the entire
month of February.  
I said this immediately following the game. The Big 12 conference has put us
in a position to be prepared for just about anything the NCAA tournament could
throw at us. And I don't think we'd come back tonight, even with the big
crowd, if we have not been tested the way we were tested throughout the month
of February.  
We've been behind before. We've been behind a couple of times when the game's
over and the scoreboard's finished. So there's a poise that you develop after
going through that.  
So I think the month of February prepared us for tonight and hopefully
tonight, coupled with the month of February, gets us ready for anything we
might see next.  
  
Q. Coach, how proud are you of Courtney? She hardly didn't have any fouls,
maybe one foul in like the last few minutes. You pulled her out. You knew they
were going to make their run and you put her back in. What kind of adjustments
did you have to make on that?  
COACH COALE: Well, I was really proud of Courtney. I think she got a little
frustrated in the first half. They were just bringing the house when she
caught the ball and had trouble finishing. It was 4 of 13 at half or
something. And then missed a couple early in the second half. And then
gathered herself. And it's all about balance with her.  
She wasn't in a hurry in the second half. She caught the ball in the vice.
Looked, who's coming, when are the coming, where are they coming from, and
looked at her options and when it was single coverage, she was able to use her
skill and athleticism to get to the rim.  
All she needed to do was get one or two rhythm shots, and we knew it was over.
That's one of the reasons that nobody panicked. We're in that situation. And
Courtney really hadn't gotten going yet. Courtney is going to get going. They
just know that at some point. And once she did, then everybody just relaxed
and everything was obviously much better.  
  
Q. Sherri, did we see the Leah Rush of old in this tournament, and
especially tonight?  
COACH COALE: Oh, I think so. The way she started each game for us was just
huge, sort of set the tone for everything. And that's just sort of the way
Leah Rush plays in post-season. We've become accustomed to that, so that's a
good sign for us.  
  
Q. This goes back to the frustration question and it goes to Courtney and to
Jenna because I don't know that Leah was frustrated too much tonight. But you
certainly were. Courtney would you describe your frustration level and what
you had to do to work around that, and Jenna, yours as well, because you had a
lot of that tonight.  
COURTNEY PARIS: Well, I think -- I was frustrated because you want to make big
shots in a big game. And I wasn't. But at the same time I had teammates
saying, "Court, don't worry about it, you got the next one." And I'd miss it.
"Don't worry you got the next shot."  
I've got great teammates that don't quit on me and stop throwing me the ball
if I miss shots. So that helps a lot.  
JENNA PLUMLEY: I felt like I kind of rushed myself coming in I had an easy
transition back to the basket at the very beginning of the game coming in. And
I saw the 3 and sometimes the first shot tells you how you feel, builds your
confidence, and I think I kind of let my confidence go with that first shot.  
And then when I talked to Coach Coale in the second half and she came up to me
and told me to get her 3, that just built my confidence back up. And
(inaudible) made a wonderful pass to the top of the key to the corner of me
when I hit my first 3. And all I could think about was Coach Coale because I
felt she gave me the assist.  
But other than that I just felt like I rushed myself. That's pretty much all
it was was me, within myself, and trying to keep up with what I have to do.  
  
Q. Leah, would you talk about your play here at the tournament this week and
do you feel like you're playing as well as you have maybe all season?  
LEAH RUSH: I think so, maybe. Tournament play is fun. I love tournament play.
And it's kind of weird being the last time we'll probably play in Oklahoma in
front of our home crowd. I know they'll travel with us, but it's kind of
different when it's right here at home. I don't know.  
I love tournament play. I think it's fun. Either play and win or go home. And
I love to play so I want to keep playing.  
  
Q. Leah, will you talk about just the craziness of the game. You guys going
to 15 run, looks like they're going to run out of gas but it seems like they
never do?  
LEAH RUSH: Yes, Iowa State is one you can never -- with the way they're
shooting the three ball, no lead is a safe lead with those guys. We knew they
would make runs, and we knew that was coming. And I'm just proud of the way
the team responded and was able to make our own runs and send off theirs.  
  
Q. Sherri, your team came up with nine steals. Jenna got six. You only
turned them over 15 times. But nine of those stole the ball. Talk about your
defensive effort especially just to come up with the ball on key plays.  
COACH COALE: Jenna, just has a knack for it. I don't think you teach any of
that. It's just instinct. She catches guys with their back turned and she's so
quick she comes from behind and knocks it loose.  
Several of those in transition. Obviously the one late was huge, I thought.
But she just has it and smells it. And we look down we were just talking in
the holding room. We had nine steals and we only had 13 turnovers. We may have
a serious party on the bus. Finally got it under 15. Woo-hoo.  
(Laughter)  
Q. Coach, can you talk about just emotionally how maybe this is different than
last year? You guys almost seemed a little more subdued.  
COACH COALE: Which one seemed more subdued to you?  
  
Q. (Off microphone)  
COACH COALE: I don't know about that. They all feel great for me. But I think
for a lot of us, I speak just obviously from my own point of view. It was one
of those things where you know the game didn't go down to the wire. You knew
we saw it for, 30 seconds or so there that we had it. But there were a lot of
emotions, honestly, because of the crowd that we had, the way we had been
embraced this week and this tournament.  
And for me personally, the reward in women's basketball and the respect that
people have gained for our sport and the way they've just embraced our
players, it was sort of a surreal moment.  
If you felt any sense of it being subdued, I think it comes from that, maybe
just soaking it all in.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)  
COACH COALE: I don't think so. Because I don't think you can ever take a
championship for granted. I told our guys in the locker room, I went 5-22 once
and I made a decision. Every time we win, I'm celebrating it until the sun
comes up the next day, no matter what. I told them we're not talking about the
NCAA tournament we'll talk about it tomorrow. Tonight we won the Big 12
tournament championship and we're going to celebrate until the sun rises.  
  
Q. Sherri, you talked about how the Big 12 prepares you for moments like
these and for the tournament. Are you glad, though, now not to be facing a Big
12 team at least for a while?  
COACH COALE: Heavens, yes. But you never know, when the committee puts the
bracket together, we might be right back with somebody in another week. But I
do appreciate the challenge and the coaching in our league, because I do think
we go into the tournament. And our record in the NCAA tournament has been
very, very strong. And I think a lot of that is a reflection of the
competition we play night in, night out.  
  
Q. Courtney, can you brag on Leah? Seemed like when you were struggling, it
sort of kept you guys scoring and kept you going.  
COURTNEY PARIS: We were down by 8. Her and Kendra both just making big plays
and making big shots, being vocal and being leaders, that's big time. That's
what kept us in the game is watching them be so confident. Kind of helped
motivate us all.  
  
Q. Courtney, after winning the Big 12, Big 12 tournament, is this team ready
to win more games?  
COURTNEY PARIS: Yes, that's the plan.  
(Laughter)  
I mean Coach said after the game that you do everything all season long. I
know I guess I'm speaking for myself, but like you play your whole season and
preseason and all that stuff you want to win the big thing.  
So we definitely have a lot more to learn and a lot more things to get done.
But that's what we're playing for coming up later in March.  
  
Q. Leah, you and Kendra played basketball at OU for a long time. When she
came in, I saw you say something to her. You guys know each other really well.
Did it surprise you she got on that kind of role for that little stretch and
what she did? And I don't know if you can share word-for-word what you said to
her but could you give us an idea?  
LEAH RUSH: Honestly, I don't even remember the specific moment. But Kendra has
a knack for making big plays at big times, I think. She's a competitor and
she's quick and she's a good ball player. And she knows what she's capable of.  
When the opponent gives her something that she can take, she's going to take
it. And she did that tonight. And Kendra's just a fun kid. I think when we
play together we enjoy.  
COACH COALE: We've been here for four years together. So I think there's kind
of a special connection on the court with anybody in your own class.  
  
Q. Coach and Courtney, I was really impressed with your sister, Ashley. She
made some moves tonight and I want to know, how important is her confidence
when she comes off that bench?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think it's so important and I think Leah did a great job the
way Iowa State plays with those shooters, and I think Leah a lot more tonight
over Ashley. But her confidence, that's the big thing. When she goes in, even
when she misses the shots, she doesn't care. She's aggressive.  
A year ago you couldn't make her go score. Ashley you can score. She's like
give me the post, I'm open. I think her confidence has (inaudible). And when
she's playing great -- I thought she had a great tournament. And when she's
playing great, being that confident and aggressive, it makes what I do -- and
I think I speak for Leah, what she does in the post makes it a lot easier with
another threat in there.  
  
Q. Sherri, it seems like -- or I do not remember Kendra and Jenna playing on
the court together for anywhere near that long this season. And do you think
you found something that you might use a little more, both of them together,
and what did you think when you put them in tonight?  
COACH COALE: I put them in for defense. I felt like their speed and their
quickness to get out to shooters quickly and we would be able to maybe control
that 3-point line a little bit.  
Is it something that we think is a weapon, a new game plan? We have all kinds
of combinations, all kinds of combinations, and I think that's one of our
strengths is we're able to be sort of chameleon-like and become what we need
to be depending on who we're playing.  
And that's a real strength of the depth of our bench and the amount of quality
experience that these young guys ever see over the course of the season.
Because of the (inaudible) earlier in the year, she ran into a situation,
confidence is strong and she's ready to effect the game, which she did
tonight. You could say the same about Amanda and Chelsi and Nyeshia. In
certain situations we were close to sticking her in for a point or two tonight
to try to change the flavor of things. That's the versatility of our team.  
  
Q. Coach, the way you guys ended the season, ending the Big 12 championship,
where do you think you'll be seeded in the NCAA tournament?  
COACH COALE: That's a good question. I didn't even look at any of the proposed
reports until yesterday. In the paper I scanned a couple. I don't know how we
wouldn't be 2 because we shared the regular season and won the tournament
outright. But stranger things have happened, and I'm just one of those people
that thinks you've got to beat everybody who is really good if you want to win
a championship anyway. So send us where you need to send us and place us where
you place us and we'll be ready to play.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MODERATOR: Coach, your comments.  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: It's been phenomenal. It's why you play. It's why you
root for your team, to have the opportunity to play in a championship game in
the Big 12 and we're looking forward to it.  
We know we're playing an outstanding team. We're really excited to have the
opportunity to play tomorrow night and hopefully we can give the fans a good
show.  
  
Q. Bill, about last year's quarter final game with them, first of all, what
stands out about that game to you still and can you use anything, can you take
anything away from that game, translate it into this game?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: Erin Higgins, three point shot. I can see it in my
dreams. And ironically the first night we we're here we go to dinner at Mickey
Mantle's restaurant and this young man runs up to me. Coach Fennelly, my name
is Patrick Higgins, the brother of Erin Higgins.  
(Laughter)  
That's how my week started. So that's the shot. I thought our kids played a
tremendous game. We had an opportunity to win, and she makes an unbelievable
three-point shot. So that's the play I remember about the whole thing, and
decides letting Courtney Paris break every tournament scoring record there
was.  
  
Q. Coach, if you do win tonight, will you finally be willing to concede your
team might just make the tournament?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: We're not playing tonight. So if we win tomorrow, then,
yes, I will say we're definitely in the NCAA tournament. Because the rules say
if you win the conference tournament, you're in. So, yes, I will agree to
that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your relationship with Sherri Coale?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: She's a very good person. Deb and I got to meet with her
and spend some time with her and her husband Dane on the Nike trip. She's been
in the league almost the same amount of time as I've been in it. I think we
both try to run programs the same way, with classy individuals. I think both
of us have tried to do our best to build programs, not just with the players
but with the fan base, and what you're going to see tomorrow night is a
tribute to Coach Coale and everything she's done.  
Hopefully we've done the same thing at Hilton and the fans you'll see here at
AMs, but hopefully we'll do it in a way to help our league. We've worked real
hard to make the Big 12 a good league and expose it nationally. She's a
tremendous coach.  
I don't think she gets enough credit for the way she coaches. Really don't.
They have great players. And sometimes they have to forget they have to be
coached and put in a system. They've done a great job. She's a great person,
great family and a great example of what a woman's basketball coach should be,
in my opinion.  
  
Q. What are your impressions of Jenna Plumley and the confidence at such a
young age she brings?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: I don't think there's a question that when Coach Coale
put her in the starting lineup their team changed dramatically. She's
extremely poised, handles the ball very well, gives them another deep threat
with the 3-ball. She plays an amazing amount of energy. And you have Courtney
Paris who may be one of the best big players, tall, long, athletic, skilled,
and then you have Plumley at 5-3 running around out there.  
So she really, I thought, played great last night. I'm a big Angela Tisdale
fan, and I thought she played really well against her. So her ability to
stretch the defense, her ability to handle the ball, her energy she brings to
the court, and obviously being a young player from the state of Oklahoma will
bring an additional fan base to their team.  
  
Q. Lyndsey and Megan, what are the keys to winning tomorrow night?  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: We talked about how good their offense is, and something
we'll need to improve upon the next 24 hours is being able to score better
down here in Oklahoma City. They're too good to try and limit to 20-point
halves like we did against Nebraska.  
So I think a big key for us is going to be to try to score as many possessions
as we can and then we try to get stops along the way.  
MEGAN RONHOVDE: And just to kind of add on that, obviously you can't stop
Courtney Paris from scoring. That's obvious. No one can do that. The biggest
thing I think we have to do is eliminate the easy baskets that she probably
does get with the put-back and the second-chance opportunities. And trying to
be able to guard from the outside and limit the amount of outside shots that
they get.  
It's hard because when you have an inside player that brings so much attention
to your defense, it really makes it easy for them to stretch your defense out,
so you know you really have to be guarding from both ends of the court that
way.  
  
Q. Lyndsey, can you talk a little bit about Plumley, because you know what
that's like being a freshman, trying to run the show. If you could talk about
that matchup, what you've seen of her. And also tomorrow night you guys are
going to be not the favorites of the crowd. It's going to be a huge crowd for
Oklahoma. Can you talk about how you enjoy that? You're used to the Hilton
magic, but do you also enjoy being the underdog in terms of facing the
crowd?  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: First on Plumley, I've been extremely impressed with her,
much like coach said. She's kind of sparked their turnaround when they went
through that stretch where they had to play so many games in so many days, and
out of that they got an obviously very successful point guard.  
So the pressure of this position, and it seems like Coach Coale in a sense
runs her team a lot like we do here at Iowa State. And so I've been very
impressed. Just the pressure that goes along with it, being able to score and
being able to drive, and it seems like she finds Courtney Paris better than
anyone on that team does.  
So that seems to have helped them a bit. Part two of your question, we've had
a couple of big road wins this year earlier in the season. Some of our
nonconference games at U&I, at Iowa, and I think maybe two of the bigger games
all year leading up to this tournament. A win at K State and a win at Tech,
which I think it's going to be good for us, we'll have 9,000 people cheering
for them and a thousand for us.  
So it's a still a 5-on-5 game, 94 feet and it's still a 28.5 size ball.
Nothing changes out of that. And does that mean that a lot of people aren't
going to be in red and gold, yes, but it's still a basketball game. It's still
5-on-5 and we have to just play.  
  
Q. First meeting with Norman, you guys did a great job on Paris, she had 13
and 14. Obviously last year you let her do what she wanted to do and guard the
rest. I don't want to give away the game plan, but is there a way you can
contain her with containing the rest of the team? Do you have to give up
something with them?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: I think you have to give up something. They just have too
many weapons. They're so talented offensively, and as we talked so much about
Plumley, and I'm a huge Leah Rush fan, and I think Ashley Paris has added to
them. So they're a team that defensively you have to do the best you can.  
I think you have to hope they help you a little and miss. You have to hope
that maybe you get someone in foul trouble or tired. But I think this is one
of those games you go into, we're going to have to outscore them. I really
believe that. And that's just the way we're going to approach the game. And we
want it to be entertaining.  
We're going to try to play the game the right way. But we don't have the
capability like a Texas A&M to get out and pressure the perimeter people and
take them out of their offense a little bit. We don't have that ability. We'll
have to be smart defensively, hope they miss a few, maybe change our defense a
little bit. But as Lindsay and Megan said, we have to be as efficient as we
have been all year to have a chance to win. I really believe that. It's not
the NBA play-offs. We don't have to play them 4 out of 7. We have to be better
one time. That's what we gotta do.  
We talked this morning about all the teams that won conference championships
that didn't win the conference tournament. There's a long list of those
people. So that's what we're trying to do and we understand what we're up
against, and that's the way it should be. It should be this kind of game at
the end of the Big 12 season.  
So if the game's as we hope, I hope it's in the 70s and hopefully we'll get
one more.  
  
Q. Bill, you guys came into this tournament playing really well. Five
straight wins. Do you think having to play three games over the last three
days you've taken that disadvantage and turned it into an advantage by keeping
the momentum going and getting it before anybody else could get it in the
tournament?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: I think it's a big game, and Lindsay made a good point.
After we left the coliseum after beating Nebraska, if we do our business,
we'll never play another game at Hilton. We'll go on the road for two, K State
at Tech and the Big 12, and if we are fortunate enough to play in the NCAA
tournament, we'll be on the road again.  
It gave our team a lot of confidence to play in tough environments, to play in
different ways. We came from behind from K State, hung on at Tech. The big
game is obviously the first game. The 5-12 game is scary. You don't know
what's going to happen. We won that. And obviously the Nebraska game was a
tremendous basketball game. But our kids are playing with a lot of confidence.
They believe in one another. The runs they've had over the last three weeks is
unlike any team I've ever been around.  
And I hope it continues, because they've done everything we've asked them to
do and then some. So whatever happens tomorrow night, we will walk out of here
with our head up and very proud of what we've accomplished, looking forward to
hopefully hearing some good news on Monday the 12th.  
  
Q. Kind of a similar question. You a few years ago went through the
tournament playing the first day and then winning the championship. Is there a
way that that has given you more momentum? Do you look at what they did,
anything?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: To be honest with you, not a lot. I think it's just, you
just want to keep playing. There's no big secret to it. You want to find a way
to win the one game and get to the next one.  
It's just so much fun to be here. You wake up this morning and you're
thinking, you know, there's 12 teams that came here trying to live out a
dream. There's only two left. And the environment here, the way that the whole
thing about it is just something that our kids will always remember. Always.  
And all of the coaches, the players, the fans, it's just been -- it's been one
of the greatest experiences of my life to be here with this team and coaching
them and just enjoy watching them enjoy what they've done here.  
So, yes, sure, it's possible. It's a hard thing to do. And it's not that we're
playing four games. It's that we're playing a very, very good team in the
fourth game.  
So, sure, we have a chance. We're going to show up and play. So there is a
chance.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about Megan's defense the last few days.  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: Megan is, and I said this back home, and I was extremely
disappointed when they picked the ALT defensive team in our league that Megan
wasn't on it. I thought that was wrong. I don't know why she wasn't. But she's
defended that way for four years for us.  
And I think in this tournament she's made some really big stops at key times.
She made a great -- made back-to-back defensive plays at the end of the Texas
Tech game when the game was in doubt.  
That's something she's done for us all along. She's long. She's athletic.
We've had her guarding a lot of different people a lot of different times. And
I said this after the Kansas State game, when we walked off the court. I told
my staff, I would not want Megan Ronhovde guarding me because it's hard to get
a shot off.  
And she loves to play defense. She plays it hard, she plays it right she's
played as good a defense as any player I've ever had.  
  
Q. Megan, how different is Oklahoma from all the other Big 12 north teams
that you saw twice and what did you take out of the meeting in Norman the
first time this year?  
MEGAN RONHOVDE: I think the biggest thing, the difference between Oklahoma and
really any team that we've played from the north, the first thing that
obviously stands out is Courtney Paris.  
And it's just the kind of, to touch on what I talked about earlier you really
can't concentrate on one player. Courtney does draw a lot of attention. But
they have so many offensive weapons that it's very difficult to try and guard.  
You almost have to guard perfectly. You really do. And you know the meeting
that we had in Norman, you know, obviously it wasn't one of our better games
and we were having kind of a rough stretch there.  
But the way we've been playing the last three weeks, you know, I really truly
believe tomorrow night you're going to see a completely different team going
up against them.  
  
Q. Megan, coach has talked several times about how special this senior class
is, particularly as much as you and Lyndsey have given to this program. What
does it mean for both of you to have a chance to win a Big 12 championship as
seniors?  
MEGAN RONHOVDE: You know, Lyndsey and I, we've been talking about this for the
past couple of days. And each win we get, it's almost -- it's almost hard to
believe still. Coming in here as freshman, you know, you hear stories about
the great teams that Iowa State has had with Angie and Megan Taylor, and to
kind of be put in that elite group is something really special. It's something
that no one can take away from us, and you know five or six years from now,
when we're in the position they're in today and people will be able to refer
to us, I think that's something that the two of us are really proud that we've
been able to get to this point and accomplish what we have and you know it's
something that we'll always remember.  
  
Q. Bill, this is your fourth time taking the team to a championship game now
in the Big 12. Are there any characteristics between, similar characteristics
between this team and the other three that you've had?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: I think this team is probably better defensively than
some of the other teams we've had. I think that the ability to find different
ways to win is similar.  
We haven't, those other teams, you know with Angie, we probably had a little
bit more, I don't know if dominating is the right word, but a little bigger
post presence. But I think this team has a greater ability to find different
ways to win.  
Those teams, we could outscore a lot of people. And we were very efficient
offensively. I think this team has found every way possible to win and whether
it's been close, we've come from behind in a lot of games at half time.  
We've had to guard people. We've had to outscore people. This team seems to
have a little bit more balance that way. And to be honest with you it's
probably been a little bit harder for this team and the competition is
greater. Top to bottom than it's ever been.  
So I think to get to the championship game in this league this year is a great
accomplishment, because I think our league is one of the best in the country,
top to bottom. All you have to do is look at the scores.  
So I think that that is something that really is special for our seniors and
our entire team.  
  
Q. Bill, Courtney is just kind of other worldly in terms of her physical
presence and these crazy numbers the double double she puts up. How do you
sort of prepare, especially a younger post player especially like Nicky to
deal with Courtney and not get overwhelmed by just facing Courtney?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: Get a massage this afternoon. Get ice baths, rest up, do
the best you can, don't get hurt. I guess stay in front of her when you can
and do the best -- I mean actually Nicky didn't play her too bad in Norman.
She really didn't. She stayed in front of her. Nicky is long and she'll
compete. Foul trouble becomes an issue. We're not real deep. We have Nicky and
Rachel. And then when I said to Nisleit and Toccara in practice, you may have
to guard them, their eyes were real big. They weren't really excited about
that.  
Megan is not looking because she doesn't want to hear her name to have to
guard them.  
MEGAN RONHOVDE: I'll guard 'em.  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: Yeah, right.  
(Laughter)  
But I think that everyone knows how good she is. And we played against her a
couple times. No one's found a way. I mean no way has found a way.  
She's the best player in the country. That's what you have to -- that's the
very first find on our scatter report. And the challenge is are you willing to
accept that challenge to go up and say I'm playing against the best college
player in the United States, whatever I do well against her I'm going to tell
my grandkids. I'm going to tell everybody this is what I did against Courtney
Paris, whatever. So there is no way to prepare them. You just say go play as
hard as you can, try and get them in the right position. Try to help them
smartly.  
And just go out and do it. And I really -- I think Nicky will compete hard. I
know Rachel will too. So if we can keep them out of foul trouble, they'll do
the best they can and hopefully she won't go crazy.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Coale and the Oklahoma Sooners.
Congratulations again, Coach. Now that you've had a couple of hours to rest
since the game, your thoughts about last night's game and your upcoming
opponent Iowa State.  
COACH SHERRI COALE: Not much has changed. Proud of our team's performance,
feel fortunate to be in a position to play in another conference championship.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts about Iowa State beating A &M?   
COACH SHERRI COALE: Impressive performance. Iowa State is playing very well
right now. It's like they willed themselves to win games. You admire that as a
competitor. You admire the way they're playing together and the things they've
been able to accomplish.  
It reminds me a little bit of our team that went to Dallas and ran through. We
were the first ones to be able to be playing on the first day and end up
playing on the final day as well. And we were fortunate enough to be able to
win that.  
So we know it can be done. And they're a formidable opponent. They shoot the
ball extremely well. And Bill is just one of the best coaches in the business.
So we have our hands full.  
  
Q. Sherri, would you talk about how different this team is than maybe the
one that everybody thought you were going to play?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: The big difference is we feel like we spent the last month
playing Texas, Texas A&M and Baylor. Feels like we play them over and over
again. Different styles in those teams, Iowa State playing quite a bit
differently than those guys. It will be an adjustment obviously. But that's
what it's like in the NCAA tournament. You get one team that plays one way one
night and it's a completely different story the next.  
Just great preparation for that.  
  
Q. Sherri, early in your career, first several years seemed like you
couldn't get over the hump against Iowa State. Remember you playing them and
that was the one team you couldn't beat. Now, fortunately, you've been able to
beat them a couple of times. But for a while this was the team that seemed to
just have it against you for some reason. Just couldn't get over the hump?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: At least we're not playing in AMs tomorrow, thank
goodness. One of those matchups for whatever reason. Our 2002 team lost to
them up in AMs and Bill does a great job and many times they've set in that
zone and we've been unable to hit shots. They don't play as much zone as they
used to.  
But they're offensively always going to be volatile. That's the type of kids
he recruits and the way they play. You have to guard them every single night.
And he always has them ready. So luckily we've been able to win a few of the
last ones.  
  
Q. Sherri, can you comment on being the marquee draw really downtown and the
atmosphere you've had the last couple of games inside the Cox Center?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: We're blown away by the crowd and not just the number of
people but the way the people have interacted with us while we're on the
floor. It's really been just an amazing thing to be a part of. You think you
know what it will feel like. We played New Mexico here earlier in the year and
got a taste what it would be like to be in this venue with a lot of people,
six, 7,000 people at that game probably.  
But then once you're here, it's something completely different entirely. Our
guys are like rock stars rocking around. And it's awesome for them. It's as
much a taste of the NCAA tournament you can possibly get. It reminds me of the
day when you got your home court, if you were a top four seed in the
tournament, the way it felt that first year when we sold out the Lloyd Noble
Center to be able to play. It's got that feel.  
But you know I think the best part of it is the fact that for every game there
has been juice inside the Cox center, and I think all of us as coaches can
speak to the fact that we've played in early rounds, Big 12 tournament games
in which there was no juice. And most coaches probably agree with me in that I
would rather play in a hostile environment than a dead one. Nothing is worse
than that.  
I think our opponents have appreciated the atmosphere while not necessarily
having us having so much fans in there. But they've appreciated the
electricity of it all.  
  
Q. Sherri, where did your confidence in Jenna come from to turn to her in
such a critical time of the year?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: It's always practice. Always. That's what earns you your
time. To get on the floor when the lights are on and everybody is looking. And
she just has battled day in and day out since the start of the year, with
Britney and Kendra. And it's been a positive thing, in which they've really
pushed and propelled her and taught her and given her absolutely no slack on
any day. They've just challenged her every single day.  
It made her progress so that when the opportunity came, she was ready for it.  
  
Q. Going back to the bigger picture stuff, do you feel like tomorrow night
you guys are playing for maybe a number two seed, maybe Austin, maybe Dallas?
Secure something like that?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: You know, I never ever get caught up in all that stuff.
Somebody asked me the other day where they thought we would be. I knew that
there was a regional in Austin and we could go and play there. But I haven't
even looked at it. I looked this morning in the newspaper and I think one had
us at a four seed and ESPN three. You have to be good enough to beat everyone
once you get in that thing anyway. I can't control any of it, so I'm not going
to worry about it.  
  
Q. Leah, Iowa State is a unique team in they shoot the 3 so well. Defensive
tendencies are when the ball goes inside, you crash, you double up, against
Iowa State, you talk about as a forward like that you play you have to guard
somebody. You can't crash down on Iowa State. You have to stick on your
opponent?  
LEAH RUSH: I think facing Iowa State, I've become accustomed to three-point
shooting, that's what they do year in year out. It's a different look
certainly than the Big 12 south, who we've been facing a lot lately.  
I think we'll just make a few adjustments and change the style a little bit.
Still play hard, still pressure, all out defense, and I think it's a different
team and just as with any team, you're going to play a little bit differently.  
  
Q. Coach, do you enjoy hugging Bill Fennelly as much as he seems to enjoy
hugging you?  
(Laughter)  
COACH SHERRI COALE: Yes, I have a season pass from his wife, Deb, she said I
could. He's the best.  
  
Q. Leah, you guys a couple of years ago were the No. 6 seed and were able to
win. The only team that's been able to do that. Iowa State is trying to do
that now. Can you kind of talk about that, reflecting back on that, how much
sort of the momentum helps you but also how difficult it is to do? And, Coach
Coale, if you could talk a little more about you and Bill. You're both
incredibly competitive people and yet you're sort of, it's a very high class
respect relationship between the two of you.  
LEAH RUSH: I remember a few years ago we ran through, we get on a roll and
there's just tremendous momentum and I'm sure they're thinking nobody can stop
us right now. And so I think we have an advantage in that respect because
we've been in their spot and we know what they're thinking right now.  
At the same time we're going into this game with that same attitude. We're on
a roll right now as well. And we're very confident and we're playing
confident. We're playing hard. And we look forward to the matchup.  
COACH SHERRI COALE: These two-part questions, we gotta concentrate to remember
these paragraphs. Sorry. I gotcha.  
The thing I've appreciated about Bill from the time I came into this league,
and I was fortunate, came from the high school rink right into college and
everybody in this league could have just said, you know, what are you doing
here and ostracized me, and they didn't. I had a lot of incredible mentors who
treated me as though I had been in the business as long as they had. And Bill
was one of those. The thing I've appreciated the most about him through the
years is that it's just about competing for 40 minutes.  
And he competes as hard as anybody I've ever met in my life for 40 minutes.
When that game is over, he's the same as he is if you saw him on the golf
course or at a football game, wherever he might be. Just always the same.  
And I appreciate that so much, that he is who is he is all the time. It's an
honor to compete against someone like that.  
  
Q. Leah, you've had a couple of very nice games and last night when Baylor
took the 1-point lead it was Chelsea that had a personal run. So I'm just sort
of wondering, I know there's a sense of urgency for everybody. Are you guys
feeling, the seniors, do you think you're feeling it in a much greater way,
perhaps?  
LEAH RUSH: With our individual performances or collectively? Well, sure, I
think definitely, there's six of us, and we have one more go at this and
finals of the tournament tomorrow and we step into the NCAAs. And any game can
be your last one. I don't think anybody wants to end before Cleveland.  
And we expect to go far this year and so I think every game we have an
experience factor and we have a determination factor that we plan to use
throughout.  
  
Q. Courtney, I want to ask you about what Jenna's play, such an important
correlation between a point guard and center in basketball. What's her play
done for you?  
COURTNEY PARIS: Well, I think the coolest thing about Jenna is she's a great
passer, probably one of the best point guard passers I've ever played with.
But at the same time she has confidence to knock down a shot. I think last
year a lot of times different teams have tried to pull off with the point
guard spot that fell down. And get her to shoot like that, it creates more
problems.  
  
Q. Courtney, coach said your team's being treated like rock stars here in
Oklahoma City. Does that make you the lead singer? Steven Tyler or somebody
like that?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I'm definitely not the best singer, so I don't know. No, I
think it's cool, even other teams it's the cool thing about it. Yesterday we
went to the memorial, a Baylor fan said good luck, I hope you win and, hey, we
played you guys today, but I just think everybody is really supporting us and
it's just going to go out in the spirit of playing.  
  
Q. Leah, as long as you've been around and seeing all types of guards in
this league and the tournament and stuff, what do you think of how Jenna's
been able to step into this massive spotlight and play?  
LEAH RUSH: Jenna has been tremendous not only as a freshman but just period.
Last summer when we started pick-up, I think everybody saw something in Jenna
and knew she could be a special player here. When coach called her up, I think
she was ready to go. And she brought a whole new feel to this team, I think,
and really propelled us to the way we're playing right now.  
  
Q. Courtney, Jenna, Leah, you can answer this. The way Ashley has played
recently here inside, what can that do for this team if she continues to play
like that offensively?  
COURTNEY PARIS: She's been playing basketball for a long time. She's
aggressive, not afraid to go score. She's as tough as anyone, I think, as
another post player. Like I said, about Jenna, guards dropping, post players,
if they want to drop down and double, they're aggressive, having the ability
to score. It's just going to make the defense make things harder on our
opponent's defense.  
  
Q. Sherri, will you talk about Lyndsey Medders, and even if she's not
scoring, which she has been lately, what she brings to that team.  
COACH SHERRI COALE: Just toughness. I think she's their heart and soul. They
revolve around her. And she's gutty, and confident and a terrific shooter,
obviously. But she controls the game because when the ball's in her hand she's
going to make something happen and it's in her hand a lot. Late in the game, I
told her after that Nebraska game, we're just going to foul you like at the
bottom baseline because if you get a chance to shoot it, it's going in. I know
it. So just get ready; we're just going to foul you.  
She just has that competitive will about her. If the game is on the line she
wants the ball, and you almost kind of create your luck sometimes when you
think that way; that you make something good happen. Then you start to believe
something good is going to happen. It's a crazy cycle. But she's their heart
and soul.  
  
Q. Sherri, can you talk about the matchups between the two teams and how the
two teams match up, so to speak?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: They're just so different, and I mentioned that earlier,
so different than the Big 12 south that we've been competing in lately. They
love to shoot the 3-ball obviously. I think they shot 26 3s last night
compared to 22s. So we'll shoot the 3 a little bit, but not that ratio.  
So different styles, I think. We're probably a little more smash mouth and
they're a little more spread the floor and shoot it deep. But both relentless
defensive teams that probably don't get enough credit for defense. Both
squads. Really get after you and compete hard. Maybe not a perfect puzzle
piece match up. Maybe a battle of who does what they do best, best.  
  
Q. Jenna, a lot of people have asked others here on the panel about you. But
is this where you thought you would be? I mean I remember I asked you a
question earlier this season. You said when I finally got my chance. You're
just a freshman. It was not far past mid-season, but did it seem like that to
you and is this where you always thought you'd be this season?  
JENNA PLUMLEY: Well, it's been really overwhelming just coming in, coming into
this year. I had two senior point guards ahead of me and Kendra and Britney
have been so good to me, teaching me the ropes and being there every step of
the way. And in practice is where I learn the most being able to compete with
guards like that has made me so much better as a point guard.  
And I feel like just having the players around me that I do, my teammates,
it's just been a wonderful atmosphere and I'm just glad to be able to play for
Oklahoma and be here with these guys.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)  
JENNA PLUMLEY: A little emotional. It's been a tough journey, like coach said,
fight day in, day out and work your way up. And it's just all about, like she
said, having confidence and coming in. And like she told Kendra last night,
just coming in and playing when your number is called, and I think that's what
it's all about.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [Jessica Morrow](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17021)

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MODERATOR: We'd like to have you assess tonight's game but we understand
Jessica had a career high of 25 points. Congratulations to you, and your
thoughts about tonight's game and upcoming season.  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: It was a very entertaining basketball game. We
just fell short. I congratulate Oklahoma. I'm proud of Jessica. I thought
Jessica played very well for us.  
And take a deep breath and head to the NCAA.  
  
Q. Coach, talk a little bit about you had a road game tonight.  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: What now?  
  
Q. You guys had a road game essentially tonight. Talk a little bit about
that atmosphere in there.  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: It was a great atmosphere. I thought good for
women's basketball. Good for the Big 12. And we fought hard.  
  
Q. Kim, can you talk about, every time you got close, they put together some
kind of a run. And also the two three-pointers you fouled out on that resulted
in the free throws.  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: I think you answered it for me. They made plays
when it was tight and I think one coach in this league said it best: After a
loss, it's hard to defend the foul line.  
  
Q. Kim, six games in a row now against these guys. I know you said last year
that Courtney Paris is not one player. There's a bunch of players out there.
Just why did they have a hex on y'all tonight?  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: I don't know that they have a hex on us, Brian. We
have got a national championship and they don't. So where is the hex? They
have a very good team. They have many more Big 12 championships than we do.
But I think it's just a great atmosphere when two competitive coaches and two
competitive teams get together and, you know, I don't know that hex is the
word.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys really struggled the first five minutes, all of you in
the second half. What was it about tonight that was able to come out on fire
in the second half?  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Maybe we're growing up a little bit. Maybe we're
going to try to figure this thing out and when you look at our lineup, we
don't have six seniors, and we're trying to compete with kids that have been
in this environment that have been in this situation, that have won a lot of
ball games for their team.  
And we're growing and we're learning. And we fought hard.  
  
Q. Coach, the fact that you came back in that second half that Josh was
talking about and took the lead and took it to OU for a while, does it give
you encouragement heading into NCAA?  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Sure. No loss is fun. You must understand there
are a lot of teams that are playing their last games of the season this week
and last week, and we've got another opportunity. And we're going to look
forward to the NCAA tournament and sit down on Monday for the selection show
and keep our fingers crossed that we get seated in an area where our fans can
come.  
  
Q. Jessica, talk about tonight. You were feeling it, they couldn't defend
you. Talk a little bit about that.  
JESSICA MORROW: Well, I just did everything I could to keep my team in the
ball game and when other people weren't really able to score, that's why I
tried to take advantage of the situation and score also. But my team, we
fought as hard as we could. There wasn't nothing else we could do about that.  
  
Q. Kim, have you ever seen Bernice have that many travels in a game?  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: I don't know. Probably not. You know, Bernie
struggled tonight. Yet at the same time, it's one game. She played well
certainly in more games than she's not played well. And she'll learn from it,
grow from it and hopefully she's got it out of her system.  
  
Q. Coach, I noticed on the side you were giving your team the come on down,
because several times you looked like you knew they could, you could beat them
to the hole. Also what did you say to Bernice when you go back home to get her
together for this next level you're going to?  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Seniors have a sense of urgency. I don't know that
I really need to say a whole lot to her. She understands how she played
tonight, and if she were to play halfway decent, it may have been a little bit
different outcome. I don't know that.  
But she doesn't want to let her team down. She doesn't want to let herself
down, but, guys, in this business those nights happen. And we're not going to
dwell on it. And we're going to move on and probably won't say anything to
her.  
When I was telling her to come on, I just felt there were many opportunities
when we would get long rebounds, we could run and try to score and get
something in transition, and that's what I was doing.  
  
Q. Kim, you were real high on Jessica at the beginning of the season and
thought she was going to have kind of a breakout year. Could you talk about
what she was able to do? Is this what you saw in the pre-season and what she
was capable of doing?  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: I saw this in recruiting Jessica. I think Jessica
is a player, a six-foot body on the perimeter that can shoot the shot, can
take one or two dribbles to the basket, and I just thought that without her
efforts tonight, it wouldn't have even been close. And she just battled and
battled and just tried to help us win a ball game. And hopefully Jessica will
continue to play like this and grow.  
Sometimes I have to remind myself she's just a sophomore. She's just a
sophomore.  
  
Q. Were the technicals more frustration than anything else? What did they
tell you on that?  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: I can't even talk about it. You all know the
rules.  
  
Q. Kim, I know you're thinking about this game, maybe you aren't, but care
to size up the championship game? Iowa State maybe a surprise in there,
beating A &M tonight, and Oklahoma, how do you see that matchup?   
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Well, Bill Fennelly is one of my all-time favorite
coaches. I think he's one of the coaches when you look at the game can take
talent and exceed beyond what you think they're capable of doing. And he's got
seniors as well that are playing with a sense of urgency.  
And it should be two contrasting styles but yet similar styles. Both teams
will play zone. Three-point shooters. So it's going to be a good ball game.  
  
Q. Kim, Courtney said she'd never been defended like that. Actually facing
her and turned around to her, was that just something y'all came up with this
week, where you actually had the players like in her face and --  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Is that a compliment coming from you?  
  
Q. Yes, and it was a compliment from Courtney as well.  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Well, tried something different. Nothing different
than we used in previous games worked so just tried something different. They
still won. She still had a double-double.  
  
Q. Coach, on media day you mentioned earlier that this league was totally
different than past years. When you talked about them, it was very competitive
and lead champions would have at least two losses and that pretty much what it
boiled down to.  
Why do you see the conference having -- how do you see the conference being
this year?  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: If they would listen to me, they'd give us seven
because I know Jody Conradt is in there. I think she earned it from what she
did in the previous years, but they don't listen to coaches. Kind of like
referees. They won't listen to coaches either.  
I don't know. I'd love to see seven. I think legitimately we had six. I wish
we could get seven.  
  
Q. Jessica, when y'all were able to come back like that and take the lead,
did you have a good feel then or did you feel like maybe that you all had
expended so much energy that it was going to be tough to sustain that?  
JESSICA MORROW: We actually thought we had a good chance. We were all pumped
up and we fought back hard to get the lead. And it wasn't -- everyone had a
feeling that we were going to win and it didn't turn out the way we wanted it
to.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MODERATOR: We're going to go ahead and get started. We'll be joined by the
players in just a moment. Coach, congratulations on your win. Your thoughts
and assessment of tonight's game and your possible matchup on Saturday.  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: Obviously we are ecstatic to still be playing, to be
playing the championship game, such a great event.  
Texas A&M is an amazing team. They are going to be a great NCAA team. So hard
to prepare for. I've never coached against a team that make you earn it like
that every possession. But our team continues to show the character and grit
that they've shown when this thing started on February 14th and we won our
last eight games.  
We beat a great team tonight and did everything we could when we had to do it
to make the plays. And great semifinal game and we're honored to be playing
Saturday night.  
  
Q. This streak started with the Texas A &M win. Just kind of talk about
where this team has come from that game to this game and just both with Texas
A&M.   
COACH BILL FENNELLY: That's basically what we talked about in the pregame
speech. Started on February 14th. Valentine's Day, and we challenged our team
to show a little heart and soul on that day. We beat a great A&M team that
started this streak.  
And it's continued. It's continued because of amazing senior leadership from
Lyndsey and Megan and Abby, and it's continued because our team has shown an
ability to be resilient when at times we weren't earlier in the year, making
big plays, making shots. People contributing.  
That's what I told them before the game. We won seven games in a row before
this game. Different opponents, different venues, but it's the same heart, the
same team, the same everything. But every single person has contributed in a
different way. And that's how you win at this level and that's how you win at
the end.  
But the bottom line is I have three great seniors. It's seniors that get it
done at the end of the season and they're doing it for us right now.  
  
Q. Bill, just talk about the three-pointers. I think you had your season low
three-pointers against them the first time and they were 10 of 20 at one
point.  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: We had such a hard time getting into our offensive. We
knew that. They don't let you enter the ball to the wing. We tried to do
everything off a dribble entry to the wing. Try to spread them out. Drive and
kick. We had a hard time getting to the basket.  
So it's a part of our game but we knew tonight that it was going to be
something we had to do a little bit more. They were switching a lot of
screens. When we did dribble drive. We felt there was some opportunity to
kick, and I thought we did a good job of that. And we made some huge runs at
huge times. And sometimes you get lulled asleep and start shooting 3s all the
time, but that's a big part of our offense.  
Because their defense is so good, we couldn't get to the basket. So the shot
that was available was the 3. And luckily we made enough of them tonight.  
  
Q. Megan, the three-pointers were one thing but talk about the defense you
guys played tonight. I think they scored one point in the last six minutes
until their last basket. Was that as good of defense as you've played in a
while?  
MEGAN RONHOVDE: I think so. The K State game a couple days ago I think speaks
to some of what we did. We struggled to score in that game in the first half.
And it was the defense that won that game for us.  
I think that's one thing that's really special about this team is that you
know at certain moments of the game we can really tighten up and lock down and
get some key stops.  
And it really -- I mean that last six minutes, that was critical for us.  
  
Q. Lindsay, I wouldn't want to imply it's a good thing you've gotten hurt a
lot in the last two years, but because you missed so much time and Heather was
forced to play so much point guard and Alison had to play a lot of point
guard, when you went out with your fourth foul tonight, did you feel more
comfortable about the fact you might be able to keep the lead?  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: I was confident with Heather and Alison. The three of us have
a close relationship. We spend a lot of time looking over plays and talking
and stuff. When I went out with my fourth and knew the ball was in their
hands, I was the one with six turnovers, so it might have been a good thing
that I was out for that last stretch in the end. I was completely confident in
them. They made big plays down the stretch.  
And I'll be the biggest cheerleader whether I'm playing, sitting or since I'm
such a good defensive player, I had four fouls, whatever that may be.  
  
Q. Lindsay, all of you guys, can you talk about the three-pointers, the
confidence you guys had going. I think you made eight straight between the end
of the half. Was it just feeding off of everybody?  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: Yes, I think so. We talk about it a lot even in drills and
practice, when one person starts hitting, another person starts hitting, and
we kind of ride a lot on that momentum.  
I think Megan hit a very critical one in the first half. She kind of got the
cobwebs off her three-point shot out here in Oklahoma City. That was a good
sign for all of us. And Alison hit a big one. We each hit a big one. And so I
think we just -- we relied so much on momentum and a lot of that does come
from our three-point shots.  
  
Q. Such a big part of their game obviously is the fast break, and you guys
held the zero fast break points. Would you talk about really just kind of
staying with them and playing their game a little bit.  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: The two things we talked about defensively was obviously
stopping transition. And even though we had 19 turnovers, there weren't many
in the open court. Most of the turnovers were on the dead ball, the travel. We
throw it out of bounds. We even told them if there was any doubt take a five-
second count and go guard in the half court and offensive rebounding.  
And they got 15, which isn't bad but we didn't foul a lot. So that was the big
part of the playing, was do not let our offense become their offense. And
that's so often two years ago when we played them at A&M, they scored 54
points, I think 41-43 we were offensive rebounds and turnovers.  
The turn overs we had tonight 19 is too many. I don't think they were bad
turnovers the way the game plan went. If you make them score in the half court
we felt we had a chance if we could rebound and I thought defensively we were
very good from start to finish.  
  
Q. Bill, the first time you played zone against them and it really worked,
did it two things, did it give you a chance to -- I hate to use the word rest,
but to be able to take a little bit of time off in the zone seemed like it
frustrated them again?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: I don't think there's any question that playing zone kept
our kids' legs underneath them. If they don't score in transition they run a
lot of really good stuff, but it takes some time to run it. They reverse the
ball and they screen.  
So, yes, you're not technically rested but you are a little bit because you're
not running through screens. You're not chasing people around screens. So I do
think it helped. And offensively you know we didn't try and slow the game
down. Might have looked like it. We were trying to get it into an offense.  
But the zone allowed us to keep people in front of us and try and stay out of
foul trouble. But I don't think there's any question that that's the way we
felt we had to play them but at the same time it allowed our kids to keep
their legs underneath them because we were subbing a little bit more, had some
foul trouble early. I do think it impacted how we could play. And luckily for
them, that's a good preparation for us.  
  
Q. Bill, without question the three-pointers was a huge impact, but once you
get the league, they catch you, you don't get another three-pointer the rest
of the game. Do you think the three-pointers maybe set up your inside game
because they had to come out so far and they did help you in the lane down the
stretch?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: I don't think there's any question because we weren't
getting anything in the post. Nicky made three baskets, Toccara got a couple
good looks at the free throw line, a great back cut on a play there, probably
nicest play of the night. You never know when someone breaks the game open,
but that was a great play.  
So yeah, when you're trying to stay in the game and people are making 3s on
you, you want to extend your defense. You want to extend your defense. When
you do that, obviously you're going to have a little more options in the post.  
Even though we didn't get a lot, you're right, we got them at the right times.
And I think the 3-ball made a real difference for that.  
  
Q. Bill, would you talk about last night. You needed everything Lyndsey
could have as a player, dramatic and everything. But tonight the entire team,
everybody had something in this one?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: You're exactly right. And during the timeouts, a couple
of the timeouts, Coach kept telling them, Lyndsey did it last night, we need
to help her. I believe that honestly. She kept telling the kids Lyndsey got us
to this game, now got to get her to the next game.  
That's what good teams do. That's what teams do that are still playing. I
think that's exactly how it went.  
Austin and Heather did a great job in keeping us in offense and we made enough
big shots to impact the game, but that was a big, big part of it. And Lyndsey
only played 28 minutes. If you would have said to me before the game she's
only going to play 28 minutes and be in foul trouble, I would have been real
concerned about us winning the game.  
But we were able to stay fairly efficient offensively and allow us to score
enough points.  
  
Q. Bill, when you have to play three games in three days, there's no doubt
you need a productive bench. It was Nisleit on the first game and Ezell and
Rachel Pierson these last couple days. In general how big was that for you?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: Our bench people have been very, very good. That's why
you win games. It doesn't look like -- Nisleit plays 14 minutes. I put her in
the position in the middle of the zone. She hadn't practiced it ever, ever,
but she went out and did it because we were in foul trouble, Megan turned her
ankle.  
Our kids are doing everything. We have six starters, seven starters on this
team. I really believe that. And Nis is getting to that seven and a half,
eight spot.  
So you don't win at this level, you don't win in three games in three days.
You don't win 25 games without a lot of help from a lot of people.  
So I appreciate you asking, because it's nice that those kids get a little
recognition, too.  
  
Q. Lyndsey, are you going to work on the chest bump a little bit? And then,
Alison, if you could kind of talk about -- you're obviously from Australia. I
know you spent last year in the United States. But this is your first Big 12
tournament, playing with a couple seniors. If you could talk about what it's
been like for you and just playing with these guys.  
ALISON LACEY: Probably just completely new experience. This team has taught me
a lot of what the Big 12 is about, what Iowa State is about. And I think they
really emphasize on how special this team is and how special our fans are.
They've done everything toward the team and me.  
  
Q. Lyndsey, what do you have left for Saturday and who are you routing for
tonight?  
(Laughter)  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: I choose not to answer. Can I say no comment?  
(Laughter).  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: I'm not rooting for anyone. What do I have left for Saturday?
I played 28 minutes. I'm only 21 years old. And at this point in the season,
it's about adrenalin. It's about knowing that I have however many games left
and I'm playing in maybe the biggest game of my career.  
So I'll have everything in the tank and I'm excited about it. And I'll be
fine.  
  
Q. Bill, I was going to ask, you were on the receiving end of another hug
from Sherri Coale tonight?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: Yes. Yes, I was.  
(Laughter).  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: She didn't hug my wife, I'll guarantee you.  
MEGAN RONHOVDE: Smart man.  
(Laughter)  
Q. Coach, just your thoughts, compare and contrast what you'll face on
Saturday, first Baylor and then Oklahoma, in your experience with both those
teams.  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: Our experience with both teams was a disaster. We were
not in either game. I think both teams present different challenges. I think
Oklahoma obviously with Courtney Paris, and they've changed their lineup with
Plumley and Thompson for the first time.  
With Baylor, they shot the 3 ball great against us. They hadn't shot it great,
but they did. Bernice Mosby is I think one of the best players in the country.  
They both present challenges similar to A&M as far as their athleticism their
ability to defend.  
Oklahoma, obviously Courtney Paris is unique. If it's Oklahoma, it's a road
game. If it's Baylor, it's a neutral court game. So that's the way we'll
approach it.  
But we're excited to be playing. And whoever that is, we're going to do the
best we can and represent our university and see what happens.  
  
Q. Megan, was there any time where you guys -- there was a lot made about
third game in three days. Were there any times where you were worried the legs
were going out? Or did you always feel you had enough as a team to get to the
end of this game?  
MEGAN RONHOVDE: We talked about that last night after the game against
Nebraska. And at this point in the season and what's at stake and what we have
to play for, I don't think you can use fatigue as an excuse.  
Minus this game, Saturday's game, Lindsay said it's going to be the biggest
game of our careers. How you cannot be ready to come out and play as a
basketball player at this point in the season and what we're playing for, that
was really kind of a nonissue for us tonight.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MODERATOR: Give us a quick assessment of tonight's game and upcoming opponent
on Saturday.  
COACH SHERRI COALE: I'm proud of our kids, the way we battled. Give Baylor
credit. Played extremely well, shot the ball extremely well from the three-
point line and we were able to stave that off and make the plays down the
stretch, get the rebounds and stops and showed a lot of character.  
Shot out to Kendra Moore, found her minutes in the first half were absolutely
huge for us. I know she's not here with us, but her minutes were absolutely
huge.  
And just really proud of our kids. Proud of the effort. Gritty game, and we
did what we had to do down the stretch.  
  
Q. Sherry, every game obviously gets bigger for your freshman point guard.
Talk about how she performed on this stage.  
COACH SHERRI COALE: Good and bad. She had obviously some huge 3s, huge 3s in
transition, just completely changes the complexion of transition defense for
our opponents.  
Some forces. Tried to hit some home runs, feeding the post a little too early.
A little bit antsy but played her way through it. Came back and made big plays
and did what we needed her to do in the second half, and her performance in
the second half was just huge.  
  
Q. Sherry, this was like a heavy weight fight in some ways, especially in
the second half when they made their run and yet they only got one small lead
and the rest of the time you countered every time. You've got to like how your
team just wouldn't give in and wouldn't let them build any kind of lead at
all.  
COACH SHERRI COALE: I think that's a little bit of a reflection of hunger
that's borne of going through post-season last year and things not finishing
up the way we wanted them to finish up.  
There's just a toughness that you develop that is borne from going through
those situations, and I was proud of that. We did some silly things to let
them get back into the game and give them credit they made shots. They made
plays but, boy, we just handed them the basketball a few times. And you can't
do that against quality teams.  
We were able to stave it off and do good things down the stretch. But
shouldn't have ever been in that situation.  
  
Q. This is for Courtney and for Jenna. Can you talk about -- Jenna, can you
talk about what you saw on the little skip path that you threw from the top
down? You know the play I'm talking about? About four minutes left, that got
to Courtney, ended up being a pretty big basket. Can you talk about what you
saw there and then kind of a tough pass to corral. I wondered what you saw,
Courtney, as well, too?  
JENNA PLUMLEY: First thing, Coach said this is a big play for us to come in
and execute, nothing that I had to force, but I felt like I knew Courtney was
going to get her numbers to the basketball. Every time I see Courtney, no
matter where I throw it, she's going to get it. And I seen her there and it
was one of those passes you see and you hope it gets there.  
But that was a big play that she came up with, that she -- she has such great
hands and she was able to handle the ball and get an easy layup.  
COURTNEY PARIS: I thought what I saw was an opportunity to make a big play and
kind of give us momentum going in the last few minutes. And Jenna Plumley is a
great passer. Complete front line. I've never seen anyone play like that
before. But the backside was open and Jenna was able to get the ball there.  
  
Q. My question is for Coach and for Courtney. Coach mentioned about Kendra
and then you got Miss Plumley there as the guard getting the ball to you. How
important is it that you're a balanced team? And also, Coach, about the
competition of the Big 12 with these games we've seen on this week?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: I think point guard play is essential down the stretch.
You gotta be able to handle the basketball, make plays and I should probably
receive most of the credit for some of the turnovers in the second half. I
think I tried to organize too much. I should have let them go a little bit
more.  
We were trying to get some isolations and we were trying to exploit the way
they were guarding Courtney. I probably put them in too many structured
situations. They're smart and know how to play basketball. I leaned over to
Chelsi at one point second half and I said I need to let you guys alone, play
for a little bit. You know what to do. That's why we practice.  
I take a few of those, I think Kendra and Jenna together handled it. It was
not an easy job tonight. They put all kinds of pressure on the basketball all
night long and never go away. So it's not an easy job regardless of who is up
there running it.  
Second part of your question, Big 12 in general. Incredibly tough. We don't
have a bottom half. Most leagues have a top and a chasm and a few teams at the
bottom. We just don't. There's just great, great parity. It was revealed this
week in the play. Iowa State is playing for a championship. They come in at
what, five seed? I'm not sure. Is that right? Number five. So obviously a lot
of parity up and down.  
  
Q. Sherri and also for some of the players, but you mentioned Kendra, but
also on a night when Amanda and Leah and Erin did not shoot it well, you still
showed a lot of depth. Ashley had a great game. So talk about that, the depth
and also Jenna and her first Big 12 tournament. And I would like you to
respond. Apparently this doesn't bother you, this stage, Big 12 tournament.  
COACH SHERRI COALE: I think depth is critical. We've known all year long going
into the season, something we talked about a lot that would really pay off
down the stretch. And the way the season has sort of wound down, it's given us
an opportunity to develop that depth and it's depth that has some experience.
Jenna has played under a lot of pressure these last few games in the month of
February as we were trying to share a piece of that conference championship,
and that puts her in a position to be able to excel on a stage such as this.  
JENNA PLUMLEY: It's been really exciting. Everything that's came to me, it's
been a great opportunity to come out and I feel like the players that surround
me are just great players and I feel like any given night anybody can be hot
with Courtney on my team, all the shooters, with Chelsi and Leah, anybody can
get a 3. It's so much fun playing together and beating Oklahoma.  
  
Q. This is for the players. I know you played loose and that would probably
be your answer. But I'm curious about the pressure. Earlier in the day, A &M
loses, and most people think it's going to be a cakewalk for you to go on.
Second half you had a chance for it to be a bigger lead at half time, and all
of a sudden they turned around and had the momentum and took the lead. Did you
sense at any time any -- being tight?   
COURTNEY PARIS: I don't think anyone thinks the Big 12 is a cakewalk, and Iowa
State showed that today. The league is getting so much better and it's really
good. Never know what's going to happen. Gotta show up to play. Baylor was
tough and they made a good come back, but we just stayed poised and stuck with
it and got the lead back.  
  
Q. Ashley, you've had back-to-back really solid games yesterday and today,
the last two days. I mean, sometimes post-season brings out the best in
players. Do you feel your game going to a whole other level just because you
know it's post-season and you know what's in front of you from here on out?  
ASHLEY PARIS: Yeah. I think it's crunch time now. Every game is pretty much
for the next. I feel if I'm consistent and make sure I get eight or nine
rebounds a game and try to score double figures and just be a threat out there
that it will help our team be able to be successful.  
  
Q. Coach, talk a little bit about the, I guess hometown feel you had here.
Great crowd support for you guys tonight.  
COACH SHERRI COALE: Absolutely. We needed it in the second half. Our fans were
so terrific. They so respond to our players at one point Leah Rush just raised
one hand and everybody went crazy. It's a huge advantage obviously. Our fans
have been fantastic. I love the fact that it's convenient and 're but I think
they would have followed us just about anywhere.  
  
Q. Coach, in the second half, we forgot to mention about Welch, how well she
did a great job of coming in here hitting those shots. It was a key run when
they made the 10 for 2 run.  
COACH SHERRI COALE: Absolutely. Chelsi was terrific and even the plays she
didn't score on were things that really affected their defense. She had a cut
missed a layup. Had another great cut, didn't finish, kicked it back out. But
those were things that we needed to do to attack them. It changed the rhythm
and cadence and gave us a little bit of momentum offensively.  
  
Q. Courtney, you said their defense. Did you mean because of the way like
Rachel and Danielle were almost laying on you?  
COURTNEY PARIS: Yes. I mean that's -- I don't know. That was definitely
something I had to adjust to at the very beginning of the game. I've never
seen anyone just turn and keep their hands up and breathe in your face. I
don't know. I thought it was kind of interesting. I don't know. I've never
seen that before. I told Rachel, this is strange defense.  
I don't know. It was different. Just had to adjust to it a little bit. I think
Coach Coale did a good job helping me through that.  
  
Q. Talk about the Iowa State matchup, how unique, and also Coach Fennelly
has been bragging about the hug.  
COACH SHERRI COALE: He waited around and gave me one, too. So turnabout is
fair play. I'm happy for Bill. He's a dear friend and done a magnificent job
with that team this year. They're spunky and don't go away and terrific
shooters. And Lindsay Balweg is probably one of the most underrated guards in
America. I know her well. We recruited her hard. So that relationship goes
back a ways, and she's had a remarkable career at Iowa State. But it's been a
long time since we played those guys. And so get the film back out and study a
little bit and adjust to a completely different kind of game. They're so
different than A&M and Baylor and Texas, which it feels like that's all we've
played for the last three or four weeks.  
So it will be an adjustment. But we're looking forward to the opportunity and
happy that we're playing.  
  
Q. Sherri, Courtney mentioned remaining poised after Baylor made their
comeback but you guys had committed a number of turnovers in a row. Seemed
like you had to more regain it. How were you able to do that and you sort of
had to seemingly overcome yourselves. So what sort of happened the second half
to get it back on track?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: Well, we've had magnificent practices. How many times have
we shot ourselves in the foot and had to figure it out? A bunch. You watched
all these games, Clay.  
So you know what? You learn from it and you figure it out, and they did. They
didn't go crazy. We were shooting ourselves in the foot and instead of going
crazy, they just decided, ah, let's stop that. Let's talk to each other and go
score. And it works real well. Simple game.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about the defensive job that Leah and
Ashley did on Mosby?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: Yes, with help from their friends. Early on particularly
we did a great job of just sort of being around where she didn't have any
room, anywhere to go. That's what we did for 40 minutes. And I don't know that
we did that good of a job at it in the second half. We got so worried about
Darrett and Morrow making 3s that we were a little hesitant to get in there
and crowd it up, and it's when Bernice got loose for a few.  
But overall Leah Rush battled. Whoever she's guarding is going to have a hard
time catching the basketball. She's going to make them work for every single
catch they get and she's a tough match there for Bernice.  
  
Q. The championship, you're back in another title game. How does that feel,
Courtney, Jenna? You've never experienced that. Ashley, you have. Just talk
about Oklahoma basketball and being back in a title game where you seem to be
landing in a familiar spot.  
JENNA PLUMLEY: I don't know. My year and a half year that's what we do. It's
fun. And Coach talked about all the time you want to play well and get the
seniors the championship game and that's what we were able to do tonight.  
ASHLEY PARIS: It's exciting. I think in the locker room they were talking
about most of our seniors are -- we have a possibility of winning their third
conference championship or tournament championship, and that's a huge deal.
It's just exciting. You expect great things from this program and we have the
high expectations and winning tournament and conference championships is one
of them.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

### [A'Quonesia Franklin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13857)

### [Danielle Gant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17006)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Aggies from Texas A&M. Coach Blair, your
comments about the season's game and your thoughts about upcoming opponents in
the post-season.  
COACH GARY BLAIR: Folks, this is where we were last year when it was a little
different feeling. We came in here and lost 53-52 to Baylor. Top 10 team. And
we felt we gave a great account of ourselves and the ball would have bounced
another way maybe we would have won.  
Tonight we got outplayed. I don't think we got outplayed last year against
Baylor. It's just one team scored one more point than what we did. And this
ball game here we got outplayed and a lot of it was the last four minutes of
the first half. I think we went 0-6, something like that, we're three shots
inside, bunny shots that we didn't convert. Three jumpers that we either
forced or didn't make.  
And then they made their little run at the end and hit a couple of key shots.  
But we still went into half time. We felt we could make some corrections. I
put in a new zone play. It worked to perfection. Danielle just got her shot
blocked from behind. It was wide open. We came back to that play later and TK
scored in the thing, and I thought we were right in it.  
Then we were not forcing turnovers on the press, so we gave that up for a
while and tried to play half court defense but we kept coming off of the 3s.  
We were told to stay with your girl, make them score to highlight them, the
shot. Invariably we had to come off and come over here and try to help on
Peter. And Paul was shooting 3 from the corner.  
But they're kids. They know what to do. You don't give those kids those shots.
It doesn't matter if they shot 10 out of 28. It's the shots that they took
were good shots and wide open shots, and eventually they were going to shoot
enough 3s and all they had to do was make 33% of them and it was hard for us
to catch up. We didn't do a good job of attacking the zone at times. When we
did get it inside, they double teamed us and our post players didn't kick it
out and they traveled.  
We've got to work on that. We've seen it before. We did a better job. We've
got 15 offensive rebounds, we converted one. We were 0-3 first half in
transition opportunities where we could have had the easy basket, 0-3 we had
nine in the second half. It's a game of numbers.  
If a team shoots 45%, 38 and 83 from the line, and we shoot 36, 33, and 37, we
get outrebounded by one and we only win the turnover battle by five, even
sports writers can figure that out, the best team won.  
And that's just the way it is. But we're going to regroup. We're going to look
ourselves in the mirror and the head coach will look in the mirror first and
figure out how to teach this game a little bit better, how we can play a
little bit better, and how we can play and be a little bit smarter as we play.  
I've got a great ball club and I've got great young ladies right here, but
tonight we got team -- beat by a team, we knew exactly what they were going to
do, and they just executed better than us. Give them credit give me an inch in
your paper and give them nine inches and the story is done.  
  
Q. You talked about regrouping in this game, basically the season you won
six games, now you're the national champion. A'Quonesia, this will be for you
after Coach Blair answers this. Is that what you tell them, it's a bad taste
in your mouth after losing in the Big 12. All we have to do is win six in a
row, we've done that so far, the attitude forward?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: We're resilient. We can bounce back from anything. Won 19 at
Texas, came back won 11 out of our next 12. We got beat at Iowa State, came
back and won all ours down the stretch against the Baylors and the Oklahomas
and the Texases down the stretch.  
We got beat by a team that just played better today. So we will bounce back.
And I I'll tell you what you look at these girls right here, they might not be
ready to see me in practice tomorrow, but they're ready to go practice and
correct their mistakes because they've got tremendous pride.  
We're not Cinderella. We're a top 25 team that's on a mission, and we plan on
going pretty far into the playoffs and we will see a 3-2 zone the very first
game that we play, just like we did against TCU last year, and we will find a
way to beat it.  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: As coach said, we'll take it from this experience, did a
great job on the defensive end keeping us outside, not letting us penetrate.
We'll go to practice and work on what we need to work on and be ready for the
NCAA.  
  
Q. When you look at the Big 12 conference, this shows the NCAA how tough
this conference really is because you got really six or seven strong teams and
your team is right there in the thick of everything.  
COACH GARY BLAIR: I think you definitely have six teams that should be in the
NCAA playoffs, and hopefully the committee realized this wasn't an upset
tonight. This wasn't an upset.  
And it's just they're that good. When Iowa State beat Nebraska, that wasn't an
upset. When we beat Oklahoma and when we beat Baylor, those were not upsets.
And that's how good this league is and that's how good the coaches are in this
league. So we're just going to, we're just going to go back put our heads up
high, not point fingers and look ourselves in the mirror and we're going to go
to work. And we're going to get it done and we're going to have a hell of a
ride. Monday we'll have a selection show because we know we're not a bubble
team and everybody will come pat us on the back again, tell us how great we
are and we're going to start all over again.  
And I guarantee you, you will make it past the first round this year.  
  
Q. Gary, do you think you ran into one of the hottest teams really in the
country?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: Sure, I started that streak, okay? All right. I know good
and well, I'm going to be at their homecoming game next year, I guarantee you.
But I don't have to go to AMs next year. That's the best thing; the north
doesn't like playing the south twice. I don't like going to AMs twice
particularly when it's zero degrees. Sorry back there. It was zero degrees, 10
degree wind chill factor. That is a great atmosphere. I really enjoy playing
the larger the crowd, the better our team plays. Good crowd here tonight.  
  
Q. Just how hard are they to defend when they're hitting on all cylinders
like that from really four or five different players on the court can shoot
the 3?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: I think they're hard to defend because they can dribble
drive whereas a couple of teams that we played recently could not dribble
drive and attack us off the bounce.  
They can attack off the bounce and maybe not finish, but they'll free somebody
up and they will continue running their offense. They are a great 25-second
offensive team. We're playing great defense. You're seeing us going all over
the floor. The crowd is getting up to them. We're denying this. We're doing
this. We've got ball pressure and then all of a sudden they're still running
their stuff and they make a shot at the end. That's coaching, and that's
discipline on a team knowing what their limitations are and what they do they
do well.  
What they don't do well, obviously we hadn't exploited it.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about the number one target, I guess the target on
your chest being the number one seed here and then for Danielle, could you
kind of address I guess particularly at this point in coming back to your
hometown here and those two questions.  
COACH GARY BLAIR: I don't think a target is on us because I don't think we've
earned the respect yet to be saying we're the number one seed. We just
happened to fall in it. Oklahoma playing at home was basically the number one
seed. 11,000 fans there last night.  
We're a damn good team, but I don't think we had the target on us, but I think
people have prepared better for us this year, and that -- I got everybody back
for next year again. And we relish that opportunity. I'd rather finish number
one every time.  
But I'm really going to miss not playing Saturday because we wanted to make
that next step. This is a step where we got off the bus last year. When you
see that big wall out there that's blue and all the teams up there, I had the
marketing guy ready. I had the TV guy ready I said, hey, I want that wall
shot. That's a great idea.  
The trouble is they've already printed Iowa State on that wall.  
DANIELLE GANT: Like he said, I guess they out hustled us the whole game; but
other than that coming back playing in front of my family and friends was just
something that I loved to do this year.  
  
Q. A lot of times you guys win the hustle point, loose balls, rebounds,
things like that. Did you all feel like you were winning those tonight?  
DANIELLE GANT: At a point in time. The first half, I think Iowa State wanted
it more than we wanted. I think the second half we improved, more the hustle
plays.  
  
Q. A'Quonesia, you said they took away the penetration. What were they able
to do differently these last few games against you?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: They were pushing from a 2-3 to a 3-2 zone. It was hard
to penetrate from the top of the key. So the one thing you have to do is keep
moving the ball, reverse the ball, try to get it inside.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the press working and you talked about them
having a 25-second offense wasn't that kind of slowing down, they couldn't run
that offense for quite as long and it seemed like you came back a little bit
during that time?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: We did. We came back, and you're right they did have that
long run of their offense. And you know I think that's what makes sometimes
the men's game so good because they have a 35-second clock. And they're able
to run a lot of stuff even if they're first stuff.  
In the women's game, if you come straight down, it really changes up your
offensive scheme if something doesn't work, because that's when you gotta have
creators and screeners against the zone, and we didn't screen the zone very
well today.  
If we would have dribbled attack and got A'Quonesia and TK through those gaps,
I think we could have converted or made the pass. But we tried to go east and
west and pass around it a lot, or try to run the perfect play. Well, the
perfect play is not going to beat a zone.  
You have to be consistent. When we went to the triple post, that's the offense
that's been working the best for us this year against the 3-2. And we didn't
get the ball in the hands of Gant enough.  
Then when you look at my two starting posts, they got seven rebounds between
them. That's a telling sign, because those kids are very athletic and pretty
doggone good. But seven rebounds, when there's enough misses out there, that's
not enough either.  
I'd like to thank Oklahoma City first for what they've done with this
tournament. You've got an area here that will be into the rotation. And it's a
very good place. And hopefully we'll get back to Dallas pretty quick, too.
Thank you, y'all.

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

### [Jhasmin Player](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16969)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome the Bears from Baylor University. Coach
Mulkey-Robertson, would you like to make a few comments? Congratulations on
tonight's win, and comments about tonight's game and your next opponent,
please.  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Thank you. I would I would like to make a couple
of statements about this particular basketball team at Baylor. They hadn't won
a national championship. We have two from that team still remaining. But
they've done some pretty amazing things this year and I'd like to share those
with you and make sure you put them down.  
They broke a Big 12 single season block record tonight, from what I've been
told. No other Baylor team has done that. There's only three teams that have
more top 50 wins in the country than Baylor. Do you know who they are?
Tennessee, Duke and Yukon.  
That's pretty impressive, guys, for a young group.  
Now, to talk about tonight's game, as you all follow the games, men's and
women's side, you always see upsets. There's only four of us remaining. We
finished third in the league. We haven't been beaten this year by any team we
should lose to. Every loss we've had has been to a ranked opponent. So I'm
proud of them.  
We understand what lies ahead tomorrow. It's not going to be any fun playing
Oklahoma in their backyard here in Oklahoma City, but I do have a great
appreciation for the fans that I saw here tonight supporting their teams.  
And with that, I'll let you guys ask me some questions.  
  
Q. Coach, did it feel pretty good to get the lead and not only get a chance
to rest your starters but give some of those young girls a chance to play?  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: The more we can play our freshmen and the players
that contribute off the bench for our team, the better. And I thought we were
able to do that early in the game. And sometimes when you do that, you lose
the flow of the game. You lose leads, and I thought tonight we were able to
hang on to the leads and extend it at times.  
  
Q. Kim, it's been a week since you guys had those two straight losses. I
know they were tough losses. Was it good to see them come out and really play
well both ends of the floor?  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Those two losses were to who? Two pretty good
teams. I hate the schedule fell the way it did because we ended up playing
those teams back to back twice this year.  
My personality as a coach is don't ever let them get too high. Don't ever let
them get too low. Keep it in perspective and keep working.  
And I thought they responded and did just that, and I thought it started on
the defensive end tonight. I thought in those losses at times we got
frustrated and we totally forgot the team concept on defense when we would get
beat in a one-on-one situation. And I thought tonight we got back to the
basics defensively. I thought Jessica Morrow quietly set the tone fighting for
screens and just being a leader out there for us.  
  
Q. Kim, what's it going to take to beat OU tomorrow?  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Courtney probably getting sick tonight, not being
able to play. Couple of them get in foul trouble and foul out early. The fans
not show up because they're caught in traffic. I could name a lot of things.  
Look, guys, nobody has figured it out really yet on how to guard Courtney and
how to beat them other than Texas A&M and -- who else beat them this year in
our league? Texas.  
We're going to do the best we can. We are going to fight and claw and
hopefully try to keep it as close as we can with the understanding that we
know we're not supposed to win. But we weren't supposed to win the national
championship either.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about I guess the rivalry that's starting to
develop between you and Oklahoma and I guess how it's the last chapter in that
rivalry with that loss last week in Norman.  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: I don't look at our rivalry with Oklahoma any
different than I do with Texas or Texas A&M. They may, but I don't. It's just
another Big 12 game and they happen to be the champions this year. And they've
had a great year.  
  
Q. I have one for Bernice and then one for Jhasmin. Bernice, what are the
benefits in the tournament to get some rest tonight, get them to watch the
second half, be a cheerleader? Tournaments night after night, it's a benefit.
What do you think it'll do for you to get some rest tonight?  
BERNICE MOSBY: I think it's important for me to get some rest knowing that
we're going to play Oklahoma, just to rest my legs. And I'm just happy for
this team, that the freshmen and people who came off the bench came in,
stepped up big for me to get rest on the bench. When you get rest in a game
like this, it's very -- it helps you in a niche game just to have legs under
you and try to play even harder.  
  
Q. Kim, a lot of people would say that's a finals outfit. What goes into
your decision-making to wear an outfit into the quarter finals tonight?  
(Laughter)  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: What in the hell does that have to do with
basketball?  
(Laughter)  
BERNICE MOSBY: My coach looked good tonight, y'all.  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: I don't know, man. I just thought that was good
enough to wear. I don't know.  
(Laughter).  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: Would you ask those questions of Bobbie Knight?
You wouldn't dare.  
  
Q. This is for the players. Did Coach kind of challenge y'all to step it up
on defense? Maybe just talk a little bit about the defense tonight.  
JHASMIN PLAYER: That's exactly what she did. We got to practice this week and
worked extremely hard on the defensive end, mainly on the defensive end of the
floor. I think it showed a little bit today. There are always things we could
improve on, so we're going to continue to try to improve and grow.  
But I think we took a little step forward and we're going to keep going that
way.  
BERNICE MOSBY: I think we did good on defensive end. Danielle came in off the
bench and blocked shots and JB did good also. I think the last couple of days
in practice was very intense for us.  
I mean, there's still a lot of things we need to improve on, like helping and
rebounding. But I think we did a good job today and hopefully we can continue
that tomorrow with Oklahoma.  
  
Q. This is for Jhasmin. Coach, you can second on this. Talk about the good,
not so good about facing Oklahoma, the fact that you played them just not that
long ago and didn't do so well. At the same time, you're facing them again.
The good, not so good of facing them.  
JHASMIN PLAYER: As our coach said, the good is no one expects us to win. When
no one expects you to win, you have nothing to lose. So we're just going to go
out there and play as hard as we can.  
I mean, there's not a not so good in it. We know every team is going to come
out here and compete against us every single night. They'll do the same thing.
Tonight Kansas competed just like OU will tomorrow. Kansas doesn't have a
Courtney Paris, but we'll compete tomorrow and night and try to stay ahead and
stay close.  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: She said it beautifully.  
JHASMIN PLAYER: Thank you, Coach.  
  
Q. Kim, for clarification, we have asked Knight why he always wears a red
sweater.  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: What did he tell you?  
  
Q. He didn't give us a good answer. But tomorrow night how tough is it to
play in this environment? Had 10,000 here tonight. I assume it will be more
tomorrow night. How tough is that considering they're tough enough on a
neutral court?  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: This really isn't a neutral court to them. And the
tough part is not that your kids are affected by it. It's how it gives them a
sense of energy and boost and when they're fatigued maybe they'll make that
shot instead of shooting short or when they need a defensive stop or big
rebound. When you've got that much noise and that many people cheering for
you, I think it just gives you a little bit extra effort. More than anything,
it's like with any home court.  
And I think that's probably the only disadvantage is that you're outnumbered
fan-wise.  
  
Q. Is that particularly relevant in a tournament back to back days or not?  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: I don't know that --  
  
Q. Seemed like energy would matter more in a tournament where you don't have
breaks.  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: They're so good. I don't know that fatigue or
anything like that plays a factor for those guys. They've got enough depth and
people coming off the bench that fatigue is not going to matter.  
  
Q. Coach, did fatigue matter for Kansas tonight? Did they seem like a tired
team having played --  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: I don't know. I was so focused on our team and I'm
not sure I can answer that.  
  
Q. Kim, you talked about being able to extend leads at times. Freshman kind
of struggled a little down the stretch. Is it good to find something to kind
of build on even if it's a negative thing?  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: I thought, Jerry, I'm used to your negative
questions. You live in the same town. I didn't think there was anything
negative about our freshman play tonight. I thought everything they did was a
positive. If you look at the staff, I thought they just took a very few bad
shots. I thought they gave up very few rebounds I thought everything they did
with the exception of Latara. She couldn't get in the flow. She still did some
good things out there tonight.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the freshmen, how nice was it for them to be able to
cut their teeth in a post-season setting tonight?  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: The more experience, the more play, the more
experience, the better we become and the better they become, and it was good
for them. It was good they got in there early. It was good that they did some
things early to become confident. And it was good everybody got to play.  
  
Q. Kim, there's absolutely no appropriate time for this question. But there
were some developments today, your name is going to be connected to the LSU
job. Can you comment on whether you would be interested at all in that
vacancy?  
COACH KIM MULKEY-ROBERTSON: There's a lot of jobs open. Florida is open.
Arkansas is open. LSU is open. All I know is what you guys report.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2007

  

### [Kathy McConnell-
Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14195)

### [Jackie McFarland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16379)

### [Hannah Skildum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16941)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MODERATOR: We're now joined by Colorado. Coach, your comments about the game
and your thoughts about this afternoon's performance.  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: Well, it wasn't pretty. But it wasn't for lack of
effort or a true commitment to coming in here and trying to beat A&M. But you
gotta give all the credit to A&M. They're a phenomenal team.  
They're the type of team that makes it impossible to run your stuff. They
denied the wing entries. They denied the post entries. They put an amazing
amount of pressure on the basketball. Their depth is exceptional.  
And there's really no weak spot in their top six players. So for us we felt
like our strength was inside. But we really struggled to get the ball to the
wings. We struggled to get the ball inside and really their pressure was too
much for us.  
  
Q. Kathy, will you just expand on even getting the ball touches for Jackie
was pretty hard. And they really, I think it was Reado, you know, kind of
undersized but did a pretty good job on her.  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: I think it was a pretty physical game. And it's not
one that Jackie particularly loves. But I thought they did a great job of
fronting her, not allowing touches, and it was very difficult for us to get
it, to lob it when she did have position because the ball pressure was great.
Our guards kept picking it up. You know, we weren't just trying to get the
ball to Jackie, there were a lot of things that I thought they took away from
us. Jackie was part of our options. We needed Kara, Jasmina struggled a little
bit on the offense to score, and with that type of pressure we just took bad
shots. We took them bad and we took them early.  
  
Q. Kathy, could you expound on guard play not being able to get the extra
passes. You mentioned it earlier. But also a little impatient on waiting for
the wings to clear and making passes just to get the ball into the post?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: You know, when we try to do a lot of dribble entries,
we try to change up our sets a little bit. I think which leads to the lack of
assists. We didn't do a good job of putting the ball in people's hands. Any
time we scored, it was really off of penetration. It was off of an offensive
board or it was just, you know, working somebody to get to the rim.  
They're good. They wait on top of your screens, whether you got a double stack
high, double stack low. Inverted screen. It doesn't matter. They'll switch it.
They'll get up on the wings and denying. Whitney is not the best at entering
the ball into the wing to begin with, yet she's better full court than Susie
Powers would have been.  
So it was really a Catch-22. If you have Susie at the point where you're
struggling to get it up, you have Whitney at the point, we're going to get it
up. But at the half court, we just weren't able to didn't execute. They're
quick, they overplay, they deny.  
  
Q. Jackie, can you sort of expand on what Coach was saying, do you almost
feel like sometimes playing Texas A &M you keep trying and trying almost like
they force you to try to do more than you can even do?   
JACKIE McFARLUND: I don't necessarily think I'm forced to do more than I can.
I think we struggle when we can't get the ball inside and use our
inside/outside game, and that's not just me. That's Kara, too, and some of our
other posts.  
And we never got set into our offense. So I think when you do get the ball
inside, kind of need to make the most of it.  
  
Q. In the second half, when you were down by 6, 11 run, what keyed that run
for them?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: We were in the zone. We were doing a great job in the
zone with the exception of a few slips in the back of the zone and then they
start hitting their outside shots. We were trying to take away their
penetration. We were trying to take away what they were going to do on the
offensive end. In the zone they were one and done in the zone we were going to
have them rely on their guards to hit shots.  
And I think Jackie was on the line to get us to 6. And then they just stepped
up and hit shots. A'Quonesia Franklin hit one with the shot clock winding
down. When they hit the 3s is when they broke it open.  
  
Q. Coach, why do you think you were never able to get ahold on the turnover
issue this year?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: Well, I think a couple of things. There's no doubt
that our strength is in our front line, which is where our experience is as
far as playing time and being in this situation. Our weakness all year has
been our guard play for a few reasons. The youth of the guards; the
inexperience at this level, coming in playing Big 12 schedule. A really tough
non-conference schedule.  
I think one thing if I were to do differently was schedule a little bit better
in the non-conference to give these players a little bit more confidence,
because players like Whitney Houston and Candace Rucker and Aija and Bianca
and have been battling tough teams all year. There has been no let up in our
schedule. So they never really got the chance to get any momentum, great games
back to back. It's been tough for them all year. So I think we work on it.
It's something I think it's a mental thing.  
I think we've tried several things as far as watching film, different wing
entries. Sometimes fatigue set in. And you know you also gotta, when we talk
about the turnovers, I know most people think it is just our guards. But you
know yesterday our 3, 4, 5 hit 15 of our 25 turnovers. Sometimes it's travel,
three second calls, offensive fouls. It's really a combination of all of them.  
We do concentrate on taking care of the basketball. Sometimes -- most times it
hasn't translated. It's something we'll have to work on in the off season.  
  
Q. Either Jackie or Hannah can answer this question. Just talk about the
physical play inside the post. Coach mentioned about trying getting lobs on
the inside, but you all were always getting fronted or backed up, two on one
or weak side help.  
JACKIE McFARLUND: The physical nature of this game really didn't bother me. We
played more physical teams. It was the pressure of the guards getting into the
post. I don't think they even helped that much on the backside but whether
they fronted or whether I was in front and they were playing behind me, I
think we struggled getting the ball inside.  
HANNAH SKILDUM: I think on the guards it's hard to get open on the wings. I
think we struggled with that. So that was definitely something that we needed
to do better this game.  
  
Q. Kathy, what did winning yesterday do for the program and do for giving
you a boost in terms of next year?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: Well, I think it's progress, and that's just the way
we have to look at it. We won nine games last year. 13 games this year. First
win in the tournament.  
But, you know, that's all it is. It's just progress. And with this particular
group, I've seen so much progress throughout the year. I've seen Jackie do
incredible things with a great group of young women that she's been a great
leader for them. She's brought them along. Put them underneath her wing and
really tried to lead them. There's been some great games. There's been some
not so great games.  
We've played well at home. We really struggled on the road. There's just a lot
of things that we're going to look back at and learn from.  
But the biggest part for us is to bring our guards along a little bit quicker
and to be able to have a more balanced attack. I'm excited we won yesterday.  
I don't think our players were satisfied with that. I don't think they rested
on that. But it was definitely progress made.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MODERATOR: At this time we'd like to welcome Kansas. Coach, your thoughts on
this evening's game?  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: Tremendous amount of credit to Baylor defensively. I
thought they set the tone and tempo early. And you know, disappointed
certainly. We didn't respond to the pressure on the ball, pressure and passing
lanes and really got us out of rhythm, out of sorts pretty quick. We went to
the bench early to see if we could get somebody to respond. We just didn't.  
But a tremendous amount of credit to them. And to come out and set the tempo
right away.  
  
Q. Coach, how did fatigue factor into the game, particularly with you
playing one night ago and Baylor haven't played for a week?  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: I really felt like going into the game, we talked --
walked through today, I thought it would be an advantage for us to have played
last night. Got a win, a good emotional win. A game we played awfully well,
and we were pretty excited about what we were doing.  
I've been in both where you've had to come in with a day off and come in where
you had to play a second. And I think our kids are in great shape. I think
we're one of the most fit teams certainly in the country. Take pride in that.
I didn't feel that was a question. I didn't feel that's what it was. We were
like deer caught in the headlights right away. Down 20. Body posture and just
that was a puzzling look to me that really couldn't -- we just never got
through that.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about their defense tonight? It seemed particularly
aggressive?  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: I thought great pressure on the ball. Great pressure
on passing lanes. And you know, you've got to neutralize some of that
athleticism by screening it and getting it off balance and change of pace and
speed. We didn't do that. We didn't respond. We stood around, wanted someone
else to handle the pressure. And they were all looking at each other for
someone else to handle the pressure. We didn't do a good job. Weren't
aggressive on the ball screens and like sharks in water. They smelled some
blood and found some blood and kept coming. We just never made them get off of
us. We never did much to get some separation.  
  
Q. Coach, it's not too often you get whistled for a technical foul. Talk
about that the frustration.  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: Yes. Yes.  
  
Q. Remember your last one?  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: Got one at Oregon. Really my first one, I called a
timeout in Oregon. My staff clearly told me I didn't have any left. And my
mother still swears it's their fault. But I called it and I didn't. And I
didn't have one.  
Not that I earned this one. I didn't say a bad word. I want that made public.
I did not say a bad word.  
  
Q. Coach, I just wondered can you talk about the progress of this team and
how it's come and especially the win in the tournament, first win since 2003
and the final stretch of the season for you?  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: Right, I think you've got two kids that are sitting
up with me this evening right now that are sure a big part of that. But
Sharita Smith, our two seniors, Shaq and Sharita have done good jobs of being
leaders and voices in the locker room and providing great energy in practice
every day. And every day even though we couldn't find a way to win we try to
get better every day. And that speaks to who they are as people.  
Speaks to their character and resiliency and fortitude and that's -- you win
with kids like that. And that's been important. So it's disappointing to
struggle in play tonight. But in time we'll be able to walk away from this and
still have great pride for the progress that we did make and played with a lot
of pride for what was on the front of our uniform.  
And especially the seniors will walk away knowing they made the program better
and help the young kids get better.  
  
Q. Coach, when you look back on the season what will you remember the most
about what Shaq brought?  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: Shaq for the rack, I guess, you know. I think that's
fair. Larry Keating coined that. I can't take credit for it. Her
aggressiveness and willingness to step up and take big shots and make big
plays and just not off the dribble.  
Her shot was a lot better this year because when she's in between classes or
when it was after workouts this spring and summer, she had the gun out there,
the machine that kicks it back to you. She wore that thing out and did a great
job. Spent a lot of time to make herself a better shooter. And that just
didn't happen overnight. She made a commitment to get it right. Made a
commitment to be a great player at Kansas.  
  
Q. For the players, do you agree you had a deer in the headlight look before
Baylor pulled away?  
DANIELLE McCRAY: I think we did. They had their first shot and I think we were
just kind of, I don't know, not expecting it at first. And then like Coach
said we were kind of down but we were only down by 2. I felt it in the huddle,
too. I don't know, I think we just was -- I don't know, just not ready for it.  
SHAQUINA MOSLEY: We didn't match their intensity. We just came out lethargic,
lack of a better word.  
  
Q. Shaq, if you could answer this first and then Danielle. You're going out.
You've spent the last part of two years rebuilding it Danielle three more
years. Could you talk about the progress of Kansas and Shaq what you've meant
to it and Danielle what you hope to?  
SHAQUINA MOSLEY: Well, a lot of people asked me at the beginning of the season
did I ever regret coming here after last season. And I don't regret it one
bit. It's only going to make me a better person. And Bonnie's a great coach
and I had a lot of fun here and I've learned so much. Like she said, we can
just take that throughout life and I hope everyone who comes in here just
works hard and know that even if you are struggling that you can still make a
difference towards the end of the season. It's not over just because you maybe
lost two games in a row.  
You still have to push and keep fighting. And hopefully players that come in
after this year have the determination to keep pushing, even if you're
winning, keep working hard, because it's not going to come easy.  
DANIELLE McCRAY: I agree with Shaq what she said. The beginning of the season
we were struggling and everything, and I think we just stayed together as a
team and we knew that, knew it was going to be our time sometime. And we did
that down the stretch and we got a win last night.  
But, I don't know, just coming back from this one this year, I have learned a
lot. And off season, I'm just going to work to be even better and make Kansas
better.  
  
Q. Coach, I know it's tough after a loss, but you guys have changed so much
in the last month or two from being 0-9 to a pretty good, a win in the Big 12
tournament. Just how happy are you with the progress?  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: I'm excited about our growth. I'm excited that I
really believe we got the right people in the program. I believe that you know
I believe in my coaching staff and their commitment to these kids to grow and
you know develop players and develop a program and we're not there yet.
Certainly obviously -- but I think we're headed in the right direction. I
think we're able to build some momentum down the stretch.  
It's good for the young kids in the spring and summer workouts but recruiting
is huge for us. It is for anybody. We've got some position and needs we need
to feel and we've got the answer and we're certainly working our tails to get
that done.  
MODERATOR: Coach, have a great spring.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2007

  

### [Kelsey Griffin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16960)

### [Kiera Hardy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13848)

### [Connie Yori](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13896)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MODERATOR: We're now being joined by Nebraska. Coach, your thoughts about this
afternoon's game.  
COACH CONNIE YORI: My leading thought is I wish we would have gotten it done.
I'll tell you what, Iowa State is a good basketball team. Highly competitive
game. I thought the two teams competed very hard. Made a lot of plays. Get 70
at the regulation, you know you've got two teams that are making a lot of
offensive plays but I thought two teams that competed very hard on their
defensive ends.  
Bottom line is in the regulation, Lyndsey just hits huge shots. And she's a
senior who she's broken my heart on numerous occasions. And that was a big
shot. We had a chance to go to do some things in overtime, and we had our
opportunities. And I thought we got tired. And they made some mental mistakes
defensively and they capitalized on them. I think when you're playing Iowa
State, if you make mental mistakes, I think they make you pay for it.  
And the point guard that they have, I just think Lyndsey, I think she's
awesome. I think she's a great player. I think she's -- she just makes that
team go and she makes great decisions and she did it in regulation and she did
it in overtime.  
  
Q. Coach, when did you see the fatigue set in?  
COACH CONNIE YORI: Well, we had some mental lapses, I thought, in the second
half in defending their stats, in defending the ball screen. We had a mental
lapse in helping off the ball side post or helping down off of a guard on the
ball side and gave up a wide open 3.  
But I do think that we -- I just think that says a lot about Iowa State.
They're really well conditioned. They're tough. We should have been the more
fresh team, and I thought they showed great toughness.  
But I thought we showed good toughness, too. Don't get me wrong. I think we
competed very hard. They just made a few more plays. When we broke down, they
made us pay.  
  
Q. That was a tough shot she hit at the end of regulation. Do you think you
had it defended pretty well?  
COACH CONNIE YORI: Not really. We didn't execute defensively. We should have
got out on her. You know she's going to shoot it. And we didn't switch the
ball screen. She knocked it down.  
  
Q. For coach and the players, you shot 64% in the first half. 28% in the
second. What happened there?  
COACH CONNIE YORI: Well, law of averages, I think in part. We really had it
going in the first half. But they doubled the post in the second half and took
some things away from us there. We didn't have as many easy opportunities on
the low block as we did. We expected that.  
We made them pay a couple times on the weak side. And Kelsey had three assists
off of basically of double teams. But I just -- it was a case where I thought
their double teams bothered us.  
Their zone bothered us some. Just a case where I didn't think our shot
selection was really that much different in the first half as the second half.
I think sometimes they go down.  
  
Q. Kiera, after a tough loss like this how confident are you in this team's
ability to regroup and kind of refocus for what you have ahead?  
KIERA HARDY: I'm very confident. We still have a lot of season left. Now is
not the time to go into the tank. I mean you're playing for possibly going to
the NCAA tournament, somewhere where we haven't been. I'm disappointed about
this loss, but I think our team is going to do pretty well in a tournament.  
  
Q. Kelsey, could you kind of answer the same question about this team, how
you think this team will rebound for the NCAA tournament?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: I think the team's worked very hard to be where we are now.
We've had some hard losses but the one thing about the team is how resilient
we are. So if anything hopefully this loss will motivate us, and I think it
potentially can. So I'm not too worried about it. It's disappointing, but I
think we'll overcome it.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MODERATOR: Congratulations on this afternoon's game. Your comments about the
game and the upcoming opponent tomorrow evening.  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: I don't know who we play. That was obviously one of the
best college games I've been a part of. And obviously you feel for Nebraska.
They played their guts out. It was a great game. I think it shows what Big 12
basketball is all about. Two fantastic teams.  
I'm a lucky guy I got a kiss from my wife and a big hug from Sherry Cole.  
(Laughter)  
Sherry got me before you did. But, no, it was fun. And obviously those are
games that bring back special memories. What I told the kids before the
overtime was there's something inside of these kids, it's not the coaching.
It's what their parents gave them, the character and resolve that this team
has shown is amazing.  
And I just told them no matter what happens in the game don't lose that
because you're going to be very successful in life.  
Excited to keep playing, excited to get to stay here. And get to playing in
the semifinals tomorrow. We're honored to be here we'll show up and do our
best.  
  
Q. Lyndsey, take me through the last possession in overtime. Did you want
the ball in your hands were you going to shoot that, was that the game plan?  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: The one in regulation?  
  
Q. Regulation, right.  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: To be honest, I took Nicky to point guard camp where they
taught her to dribble. She took three of the scariest dribbles I've ever seen.
She got the ball inbounds and made a great pass, and I wasn't able to get my
shot off for like three seconds left. She turned around set a perfect screen.
When she set that screen the ball left my hands.  
It felt really good and my shot felt pretty good all game. So it wasn't
diagrammed. We didn't have a time-out or anything. But we even made a perfect
pass up the court and then an even better ball screen which freed me up to
shoot the ball.  
  
Q. How does this one compare to the Colorado one two years ago?  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: I think as a senior, you know, I'm playing in my first
semifinal game in a Big 12 tournament. We're playing for a seed in the NCAA
tournament. This one might mean a little bit more.  
I mean people I played with the past four years have been pretty special. And
so I'd probably say this one a little bit.  
  
Q. Would you talk about what goes through your mind when you're working
around those screens out top and you don't know if you're going to get an open
shot and what was going through your mind, the time on the clock, those kind
of things?  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: Actually spent some time with coach this morning. Watching
game film. We talked about last night using ball screens. Our post players do
a great job of setting good screens. And I wasn't making great decisions as
far as passing today. Obviously with six turnovers.  
And so when I saw that I had a little green light to shoot I wanted it to go
up. I know if they backed off on the screen and I had a little daylight I was
going to throw it out there if they didn't then it was about creating for
other people.  
Today I was able to get more shots off and they went in today.  
  
Q. Alison, you had a big three pointer late in the game I believe, too can
you take us through that as well?  
ALISON LACEY: Pretty much saw the green light and let it fly, actually. Hadn't
missed. And they told me to shoot and I saw an opportunity and let it go.  
  
Q. Coach, Nebraska shot 64% in the first half, just 28 in the second. What
do you attribute that to? Do you take credit for that?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: I hope we can take a little credit for it. I wasn't real
happy at half time. They need a new erase board in the locker room, probably.  
I just didn't think we defended at all in the first half. I really didn't.
They made a lot of open shots. You gotta defend better against that kind of
offensive team. In the second half we dug in better. Fatigue sets in
nervousness sets in. Once we knocked it down from 9 to a working number, those
shots are a little harder to make.  
Sometimes -- they missed a couple shots they'd probably like to have back. But
I think any time that people don't make shots defense is part of it and luck
is part of it. And they miss is part of it.  
I don't think we can take total credit for that at all.  
  
Q. Bill, what's your philosophy when the clock is down like that to maybe
fouling when you're ahead by three points, do you believe in that? How do you
go about that?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: I don't. And I have this discussion with my son and my
father and everyone else. And I just really feel like there's too many things
that go wrong if you foul. To be honest with you the way we're defensive
rebounding that probably wouldn't be a good idea.  
I thought we defended it really well. If they make a great shot like Lyndsey
made, so be it, but I think there's too many things and you put, you bring in
more things. When do they call the foul. There's a lot of things.  
But we've never done it. We talked about it as staff. We've practiced both
ways. It just seems like for us it's not the thing to do and we've never done
it.  
And I don't anticipate doing it in the future.  
  
Q. Two quick questions. One, a lot of green light talk up here. Passing
green lights out to everybody?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: Shoot it before you throw it away. I mean that's what I
tell them. Every pass is a turnover waiting to happen, and our kids can shoot.
We recruit shooters, they like to play, I think kids want to play. They play
-- and every timeout they're saying play to win play to win play to win.
That's fun. We're trying to grow the sport. This is a great game for TV and
great game for the fans. And they don't want to see you hang onto it and
dribble it out. They want to see people shoot the ball and play.  
That's the way we've played in and the three-point is a big part of our game
to do it.  
  
Q. The ball was in the right hands for that shot?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: There's not a player in the country I would trade for
her. Not one.  
  
Q. Nicky you picked up a couple of fouls in the first half, just one in the
second half. How did you go about playing defense knowing you were in a little
foul trouble there in the second half?  
NICKY WIEBEN: When you're on defense you're a little tentative especially on
the post. I had a time -- getting 2-0and not being able to get around inside.
The second half I knew my defense really needed to pick it up a lot. Griffin
had a fantastic game. Danielle Page came in and played good minutes.  
I don't know, just came out and was trying to limit the touches inside more in
the second half.  
  
Q. Nicky, Lyndsey said she was scared to death when you were dribbling the
ball, what were you feeling when you were coming up the court?  
NICKY WIEBEN: I think it was passed it to me I knew there wasn't that much
time on the clock. Tried going toward our hoop and Medders came in and helped
me out a little bit. I decided to set a screen for her. Worked out good.  
  
Q. We talk a lot this week about getting to the semifinals what does it mean
for the program to be back in the semifinals for the first time in five
years?  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: That's probably for everyone else to make that decision.
I don't think because we haven't been doesn't mean we're not doing very well.
It means you're in a great league. It's special for these kids to be in the
semifinals in the Big 12 league. It's a special league and environment, great
environment to play here. With all the other tournaments going on across the
country, the Big 12 becomes the showcase league in the nation right now and we
get to play.  
To be honest with you, I wouldn't have thought any less if we wouldn't have
won; but for me it's one more game I get to be with them. It's exciting.  
For our team this year there's a lot of lists we're checking off. And we get
to check off the semifinal one today. That was good.  
  
Q. Lyndsey, earlier this season you joked about not calling a timeout at the
end of a half because when you draw off the play it never works. Does it seem
to be that doing it on the fly just works out better?  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: Well, to correct you, the plays are usually good, I just mess
them up. I don't want coach to get mad at me.  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: She's real worried about me.  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: As soon as I saw we even get the ball, I think we had one
timeout left, the thought crossed my mind. But I like to kind of go in the
rhythm and the momentum and see what opens up and what doesn't.  
I think it was good because we kind of caught them off guard as far as we
broke the press pretty quickly. Wieben made a good pass, and they seemed to be
scrambling those past five seconds only cross half court. I messed up actually
on that one on in the inbound play before, didn't catch the ball.  
I kind of prefer to see what the defense does and try to react to it. And
Wieben deserves a lot of credit for the screen she set. Because I don't think
I would have got the shot off if she didn't do that.  
  
Q. Starting off with the Texas A &M game, seven wins in a row. What has been
the change that's gotten this team to now probably one of the top 20 teams in
the country?   
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: It's a lot of things. We lost to Baylor. I remember the play
ride home when we had three big home games and we knew we had 2 tough road
games to finish out the Big 12 season. And I think a lot of it has been
balanced scoring, helps a lot with the exception we played defense in the
first half we've been guarding pretty well. And I think that's been able to
help us a lot.  
Yesterday, you know, we weren't able to put points on the board but we were
able to hold someone to 20 points. At the end of a lot of these games we've
been able to get defensive stops. I would distinguish, traditionally been
known as a three-point shooting offensive machine which I still think we are
at times but to also add to that a defensive element where all five players on
the floor with the exception of myself a couple times, can actually guard
people. So I think balanced scoring and being able to guard.  
  
Q. Bill, can you talk about, you said you wouldn't trade her for any player
in the world. Talk about what she brings other than scoring.  
COACH BILL FENNELLY: We don't have enough time for that. She's the fails of
our university, our athletic department. She's done everything that we've
asked of her. I have been on her butt for four years and asked her to do
things that at times weren't fair.  
But the impact she's made on the court, off the court, is dramatic. And I
think she will go down in history as one of the greatest student athletes in
our university. One of the best players in our league, because of the way she
conducts herself and the grace and dignity that she does it on the court, off
the court, and it's been a tremendous honor to coach her and be around her
every single day, because she leads by example and I think to go back to
Scott's question, the reason this team is better is because she's healthy and
I think that is the number one factor that's allowed other players to relax
and play.  
And after the concussion and the turf toe and everything else, she's playing
the game the way she's capable of playing it. And it's great that she's ending
her career that way. That's the way it should be.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MODERATOR: We're now joined by the University of Texas coach and player.
Tiffany will be here in a couple of minutes. Carla is here and she'll take
questions and Tiffany should be joining us momentarily. Coach, your comments
about tonight's game.  
COACH CONRADT: To indicate how hard our team played. Tiffany cramped up on the
way on the walk here. So as soon as they stretch her out she'll be here.  
It was hard-fought. I think you saw two teams who really respect each other,
really go at it. They play a little prettier than we do and they started out
like lights out. I was hopeful they wouldn't continue to hit the 3s the way
they did. We tried to tell our team to just try to weather that storm.  
And I thought we did. But we had spells throughout the game where we really
got pretty frustrated on offensive end. We got shots blocked because we went
right into the big people and invited them to block it, and when we did have
some opened looks, we were looking around to see who was going to block it.  
And we missed some really good opportunity to score some baskets in
transition, and we had some good looks and we didn't knock those down.  
It's hard to believe you take 72 shots to your opponent's 54 and you still are
struggling to stay in it offensively. But I look at the stat sheet. I see that
we fought hard rebounding-wise and they're a tough team to rebound against.  
We took care of the basketball. They have turnovers, but it all got down to
one thing counts and that's when you put the ball in the hole. And we had a
lot of difficulty doing that. It's no secret that that's been an issue with
this team, particularly as the season progressed. We're not the best shooting
team. And people have the ability to collapse on us and if we can't loosen
them up then it's usually a long night.  
But, again, Oklahoma is really good. They're hard to defend. I thought we did
a decent job with that part of the game. But on the other end our inability to
score, our inability to finish would have made it awfully hard for us to win
this ball game.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)  
COACH CONRADT: I don't have any idea about that. With this team I don't think
we have focused on that because I think that this team knows that they have to
play possession after possession. You would hope so. Are we one of the best 64
teams in the country? I believe so.  
I believe that our conference is very tough. I think we have beat up on each
other. I heard someone mention today this is the only conference where there
was a real conference race. Everybody else had teams at the top and teams at
the bottom and they never met on our level at the conference, it's been a
battle for everybody. And, again, I have no idea. We're hopeful. But on the
other hand I think our team did everything that they could do to try to play
themselves into the tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, when they're hitting three-pointers like that how much more
difficult does it make it guarding Courtney?  
COACH CONRADT: They're really good. Any team that has inside/outside game the
way they do, they're going to be successful. And, again, I thought we worked
about as hard as we could work. We boarded with them. We forced turnovers, but
they're hard to guard. And our team laid it all on the line. I don't have any
problems with the effort we gave tonight. They're a lot prettier than we are
the way they play. But that doesn't get your points. What matters is whether
you knock down shots. They did, we didn't. We had a lot of opportunities where
we could have folded but we didn't.  
We're going to take pride in that. We're going to congratulate Oklahoma
because they're a very good team. They were predicted before the conference
ever started that they were going to win the conference. And I don't think it
was easy for them or for anyone else, but they persevered, and I want to say
that this was a great venue.  
I mean that was an electric environment. Oklahoma City has done a wonderful
job with this tournament. And I enjoyed being in an environment where people
are passionate about women's basketball.  
And they've been very hospitable and done a great job. Our hostess, as I
mentioned last night, really good. They went into the witness protection
program now. But they did a great job. They thanked me for not naming them
last night when I talked about them finding us a place to practice.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the blocked shots Oklahoma had and how it played in
to you guys couldn't score in the second half for a while.  
TIFFANY JACKSON: That was huge. That's one of the strengths of having Courtney
in the middle along with Amanda Thompson. They had us off on a lot of our
shots. It played a big part in them winning this game.  
  
Q. Tiffany, how badly do you want to continue your career here at UT?  
TIFFANY JACKSON: A lot. I don't even know I didn't even know words to say to
explain how bad I want to continue to play. I want to keep playing.  
  
Q. Tiffany, Oklahoma's first four points came on five three-pointers how
much did that just snowball the momentum and all of a sudden they blow the
roof off with their shooting?  
TIFFANY JACKSON: That was huge whenever anyone gets a 3 in transition or a 3
that's a big momentum changer. They had a great crowd behind them. And that
got into our heads a little bit. We just tried to continue to play.  
  
Q. Coach, you had nights where you shot bad, but when you mentioned about
the rebounding and the turnovers and the steals and you get down to the end,
some nights you pull those games out. And tonight that just wasn't that way?  
COACH CONRADT: You're exactly right. We've seen a lot of zones and people are
going to zone us. I mean it's no secret we are what we are. We're really good
defensive team. We're really hard-working team and when we can get in open
court, we generally finish. Although we had difficulty with that tonight.  
But there's a temptation. When you're seeing people not guard you there in the
zone, you want to competitively you just want to make the shot.  
And we needed to stay disciplined and for the most part we did. They challenge
you to shoot from the perimeter, and we just don't have a shooting team from
the perimeter right now.  
Ernie Williams is probably one of our best perimeter shooters and she didn't
have a great night. You know it's hard. She's from Oklahoma I know she put
pressure on herself to come here and have a great outing. And that didn't
happen for her. But she's as hardworking as anybody we have on our team. Carla
willed some shots in tonight. That's not what Carla does best.  
But I think you see competitors try to step up and it's no secret we were
going to have trouble with zone, because Tiffany's going to have trouble
inside if they double and triple team her and we did get going inside out a
little bit, Carla knocked down some shots.  
But we don't have the kind of shooters that we need to face the zone night in
night out.  
  
Q. Jody, with the youth you have on your team and the way they worked hard
this year, would you entertain a WINT bid in case you all don't get one on
Monday?  
COACH CONRADT: You know, I really don't think that that's where this team
would go. You know, you set your goals on going to the NCAA and that's still
in the back of our minds. Hopefully something will happen and we'll get there.
But in my mind it's awfully difficult when you're disappointed in one way to
turn around and get ready to play again.  
We've asked this team to do a lot. We don't have depth. Carla has played, I
don't know, how many minutes, and you know when Tiffany starts cramping
upcoming to the media room, then you know that your team has probably given
you just about everything they can.  
If we can get a little time off and make a run in NCAA be at home, obviously
we'd be very excited about that.  
  
Q. For Carla and Tiffany, do you feel like you've earned that spot in the
NCAA?  
CARLA CORTIJO: Yes, we've been working real hard this whole season, and I
think -- yes, I think we saved that spot right there on the NCAA. Anything can
happen right now, and we probably would be there.  
COACH CONRADT: I think if you asked if we were competitive against anybody we
had played against other than Tennessee and Duke early in the season, I think
we've been in games, I think we've been competitive. And I think we can play.
We've got some really good wins but we had some losses that were disappointing
as well.  
Tiffany, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to take your question.  
TIFFANY JACKSON: I agree.  
(Laughter)  
MODERATOR: Coach, best of luck in the post-season.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Oklahoma University and congratulations,
Coach, on the win. I don't know whether you were informed but you all set a
new team record for team blocks with 15 for the tournament. The old record was
10 held by Kansas State on March the 12th, '03. Congratulations. Your comments
about the game and upcoming opponent.  
COACH COALE: I was proud of our kids. I thought we really competed. Gave up
too many offensive boards. That's something that we had keyed on before the
game. 19 is not a good number. But at the same time, we made a lot of effort
plays. Forced some turnovers, did a great job of blocking obviously around the
rim. Courtney, Leah, Amanda all those guys involved in that.  
We felt we did a great job sharing the basketball. That's a great thing. 15
assists. That's the way we play. When that number is high we'll be pretty
successful. I was really proud of our effort, and I thought Texas played very
hard and competed for a full 40 minutes.  
We just were pretty good from the three-point line tonight. That made a big
difference as well.  
  
Q. You obviously saw Texas was hot yesterday in their win. Can you talk
about your defense performance tonight and what was the mind set coming in
defensively?  
COACH COALE: Well, Texas makes a living by scoring in transition. And early
on, even though that's what we were prepared to stop, it's one thing to talk
about, another thing to really be on the floor with it.  
I thought it took four, five minutes to adjust to the transition. Did a better
job getting the ball at half court slowing them down and it made us catch up a
bit. We've been playing with more abandon defensively figuring out how to help
each other and how important it is that five guys guard as one instead of five
different guys trying to guard individually.  
We pushed it up a lot and felt that could be effective against Texas. I think
it was. Again, when you have somebody like Courtney hanging around in the
middle of the lane where they can't get to the basket, that makes a huge
difference. I suppose that's why she gets defensive player of the year.  
  
Q. Sherri, this was a very physical game but it seems throughout the season
when the games are physical, you usually come out on the front end of those.
People don't talk about it very much, how tough your team is and when you get
into these physical games, you usually come out in good shape.  
COACH COALE: Well, we have a lot of experience. I think when a game is
physical, seniors who have been through the battles understand how to handle
themselves and I just thought we made some tough plays. A lot of athletes
going after rebounds around the rim.  
For people who might say women's basketball doesn't have anything to do with
athleticism watch that game tonight. They were happy jumping around the rim.
Chelsi took a charge that wasn't called a charge, but she planted herself. I
swear the girl's feet hit her in the head. That's the only thing. Tremendous
athleticism on the floor. We handled ourselves well in terms of staying tough,
keeping the block out. Holding the block out against that speed and explosion
is tough. And I thought these guys did a tremendous job there.  
  
Q. Sherri, talk about Leah's game tonight. Seemed like she was on all over
the court contributing in so many different ways.  
COACH COALE: When she hit the first basket, I had a flashback to Kansas State
and Dallas. It's something about the Big 12 Post-Season Tournament. Leah Rush
is really, really good, and that's exactly what we needed our senior leader to
be. She made big baskets. She was calm, she was poised, she defended Tiffany,
kept the ball out of her hands for the majority of the early part of the game.
And you know it's one of the reasons we got off to such a great start.  
  
Q. Leah, can you talk about how the crowd fueled your effort tonight and was
it any different than the crowd in Norman when you got a big crowd at Lloyd
Noble or did it feel like the Lloyd Noble Center?  
LEAH RUSH: It felt like a home game certainly. It's a huge advantage I think
playing in Oklahoma City. Huge advantage for us. And it's fun, I think.
Oklahoma City and the surrounding area, the Sooner fans around here are
enjoying it and we love being here and letting them come out and support us.
It's a lot of fun.  
  
Q. Sherri, Jenna Plumley is someone that seems like you've kind of given her
the green light, because tonight she had five assists, six turnovers, but
still she was a spark plug. And I would think you would think she plays well.
Do you coach her any differently because she is going to make good things or
bad things happen, it seems like?  
COACH COALE: I think that's the case with a lot of great players, particularly
maybe point guards who create things. And I remember No. 21 for about four
years here, Stacey Deals, every other pass might go to a security guard. If
you're sitting on press row, you better have your hands up. But the ones in
between those errant passes went right where they were supposed to go. The
defense couldn't get to them.  
So there's a risk/reward. You roll the dice a little bit. But when she goes
four of five from the three-point line, I think that might cancel out a few of
those.  
  
Q. Sherri, your offense kind of went reverse tonight. I think your first
five baskets were three-pointers and later you came back and hit them with
Courtney in the hammer. Is that fair?  
COACH COALE: Yes, that's a perfect assessment, John. It was sort of an
atypical beginning because typically we established Courtney at the low block
and we pounded in and pounded in and pounded in, and then when they started
surrounding her, we kicked it out and get the 3s.  
But with we had some opportunities. We had a hard time getting her the ball
early. It wasn't that we weren't trying to. We had a hard time and credit goes
to Texas for that.  
It was two things. It was their activity and their active feet around her, but
it was also their ball pressure. And we couldn't quite see to make those entry
passes. So we were fortunate that we had guys step up and make 3s.  
And, Leah really just -- you hit a couple shots early and suddenly you feel
really good and the rest of them are a little bit more confident.  
  
Q. Looking ahead, if you were to play Baylor tomorrow night talk about the
pros and cons of playing a team in a tournament that you just played last
weekend, really blew out.  
COACH COALE: I hate to guess about who we're going to play. There's a
40-minute game that's going to make that decision. I don't think it's
necessarily a bad thing to play someone you're familiar with. We played Texas
not long ago. It was a fairly easy preparation in that our guys remembered
everything that they do. And it was fresh on their mind. I think a little bit
easier than had we drawn, say, Nebraska who we didn't play since opening
weekend in Big 12.  
COURTNEY PARIS: Like Coach said, we don't know who we're playing yet, but I
think the big thing we're working on lately is focusing on Oklahoma and making
sure we're playing our right kind of basketball. And our assistant coaches do
a great job scouting, so we just need to play Oklahoma basketball.  
  
Q. Sherri, talk about the play of Ashley tonight. And, Ashley, I want you to
talk about playing alongside Courtney so much tonight.  
COACH COALE: I felt one of the biggest plays of the games was when Ashley
caught the ball (indiscernible) the timeout. And we talked about exactly what
we wanted to do, but she executed it perfectly. And I thought that really sort
of blew the game open because it was like we had the three-point basket going
and now if we get the high-low game going as well, they may not have an
ability to have an answer for it.  
I thought Ashley played with great abandon in the second half particularly
going after rebounds, very, very tough and physical.  
ASHLEY PARIS: About playing with Courtney, you said? I think playing with
Courtney, (indiscernible), I mean that high-low thing is going to be there.
She works pretty hard. She will go get it for you if it's any way possible. I
think as far as having those shots open tonight, it's because so much pressure
is going towards her, and it just let me take that. It just makes the game a
lot easier for me with her out on the court.  
  
Q. Courtney, could you talk about the adjustment you made and you had four
shots in the first half. You had five I think in the first two minutes or so
of the second half. And you scored the first eight points and just kind of
gave you guys some distance there.  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think Coach said it earlier. Normally we're usually -- we'll
establish the inside and then we'll hit them with the outside, once they all
come down. But Texas did a great job of playing the post, and they were there
and they were fronting and it was hard to get the ball inside. But Leah Rush
and these other guys were knocking down three-pointers.  
For me it was just like, well, your teammate knocks down a 3, that's really
good. They established, we established ourselves on the outside first and then
Texas had to adjust, and then the second half I was open a lot more.  
  
Q. Courtney, did this feel as effective as the game with Baylor? You guys
put two of these together in a row now?  
COURTNEY PARIS: Definitely we're excited and Coach except saying you just
survive in post-season so you can keep playing. I think not only did we
survive we got better and played with abandon. That's a fun thing to see.  
  
Q. Sherri, a few times this year you talked about, you still have a potent
offense when you take Courtney out of the game where she has to come out of
the game because Ashley has become such a good low post score. Tonight that
was very evident. That really benefits your team for the long run doesn't it
when she can do that?  
COACH COALE: Absolutely. I think what was special about Ashley's offensive
performance tonight it came in a variety of ways. She hit a high post shot.
Caught it at the high post penetrated got to the rim finished around the
basket. Made a post move. It was a variety of different things which really
keeps teams off balance. And I think in the second half she and Courtney both
ran the floor better offensively which created some opportunities as well.  
  
Q. Sherri, I had the pleasure of sitting next to a genius in John Holcomb,
and he was talking about how some women's basketball is more fun to watch than
men's because you are fundamentally --  
COACH COALE: Oh, John, that's precious.  
  
Q. Anyway, the entry passes were something down to the low post. There were
some terrific low post entry passes it seemed tonight.  
COACH COALE: Right. Jenna Plumley has an uncanny court vision. And she can
deliver in ways -- she had a couple of post feeds a week or so ago at home. I
wanted to see them on the replay immediately. Like the ball bounced five
different directions once it hit the floor before it came back to Courtney.
She just has that sense about her.  
When you're five foot three and playing against guys five 10 and six foot,
maybe better be a little creative. It wasn't just Jenna. Amanda had a couple
of great feeds and she has terrific vision as well.  
That's something that we work on. I mean I think feeding the post is a lost
art. I really do. I think finding kids who can get the ball to a post play in
the right spot at the right time, that's a rarity.  
And we spend a lot of time working on it. We're fortunate, a couple of our
young kids come in with that skill. But that doesn't mean we're going to pull
away from the reps on that. We have to do it every single day.  
  
Q. Courtney, Texas shot 25% for the game. Was your defense that good, your
team defense that good tonight?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think it was okay. I don't know. Yes, it's something that
we've been working on all year long. So I mean I think we're getting better at
it and our communication is getting a lot better as far as being there and
contesting shots. I think, yeah, we were there and they had to shoot over us.  
  
Q. Is that a big deal to you, Courtney? You talk a lot about double doubles
and points and rebounds, but talk about blocked shots. How big or how
important is that to you and the team and something to be proud of? How do you
feel about that?  
COURTNEY PARIS: Yes, I've been asked before what's my favorite thing doing on
the court. I think it's blocking shots. It brings a lot of momentum. The crowd
goes crazy. It can be a blocked shot that stops the game-winning shot, you
know, or it could be a ball that goes out of bounds and everybody goes crazy
and it brings a lot of momentum. And it's fun. It's cool to see.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you all very much.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Texas A&M and Coach Blair and his players.
Coach, congratulations on this afternoon's win. Your thoughts on the game and
your upcoming opponent?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: I always believe the team that played the day before that
doesn't have the by has the advantage. Because I really like how Colorado
played the day before, and they held a pretty good Texas Tech team down the
stretch in check, and they were playing with nothing to lose. And we had that
attitude, that's why we went out there with such hard intensity on defense. I
was really proud of my half-court defense.  
We've got to do a better job of scoring in transition. When we do force
turnovers or we do make them miss, we just were not doing a good job unless we
had break-aways.  
Of course, as most of you know, I didn't like the last minute of the game. We
had a chance to really hold the team down to 10 points, and it's not that
we're trying to ever do anything like that, but you want to take that momentum
and pride in there. And we were substituting a lot there.  
And we wanted to keep the kids out of foul trouble. We made some mistakes, and
that comes with the territory. We had kids come off the bench not knowing who
they're guarding.  
But I was proud of our effort on the defensive end. I thought it took eight
minutes into the second half to get out of the sluggishness that we had.  
And I got on my Energizer bunny here pretty hard, but she's been able to take
me for three years and is going to because the team responds around her. If
she walks to the huddle on a timeout, the team's going to walk with her.  
If she runs to the huddle, the team's going to run. If she gets to the huddle
and acts like a leader and a captain, the team is going to respond. And if she
starts making excuses, our team will make excuses with her.  
And this is what a point guard is all about. And she's a very, very special
one. I'm prejudiced. I think I got the best one. And there's some very good
ones in our league. But she's got her job tomorrow. It's going to be a tough
ball game tomorrow, whichever one of these teams, because we beat Nebraska all
by a total of one point and we got beat up there by Iowa State. So that's the
Big 12 tournament.  
I'm just glad to be here. I'm proud of my kids and I thought we did some good
things in the ball game. We were a little sluggish. Perhaps that's the first
game of the tournament. But I commend Colorado because we really didn't force
the turnovers that I thought we were going to off of the press.  
And the press sets the tempo and the attitude of the game. It doesn't
necessarily mean you've got to steal the ball. But it sets the tempo and the
attitude and you wear it down.  
Coach Schaefer's number one thing was to stop the guard-to-guard passes. Make
them go guard to post instead of guard to guard, because when you go guard to
post, we've got a lot of help side in there. And I believe they only had one
lob the whole night, and that was in the second half to McFarland.  
And other than that, that's just how we play. It might look a little ugly to
you, but we're sitting up here right now and so it's still pretty.  
  
Q. A'Quonesia, will you talk about that leadership you need to have. And
then there was a stretch there after they hit two three-pointers in about a
minute and a half and then you had two three-pointers in a pretty crucial
stretch, you had the three-point plays.  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: Well, it's a hard role to fill on the team. But my team
is behind me and they respond well. And with the three-pointers, at that time
we knew we had to break the lead open. If we didn't, you knew it was going to
be a close game and we didn't want that kind of finish.  
  
Q. This is for Patrice. It looked like you really hit the boards very hard
there the first two games. You guys got a lot of points on some of the points.
Can you talk about how you felt that you really took it to them from the
beginning, scrapping, rebounding, et cetera.  
PATRICE READO: Well, every game I go into the game just wanting to play
defense. For the past couple of games, I haven't been going to the boards.
Coach Blair has been getting on me about going to the boards. This game I just
wanted to go in, rebound and play defense, so our team can get the win.  
  
Q. Patrice and Takia both, they cut it to five. It looked like you got a
good delay up there with the three-point play, and you all really kind of got
going after that. At that point was it almost like, all right, enough of this,
let's put it away? Was it that feeling?  
TAKIA STARKS: I wouldn't say it was that feeling. Sort of like we had been
playing the whole game. We thought we should be up by more. We weren't up by
more because didn't play like we should have played. And as soon as we got
that run, we just kept trying to keep running and getting defensive stops and
getting the transition shots, and that was really our game. When that started
happening, you saw us start to take the game away.  
PATRICE READO: Once we get the momentum on our offense, that's what leads us
to the momentum down on the defensive. That's how the big plays gets us
started.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys were on the offensive glass a lot, getting a lot of
steals. Just kind of the way the entire season has gone?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: I think so. It's what we do. There's no great formula.
Basically the run started with that Oklahoma tornado in there, Danielle Gant,
when she made the block on the baseline right in front of Kathy. Those are
big-time plays, and gave stops to finish down there. I thought it killed
Colorado by her two blocks and what she did there.  
And make sure you give -- McFarland got 17. But Reado did one heck of a job on
her. She was on her the majority of the game at 5 foot 11 and I thought that
was the difference in the game because I had nightmares last night of her
getting 32 again.  
And a lot of it is because of that little kid who is usually not up here in
the press room. She's back there in the garage doing the dirty work, and
that's the type of player she is.  
But I was really pleased at how well she played at the floor.  
  
Q. Gary, can you talk about Gant in general, what she does for your team.
Doesn't seem like she shoots a lot. Can you talk about the stuff she does to
help you win.  
COACH GARY BLAIR: You're right, she doesn't shoot a lot. She makes a lot. When
you look at the field goal percentage leaders in our league, they're all post
players, except for Danielle Gant, who plays a 3 the majority of time for us.
But all of the others, the Mosleys, the McFarlands, the Riddles, everybody but
Jackson, shoots great field goal percentage. But we get all ours almost from a
little almost five-10 kid. She means so much to this team because how many
players of that stature would come off the bench and be able to handle that
without phone calls: Hey, my daughter needs to be starting, and all that jazz.  
She handles it. She's the ultimate team player. And so are her parents. We're
happy to have her here. It's not how many she scores, but she sets the tone of
the game. She's a great defensive player.  
  
Q. Will you expand on Jackie McFarland. She takes nine shots but they really
struggled to get the ball to her at all in the first half.  
COACH GARY BLAIR: Well, a lot of it, when you do not have the guards that can
dribble penetrate besides Houston, they can't create passing angles to get it
in. And that's the hardest thing, and that's what we try to take away is make
you run your offense 25 feet from the basket. And then we gamble a lot.  
And we're going to get beat on layups, but we said whenever McFarland did beat
us, let's try not to foul her because she just doesn't miss. That kid is a
great player and just a sophomore. Special, special kid there. And I'm sure
that will be one of the all-time greats to ever play at Colorado.  
And did you recruit that young lady? Good job, hon.  
  
Q. Coach Blair, back to Danielle Gant, did she seem to have a little extra
pep in her step in practicing this week as she was having to come back to play
in front of her home crowd, or did it really make any difference to her? Was
she just locked in?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: She's the most low-key individual you ever met in her your
life. Sometimes I have to check to see if there's a pulse there. All of a
sudden she's smiling more, she's talking more, she enjoys coming back home,
and I think that's special.  
I think you saw that with Earnesia Williams from Texas, also played the same
type. Kids like coming home. And she's played very well in this state, and I
just like to thank the State for putting out as many good high school players
as there are in this state right here.  
This is probably the most underrated state in the country as far as producing
big time quality basketball players. I think Connecticut has won a couple of
national championships with some Oklahoma kids, too.  
But Danielle Gant is special. The best thing about Gant is she's got two years
and hopefully a month left to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2007

  

### [EeTisha Riddle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16917)

### [Cindy Stein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14283)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Missouri Tigers, and, Coach Stein, if you
would like to make comments about tonight's game.  
COACH STEIN: I'd like to congratulate Coach Conradt with her 900 wins. She's
an unbelievable coach. And obviously I wish we didn't have too many of those
victories against us, but she's a great coach and a great asset to women's
basketball.  
But unfortunately tonight our chemistry was off. We struggled on the offensive
end quite a bit. Finally figured out what they were trying to do on their
offense, and I thought our kids came back in the second half and did a nice
job, but obviously it wasn't enough. We had trouble scoring. And I think you
have to credit their defense.  
  
Q. Cindy, you talked about the chemistry being off. What was the decision
behind kind of switching up your starting lineup for tonight's game?  
COACH STEIN: The starters were 5 and 11 in the league, and they weren't
playing very well together. We had started in holes. It was just a matter of
trying to change it up. I felt like Toy and Marchelle had been playing very
well in games and that they were playing very well in practice. And in
practice we looked to put a starting group together for this game that was
playing well together. And they were.  
So that was a decision. I didn't feel like it was a demotion. I felt it was
just trying to change things up, trying to get some chemistry back, and
obviously we needed a lift off the bench. When we've had great play off the
bench, we've usually won. And just trying to have a really bang off the bench.  
And I felt Blair and Tiffany came in and played really hard and Jessra played
hard. I thought we had key minutes from Amanda Hanneman and probably some
others that I'm missing.  
But like I said, our chemistry was off the entire night. Especially on the
offensive end.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you think your post-season is going to look like? Do you
feel pretty confident that you guys are going to play in the post-season?  
COACH STEIN: I feel we deserve an NIT bid. NCAA, we don't deserve it. So we
hope that we have that opportunity.  
  
Q. Coach, all the lay-ups that Texas was able to get to, was that a
byproduct of how many threes you took early or just not getting back?  
COACH STEIN: You know, we've had a problem with five people getting back all
year. And it's something we work on all the time. To me, it's a toughness
thing. It's toughness getting down the court and getting the angle of the
basket away. We had quite a few opportunities where we could get there and
take the angle away and take a charge, and we backed out of it and it's just a
toughness thing. And we've got to get a lot tougher.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit more about Amanda Hanneman and her play
tonight? Obviously she's feeling much better.  
COACH STEIN: Yes, Amanda is finally getting healthy. She's had back problems
and all year long and she's a tremendous competitor. And she's been getting a
lot healthier. She's been feeling better. Her quickness has come back and it's
not quite all the way, but she does a lot of really good things. Now she's a
tough kid. And we wanted that out there. She's been playing real well in
practice.  
And I don't think she really revealed herself on all the things she's capable
of doing. But I think this is a good start for her.  
  
Q. EeTisha, talk about toughness. Looked like you rolled an ankle on at
least two occasions. How difficult was it to stay out there?  
EeTISHA RIDDLE: It wasn't hard. I didn't want my last game to be sitting on a
bench with a rolled ankle. Everybody rolls an ankle. I had to suck it up and
run down the floor.  
  
Q. Cindy, going back to the first half and the way you guys played in the
second half, do you feel if you could have put the two halves together, it
could have given you a chance to be in at least?  
COACH STEIN: Sure. It's frustrating from a coaching standpoint, you go into a
locker room and our kids feel confident they can play with Texas. It's not a
matter of you're trying to build up their confidence; it's just for some
reason this group it takes the first half to figure things out and then try to
come back strong in the second and I think our kids always play hard and it
just goes back to I've said over and over again. I put too much emphasis on
ourselves and not always working together. They try very hard to do things,
but it's not as team oriented, whether it's getting somebody else opened or
being a little more patient to set up your defender.  
Little things like that, they're overrunning things. And it's frustrating from
a coaching angle because we don't do that in practice. And then we'll get in a
game and it's like we're overrunning passing lanes and you're seeing things
that you don't usually see. We've got to be able to figure that out.  
  
Q. In the first half, it looked, you were posting up against Tiffany Jackson
and Tiffany Brooks had the ball and you were screaming to throw it in to you
and she threw it elsewhere. How bad did you want the ball tonight and how bad
were you thinking about carrying this team like the first game?  
EeTISHA RIDDLE: I always wanted, like, demand the ball because I know I get a
lot of attention, and they were going to double and triple team me, and then
that's going to leave a lot of my teammates open, and it's frustrating. It's
hard being a post player because you depend on other people to get you the
ball.  
But maybe she saw something that I didn't see.  
  
Q. Cindy, when you talked about the emphasis on the self and in looking for
an evaluation of the season, is that something that just the subtraction of a
couple of players, key players from the previous team can affect? You talked
about chemistry, is that just something losing a couple of key players can
have that kind of impact?  
COACH STEIN: I think we've had other kids step up. Obviously you miss two WNBA
players, and that does have an effect on the team, but I feel the team has
done a good job of getting themselves into a position to do things. It goes
back to where, you know, Tiffany Brooks is able to create her own shot and
EeTisha is able to create her own shot and Alyssa Hollins is able to create
her own shot. And sometimes we rely on that happening instead of the flow of
the offense. If you look through our games, which I've done, it's like we
score when we move the ball real well. Our movement on offense is good, but
when we get into a tight situation, we're a one-pass try to score. And like I
said, it's tough because our patience needs to be in there in those times.  
And it's something that we work on all the time in practice going eight passes
before you can score, and it's just -- we've got a lot of game slippage,
unfortunately. That is new people in those kinds of pressure situations,
understanding what that takes.  
  
Q. Coach Stein, could you talk about your decision to send Tiffany Brooks
back into the game with four fouls with lots of time left and when she got her
fifth foul?  
COACH STEIN: Sure. We were down. We were basically 20 points down, if not
more. And we needed someone aggressive. And she was getting in there, trying
to be aggressive, and at that point you don't have anything to lose. You gotta
play it all out.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, good luck for the rest of the season.

## March 6, 2007

  

### [Shalee Lehning](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13847)

### [Deb Patterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14194)

### [Shana Wheeler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16914)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MODERATOR: We're joined by Kansas State. Coach Patterson, if you could make
comments about the game and then some questions.  
COACH PATTERSON: I think when you line up against a team the third time, you
can sometimes expect that it's not necessarily going to be pretty, because of
the familiarity that each team brings to the other on the offensive end.  
But obviously Iowa State separated themselves offensively in the second half
of the basketball game. And you know by and large I thought that was the
difference in the game. We continued to struggle on the offensive line all
night. They went through a segment probably from the 11-minute mark on in the
second half where they got in my opinion particularly more aggressive than we
did. Made some first-pass shots that were very, very aggressive and then
certainly Lyndsey Medders stepped up, got aggressive on the on-ball play and
we just, you know, just saw Iowa possession on possession and separate
themselves while we continued to struggle to make shots and find a way to
score.  
  
Q. Shana, can you talk a little bit about, seemed like you guys were
struggling from the outside and then you were, you got the ball more, it was
your career high in attempts. Can you talk about how you factored in the
offense today?  
SHANA WHEELER: Coming into the game we knew for post that we had a chance to
score a lot. And just get a lot of points inside. And I think just showing our
presence in the paint was a big part of our offense this game.  
  
Q. Deb, at one point I think you guys were just like 3 of 21 of the field
but you were only down 1. Did you feel okay half time with the shooting and
still being in this thing?  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, I said very much the same thing to my team at half that
I felt very good about where we were at considering we had struggled so much
offensively and yet it's 24-20. They hadn't necessarily cut loose.  
So I was very pleased with our defense. I thought the rebounding was even at
that point by and large. So you know it really just didn't come down to who
was going to make plays and separate themselves offensively in the second
half.  
But, yes, I felt very good about where we had positioned ourselves considering
the ineffectiveness of our shot-making ability in the first half in what was,
you know, just pretty much a slump fest and not a real pretty offensive first
half by either team.  
  
Q. Deb, could you talk about Shana and what she did today?  
COACH PATTERSON: She was absolutely tremendous today. She showed big to the
ball. Wanted it just about every trip up the floor, showed herself as a big
presence, was a good finisher for us. And I liked her defense. I thought
particularly in the first half she was very effective causing deflections and
rebounding the ball and just very proud of the overall game she brought in a
game that we hoped to establish the inside game as a major priority.  
And I thought she did step up and really was a good finisher with that. You
can see by the numbers that we shot a lot of 3s and probably more than it was
prudent to do considering we had Shana as effective as she was in the night.  
But I think it's players trying to make plays. I think we took more guarded 3s
tonight than we have in other nights when we struggled.  
But Shana was just a great presence in every respect and I think played the
best -- she was obviously the best player we had on the floor tonight.  
  
Q. Deb, do you think WNIT is, do you want to play in that again?  
COACH PATTERSON: I would love the opportunity to play in the WNIT. You know,
we finished above 500. It's been one long stretch since we've won a basketball
game. But I think to be considered in that evaluation is the fact we're
playing in a great league and I hope the WNIT will take that into
consideration. I know a lot of times close doesn't matter. But I do believe
that certainly the top 12 teams in this league this year are more than
competent to be great WNIT tournament field teams.  
And I would love for our team to have the opportunity to be in the WNIT in
spite of the fact it's been a long time since we've won a game.  
I certainly have a very strong desire to continue to coach this team and to
see us have that opportunity.  
  
Q. Shalee, can you talk about that. You've been battling, but obviously it
gets a little frustrating. You've lost six in a row. If you are able to play
in the WNIT, are you looking forward to that opportunity of not facing a Big
12 in the next game?  
SHALEE LEHNING: It would be a great opportunity, we'd love to continue our
season give us more of an opportunity to continue competing and working on
things we need to work on and just getting better. Coming together as a team.
And so, yes, if we have that opportunity we definitely need to maximize
everything that we can get out of this season and we can't look at the past if
we have a chance to get into the WNIT it's a new season so maybe this will be
a way for us to get our feet on the ground.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2007

  

### [Jasmina Ilic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13849)

### [Kathy McConnell-
Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14195)

### [Jackie McFarland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16379)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MODERATOR: We're now joined by Colorado Coach Kathy McConnell-Miller, two
players, Jackie McFarlund and Jasmina Ilic. If you would please, Coach, make
some comments about today's game and congratulations on the win and your
thoughts and then we'll take questions.  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: Thank you. You know, I'm just really pleased and proud
to be sitting up here with these two ladies. They were phenomenal today. It
was a total team effort. I told her before the game that I wanted to coach
another day with her, to come in here tonight and to win a game post-season.  
I'm excited. I know they are. When we left the locker room, we talked about a
lot of things we don't typically talk about as far as what happens in the win,
what happens, the excitement, moving on the energy, tournament time. We spent
a lot of time in the hotel room talking about that. We watched film again this
morning in a more relaxed, casual way. We think the preparation today was
different than we've had all year.  
Bottom line, these two stepped up, made big plays, made their free throws, and
it was a battle against Texas Tech. It was a great challenge for us, start to
finish with the pressure, their on-ball screens. Made some adjustments in the
second half that made the difference in the game on the defensive end.
However, we are here to play another day against Texas A&M.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about facing Texas Tech without Chesley Dapp in the
lineup?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: I think this is the first game without Chesley Dabbs
in the lineup. I think the first game before, she was not playing with the
team. So on film, they are a different team with her. They won one game since
she's been out of the lineup, not in the rotation. It's been a struggle for
them.  
But I'll tell you what -- the films I've watched, they've been in games at the
end, joining to make shots, joining Patrice Edwards and Robertson, what can
you say? The girl has done everything but strap the team on her back. It's
hard for me to say with or without, because we didn't the first time around.  
  
Q. Coach, will you talk about Jackie's resiliency. She's got people all over
and she scored I think 9 of your last 11 points and got the assist on the
other.  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: I'm not sure how she does it with her body. If you
ever read anything I've ever said about Jackie McFarlund, the bottom line, she
does not take a playoff, not in practice, not in games. The only time she does
is when she should. In practice, we had a rotation, five possessions and
possession work, and I will have to tell her to stay in 2 out 3. The next
thing, I turn around, she's in the fourth and fifth possession, she's playing
somebody out.  
I'm surprised at the amount of minutes she can play. I'm surprised what she
does with her size on the block. But the bottom line is she's a great student,
she's a great player. She's wonderful for the University of Colorado, and it's
all about her preparation. It's all about her work. And I love coaching her. I
know when I design something out of a huddle, she's going to make it or she's
going to get to the free throw line.  
She's just a tough player.  
  
Q. Kathy, for you and Jackie, was the backdoor lay-up to Whitney, was that a
call play? Because it looked like they kept sagging to the middle, especially
as soon as she got the ball wide open in the corner.  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: Jackie has faced double teams and triple teams all
year. We go -- Jackie's ability to pass out of the double or triple teams. And
I thought today she passed out particularly well. We typically pass out to a
shooter, but anyone that watches us knows in a lot of senses teams don't guard
Whitney Houston. They typically double with her or sit her on top of Jackie.
Whitney, being active, they hit her in the corner a little bit, and she's
usually maybe a screener or passer, but I thought Whitney's cut to the basket
I thought was -- two of them were key for us. It's all about the double teams
that Jackie has to handle.  
  
Q. Two-part question. First of all, what did you say to your team to
overcome the turnovers because they were hitting you pretty hard in the first
half? You had to make a adjustments.  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: I saw Whitney Houston.  
  
Q. And the energy she brings to your team, what does she really bring for
your team?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: She's a freshman. And she's an exciting player. You
know, when she's sitting on the bench next to me, if she said it once, she
says it 30 times, "I'm ready, Coach," as soon as I pull her out. It's almost
as if I hear it as I go to sleep at night. She's the player that's hard to
keep off the floor because she keeps rebounding and keeps balls alive, goes on
the defensive end. Her decision making. She hasn't played a lot of point guard
in her life, so trying to score, taking care of the ball, vision defenses,
it's an ongoing teaching process with us.  
And some days you get more frustrated than others, but today I thought she did
a better job of reading. Once you sit her, she has time to evaluate. I think
she gets it a little bit better. We do need her on the floor because of the
energy she gives and I love coaching her.  
  
Q. Jasmina, you had the first 11 points, or first 11 and 14 points for
Colorado in the second half. Can you talk about that a little bit?  
JASMINA ILIC: I'm pretty sure they made a adjustment to double Jackie in the
post so that would put out a little for me. Because they were helping and
rotating so I was being open off Kara's screens. So I tried to knock those
off.  
  
Q. Jackie, you seemed like you played one of those games today as a senior,
don't want my career to be over. I mean, you had big numbers all year, but
talk about the focus and you didn't want it to end today.  
JACKIE McFARLUND: No, I didn't. I think more than anything I was just really
excited to be here at this tournament. We were the top seed for the first time
since I've been here. I have a lot of friends and family that live here in
Oklahoma City.  
You're right, I didn't want it to end. I have too many people here watching.
It's been a good season. I think it will help us -- however we do in this
tournament will help us into next year.  
  
Q. Coach, not too much time to enjoy this victory. Can you talk about the
match up tomorrow with A &M?   
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: You know, we do turn the ball over quite a bit. Their
full court pressure is something we need to be concerned with. Not necessarily
full court, just the amount of pressure that they put on the basketball. And
for us it's key that we make sure we take care of it. And in the first half, I
got the stat sheet. I think we had turned the ball over 10 times at that
point.  
And I just explained to the ladies that we didn't even have an opportunity to
score. We're not even in the game. We're basically giving it back to them. I
said you're starting down 10 with the way we're turning the basketball over.
So against A&M it's always a struggle. We feel like we have a pretty solid
front line with Jackie, Jasmina and Kara. Most teams have to make adjustments
for them with their personalities as well. Jackie, high-percentage shooter,
and Jasmina is great with the basketball, and Kara is a great complement. We
need our guards to step up and take care of the ball.  
  
Q. Going back to something you said at the beginning, you said key second-
half adjustments you guys made. Can you talk about those, what were they?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: Biggest thing I thought we were struggling with the
on-the-ball screen, not necessarily on the wing but at the top of the key. I
thought Murphree was getting in the lane and Christian was getting in the
lane. If they weren't scoring, they were finding a scorer. We made an
adjustment about the 10-minute mark to trap the ball, regardless of where they
were on the screen on top. They struggled to get out of the pass on them a
little bit. Should have taken a little bit more time. I thought we were more
in tune on the defensive end. But that adjustment I thought gave us energy,
got a few turnovers and that led to some scores on the offensive end.  
I think we talked a lot about how to guard Myrick and how to guard Edwards.
Myrick is the player we try to eliminate her touches, and Robertson is one we
don't give angles to. I didn't think we did a great job in the first 30
minutes of identifying personnel, but when we went back and reviewed it, we
did a better job of that in the second half.  
  
Q. Jackie, did you realize during that game how many times you guys were
turning it over or did you have to wait for the coach to point that out?  
JACKIE McFARLUND: I realized it in the first, especially in the first four
minutes, I would think it was. I think we either had shots in the first, you
know, five, ten seconds of the shot clock. We didn't get a shot off, I know. I
was getting frustrated from a post point of view because me and Kara, I don't
think we probably had shots in those first four minutes.  
And a lot of it was because of the turnovers, but I think we were just really,
really excited at the beginning. It was a team that we knew it was a good
match-up for us and we wanted to go out there and make the plays, and I think
we forced a little too much.  
  
Q. Coach, after playing Texas Tech twice now, can you talk about the job
that Kristy Curry has done with this Texas Tech team, what you expect to see
her from her teams in the future?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: I think she's a great coach, amazing recruiter. If you
look at what her teams have done, I think she's phenomenal. I think she's
going to be great. She's wonderful in the State of Texas as far as being
received by recruits and high school coaches. Her style is just fight. She's
like myself in that there's just -- the energy about her. If you were at the
game in Boulder, it was a battle.  
It was 40 minutes, I think the score was 70-67, or 71-67. I think Kristy's
great. I think her staff is wonderful. Starts with her recruiting and she's a
great recruiter.  
MODERATOR: Congratulations. We look forward to seeing you guys tomorrow
against A&M.

### [Taylor McIntosh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16922)

### [Shaquine Mosley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16923)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, Coach. And would you like to make some
comments about tonight's game and maybe your upcoming opponent tomorrow
evening.  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: I thought for us offensively to be in such a good
rhythm, not many nights we shoot 50 percent in the first half and we're still
down at the half.  
But because offensively, we had pretty good rhythm, I thought we did. I
thought our zone was effective and there weren't a lot of uncontested shots
for Oklahoma State, and I thought we flew around and defense, we tried to
battle and communicated pretty well. I know the zone looked like
(indiscernible) but we were trying to pass things off and play next and at
times we did a good job, at times we didn't. But not much in transition really
much for either team.  
But we've got some young kids. When they went into to the triangle for one,
and let's start screaming for Shaq and let her run up for some looks on the
baseline. And she's got great footwork. And Sharita sets a great screen for
Danielle hits in the corner, puts up for 6. A lot of kids did a lot of little
things to help us win tonight.  
  
Q. Bonnie, how did Taylor's game, especially after the injury, how much did
that help your victory?  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: She should have knocked her on her face a long time
ago. That's what I said to her. And Rashidat didn't mean to do it. It was on a
screen and she was trying to get through the screen. But there was so much
room in the middle, the zone, because of how wide the 2-3 was played. But kept
saying keep flashing and penetrating. We've done such a good job in man
offenses, penetrating to either pull up or make the extra pass. We said it's
going to be the same concept in that zone. There's going to be room in the
middle. Let Taylor kind of float around, especially when we played some 4 out
with Danielle and the guard pretty much had they got their heads up.  
And early in the first half she got herself pinned underneath the rim a little
bit. To shoot it, she's got it on top of her head and then knocking it down in
the second half. I said, "Don't get your cut but stay out from underneath the
rim so then you can make a move off one leg and kind of get away from someone
who is trailing you. Because there was going to be a lot of one-on-ones from
inside. But a lot of that came off of penetration and some great passes by the
guards in the lane. And I've said all along, when she shoots confidently,
she's very, very good and she's capable around the rim. She did a great job
for us.  
  
Q. Coach, what's this win mean for this program the way you have struggled
this year and coming back late and playing so well?  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: For us, I just had great respect for this group about
how resilient they've been, and I understand from a media standpoint about
when we were struggling to find a way to win, Coach, how has practice been or
when we finally won. They'll say practice will be so much better now. And I
say actually it will probably be like it's been. They've not cashed it in.
They've not called it quits.  
Even back when we were struggling and getting close and after we won and
finally beat Colorado at home, it was practice as it had been. Great energy,
great effort, great enthusiasm for what we were trying to do. Great pride in
that we had gotten better and we were working hard.  
And our chemistry was really good. They've been coachable. They've been really
resilient and have shown a lot of fortitude, and you need that this time of
the year. As I said, only those of us in the locker room really understand how
much better we have gotten and how good you've been with each other to get to
this point.  
Because they didn't get frustrated with each other and they didn't call it
quits on each other. They've really grown even stronger and stronger as we've
struggled. And obviously they've had the opportunity and deserve the
opportunity to enjoy their success together.  
  
Q. Taylor, can you talk a little bit about -- I know offensively you've been
coming around a lot -- just how much you felt comfortable and confident out
there, especially you had three right-handed lay-ups. And I know that's been a
little bit of a challenge. Just talk about that.  
TAYLOR McINTOSH: Like I said, I feel more confident and it started in
practice. Coach said you won't shoot it in a game unless you start shooting it
in practice.  
I think ever since, I just got tired of losing, as everyone else did on the
team. I just tried to step up offensively, be available. And then when they
pass, the guards pass, especially Shaq, just make the shot.  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: I text messaged a long time ago, right about the time
we came back from Nebraska and I thought she played really well. I sent her a
text that next day because we were off on that Sunday. I said, "Listen,
Taylor, you're doing what you're supposed to do. I thought your effort was
great." Then she sent me a text saying, "Coach, I'm trying to be the offensive
threat you wanted in the post." She's taken that and embraced that and tried
to do what she's capable of doing. Played with a lot more confidence in and
around the rim.  
  
Q. Coach, what kind of challenges did Andrea Riley pose to you guys coming
in? How did you plan to stop her? And for Shaq, how did you stop her? How did
you hold her so quiet in the second half?  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: Well, the plan wasn't to stop her, certainly to
contain her. I made the analogy I think to -- it might have been on a TV
interview yesterday for the media here that her growth has kind of mirrored
our growth as a team. We've gotten a lot better but she's gotten a lot better.
Because their place, she exceeded her speed limit a little bit.  
She's very, very quick, but got, you know, got herself where she made plays
fast and she didn't make good decisions, and I think she might have had five
or six turnovers. She doesn't do that anymore.  
She's got a lot more poise as she grown in her freshman year. Done a great job
with this team and certainly a big reason why they had so much success. It
wasn't to stop her but we had to contain her. We had eight and ones, and I
think she had four of them. We just fouled her and I thought we made her take
some tough shots. We still fouled her a little too much. We tried to get Shaq
in. Shaq didn't have the match up a whole lot. Tried to get underneath her,
flatten her out, don't play into her hand. Some sets are designed for her to
penetrate at a shooter, and we tried to take that away and bring some help
from all the way across the floor.  
But Shaq, I said, "Use your athleticism but be on balance with her and don't
gamble and be on balance with her. We're not going to try to pick the kid's
pocket. Not going to happen. But stay underneath, stay underneath, and then
make her take a tough shot.  
SHAQUINA MOSLEY: Well, Bonnie just told me in the locker room that I don't
need to jump back as much because she had to step back. So she stepped in and
stepped back and take a pull-up jumper. So I tried just tried to not jump back
as much so I could contain her and I could contest her shot if she went up.  
  
Q. What does this game do for Oklahoma State's chances to make it to the
NCAA tournament?  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: I think they should still be in there. They had a
great run. They had a successful lead. This is a tough league to win games in.
I agree with Kurt. I thought before coming in they didn't need a win to make
their case. I think they should be in.  
  
Q. Now you look forward to facing Baylor again. Two-part question here.
Number one, your early thoughts about facing Baylor again and how different is
this team now than when you faced them earlier this season?  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: How different are we or how different is Baylor?
Well, I think we're different in that we're offensively certainly playing with
a lot more confidence. Our rhythm is better. Our game, again, we're similar. I
think we play Baylor and then go to Oklahoma. I think they're back-to-back
games. I believe at our place we play them at home then go to Stillwater.  
Obviously they have got tremendously talented players and we'll have our hands
full defensively and we'll have a game plan in place similar for our kids
tomorrow night. But they're better. Wilson's better. (Indiscernible) is
better. (Indiscernible) has always been good. Mosley has always been good.  
Kim's not upset about the talent she has on the team, I promise you. So we
have got to play well and play well for 40 minutes tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Shaq, I'm not sure I did my homework right, but looks like you and
Danielle Green are both part of the national championship team at Central
Arizona. If that's true, there was a part that was back and forth between you
two. And what's that like with an ex-teammate who you probably know well?  
SHAQUINA MOSLEY: Well, Brisa is on that team (indiscernible) and Cordero, No.
24. Danielle is a talented kid. And she's great, like, on and off the court.
So I mean I know it's going to be a tough matchup with her because I knew in
practices it was hard to guard her.  
I mean, we did our best. She hit some tough shots. And I mean people are going
to hit it all year. I mean, there's nothing much that you can really do about
that. She's a really talented kid.  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: Great respect, and I'm probably the luckiest one in
the room because I got to watch them do that and then watch them compete
against each other and great respect for each other.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you say to them when it came to the ball movement in the
last five minutes because they were executing and passing and then they hit
the free throws at the end, 85 percent?  
COACH BONNIE HENRICKSON: We talked about when we get to the free throw line,
go up there and shoot with confidence and focus on making it because a lot of
people that make free throws are focusing but they're focusing on missing it,
not making it. So we said focus on making a free throw.  
But offensively we really tried to get to the short corners. We put Danielle.
We went to 4 out one in, put Shaq at the free throw line and let her find a
gap. Then we put Danielle at the short corner, when the bottom of the zone
came out, we cut her to the short.  
It's a busted play that Sharita just, as a senior, just has the sense about
her to step in and set a screen. And Danielle is screaming for the ball in the
corner opposite of our bench, and Shaq has the vision to see it, skips it,
Rita gets a piece of Catic on the bottom. It's an uncontested 3. So share the
basketball, which I don't have to lecture them about. They let go of it.
They're unselfish. They don't care. They don't look at stat sheets. They want
to win. That's all these kids have wanted to do all year.  
Just good movement and spacing and then let Taylor run around in the middle a
little bit, see if she can get a catch.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa State. Coach, opening comments.  
COACH FENNELLY: I told the team to move your name to the right of the bracket.
It's a big win for our game. We're looking forward to playing tomorrow. But
that was a hard fought game. Not the most aesthetic thing I've ever seen. But
this time of year, it's the ultimate to survive in advance. And our team
survived a very good team today, I thought.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your play in the second half -- you looked far more
assertive. Was it something you were doing in the first half or was it not in
the first half.  
AMANDA NISLEIT: It wasn't going as good in the first half. Guards were doing a
fantastic job on the ball inside. I got a couple good shots up. And it helped
getting us into flow of things.  
  
Q. Lyndsey, what was the difference in halves?  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: I think taking care of the ball was a big thing for us.
Offensively we couldn't score for a stretch of the time. We talked about at
half time as far as getting movement, getting better shots. And I think we
even did a really good job there for a stretch in the second half as far as
catching the ball on the block, scoring. But defensively we did a pretty good
job in both halves. I think offense just picked it up there in the second.  
  
Q. Lyndsey, not to bring up a bad memory, but did this feel like the
Oklahoma State game a little bit in the fact that the offense, the shots were
open, you're not hitting and then things just weren't going for you guys? Did
it feel like that game at all?  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: Little bit. You wouldn't think as a senior, you wouldn't be
the most nervous person. I haven't had as many butterflies in a game. I know
myself the enthusiasm wasn't there like we talked about the Oklahoma State
game, but once we got our rhythm, the offensive got the cobwebs out and felt
better.  
  
Q. Late in the game you took a three-point shot and made it. That was your
third three-point basket against a Big 12 team. What prompted you to take that
shot?  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: In practice coach told me to take it if I was open. I was
wide open. Thought I'd throw it up there.  
  
Q. Toccara, you're talking about playing the inside players in the game in
Manhattan. Sweat had a big game and Wheeler had a big game. What did you do
against Sweat to slow her down a little bit tonight?  
TOCCARA ROSS: One of the things we wanted to do was double team her, get the
ball out of her hands. It's something we did pretty well tonight. On the
offensive side we wanted to get the ball inside. Obviously when we got inside
we tried to score.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: I don't know. I wish I had the answer. You approach your last
Big 12 tournament and I've enjoyed everything that I've done in this league
and I don't know what it was. But I got them all out and thank God my
teammates kind of carried us through in the first half. But I wish I could
explain it but I can't.  
It's just part excitement, part nervousness. Just a combination of a lot.  
  
Q. Lyndsey, this is the first time this building has hosted a meaningful
basketball game in years and years and years. What did you think of this
building as a basketball venue?  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: I think it's fantastic. I think Oklahoma City has done a
great job as far as embracing all our teams. Everyone has been really kind and
nice and generous. And then as far as a basketball facility I think it's
great. Our fans were loud as ever and there seemed to be a decent amount of
people in the stands and it's an exciting place to be at.  
Kind of reminded me a bit of Kansas City as far as venue. I think it's a great
location for a Big 12 tournament.  
  
Q. Lyndsey, you mentioned butterflies. They were gone late, but you had kind
of an interesting trip to the scorer's table there.  
(Laughter)  
Don't look at me. You better explain that. Even the refs are laughing.  
LYNDSEY MEDDERS: I have abnormally large feet for someone of my size. I think
the line jumped -- I don't know what it was. I was so excited to get back in
the game. I can show you my feet. They're huge. I tripped over them. I was
actually looking through the media guide before and one of the questions they
asked this in the season, what's the funniest thing that happened to you in a
game. And I got ran into. I got a couple of shoot-outs over the years, it's
just the nature of my athleticism I guess is what I like to call it.  
(Laughter)  
Q. Bill, obviously K State, no surprise 1-2, made pointers in this game. In
the first half did you feel like you were seeing two imposter teams nobody
could hit anything?  
COACH FENNELLY: It was tough. I thought both teams defended it real well. We
had open looks, didn't make it. Sometimes it's the nature of the facility.
Sometimes it's defense. Sometimes it's nerves. Sometimes there's a lot of
reasons; but, yes, it was not a great shooting performance by two teams that
normally shoot the ball well. But I think you have to also give some credit to
the defensive effort of both teams to chase shots off, chase people off the
shots and I thought we did that for the most part.  
But it was a game where there were some looks available but neither one of
them hit them at the right time. We hit a couple. Lyndsey hit a big one.
Obviously Nicky, as big a 3 as she's hit in a long time. We were fortunate to
make a couple. Not enough. But hopefully we can shoot a little better
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Along those same lines, looks like Allison's 3-pointer loosened the team
up. Did you feel that way, that it was the one that got your offense going?  
COACH FENNELLY: Great play. Lyndsey made a great ball taking the ball to the
basket. They had a good look at it. We told our kids, you got a shot, shoot
it. We were missing some. But it was a grinded out game. You get a six point
lead, you felt you were way ahead at that point. I think it did energize the
team. Energized the bench.  
Obviously she's a freshman going through this for the first time. I think she
defended better after that. So that was a big play. And especially in a game
like this. It was so hard to score. You separate from three points to six,
that's a pretty big margin in a game like this.  
  
Q. Nicky, just kind of talk about how different this year is as opposed to
last year. Obviously a much bigger role this year. What's the difference
between this year and last year and what have you learned in another year of
play?  
NICKY WIEBEN: One thing I can say, we had Brittany Wilkins here, she was an
unbelievable post player. I knew when she left, I knew I had a pretty big fill
there. We did really good. And Toccara came in, and she's playing well on the
post. We all worked on the inside post. Go inside, outside. We can go to the
3s. I think overall as a team we've really developed a lot over the summer and
carrying on to the end of the year.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2007

  

### [Jody Conradt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13898)

### [Tiffany Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13843)

### [Katrina Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16918)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The Longhorns have now joined us at the podium. Coach,
congratulations on the 900th win in your career.  
COACH CONRADT: Thank you.  
MODERATOR: And if you would make some comments about tonight's game and then
anything else you'd like to make comments about.  
COACH CONRADT: First of all, I have the seniors on this team with me. I
thought it's their team, it's their wish to extend this season, and I thought
they had their team ready to play tonight.  
I thought we were really terrific in the first half. We controlled the tempo.
We pushed the basketball and we really made a statement about how we can play.  
Second half, we sputtered around a bit. It hurts us, obviously, when Carla
Cortijo gets fouled. We have no options at the point except for Tiffany to
move up there. And she does a good job with that. But we're really trying to
keep some kind of offensive flow going when that happened.  
I thought Katrina -- and I wanted her to be here because I thought she made a
difference in the game tonight. I thought when she came in, Riddle had a lot
more difficulty scoring and our team is about defense. I don't think there's
any question about that. We have to be really good defensively to win, because
we have offensive limitations, which I think are pretty obvious.  
But when we push the basketball, shoot lay ups, shoot 60.5%, then we've had a
really good night.  
The last thing on my mind is 900 wins. I didn't even remember it, because with
this team, you have to think about the next possession. That's all you can
focus on.  
  
Q. Jody, you said yesterday, "We need to win. That's what we need to do to
take care of our post-season." Is it still just tell your team, we need to
win, keep winning, or do you feel good?   
COACH CONRADT: I think that's obvious. I'm not going to feel comfortable about
anything in the post-season. I don't think we can control anything. It's been
the same story for quite some time now.  
We pulled out all stops, so I think we have the only three people in the state
of Oklahoma who are willing to be our hostess and we're Texas, and they showed
up. And today they did their part. They took us to practice at a church.  
So we're doing everything we can to extend our season, and hopefully some of
it will work.  
  
Q. This is to the coach and Tiffany. How good is it to have support when you
look up and see your teammates getting double doubles for at least four or
five out there with you?  
TIFFANY JACKSON: I think it's huge. There's several people on our team that
have that capability. It's something that we can expect that can happen every
night. It's just a matter if we go out and do it.  
So it's really exciting to know, and I think it's good as far as the trust
factor, I think everybody can trust everybody now, and that's huge.  
  
Q. Coach, you may not have been thinking about 900 wins, but how nice is it
to get it and also get it behind you?  
COACH CONRADT: Well, again, you know, I thought for a while, when we were
having so much trouble and people kept reminding me of it, I thought, well,
everybody is going to try to get 900. I don't know how many people are going
to try to get 899. That might have been more unique.  
But obviously this was a big win, because it extended our season, because we
keep playing. And regardless of what this team has gone through, some ups and
some downs, they've been a really good group to try to stay focused.  
Every day they come to practice the same way. They work hard. They try to do
what the coaches ask them to do. And they need to have some success to be
rewarded for what they have gone through this season.  
  
Q. Katrina and Tiffany, can you talk about your play on Riddle, because I
know for a while she had like 16 points, and then you all basically shut her
down to what she eventually had.  
COACH CONRADT: That's when Katrina went to guard her. You're exactly right.  
  
Q. Katrina, can you talk about that.  
KATRINA ROBINSON: When I went into the game, I made sure I played my
principles. And Riddle is left-handed. I play on her right shoulder because
she would come right to me. If she got the ball -- I was trying to make it
where she didn't get it, but if she did get it, I made sure I played on her
right shoulder and tried to play good defense.  
  
Q. Jody, could you elaborate on the church thing?  
COACH CONRADT: Well, because the game started at noon today, everybody had 20
minutes on this floor. We needed longer than that, so our hostess had told us
last night that there was a very nice gym that was relatively new at a church
and it was an Episcopal church. I think you call the ministers there father,
too.  
He showed up. It was something that you sort of look at it and say, okay,
maybe there is an omen here. Maybe there is something that will help us out. I
couldn't get back there. We didn't leave bread crumbs or anything.  
But it was across town and we had a very nice preparation with a little more
time than we would have gotten had we come.  
  
Q. Also could you elaborate on your pregame speech. Your team seemed very
focused and relaxed.  
COACH CONRADT: I don't think that I said anything profane or profound. I think
it was about this is win or go home. And we talked about everybody here is
going to be playing one and done. So ours started a little bit earlier than
everyone else's, and I haven't had to say a lot about that to this team. I
think they're smart and they understand that we have to win.  
  
Q. Coach, just your thoughts on Oklahoma tomorrow.  
COACH CONRADT: You didn't let me enjoy this one very much, right?  
(Laughter).  
COACH CONRADT: We know Oklahoma very well. Obviously this will be our third
time to play them. One time we had success and one time we didn't. They're
really good. I think they're a challenge and it starts with Courtney Paris. No
question she's a unique player in our game now. And we have to do an excellent
job of making it difficult for her in terms of second-chance opportunities in
terms of getting where she wants to get on the floor.  
And at the same time we have to guard their perimeter people. What makes any
team good is that they have a strong inside-out game, and they do. And I think
it's been well documented that they've made some lineup changes. And when they
did, their perimeter game became a lot more potent, and we know that it will
be a challenge for us.  
We are concerned about our ability to recover but it is what it is and I
believe this team will give their all-out effort to try to keep playing.  
  
Q. Tiffany, scoring, rebounding, running the point, directing traffic out
there, doing it all. How important is it for you to do it all right now and
what does your last go-around bring?  
TIFFANY JACKSON: I think we feel an acute sense of urgency, especially me
being a senior and it's my last go around. After the Kansas, I think it was, I
told my team I was committed to doing whatever they needed me to do regardless
of what it was, and that's what I just tried to step up into.  
  
Q. Coach, Brittainey scored double digits in the last three games. How has
she progressed at the end of the season?  
COACH CONRADT: I have some gray hair and a lot of these have Brittainey
Raven's name on them. She's the little girl with the curl. Remember that one?
When she's good, she's really, really good. When she's bad, she's not so good.
I just don't know what she's going to do. If I could explain it, I would
definitely tell you. But I know when she takes off, something is going to
happen. I just don't know which way it's going.  
But I think she's as explosive a player, as quick a player, has incredible
speed. It's just we don't know how it's all going to turn out. But tonight it
turned out, particularly in the first half, really well.  
  
Q. Jody, I think you've called Tiffany the most versatile player you've ever
had. Can you just talk about having her, her ability to move to the point and
your confidence, I guess, in extending the season with a player like her?  
COACH CONRADT: I don't want to slight anybody else in this program because
I've had a lot of really, really good players. I have to say it might be 1-A
and 1-B with her and Andrea Lloyd because Andrea was capable of doing the same
kind of thing. But that was a long time ago.  
And today we're talking about Tiffany. Tiffany is incredibly intelligent.
Basketball IQ is very high. I've talked about that. So when you are handling
the ball, which she has the ability to do, it's about making decisions, and
it's about getting everybody else involved and making them better. And Tiffany
does that.  
And she really is our only option when Carla is not on the floor right now.
It's hard to take her away from the bucket. It's hard to take her out of the
paint because of her rebounding and her ability to draw the double team and
create things offensively.  
But if you don't get the ball down the court and get it in position to run an
offense, it's not going to be good. And Tiffany has the ability to do that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, ladies.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Andrea Riley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16924)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Oklahoma State has joined us. Coach, comments about tonight's
game.  
COACH BUDKE: Obviously we're very disappointed. We've been playing much better
basketball than that. But I want to, first of all, congratulate Bonnie and her
team.  
I think they did an excellent job tonight. They came in knowing that they, you
know, that they have to win this tournament to move on. And they played with a
little more desperation than we did tonight.  
And they did a great job. I give them all the credit in the world. We're not
going to win very many games when you shoot 19% in the second half. And we
haven't done that -- we haven't done that since we started this whole thing at
Texas Tech a long time ago.  
But these kids always give their all and we just came up a little short in
these conference tournaments things like this happen. And it happened to us
tonight.  
  
Q. You said all along you had done enough to get into the NCAA tournament no
matter. We're going to find out. State your case on why you're confident
you're still going to get in.  
COACH BUDKE: First, you look at the RPI at the league at 2, you look at the
strength 1 through 12 in this conference. 6 of our 9 losses before tonight
were to the top 15 teams. Three of the losses came at the buzzer.  
So this is a team that it was very close to not even being 8 and 8. We could
have been 11-5 very easily. I just think our league actually deserves seven.
We're sitting here talking about six. I don't know how you could keep Texas
out of here.  
I think Texas is a very good team also that deserves to be in the tournament.
So you know it was one bad night. It was one bad night. Hopefully they look at
your body of work and where you've come as an inexperienced team at the
beginning of the year to where you're at right now.  
And I'm still confident that we're in, because of the strength of our league
and you saw that with Kansas tonight. Very good team.  
  
Q. Coach, do you think this is going to take your team to the next level
that they'll use this like a situation like A &M was a few years ago, and it
will help them be better? Because this is her first year in going to the next
level, coach?   
COACH BUDKE: It's both their first years in playing in this type of setting.
You know, we ran into this again when we started this whole thing at Texas
Tech. This is the first time in the Big 12 tournament. It's tough on these
kids.  
It's tough playing an 8:30 game. I'd rather play the noon game than waiting
around all day long, watching the scores come across. Seeing games on TV.  
And it's an adjustment for my team. And no doubt we'll learn from this. And I
don't think it will happen again.  
  
Q. We'll have both Andrea and Kurt address this. But you've been shooting
the ball well behind the arc recently, but tonight looked like you settled for
working the ball, go one of 16 in the second half. Were you trying to work the
inside a little more especially when it wasn't going in early in the second
half?  
COACH BUDKE: We just didn't have very much continuity tonight. I didn't think
we flowed any time tonight. You have to credit KU with that. They did a great
job defensively. Shots that we normally hit, there was a time it was like
42-41 that we missed three or four free throws in a row and they threw three
or four out of bounds, that that's where I thought the separation could have
came right in that area right there.  
And we didn't take advantage of it. I knew when we didn't take advantage of it
it was going to be a tough night for us.  
  
Q. Andrea, like you said, you played so well the last seven, eight, nine
games. You learned from some of your mistakes, but then in the second half
looked like some of the stuff you went through in January. Talk about the
second half compared to the first half and some of your recent games why it
didn't click as well for you.  
ANDREA RILEY: Well, the first half we started off a little bad, and then we,
like, we started coming together. But then like the second half we started
trying to do individual things. That's not what we're about.  
We should play as a team. And I mean it just seemed like we all wasn't on the
same page tonight.  
COACH BUDKE: I think you saw a nervous team tonight. A nervous team tonight.  
  
Q. Andrea and Danielle, either one of you, what do you all take away from
this and work on as you await finding out if you're in the NCAA tournament or
possibly an NIT bid?  
DANIELLE GREEN: I think we'll work on tossing the ball in the zone, getting
into our stuff early and just hitting shots and playing D, really. That's
about it.  
  
Q. Danielle, Andrea, he said you got nervous sitting around watching scores
come in, and now you have to wait five, six days to watch scores around the
country come through. What are your emotions going to be before you hear your
fate, how will you try to handle that?  
DANIELLE GREEN: It's going to be hard. You just want to get out there and
play. That's when I know the team is going to be ready. We do make it, we're
going to be ready this time.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Kristy Curry, Patrice Edwards, Brooke
Baughman and Alesha Robertson. Coach, your thoughts about today's game?  
COACH CURRY: There's a lot to say. It's kind of how things have been done for
us. We've been close, but close doesn't really count. And I think the thing
about it, I'm proud of the team and they've been great as people. I've been at
Texas Tech. I think they have a foundation for what we're about to do in the
future.  
When we came in, we had our work cut out for us. The more work, the more I
like it. We're working on it every day to get it back, and we'll go do that.
Plays a big part and we'll try to emphasize it.  
  
Q. Kristy, how hard is it to wear down Jackie McFarland? As she plays 40
minutes, it doesn't seem like she really tires at all.  
COACH CURRY: She does a good job. Seems like they just never get tired. They
play so hard and, to me, they're really similar in how they play. Just give
her credit. She did a great job today, especially from the free throw line.
That's pretty obvious. Wish we could have kept her off the line a little bit.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you're not big on what ifs or excuses, but how tough was it
going down the stretch without Chesley, without her.  
COACH CURRY: I'm not going to make an excuse. You roll up your sleeves with
her gone. Bottom line was it is what it is. And it's something we can't
control. And it's obviously something how do we jump back.  
As far as the staff, we tried to fill that role and to find a way. There was
just no way in the stretch that we were able to do that. I think that's what
we tried to do. It's out of our control. We missed her plays. We missed her
presence. We missed her -- she gave us a confidence. She was that kind of
player at Tech. It is what it is.  
  
Q. Coach, did you feel like you had good looks at the end?  
COACH CURRY: Oh, my goodness. It's just indicative of the way it's gone. Maybe
like the last four minutes, we had some wide open looks, from 3, didn't go
down for us for whatever reason.  
Patrick, I'm not sure why this happened. I know we did everything we could,
and we're just -- we'll have better days ahead. We'll find a way.  
  
Q. Along those lines, you had to have been upset. They had so many turnovers
and yet you all couldn't pull away.  
COACH CURRY: It was our decision-making. In practice situations, we try to
bring in and talk and teach. Seemed like our decision-making just seemed to
jump up, caught us at critical times. Right at the end, 5.3 to doing that, I
don't understand that, but it is what it is.  
  
Q. Coach, down the stretch, having four players with four fouls, did that
make you guys have to relax a little bit?  
COACH CURRY: Not at all. That was really never talked about. We knew what was
happening. We couldn't focus on that. We had to come out and be aggressive. We
knew our bench could come in if they had to. We never really talked about
that. We told them how many they had if they forgot because sometimes they
forget.  
  
Q. Can you tell us about the emotions you're going through playing your last
game as a Lady Raider?  
ALESHA ROBERTSON: It's really hard. We fought hard. We did what we could, and
I don't know if it's sunk in yet, but I had a little talk with my teammates
after and told them to come back here and kick their butt and do it next year
and try to remember this. And yes, it's pretty hard, but just got to move on
and see what God has in store for us next and take that challenge.  
  
Q. Patrice and Coach, how tough was it -- you scored 13 points, and you only
played 14 minutes, for 6 and 7. How tough was that?  
PATRICE EDWARDS: That was pretty tough because I got into foul trouble kind of
early. It slowed things down, the more minutes that I got to play tonight, and
I think that put us in a bad situation.  
COACH CURRY: She said it best. She gets in foul trouble, it puts us in bad a
situation. Not just foul. She wasn't trying to foul. It's something we've been
working on. Just not putting her hands down. I guess her arms are so long and
she's so skinny that sometimes she's just so long that things don't go her
way. We've just been working on it and we got another one today. But we'll
keep working on it. She has some basketball left in her at Trinidad, so that
will be good.  
  
Q. Alesha, you seemed to, in a lot of instances, draw tough defensive
assignments, get banged around and beat up on the defensive end and then have
to come down and score, and you didn't play a lot of minutes. Talk about your
physical conditioning and what -- having played defense and the rebounds,
might take out of your offense. You also kind of lost some weight this year
and a little lighter. So how did that affect your game?  
ALESHA ROBERTSON: Yes, it's tough when you draw defense, but that's just one
things that players have to face and they have to find a way to get around it.
You're not going to unless you make a mental note that you are, that you have
to. So, yes, that's my personal deal and I've just got to find a way to get
around that.  
And I think God's given me a pretty good body that it won't break down. But
you just gotta go in there and fight and I'm just thankful that he put me in
the big 12 so that's a good blessing. And I'm very blessed and I'm glad I get
to do it. I'll fall down as many times as he wants me to.  
  
Q. Brooke, can you talk about what you're feeling right now?  
BROOKE BAUGHMAN: It was a good experience and you kind of come in face these
challenges. They don't always go the way you want them to. But like Alesha
said, we'll go on and face other challenges.  
  
Q. Brooke and Alesha, can you talk about being a part of a team together
after playing with each other throughout your whole basketball careers?  
ALESHA ROBERTSON: I just told Brooke in the locker room me her and Pat are
going to have to find a church league. But we're going to try to get on a team
together and do it all over again. But, yes, it's been a blessing with Brooke
being my point guard for a long time. We've played against each other in high
school and then she was my point guard in AAU, and she's been a blessing.
She's a great point guard and I'm glad that we've been together.  
She means a lot to me. I've got a lot of respect for her as a player and as a
person.  
BROOKE BAUGHMAN: Alesha is just a wonderful person. Every day I enjoy being
around her. I've definitely taken it for granted. I'm going to miss her, but
we'll still be friends and go on.  
  
Q. For the three players, coach talked about how you all have laid a
foundation, but what sort of foundation do you think you've laid, what sort of
future do you think the program has?  
PATRICE EDWARDS: I think the program has a great future. We have a lot of
great players coming in I think we'll have a team that's really balanced in
the next few years. She knows we really do care about winning and we really do
care about each other and I think that's important.  
ALESHA ROBERTSON: I think that next coming years are going to be awesome. I
think this coaching staff knows what they want and they're going to get it.
And they're awesome.  
One of the best coaching staffs I've ever had and they're a blessing, and I'm
glad I got to be a part of them and it's just a blessing. I'm very thankful to
be a part of that and they're going to get it done. So whoever is going
against Tech better watch out.  
PATRICE EDWARDS: I think we have a great coaching staff and players. They're
going to come in and this program is going to get back up to where it needs to
be.  
MODERATOR: Thank you very much. And congratulations on a good season. Good
luck in the future.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2007

  

### [Katie Gearlds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16881)

### [Erin Lawless](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16882)

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

### [Lindsay Wisdom-
Hylton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16907)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open to up with general comments from Coach Versyp and
then we'll go to the student athletes for questions. Sharon?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Well, this is an unbelievable evening for Purdue
University and this group of young women. You know, it's amazing what they
have gone through in order to be in this position tonight, being Big Ten
champs, and I can't say enough for them and what their dedication and their
belief in me and my staff, to go through this journey together and just be
able to end it this way. Obviously ending the Big Ten championship but going
on to the NCAA and hopefully doing some really great things.  
  
Q. Katie, did you have any sense before the game that you guys would get off
to that kind of a start?  
KATIE GEARLDS: You know, we talked about wanting to get off to a good start in
the first two games we got down by nine, ten points and we really wanted to
focus on getting a good start because it takes so much energy to battle back
when you start off like that.  
To start off 21-0, you can't say enough about our defensive job, finishing the
plays with rebounds, and we just pushed the ball in transition. You know,
sometimes we can kind of struggle if we have to set up in the half court, and
I thought we did a great job of really pushing the tempo and finding some good
looks.  
  
Q. Katie, your dad was saying that this is why you went to Purdue. Did the
reality look a lot like the dream? And secondly, what did you say to the bench
after you hit that one shot?  
KATIE GEARLDS: You know, you talk about going to Purdue and wanting to win
championships. You know, we felt like we were in the position this year; we
started off really well in the Big Ten and had two losses on our home court
that we let slip away. Both games we should have battled and won those games,
but we didn't. Those things happen for a reason.  
To come back here and win a championship in my hometown is something really
special.  
The shot, it was a step back, and as soon as I released it, coach said, "It's
off, it's off." And I just turned to her, and I said, "Nope." And that was it
(laughter).  
  
Q. Lindsay, could you talk about the fact that Ohio State has beaten you
guys a few times in a row and a lot of talk may be about how dominant they had
been? Did that motivate you guys at all knowing that maybe they were
favored?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: Definitely, yeah, they were favored, and yeah, they
beat us at home and that hurt and we used that as motivation to come out and
be aggressive and be strong. We had lost to them last year, a year ago. They
came back beat us here, and we were able to come back and we kind of fell
short. But we used that as motivation to come through with a great win
tonight.  
  
Q. Erin, just the feeling. You guys have not had this experience since your
freshman year. Just talk about the emotion and the feeling.  
ERIN LAWLESS: You know, I had a great feeling when I woke up this morning. I
just felt the same way I did my freshman year. I woke up, and I was like, I
feel great about this game, I feel great about this team's confidence.  
The emotions are just all over the place. There's excitement, there's joy,
there's every kind of emotion, it's overwhelming. It's just happiness all over
right now. It's fantastic to know we fought those first two games, and to come
out to a 21-0 start is something you just can't stop smiling about. It's just
-- you know, we got it done. We went out there, we played, we got that
championship.  
  
Q. Lindsay, there was a point there in the second half where it looked like
you felt like you could do just about whatever you wanted to offensively. Were
you feeling pretty comfortable at that point with your ability to get some
points on the board?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: Definitely. I was starting to hit a few shots and I
kind of felt like I was unstoppable so I kind of kept going at them. I missed
a few shots and then we were able to run through some of our offense, and
Katie and Erin were stepping up and hitting shots. We were playing great team
basketball, and I think that's what pulled us through with the victory
tonight.  
  
Q. Katie, as you're standing there with the trophy and taking pictures, any
particular thoughts go through your mind? Also, you've had a lot of injuries
and a lot of rehab. Did you give any thought to what you've been through to
get to this point?  
KATIE GEARLDS: The only thing that was going through my mind was how special
this feels, but most importantly how much further we have to go this year.
This is a great building block right now to really grab onto this momentum and
carry it into the NCAA tournament.  
One thing I wanted to say, we're hoping we've got six more games left and that
will put us in the National Championship. We're going to take it one night at
a time, and from here on out it's one and done, and I'm hoping and I know Erin
is hoping that we've got a lot more college ball to play.  
  
Q. Lindsay, I'm wondering about your fearless nature. There were back-to-
back-to-back situations between you and Jess. Just talk about what a rush it
is maybe to take it to the hole strong against one of the most celebrated
players, and you scored on her twice in three plays there.  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: Some of our offense was run toward me because I was
kind of hot, just like any other player was. But she's a great player, great
defender. But I couldn't be scared. I just had to take it at her and be
aggressive, and I think that's just what Erin and I and everybody else was
doing on the court.  
  
Q. For any or all of you, when you get out 21-0 like that, how hard is it --
you've got to remind your self there's still 30 minutes to play. How hard was
it to just I guess stay about your business and realize that you still have a
lot to game to play?  
ERIN LAWLESS: I don't think that was hard for any of us at all. We understood
that it was a 21 lead but any team is capable of coming back from a deficit
like that. It's happened before, and we were trying not to have that happen to
us.  
  
Q. How important was it in the second half to not let to lead get under
ten?  
KATIE GEARLDS: We talked about it at halftime, same thing, coming out and
really dominating the first four or five minutes like we did the first half.
And you know, we kind of traded baskets back and forth, and we didn't let that
lead get under ten.  
I think one time there was a chance, Jess was at the line and I think she
could have knocked it down to nine and missed one of the two, so it never got
to single digits. We knew they were going to make a run, and we knew we just
gave up a 17-point lead to Michigan State a month ago, so we knew we had to
maintain our momentum and keep attacking offensively.  
  
Q. Jim Foster was in here a little bit ago reminding everybody that Lindsay
has got game. Could you tell us what a rush you got watching her? I think
she's too modest.  
KATIE GEARLDS: You can't say enough about her. Lindsay is so athletically
gifted. She pulled out this left-handed baby hook. I was like, oh, my
goodness, if she pulls that out, she is unstoppable, because the next play I
think she turned left and just kind of went for it, and Lindsay went to the
right hand with a bank shot. She's so physically gifted athletically, you
can't say enough about her.  
She rebounds the ball off the rim, changes shots. She's one of those really
rare players that can dominate on both ends of the floor, and we try to tell
her every day how good she is, and I think she's finally starting to believe
us. I promise you, I'm not lying though. She is one of those really, really
special players, and really glad to have the opportunity to play with her for
three years. She's going to take this team a long way next year, too.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Sharon?  
  
Q. Was that the game plan to get off to a 21-0 lead?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Absolutely. We wrote it up just like that. No, we just
discussed the last two games, we got off to a slow start and got behind by 9
or 13 and you just can't do that. Again, it would be very hard for us, even
though we probably could battle back, but we just did not want that to happen.
I said that both teams are really tired, but we're in better shape. Let's get
up and down the floor and show that, and that's what got us started in
transition.  
  
Q. It looked like defensively your players stuck to the game plan pretty
well, let them shoot from the outside and passing on the inside. Just talk
about that strategy. It seemed to be really effective, especially in the first
half.  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: They only took about five or six threes total the last
two games, and if you're going to get beat, you've got to see how they're
playing, and we're just like, let them shoot from the outside. Packer is a
three-point shooter, 00 is a three-point shooter, and we just kind of played
in and sagged in and did not want Davenport to get off to a great start, and I
think we did that exceptionally well the first half. I knew she'd end up
scoring the second half because we were banging and you wear her down. Erin
did just a phenomenal job and everybody helping in. The game plan worked and
our kids stuck to it, and we got to play zone the whole night and not play
man.  
  
Q. It was either yesterday or earlier in the tournament you said that you
knew how good these kids were. Is 21-0 what you meant?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Yeah, I mean, hindsight is 20/20. I just know how special
a group this is. I've said that from day one, and I told them that. I thought
when it was 10-0, I thought, that's pretty good, and I thought it would start
going back and forth. And then we just kept rolling and rolling and I told
them you can't let them get back in this game, you can't let them get under 10
because once you get under ten, then things happen, then the momentum changes.
We just really gutted it out. I had three kids that played 40 minutes, and
they wanted to get it done for their teammates.  
  
Q. We've seen moments when Katie will lift the team on her shoulder or
Lindsay or somebody else, but for Lindsay and Katie to do it both in the
second half, what kind of statement did they make today?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: I think, like Katie said, we're hopefully playing
exceptionally well and getting every ounce of every player right now. I think
every kid stepped up, KiKi knocking down the two free throws, Erin having a
fantastic game tonight, Lindsay having a great game, and I thought FahKara had
a great court game.  
Danielle, our entire bench, whether they got in or not, what they do for us
every day is huge. I think when those three obviously are hot -- I thought
Jodi Howell played with so much guts tonight, was able to get some offensive
boards. Again, we talk about individuals, but this was a total team effort.  
  
Q. You coached against Katie last year. This year you've coached her. Have
you developed a different kind of appreciation for the type of player she
is?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: I mean, I always appreciate players that are Katie's
caliber, and to be able to coach her, me and my staff are very blessed that
we've been able to coach Katie and Erin. I think that hopefully through this
experience Katie will have learned a lot more basketball because it's a new
coach, just a different philosophy, and hopefully mentally -- physically and
mentally I try to make my players tougher. You know, for us it's just been a
complete pleasure.  
  
Q. You said in your office the other day that you felt like you were pretty
well set for the No. 3 seed in the NCAA tournament. After this, playing like
this on national TV, what do you think now?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Depends on what the committee thinks, but whether we're 3
or 2 right now, this is just a great moment, and we're not going to worry
about that. If the committee thinks we deserve a 2, they'll give it to us.
That's totally out of my hands.  
  
Q. I suppose you don't mind when a player talks back to you when she's just
hit a big three-pointer like that?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: She turned and smiled. She said it was in the whole way.
It just had a funky spin on it. I was just trying to make sure we got the
offensive board. That's what it's all about, when you can have that kind of
fun relationship with your players.  
  
Q. How important was it for you to have such a strong fan base here
tonight?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Well, it was huge. You know, the community is amazing,
the pep band, the Gold Mine, I helped get them here, I helped pay for their
tickets. They're so important.  
You know, again, I really like to reach out to everyone that's important to
our program, and I think for them, they had a blast.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Sharon. Good luck in the tournament.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2007

  

### [Jessica Davenport](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16893)

### [Jim Foster](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16894)

### [Maria Moeller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16896)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Open it up for an opening statement from Coach Foster, then
we'll go to the student athletes.  
COACH JIM FOSTER: I'd just like to congratulate Purdue. I thought they played
very sound, a well-played game.  
  
Q. Jessica, obviously you're not going to make excuses, but was there
fatigue after that game with Penn State? Were your legs a little heavy?  
JESSICA DAVENPORT: Maybe a little bit, but like you say, you can't make
excuses. It's the championship game and you go out there to play, play to win.
I mean, they were on fire in the beginning, and we couldn't throw a rock in
the ocean. That big lead they got really hurt us early on.  
  
Q. Maria, could you speak to what was going on in those first 10 or 11
minutes and what was going wrong at that time?  
MARIA MOELLER: Well, first couple minutes like Jess said, we couldn't make a
shot. We were just trying to execute, get the ball, have some inside-outside
game and just cut into that lead, the 21-0 lead.  
  
Q. Jess, that feeling when a game starts off like that, how often in your
career at Ohio State have you had a feeling like that? On the court, it must
feel like everything is going right for them and nothing is going right for
you guys?  
JESSICA DAVENPORT: It might have been the first time. You have to give it to
them. They came out hitting shots. I don't know, it was kind of frustrating
when the shots that you usually make don't go in. I don't know, we still have
the NCAA tournament to play, so we're going to get ready for that.  
  
Q. Jess, did you ever feel there was a point when you were ever going to get
back into the game, or did they just control the whole thing?  
JESSICA DAVENPORT: There was definitely points like that going back in the
game. I think the whole game we had a lot of fight in us. We never gave up,
and we kept playing hard no matter what the circumstance was. I give a lot of
credit to our teammates, especially Maria Moeller. She played every minute of
this tournament and she still pressured the ball for 40 minutes; I went to the
floor. That type of leadership at your point guard position really makes you
look forward to the next round of tournaments.  
  
Q. Jessica, when you guys did come back, I think you got within ten a couple
times in the second half, just talk about what it was that Wisdom-Hylton and
Gearlds did to extend the lead back up for Purdue.  
JESSICA DAVENPORT: They were hitting shots. There's not much more you can say.
They had a big lead and they wanted to make sure we weren't going to cut into
that lead. As much as we tried, we just couldn't go over that ten-point hump.  
  
Q. For both you guys, can you talk about how much this is a motivating
factor for you guys going into the rest of the season and obviously the NCAA
tournament?  
MARIA MOELLER: I think it's a motivator just because losing this game is going
to want us to get back in the gym, get better each and every day and prepare
ourselves for the NCAA tournament.  
JESSICA DAVENPORT: I mean, like she said, we had kind of a good run and it was
you know, sketchy in this tournament, but we have lot to look forward to. I
don't know when the NCAA tournament starts, but we have time to get out there
and prepare and rest our bodies and get ready for a deep run in the tournament
.  
  
Q. Maria, could you talk about how you guys felt physically after the long
game against Penn State?  
MARIA MOELLER: We might have been tired, but Purdue was just as tired as we
were coming in. They didn't go into overtime, but just needed to pursue
through that fatigue and just play, just go out there and play.  
  
Q. Maria, can you talk about some of the pressure they put on you guys,
putting the ball the length of the court and what that did to you guys?  
MARIA MOELLER: Well they did a 1-2-2 press and then just slowed down our
offense, took some time off the shot clock, and that's basically what the
press was. I don't think they were looking to pressure, like get the steal as
much as they were trying to get the time on the clock and get the ball away
from Jess.  
  
Q. Maria, was it hard to get the ball into Jess in the first half?  
MARIA MOELLER: I think in the first half it was because when me or Shavelle
had the ball in the perimeter they were just sagging, they had a girl in front
and behind Jess, but once we got the ball into Stephanie or Packer's hands or
A.T.'s or Ashlee Trebilcock's hand, they had to guard them and we got the ball
into Jess, and when we reversed the ball we were able to get the ball to Jess,
too.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Foster?  
  
Q. Was there anything that you saw in pregame warmups, anything that gave
you any indication that your team might start off like that?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: I don't watch warmups.  
  
Q. Is there anything that you can do? I know you called some timeouts. Is
there anything you can do when another team is on a run like that to try to
slow it down?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Well, timeouts are a good start. They just -- they played
very, very well and we had a couple players not at their level, not at the
intensity level that's necessary in a championship game. You know, we kept
looking down the bench to find people, and we found three freshmen.  
Well, we knew Maria Moeller. We know how big her heart is, and I thought
Shavelle Little came in and did a great job, and Andrea Walker came in and did
a great job, so we played a lot of that second half with three freshman on the
floor and they were terrific. They gave us the energy that we needed.  
  
Q. How tough is it when you fall behind 21-0, just the energy to get back
into it, were you demoralized at all?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: I think -- all these things just make excuses. I mean,
there's four two-minute timeouts. There's plenty of time to get back in the
game. The game is set up today where you've just got to keep battling and keep
getting after it.  
We had three or four opportunities to get it in the single digits, and I think
psychologically that would have been a big deal, and we didn't execute
necessarily the way we needed to and maybe take the shots that you would like
to take, but that's the price you pay with three freshmen on the floor. They
may not understand that. This is a big possession.  
But they played with such spirit and such heart. I really think our guards
rebounded well. Little goes out there and gets six and Moeller gets four. I
think that's a big deal.  
  
Q. Did you ever get the feeling that just today maybe wasn't your guys'
day?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Well, no. I mean, you just keep pushing buttons. You know,
I'm just happy we came back competitively and that we had a group out there
that was forcing the issue.  
I'm happy that Katie Gearlds had to work her tail off to get her points, and
she made a couple of incredible shots, big-time shots, but I thought Shavelle
Little really did as good a job of guarding her as you can do. Katie is a
great player, and she made the little fade-away on the block, and then the
three that she made going left. I mean, that's big-time stuff.  
Shavelle really came out and changed the tempo, and I thought Walker did -- as
I can say, Moeller played every minute of every game and the Malone kid is
aggressive, she led the league in steals, and Moeller's got five assists and a
turnover and handled that situation very well. I like the feistiness of a
freshman, and it allowed me to stay feisty.  
  
Q. You touched on Gearlds when it got close there at the end, what she did.
But what Wisdom-Hylton did..  
COACH JIM FOSTER: They're terrific players. I'm on the selection committee for
USA Basketball, and Wisdom-Hylton was -- she wasn't there for the first couple
days, wasn't doing the stuff she normally does, and I kept telling the
committee, "Wait a minute, this kid can play, just be patient, she can play."  
I wish she would have played like she did the first two days, but she played
like she did the last day. She's got a game. She's got a game. She's got a
little face-up, she can drive it. She's got a style of how to play. It's not
just about talent. She's a very, very intelligent player.  
  
Q. We asked the players earlier if they faced a deficit like that before.
How often in your coaching career have you faced a deficit like that, faced a
start like that right away?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Maybe my first year, second year. We played Old Dominion
with Nancy Lieberman and Ann Donovan when I was at St. Joe's. They won the
National Championship. So that's 28 years ago. I'm glad -- if it's 28 years
before it comes around again, somebody else is going to be getting it because
it's not going to be me (laughter).  
  
Q. You talked about the energy your freshmen brought you. Why did you need
that from them? How did that happen that the people you would normally look to
for that energy didn't bring it?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Good question. We'll try to figure out some of it, and
hopefully they're going to try to figure it out.  
But the good news is we really liked our freshmen class coming in, and they
have done nothing to disappoint that excitement when they came in, and I just
like their upside, I like their competitiveness, I like the way they get after
things.  
I think you need very competitive people to be a very, very good program, and
I like the corps of competitive people we have and I like the corps of
competitive people we have coming in next year. Some people have got to get
their act together, which is a lot of competition in the gym.  
  
Q. Can you gauge the disappointment level of a conference tournament loss as
opposed to maybe an NCAA loss or a loss that would throw you out of the loop
for a conference championship type deal?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Well, we won the regular season, and the NCAA tournament
ends the season. We're still very much a factor. We're still very much alive.
You know, our body of work is what it is, you know, and for a ten-minute blip
today we were not where we would have liked to have been. But that doesn't
negate the rest of it.  
If this was the last game of the season, you'd be sitting there being very
optimistic about your freshmen. But it's not the last game of the season. I
think it bodes well for our next ten days of practice that we've got that
feistiness and that spirit.  
  
Q. Obviously Star and Ashlee bring some things offensively when they're in
the game that when they're not in the game you didn't have that tonight. How
much of a concern is it going forward to make sure that they're back where you
want them to be?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Well, we shot 62 percent without them in the game in the
second half. So, I mean, I agree with your assessment.  
  
Q. But they've been two players who have...  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Yeah, but the assumption was that we're not a good offensive
team without them, and the fact is we shot 62 percent without them. We're
getting some mileage out of other players. Any game you can look down and say
Erin Lawless usually scores more than six points. Games always take their
shape and form and somebody steps up within the framework of the game and has
a bigger day.  
  
Q. Purdue has closed the season with obviously a big win here, a very strong
schedule throughout, they're the No. 5 RPI, do you think they make a case for
maybe a No. 2, maybe even a No. 1 seed?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: You know, there's a lot of discussion at this time of year
by people that really should have no business discussing those things. There's
a tournament committee that's in place, and their job is all year long to
evaluate teams. They work very hard, they're very good at what they do, and
I'm satisfied that they'll make good decisions relative to the body of work
that's presented to them. That's their job.  
My job is to coach my team. Too often today people try to do other people's
jobs.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Jim. Good luck in the tournament.  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Thanks.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2007

  

### [Kamela Gissendanner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16898)

### [Brianne O'Rourke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16909)

### [Rene Portland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14537)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start out with on opening comment from Rene and then
we'll go to the student athletes.  
COACH RENE PORTLAND: Well, I guess you can understand why we would say we're
very disappointed with the outcome. We're very proud of the way our team
played tonight. They played very, very hard. Maybe that's the best we could
get from them. But I think they played hard. It was a terrific game, and we
obviously lost to a very, very good team in Ohio State, and Jessica proved why
she's the Player of the Year in our league.  
  
Q. Kam, how were you guys able to turn things around in the second half
after shooting so poorly in the first half?  
KAMELA GISSENDANNER: We just knew that there was a whole other half of
basketball to play, and we weren't going to be quitters, so we just came out
and found a way to hit some shots.  
  
Q. For Kam and Brianne, how much did the play of Davenport and some of the
other posts put pressure on you guys as guards to step up because obviously
they kind of went off the charts tonight?  
BRIANNE O'ROURKE: Well, like Rene said, she proved why she's the Player of the
Year. We were trying to help down on our side, and double her sometimes, and
it left some other girls open. We were still trying to defend their guards or
shooters outside so it was ours inside and --  
KAMELA GISSENDANNER: She just dominated the whole time. It's hard to contain a
player of her caliber. She's an All-American, and you can just hope that she
has an off day, but tonight she was pretty much on, and we did our best to try
and stop her, but it didn't happen.  
  
Q. Bri, can you talk about the final possession after the missed free throw?
Was that the thought, just to push it up? It looked like you may have could
have pulled up, but did you think your teammate had the better shot attempt on
that?  
BRIANNE O'ROURKE: We had a play designed, but I just passed it off thinking
she had the better shot.  
  
Q. Brianne, what do you guys different on Ashlee Trebilcock? Last time, she
had 17 points against you, tonight she only had five. What did you guys do
different?  
BRIANNE O'ROURKE: We just had to key on her a little bit more. The first game
we played her she didn't have any points, and the second time she kind of went
off and had 17, but we just had to stick to our rules on her on defense
tonight and shut her down and make her not a factor.  
  
Q. Obviously just coming off of this, but it was such a close game and you
guys played so hard, what do you take from going forward because both you guys
will be back?  
KAMELA GISSENDANNER: As disappointed as our whole team is, we have to make
this a positive somehow. We played the No. 5/6 team in the country, and we
took them to overtime and two points. So you have to be proud of yourself in
that aspect. But not to come out with a victory is really hard to accept.
We're just going to keep working. We have a lot of people coming back, and it
doesn't stop here.  
BRIANNE O'ROURKE: It's just a confidence boost kind of, even though we were
down tonight, just looking forward and knowing that we can play with teams
like this. It gives us hope for the future.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Portland?  
  
Q. What did you feel like changing in the second half for you guys?  
COACH RENE PORTLAND: We shot the ball better. I thought in the first half we
certainly got enough shots, if you saw the shots taken compared to theirs. Not
that they were bad shots out of the offense, they were just rushed shots. So
we saw more things hitting the top of the backboard, just rushed shots.  
We just calmed down better in the second half. We ran things through a little
bit better. We were able to shoot 60 percent almost in the second half. We
just did a better job.  
  
Q. Did you talk to Charity, and what did you say to her at the end of the
game?  
COACH RENE PORTLAND: It's real hard to talk to your two seniors. You just tell
them it's not their fault. She thought it was her fault. It's not her fault.
You just hug them and tell them you love them, and you tell the younger kids
to be there for them because it's a tough night for seniors.  
  
Q. Some real tense situations down the stretch and great shots made, and you
had this big smile. I just wonder what was going through your head because it
seemed like you were saying, "We can do this, we can do this," just with a
smile.   
COACH RENE PORTLAND: The day I say we can't do it I should get out of the
game. It starts at the top when you believe, and I just had a good feeling
about this game to be quite honest. But obviously the feeling was incorrect.
They played hard. Defensively we didn't do a very good job because there were
times when we were scoring, then they'd turn around and score. We had to get
it to a good number. So when we got them playing defense, I felt we were in
pretty good shape.  
But I thought our kids played really, really hard tonight, it's just this is
how the game ended.  
  
Q. You were up 70-66 in overtime. Anything you do differently now? Davenport
is Davenport and I don't know how you stop that,  
COACH RENE PORTLAND: Obviously I didn't know how to stop it, and I don't wear
a uniform anymore, so my best bet was going with the five I had out there.  
  
Q. On that last possession after the missed free throw, I don't know if you
had any timeouts, or did you just tell your team that you wanted it pushed
up?  
COACH RENE PORTLAND: They did exactly what they were supposed to do. They knew
had she made it, we had it set up for a down pick and a flare pick to get a
three. You wish they had just headed to the bucket, because we said to them,
if they miss, what do they need? They just need two. We had the ball in the
hands of a sophomore and it went to the hands of a freshman. We obviously just
need a lot of late game stuff. We need to be a smarter team.  
We were lucky she missed it, and then we weren't able to capitalize on it. I
guess when I look back, the rebound at the end of regulation, I think there
was 1.7 seconds, probably should have called a timeout then to see if we could
hit it from half court. I don't know, Amanda got the rebound. That's probably
the one question I'll have tonight when I can't sleep.  
  
Q. What were they able to do to contain Amanda? To only have taken eight
shots, just talk about that.  
COACH RENE PORTLAND: Well, I just think that Amanda is going to be played like
that. She's been played like that all year. She tried as hard as she could to
be strong and to go out -- we just don't have a high-low presence. As much as
we love Charity, next year we'll have a high-low presence because with the
recruiting piece there will be freshmen. Everyone knows, go after Amanda,
makes things real difficult for her. We had 20 offensive rebounds; that's a
statistic that you say, what is that? We had 20 offensive rebounds and we out-
rebounded a great team so we just needed some layups and we'd be in better
shape.  
  
Q. What were some of the things that you guys were trying to do to stop
Davenport?  
COACH RENE PORTLAND: Well, the fact that she's graduating I might be able to
say. In the first half, we double-teamed her on one side. Like, who cares what
we did; she scored 32 points; nothing worked. We sent Brianne in the second
half for a little bit and that was okay, but then she picked up two fouls.
Then we tried to send someone else in, another guard.  
She passes the ball real well, and obviously when she shoots that well, she
just has radar. She banks most things in, and I think she made some tough
shots.  
  
Q. Finale tomorrow night, do you think Purdue's bigs can do something with
her?  
COACH RENE PORTLAND: I'll just be home watching it on TV (laughing). I have no
idea what's going to happen. It depends on how physical the game is allowed to
be. You'll get to see something.  
  
Q. I don't think either point guard came out. They kind of had a man-to-man
battle there that was pretty fun to watch. What did you think about each point
guard?  
COACH RENE PORTLAND: Well, I'm a lover of point guards, and I think both point
guards did a good job for their team. Brianne had two turnovers there late in
the second half where she just threw it to the other team. Other than that, I
thought she played a great game. I thought she had a great tournament. She had
zero turnovers last night. Moeller does a nice job for him. We told Brianne
sometimes when she gives the ball up not to let her get it back. We did that
in a spot in the second half and I thought that worked very well for us,
because they throw it back to her, and Brianne was eight feet off of her.
Brianne did a better job of not letting her get the ball back in the middle,
and that's how I felt we were able to get some things done. But I do think
they're both truly point guards, and when you have a point guard, you're in
good shape.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2007

  

### [Katie Gearlds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16881)

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

### [Lindsay Wisdom-
Hylton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16907)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Well, we knew this was going to be a very intense battle
with two teams that play some very good defense. We needed to make sure we did
well on the boards, which we did. We out-rebound them and we got more
offensive boards. We knew at the very end we've been in a lot of games like
this, and we just really had to have a great gut-check and these kids played
with their hearts at the end of the game, and that's why we were successful.  
  
Q. Katie, in the second half when you really started to warm up, what was
working there? And then kind of as a secondary question, how's the neck?  
KATIE GEARLDS: You know, I think personally I got two back-to-back jumpers
right in the lane. The one over DeHaan was a fadeaway that was the biggest
shot I've ever taken. To shoot over a 6'9" girl, that's some guts, and I got
the roll, and it just got me really hyped. Everything felt pretty good after
that.  
The neck is going to be a lot better tomorrow.  
  
Q. Sort of the opposite feeling you guys had a month ago considering the
game played out almost the same as your last meeting with them:  
KATIE GEARLDS: It's kind of the same feeling -- (laughter) no. It's completely
opposite. We came out on top tonight, and you know, I think you can never
underestimate the heart of a champion. We're not champions yet, but I thought
we showed a lot of heart tonight being down and battling back. I thought we
showed a tremendous amount of character, and when it was gut-check time and
reality set in, we laid it out on the line.  
  
Q. Lindsay, could you talk about how Katie just energized the team in the
second half, and she wasn't 100 percent, but maybe did you guys feed off that
in the second half?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: Definitely. She led this team. Starting off the half,
she started knocking down some shots for us and we just kind of went on her
back, and Erin's, she started getting everybody excited. We just fed from our
senior leaders, and we just followed them, and they helped lead this team to a
great victory.  
  
Q. Katie, there seemed to be a play late, I don't know where it was, nine
minutes or so, where they called the foul. Seemed like a nice defensive play
for you guys. You seemed to get mad?  
KATIE GEARLDS: A little bit.  
  
Q. Was there some anger, because right after that is when you really got
hot?  
KATIE GEARLDS: That's what I talked about with television after the game. I
thought I got fouled on the jumper and I've got the red mark on my arm to
prove it. I thought I made a great defensive play on the ball, and she tripped
and they called Jodi (Howell) for a foul. You know-- refs are human and they
make mistakes just like we do. They call what they see. It just got under my
skin, and I tried to do my best to get the crowd into it, and I thought we fed
off the energy of the crowd and just got really hyped from that moment.  
  
Q. Lindsay, obviously, Katie showed a lot of courage in the second half. You
get a double-double, Erin had a great box score. But in the first half
especially, talk about what Kiki did for you guys in this game?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: Well, Kiki was hitting on her nice jumper that she
always has for us, being aggressive and taking it in the lane. At first it
seemed like she was the only one attacking and keeping us in it, but our bench
players were stepping up and giving us great minutes and she's doing great,
and I think we just need more of that to help with a victory in the
championship game.  
  
Q. You guys scored 24 points only in the first half. What was Michigan State
doing and what was the difference in the second half?  
KATIE GEARLDS: I think it was both what they were doing and what we were not
doing. They were being aggressive on the ball, on the perimeter, and when our
posts put the ball on the floor, their guards were digging in and slapping the
ball.  
We weren't strong with it and then I think we didn't do a good job of really
tying to attack the basket with a purpose, and you know, I thought in the
second half we attacked with a purpose.  
Danielle (Campbell) made a great pass to Erin and Lindsay made a great pass to
Erin, and I think when we attack with a purpose, we make good things happen.  
  
Q. Lindsay, how do you think you guys handled DeHaan, and was that a big
focus coming into this game to control her and contain her?  
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: Definitely. With anybody who's a 6'9" kid, they're
probably the main focus, we definitely wanted to limit her touches. You know,
she was making great post moves. We had great defense on her. D and Erin did a
wonderful job to sustain and putting hands up and not fouling her. She was
missing a lot of her bunnies, so they did a good job in that.  
  
Q. You kind of stole my thunder, but I'm going to ask, you had 14 rebounds.
Did Sharon and you work on any specificity in this game going against a 6'9 "
post player?   
LINDSAY WISDOM-HYLTON: They just said be aggressive with the ball and go after
her. You know, we need to work on rebounding because that was one of our
weaknesses. I think in this game and some of our past games we've been
starting to be more aggressive and going to the boards. And I think that's why
we came out on top with the rebounds this game.  
  
Q. Katie, could you talk about how Erin contributed on the offensive end, as
well, and kind of carried you guys until the rest of the team got in sync?  
KATIE GEARLDS: You can't say enough about the job she did for us. She was
aggressive, and you could tell she really wanted this ballgame. She was
getting put-backs, attacking the basket strong and knocking down free throws.
But what she did with DeHaan, being aggressive with her, and when she did get
good position, Erin was right there in her face.  
I mean, she made some tough shots, but I thought Erin did a good job of
affecting her all night long and really making her think about what she was
doing.  
  
Q. Katie, we all remember the emotion you showed here last year on this
stage. It must mean a lot. Put into words what it would mean for you to finish
as a senior with a Big Ten championship.  
KATIE GEARLDS: It's just special. I think Erin and myself coming to Purdue
four years ago, we wanted to hang a lot of banners in Mackey Arena, and we've
hung one. And that's not enough.  
We've got a great opportunity tomorrow to hang one more. It would just be
really fitting to go out in my hometown with a victory.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with with questions for Coach Versyp right here.  
  
Q. Sharon, with about 15 minutes to go, I think (Victoria) Lucas-Perry had
20 points and she didn't score again. Did you do anything with the zone?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: We ended up going man to man. I just figured if they're
going to be ahead and nothing else is working, then we went man a little bit,
got hurt in the first half, but I had Kiki and Katie rotating on No. 31
(Lucas-Perry). I just thought we did a really good job when she was driving
in, cutting it off, playing good help side and really finding her.  
  
Q. You've obviously seen Katie from both sides of the fence. When she's
2-of-8, are you nervous? Are you worried about her getting going, and then
when she goes 5-of-5 and bolsters the team back, how does your mood change?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: No, I wasn't nervous today. Katie is in a lot of pain.
People don't realize what she went through, and she was pretty much doubtful
to even play tonight so she played with a lot of guts tonight. As soon as your
neck loosens up a little bit, it's hard to put your hands above your head and
be an effective shooter.  
I think when she got those shots, I called specific plays for her, and I'm
like, are you going to make these shots, let's get it done, and she just was
able to really -- I could tell when she lifted off the floor, I knew it was in
before it even left her hand because that was her normal shot.  
I just think when she gets in a rhythm, it's really hard for teams to get her
out of her rhythm.  
  
Q. When you were down 12, what did you think got you going and how much did
the crowd help you in that comeback?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: You know, I'm like, this is what happened at our place,
you know? I mean, we were up by 17 and they kept inching back, and I went
after them one time. If you didn't see me throw my clipboard, you missed
excitement there.  
I mean, these kids have heart. These kids have character, and I know how good
they are. And there's no way that any team can be ahead by 12 and secure that
lead. You saw it all day yesterday. We just got confident, stared them in the
eyes, and were like, we've got this. Just calm down, we'll be fine. And they
really stepped up. When you make shots, your legs aren't tired anymore.  
  
Q. What happened at the end of the game?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: When (laughter)? Which moment (laughter)?  
  
Q. The last moment. All the hesitation in play and then the debate.  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: I mean, there was a loose ball. It was a scramble. No one
had possession of the game -- I mean possession of the ball, and there was an
inadvertent whistle, and Katie dove on the ball and the inadvertent whistle
was at 2.2 seconds. They didn't mean to call it, I guess maybe they were
calling for a timeout. But she didn't have possession of the ball; Katie
jumped on it and had possession of the ball. So they had to go back and look
at the clock.  
  
Q. The game at your place they really did a job on you on the boards, got a
lot of second chances, a lot of offensive boards. Tonight then you get the 40
to 30 over them. How much of a factor was that for you?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: It's the biggest factor for us. We didn't take care of
the ball well in the first half, but for our rebounding, ever since that game,
we've cleaned it up, and we're a better rebounding team now.  
You know, when you're in the top two or three in the Big Ten in every category
except rebounding, you obviously find out your weaknesses very bad. So you
know we just really committed to that, and we've got kids -- if you want it,
you go get an offensive board. You're going to have a put back. We just
really, really committed to that.  
  
Q. Same thing that I asked Lindsay earlier. Katie showed a lot of guts, Erin
has a great box score, Lindsay gets a double-double, but Kiki's contributions
off the bench the first half, how much energy do you think they gave your team
this game?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Kiki just has consistently been that defensive stopper
for us. She's had some key rebounds, her field goal percentage is 3 for 4,
she's very selective when she shoots, she understands her role. She's been one
of the big keys for us. I can't say enough about her. I try to empower her all
the time and give her confidence.  
But I want to talk about one player that no one talks about, and that's Lauren
(Mioton). Lauren came in for four minutes and settled us down and that's when
we went on our run. And I think she played four minutes that were the huge key
for us to turn this around.  
  
Q. There's a segment there where things seemed to be getting away, and she
scored three buckets and hits a nice pass inside for a bucket. I thought that
before Katie went on her run and anything else happened, that Erin really held
you guys in there.  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: I thought Erin was the glue today consistently all the
way through. She got to the foul line 13 times, and after she got her back
crushed, she missed a couple one-and-ones, but for her getting to the foul
line 13S times a game is very big for us, knocking down a three and being able
to score that 15-foot shot. Erin has really stepped it up and just turned it
around, and I think she was the glue consistently the whole game.  
  
Q. I'm glad you asked about Lauren. Did she play in the first half?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: No.  
  
Q. What does it say about someone, those four minutes you talked about, to
come in, stakes like this, settle a team down, and not only that, get you
going on your run? What does that say about Lauren?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: I just think Lauren is a gamer. I think she wants to be
out there and contributing in any possible way. She's like, "If Katie can't
go, I'll play the two for you, Coach." She's a kid that really understands and
gets it. I couldn't be more proud of her being able to come off the bench in
that circumstance, and she just really executed exceptionally well and played
great defense for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Sharon. We'll see you tomorrow night.  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2007

  

### [Allyssa DeHaan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16885)

### [Victoria Lucas-Perry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16356)

### [Joanne P. McCallie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14490)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open with an opening statement from Coach McCallie and
then go to the student athletes.  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: That was a very entertaining game. I think it boils
down to rebounding and Katie Gearlds. That's the game.  
  
Q. Victoria, the first 25 minutes, how close is that to maybe the best you
guys have played this season?  
VICTORIA LUCAS-PERRY: I definitely think we played well together. We moved the
ball, we found open people. We got stops. It's what we're capable of doing for
40 minutes, we just didn't do it tonight.  
  
Q. For Allyssa, in the second half, it was just a complete opposite of the
first half, they went on a couple of 8-and-0 runs. What were you saying to
yourselves and how were you trying to keep it together?  
ALLYSSA DeHAAN: Any time Purdue is going to make a run, it's just how you and
the team handle it. We weren't getting the stops that we should have in the
first half, and that's something we need to work on. We should have just
handled it better and gotten more boards.  
  
Q. Victoria, with 15 minutes to go you had like 20 points. Did they switch
up defense on you, or what happened?  
VICTORIA LUCAS-PERRY: No, we were still trying to work the inside-out game.
You don't really worry about how many points you have, it's just about us
getting the ball in the basket and getting second-chance shots. I mean, I
wasn't really focused on that as long as our team was doing what we were
supposed to be doing. I think we should have had more focus on defense and
rebounding. That's what we should have focused on.  
  
Q. Victoria, talk a little bit about Katie Gearlds. You guys shut her down
pretty well in the first half, and then she got going a little bit. What were
you guys trying to do to stop her in the second half?  
VICTORIA LUCAS-PERRY: Definitely taking her out, just really getting in her
face, knowing where she is all the time. We just didn't do a good enough job
of that.  
  
Q. Allyssa, what was the difference in Purdue's rebounding from the first
two games you played against them to tonight?  
ALLYSSA DeHAAN: They just wanted it more than us, getting out-rebounded by
ten. We handled them pretty well offensively the last couple games, and we
just weren't there tonight. We just didn't want it as much as they did, and
that's where we've got to start right now if we want to go farther is
rebounding.  
  
Q. Allyssa, as the season goes on and you're getting more experience and
more confidence, teams are focusing on you more. How are you feeling that on
the floor? Are you feeling more pressure from defenses, more physical
pressure, things like that?  
ALLYSSA DeHAAN: I got pushed from the first game until now. There's no
difference. It's all mental, it's all me. I'm the only one holding myself
back. Their defense has nothing to do with what I do, it's just -- it's me.  
  
Q. You guys were up here playing with so much emotion; have you felt that
big of a swing emotionally this season?  
VICTORIA LUCAS-PERRY: Yeah. When we came back we were down, and it was
probably the opposite. I mean, every game you have your ups and downs. You
have your lulls, you have your runs, it's all about how you respond, it's all
about how you come back from those. That's just the game of basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach McCallie?  
  
Q. Coach, first of all, she's incredible (DeHaan). I've never seen her
before and I've heard about her in statements. Usually they come from the
media, but she's incredible.  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: For her to say that, the abuse that she takes is
unreal; the way she was pushed and hit today, it's unreal.  
  
Q. I thought you had them on the ropes. I thought Erin Lawless was their
lifeline, particularly when you were up earlier in the game. I know Katie got
hot later, but I didn't see a whole lot and Erin Lawless kept them in there.  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: She does a very nice job. She had a very nice game.
She's a steady player. Yeah, I definitely think she was just a solid person --
I think what Katie does is different, though. Katie -- from what I can tell,
without Katie, they don't go, though. Katie has to be the one -- there's just
something about that outside game of Katie's that frees everybody up. I mean,
14 rebounds for Lindsay. I mean, she's a special player.  
It's a unique trio that they have with those three, and they definitely
provide the energy and whatnot. But obviously we did not do a great job on any
one of the three.  
  
Q. Gearlds' first two games, did you think it was just inevitable she could
catch a little bit of fire at some point?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Definitely. You have an excellent player like that, you
just have to be aware. Some things worked, some things didn't. I know she only
hit a few threes but they were huge threes. I mean, that's the game right
there.  
  
Q. You had a double-digit lead in the second half. How were you guys
feeling? I know basketball is a game of runs, but were you guys feeling pretty
good, and what kind of changed the momentum at that point?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: We just stay in the moment. This is March. Leads don't
mean anything, whether you're up, down or sideways. It's March. We need to
stay in the moment and try and make plays. You know, it's a very physical
game, it had a lot of elements to it, but in the end you've just got to stay
in the moment and make plays. We did to some degree. It's three points. You
know, it wasn't exactly -- it was a close game, so we just maybe didn't make
some plays go over the time.  
  
Q. Vic didn't score for the last 15 minutes. Did you notice them doing
something differently defensively towards her?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: I'll have to look at the film. They played a lot of man
down the stretch in the second half. I think the key for us was the lack of
offensive rebounding. Our players control that.  
Again, I'm going to agree with Allyssa. You control if you get to the ball for
an offensive rebound. Scoring is a difficulty for any member of our team, you
have to go to the boards to get yourself going. We did not have any -- seven
offensive rebounds for the game, shooting 40 percent? That tells the story
right now. We've got to be more aggressive and go get the ball.  
  
Q. When they tied the game and took the lead in the second half, how close
did this feel to a road game for you guys?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: It was a road game, completely. I mean, it's home court
advantage for Purdue, without question. Always has been. I'm sure the Big Ten
is happy they're in the final.  
  
Q. You had a couple chances in the last minute and about 40 seconds, there
was a look at a three and the inadvertent whistle.  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Yeah, that was classic.  
  
Q. What was the result you wanted out of that?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: I just would have appreciated going to the -- when you
have something like that occur, an inadvertent whistle, I would like them to
say to me, okay, we'll go to the arrow, you know, something objective. You
can't have somebody on the floor with a ball, which is essentially a travel,
and then give them the ball back and then call an inadvertent whistle. You
can't do that. You could say, well, it was an inadvertent whistle so we're
going to go to the arrows. By the way, the arrow did favor Purdue. I just
wanted some objectivity in that call. That's what I was trying to demand.
Inadvertent whistle, it's Purdue's ball because she was on the floor and she
had it. Except for our kids were trying to tackle her at the same time. But
that's what they said.  
  
Q. With the way this one turned around and with what's coming up, how do you
see this team bouncing back between now and two weekends from now?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: It's just a great opportunity to learn from. We'll
examine it closely. That's a real stinger. That's a stinger game without
question. You know, I think those things can only work in your favor if you
work hard and make some adjustments. Those kids are very -- you look at
Allyssa and Victoria and Rene and the kids in the locker room, they were upset
with this game in terms of outcome and things they could have done for sure.
Hopefully it's a motivator for us. That's the way we'll take it.

### [Jessica Davenport](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16893)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go directly to the student athletes for questions.  
  
Q. Jess, just what was going through your head and what was going on in the
second half of that game and in the overtime?  
JESSICA DAVENPORT: Just score points. I was having lots of success down in the
post, and my guards were looking for me, and I just wanted to make as many
shots as I could. Just trying to win the game.  
  
Q. Jess, at any point during that second half did it run through your mind,
are they ever going to miss?  
JESSICA DAVENPORT: Who, us or them?  
  
Q. Them.  
JESSICA DAVENPORT: Well, (Kamela) Gissendanner got hot, and when you play
teams that are hungry and looking to advance in the post-season type
atmosphere, you know they're going to give a good fight. So we just had to
sustain the run when we did, and we got the win.  
  
Q. Jess, you mentioned having a lot of success tonight, especially down low.
What were some of the things that you were taking to them and what were they
giving you?  
JESSICA DAVENPORT: Well, when I got the ball in the post and I just turned and
faced and I was looking for my cutters, and I saw that they weren't playing
well with their hands up, and I was able to shoot over them, and I had a lot
of bank shots that were going in.  
  
Q. Jessica, just looking ahead, obviously a rematch with Purdue, obviously a
very tough team, a rivalry. Your thoughts on that match-up tomorrow?  
JESSICA DAVENPORT: It's going to be a great game, championship game. We're
both hungry and both want to cut down those nets tomorrow. We have to make
sure we execute. We had a tough game tonight, we need to make sure we rest and
come in and focus and play a hard 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Jessica talked about finding her cutters. A lot of your points came off
of a cut, Jess got you the ball. Is that something you two talked about or is
that just like on-the-court awareness between you two?  
STAR ALLEN: It's kind of like we talked about it and then it's on-court
awareness because I have to be able to make sure I'm in her eyesight for her
to see me so I can get the ball.  
  
Q. Maria, just how much were you looking for Jess there, especially in the
overtime. Were you looking pretty much anywhere else?  
MARIA MOELLER: I was looking for her every single time down the floor because
she was having success. Obviously, you could tell by the stats that she was
having success, we just got her the ball, and she was finding people, open
cutters. We were having success through that so we just kept going to her.  
  
Q. Maria, what were the guards doing different in the second half? Tyra
Grant and Kam Gissendanner both exploded in the second half. What were they
doing different that maybe you couldn't counter?  
MARIA MOELLER: I think they just started hitting shots. They just started
coming off screens. We weren't competing with them, and we just got in their
grill a little bit and started playing tough defense toward the end of the
second half and made some stops.  
  
Q. Jessica, looking at your stat line, you've had season highs the last two
games in scoring. Do you feel like you're maybe getting a little bit more of
the looks than you have before, or are you in a zone or what's going on with
you personally on the offensive end?  
JESSICA DAVENPORT: Just postseason. We have to up our game a little bit.
Coming into the game we didn't know if Pack (Marscilla Packer) was going to be
playing, so just having that mindset that Al (Star Allen) had to pick up a
little bit of extra scoring, and fortunately she was able to come in there and
give us good looks. But it's just a mindset that you have to have. We want to
get a championship this tournament.  
  
Q. Star, did you guys know Marscilla was going to be able to play before the
game started, and if you didn't know, when she came in the first time, how
much of a lift was that for you?  
STAR ALLEN: Well, we didn't know, but then again, we kind of figured that she
was going to come in when we needed her. But I think it lifted everybody up
because we know she can come in and shoot a three at any time.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Foster.  
  
Q. When was the decision made that Packer would play?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Probably just before game time. I was totally convinced and
the medical people were totally convinced that she wasn't going to play today.
But as the treatments progressed yesterday, she went through them, and this
morning, they said -- maybe if you need her in a situation or two you might
have her, and then I just said, then we've got nine more hours.  
After the shoot-around tonight, they kept working, and when they were doing
their probing tests and before the game, the doctor just said, "You know, I
think she can go. So keep on eye on her." But she really responded well and
really looks good.  
  
Q. What percentage do you think?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: I don't know. You know, those guys went to school for a long
time to figure that stuff out. We coaches get asked questions and have
opinions we shouldn't have. I'll leave that for the medical folks.  
  
Q. How much stress does it take off of you to know you have a player like
Jessica Davenport who you can go to time and time again when you need her down
the stretch?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Do you see my hair (laughter)? It's a good feeling to have a
great player that's got a big heart. I've been fortunate to coach some really
good centers, but Jess has really grown, and is just is a solid, solid player.  
I think going back and forth, that turns into a pretty good classic basketball
game. That should be on the Classic channel of ESPN starting tomorrow because
you saw two teams, they were hungry. I mean, they were really, really hungry.
And they should be. They've gotten better and they're playing for the
postseason. There are only so many opportunities to win this tournament. I
give our team a lot of credit for having the mentality that they wanted to win
the game.  
You know, we could have made excuses and we could have said Pack wasn't ready.
We're already where we need to be in terms of the NCAA tournament. There's a
lot of things you can chat about. But I thought we fought and did some good
things.  
  
Q. In your opinion tonight how crucial were the posts and the play down low
to your success?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Well, I think Star just played very, very well. I think it
was a contrasting game. I think their perimeter players played very, very well
in the second half. I thought Gissendanner and Grant (Tyra)-- Gissendanner has
got game. She's got some stuff. She can go left, go right, pull up, shoot the
three, and then Grant was a little out of control in the first half and got
her act together in the second half, which is what freshmen do -- that's why
they're freshmen.  
  
Q. Markedly different halves. You held them to 22 percent in the second half
and then to 70 percent. Did they do anything different? Was it just a matter
of kids getting hot?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Well, you have to give people credit. Did we play that good
of defense in the first half, 22 percent? They missed some tough shots second
half, their screens were a little tighter, they played a little bit better and
we got into a little exchange-the-basket mentality. But we got the stops when
we needed them.  
When we switched to zone I think it helped us, it took them out of their tempo
and their rhythm. They were really running some good man-to-man stuff.  
  
Q. Amanda Brown only shot eight times, finished with eight points. Was that
the focus, to put the ball in other players' hands?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Well, we're very cognizant of Amanda and where she is
because we have just a tremendous amount of respect for her, her ability to
run the floor, and that little up and under move that she has. I thought we
did a good job on her, very good job.  
  
Q. With Tamarah Riley, can you make a comment about her play tonight and
just about your rotation?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Well, I liked the numbers except for the turnover numbers
out of the four spot. You look down and you see 19 points and 13 rebounds from
Star and Tam, and I think that position -- that in the beginning of the season
there was a coach or two in the league that said we were really going to miss
Debbie Merrill. We knew how good a player Debbie was, but we knew what we had
in that position, and we were pretty comfortable we were going to be pretty
solid in that position, and sometimes we'd even stick Walker in and go with
Jess and Walker (Andrea) at the same time.  
So I like our four spot. They were a little careless with the ball tonight,
but they went and got it back on the glass.  
  
Q. You've been around Jess for a while obviously. Where does tonight's
performance rank in your memory of some of her dominant performances?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Top five. You've got to love the passes. She took one -- we
had discussion about one shot she took late in the game, bad angle, no
backboard, and you know when she just takes her time and reads, she's got the
whole package. The ability to score over both shoulders is what makes great
post players. A lot of post players have signature moves so they can go to one
shoulder, but Jess can come over the left shoulder as easily as she can go
over the right shoulder and she's out of the turn-and-pace game and may shoot
the bank shot.  
A good friend of mine Don Casey is here, spent a lot of years in the NBA, and
he said to me today, she may shoot the bank shot as well as Walton. We happen
to have a film clip of Walton's 21-of-22 game against Memphis State in that
NCAA title game, and he used the backboard, and Jess has seen that tape. We're
big on showing our players what great players do, and Jess -- somebody is
going to be showing tape of her soon to other players.  
  
Q. I don't think either point guard came out of the game, and they had
really gone at each other. You know, for both teams tell us what you thought
about each of their play.  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Well, you don't appreciate Moeller unless you have her in
the gym every day. The experts, of whom there are many, will point to the fact
that she may not score. But she scores when she has to. Brandie Hoskins, who's
played with her all year, when Brandie got injured, Brandie came up to me the
day before yesterday, she says, you know what, "I've never seen a player with
the intensity and the conditioning that Maria Moeller has." She said, "I've
been watching her since I got injured." We asked her to pressure the ball the
whole game, we asked her not to turn the ball over, we asked her to direct our
offense, and she's a freshman. She's got that stoic German personality. I
married into a German family; I know it well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Jim. We'll see you tomorrow night.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2007

  

### [Felisha Legette-Jack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16871)

### [Sarah McKay](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16873)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We've got Coach Jack and Sarah McKay with us. Coach Jack, we'll
have you give us some opening comments and then go to Sarah for questions.  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Well, I always thank people that gave me my
opportunity. I'd like to thank President Herbert and Mr. Rick Greenspan for
giving me an opportunity to represent such a fine institution and a great
group of young women. I am truly blessed. It was a fantastic fight, and also
I'd like to thank my husband and my son who allow me to do this crazy business
of coaching.  
But it was a great game. We fought, we battled. Ohio State is fantastic. I
said it earlier, I think that they're still a program that can certainly
represent us at the Elite Eight or even the Final Four. Jessica Davenport is
just unbelievable.  
But our kids just wouldn't go away. We continued to fight and we continued to
believe, and at the end we just ran out of gas.  
  
Q. Sarah, tough match-up for you. You ended up fouling out, but you also had
the five blocks. Just talk about the challenges presented when you go for the
block to try to prevent Jessica Davenport from scoring. Just what kind of
challenge is it not to draw the foul?  
SARAH McKAY: Jessica Davenport is a very, very talented player, and I know
playing against her makes me better. I just try and stay in her face. She's
got long arms. I tried to do what I could. There's not a whole lot you can do.
Once you block a few, good players counter the moves and know what they're
doing.  
  
Q. How tough is Jessica? Everyone looks at her and you hear about the awards
and the points, but just having to body up with her. I know Whitney was doing
a little bit, but I mean, she's a load, isn't she?  
SARAH McKAY: She's very strong. You've got to try and push her out and it's
not easy. But pretty much every post player in the Big Ten is a challenge to
go up against. It's never an easy job in there.  
  
Q. With the challenge of guarding Jessica Davenport, you still were able to
get 14 points, seven boards and five blocks, talk about that.  
SARAH McKAY: It's all about positioning on the court, and my teammates gave me
great passes. Over the top was open a lot, and it's up to the guards to lob to
up it in there for me. They do a great job of that. We're really good at
reading each other.  
And then on the defensive end with rebounds, I'm just going to do what I can,
blocking shots, whatever, to help out this team.  
  
Q. Sarah, you guys have been playing short-handed all year and you gave Ohio
State all they wanted here tonight. What does that tell you about your
teammates and about the future of Indiana University basketball and Coach
Jack?  
SARAH McKAY: That just tells you what kind of team this is. We could have
given up pretty easily. We were down by a bunch and we fought our way back.
And that goes to show what Coach Jack teaches us at Indiana; never give up.
You're down 20, you can find a way to do whatever you want. This is the start
of something pretty special here.  
  
Q. Sarah, when you went out with your fourth foul I think it was, Coach went
with a smaller lineup, and it seemed like your teammates went into a scramble
mode on defense and really I think got within four at that point. Was that the
plan? When you're sitting on the bench watching them make that comeback, are
you hoping to go back in and help out?  
SARAH McKAY: It was all about heart. We're pretty undersized in this
conference, and with me out and going with a smaller lineup, you're right,
it's a scramble. Everyone was doing what they could, and they did a heck of a
job.  
  
Q. Playing short-handed, two games in two days, how does that affect your
normal game-by-game routine and how did that affect the team?  
SARAH McKAY: We try and celebrate victories until about midnight that night
and then start focusing on the next game. This was a bit of a quicker
turnaround, so right after yesterday we just started focusing, watching film,
looking at the scouting report, just doing what we could to prepare for the
game today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Jack?  
  
Q. Do you feel like this team could still be playing in a couple weeks,
maybe WNIT, and what are your thoughts about that?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: I believe in miracles and I believe that we have
competed well enough where someone is going to want us to in their postseason.
Our goal is postseason. I don't know what's going to happen, but we're going
to continue to believe that it's a possibility.  
  
Q. Talk about 33 percent field goal shooting. Could you talk about their
defense on the whole?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: They're tough. They're ranked in the top 10 and
they deserve every bit of it. They went after us. They had one of the best
players, Marscilla go down with an ankle injury and somebody else stepped up.
It's a fine run machine over there at Ohio State and Coach Foster does a great
job. I have such respect for him as a coach, as a person, as a husband and as
a man, and I think that his team represents him well. They work with poise,
they play with confidence, and that defense is second to none.  
But I have to give credit to our kids. Our kids didn't look at the defense and
bounce back. We tried to go through it. We fought and we fought until the
clock expired. It is what it is, but I'll tell you, it was a good game to
watch, but to answer your question, that defense is tenacious and it's going
to represent our conference at the NCAA in a fine fashion.  
  
Q. Jess is, as your players said, really tough. Whitney trying to deny the
ball and Sarah sometimes playing her straight up. Do you try to give a player
like that as many different looks as you can, maybe have her wondering what
she's facing every time down the floor?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Well, we thought about tickling her (laughter). We
said nothing else works, just tickle her. She is an amazing player. She is a
kid that I tried to recruit to Michigan State when she was raw, nobody was
really going after her.  
But I'll tell you, she wasn't that good going into Ohio State; they helped her
become that great. D is tough. What we try to do is put our smallest post
player on her and have her turn in and then have her face Sarah. That worked
for a little bit, but then Sarah got in foul trouble so we had to put Sarah
out, and then we'd try to go underneath and she'd catch the ball and try to
dig in from down there, and we weren't getting any breaks on that.  
We just kept trying different defenses, but with somebody as good as Jessica,
we're just proud that she's in our conference and you just kind of concede
after a while. The tickling thing, that line of work, nobody agreed with me. I
should have followed my first mind.  
  
Q. When Sarah did go out with the fourth foul and it seemed like you really
did pressure the ball a lot more at that time, is that something you had to do
to not get them in a half court where they could set up with their size?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Yes, we had to do that because if we didn't it was
going to be a green light to flop the ball over Whitney and Kim's (Roberson)
head. So we tried to offset that by allowing the guards to feel the pressure
and trying to control the ball instead of looking up the court and seeing the
big kid that was very talented on the low block.  
  
Q. Very late in the first half you were within two and they went on a 7-0
run to end the half and then opened the second half with a run to go up I
think 18 at one point. What went on in that time frame?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: We weren't passionate in the second half. I
thought that we got them ready to come out of the locker room and compete, and
we didn't compete in that first three minutes of the game. That's something I
think that really hurt us. If we would have came with that tenacity that we
had in the middle to the end of the game, I think it would have been a better
game.  
But kids are kids, and you don't know what gets them going. But we allowed
them to bring the energy, and when we sat quiet they became great. That first
three minutes really hurt us, and they went up by 18 points and we cut it to
four. That's our commitment to what we're trying to do is 100 percent there,
and we'll continue to grow our program.  
  
Q. Coach Foster touched on this for a second, too, but talk about not only
Jessica's danger, a scoring threat obviously, but also a decent passer, as
well.  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Jessica is the real deal. We can talk about her
all day long, but I'd rather talk about my kids. I think our kids are
competitors and we're growing our kids just the same. I thought that Kim
Roberson represented us in two days as being a kid that really needed to be
recognized out there. She competes, she goes hard. She doesn't make all cute
passes or pretty shots, but you won't match her heart with anybody in this
conference. I'm very proud of her effort.  
I'm proud of Sarah McKay who's a kid that sat on the bench three years and
came this year and became one of the top 15 players in our conference. And if
we had a little bit more time, I beg to differ, she would be one of the top
five to ten players. We've got some good kids and some kids that we're very
proud of, and I like to talk about my kids.  
  
Q. What was the bigger factor in your decision to pressure? Was it that
Packer was out or was it that McKay was in foul trouble?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Both. She was out, and the foul trouble, we
thought that Packer is just the X factor in our opinion. This game was not
indicative of what she can do. When she's healthy and ready to go, this could
have been a different kind of game on their side, in their favor.  
I know our kids can get up and get in them a little bit, but Kim had two fouls
early and we had to sit her at the 11:54 mark of the first half, that really
put us in jeopardy because we didn't have anybody that plays defense the way
Kim does. So we were able to put her back out in the second half, and she went
out there and competed and gave us the energy that we needed to have us
compete, as well -- the other kids compete, as well.  
  
Q. Tell us your thoughts on your first Big Ten season.  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: I'm excited about our future. I definitely didn't
understand all that takes place from the head coaching position in this
conference. This conference is young and talented, and we're going to be a
force to be reckoned with in the future.  
I think that we have the best coaches in the country. I have such respect for
Foster and Joanne P. McCallie and Pam (Borton), and I think Sharon Versyp is
doing a great job with Purdue. We are ready to get this thing rolling again.
This was the conference that was the first top three RPI for many, many years,
and we slipped a little bit and now we're on our way back, and I'm just glad
to be a part of it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the job that Whitney did on the boards, five on the
offensive end and five at the defensive end?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: I just think that's one of the kids that doesn't
get any respect. She's a workhorse, she's battling down there with the big
dogs, and I just don't get it. I just don't get her heart. You know, she gets
beat up, she tweaked her knee, she hurt her wrist in the game, she came back.
She's got three people on her and she doesn't get a call, she comes back. The
fight in that kid's heart is really contagious, and we're going to be better
because of her. She's not going to be an outstanding scorer or passer but
she's the heart of our team, and we're so proud of her efforts and her heart.  
Some days I'm feeling like I don't want to come to work because sometimes days
get long. I look at that kid in the gym shooting 100 free throws before
anybody else walks in the gym just getting ready to go. I'm just proud that
she's a part of our organization.  
  
Q. What's the difference between the earlier part of the season and now?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: They've changed. They're a young team. We only
have two kids that really came back with experience from last year, and that's
Nikki (Smith) and Leah (Enterline). There's nobody else on our team with
experience. So there's going to be days when we go out and play Kentucky at
Kentucky and beat them at their place and Notre Dame at their place and we're
going to beat them at their place, and there's going to be days when you
understand that are going to be a Michigan day when you're going to be up by
17 and lose it because they don't understand how to maintain and sustain, and
as they grow -- this is a great experience for us.  
We grew, we learned, we fell, we fought, we came back, we prospered, we took a
step back, we took three steps forward. All of that is all great stuff so next
year we won't have that excuse to say we don't have any experience we were in
the trenches. We've been on every side of it, up, lost, down, came back, and
our kids, we never changed anything about us, we stayed consistent in our
confidence. We stayed consistent in our coaching ability.  
It's just sometimes kids are going to hit a wall and then they're going to
have to bounce back or they're going stay down, and these kids just keep
bouncing back.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach, and good luck in the postseason.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2007

  

### [Theresa Grentz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16897)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Theresa, give us your thoughts to open up.  
COACH THERESA GRENTZ: You know, the 11-0 run really hurt us, really hurt us
from the beginning. We came back, we fought back at the end of the half, came
back a couple times, got it to within four, and we just could never get over
that hump.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Were they tight or tentative early on?  
COACH THERESA GRENTZ: For the love of me, I don't have that answer. You know,
you look at the numbers here, it's probably as poor as we've shot all year,
7-of-30 in the second half, and even in the first half there were a number of
little chippies that hit on the front of that rim that they go in, you go on
another run. Just didn't happen for whatever the reason.  
We came back at the end of the half, they had the ball with 30-some seconds,
we end up getting it back, stealing, scoring, come back again, hit a three,
score five points in 17 seconds and yet struggle in a 20-minute period, so I
don't have an answer for you with that.  
Yeah, it's a shame because it's an opportunity. It was a golden, golden
opportunity.  
You have to think about it, they're all underclassmen. You've got three
sophomores -- well, actually two sophomores, two freshmen and a junior. Did it
get to them? I don't know, I hope not. But you've got to give Penn State
credit. They hit the shots. Get them down there, hit them in the first half,
and you've got to give O'Rourke credit, that kid came out and hit them in the
second half. I thought Brown played a senior game. She was 19 and 18. That's
pretty darned good.  
  
Q. You talked about the missed shots inside. Roughly by my count you missed
16 shots inside five feet. Was that their defense or the offense not working
quite right?  
COACH THERESA GRENTZ: I think it's probably a combination of both, but I
thought they were good looks. They were short -- almost looked like alligator
arms. They were just short arms.  
It became contagious after a while. One led to another miss. That's why I said
to them, I said, "Relax, they're good looks, they're going to go in, you're
going to get them; they're playing defense the way we want them to do that,
just knock the shot down." We just couldn't do it.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on how they defended Lori (Bjork)?  
COACH THERESA GRENTZ: I thought they did a great job. This is where I want to
be able to move her to the two. It's a perfect opportunity to slide back in. I
thought Beck (Rebecca Harris) was where she needs to be, but I'm hearing that
they don't have confidence in Beck at the point. I have confidence in her,
slide her over there. There's going to be situations, people are going to do
that.  
  
Q. You used Steph (Chelleen) a lot early. Were you looking for a combination
or an answer to get it going?  
COACH THERESA GRENTZ: I go back to Michigan State, we did the same thing,
subbed early, because I didn't think we were kicking where we needed to be. I
thought the bench came in, did some things, tried to do it again, I thought we
got some good bench play from that. How long you can go with that bench, then
come back with your starters. Will they knock it down, or is there enough
pressure that they don't realize that the starters are looking for somebody
else to take the pressure off of them?  
  
Q. Will you have some hope on selection day?  
COACH THERESA GRENTZ: Always hope, always hope. But it's living dangerously,
extremely dangerously. We lost the last regular season game, and we lost this
one. Probably not a good situation, but we'll see.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2007

  

### [Katie Gearlds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16881)

### [Erin Lawless](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16882)

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Sharon, opening comments, please.  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Well, we knew that Wisconsin was really playing good
basketball and this was going to be a battle for them as they continued to
fight to get in postseason. I give a lot to credit to them. They were really
doing a great job scoring, and our defense was okay, but they were really
lighting it up and knocking down a lot of open shots.  
But I am really proud of my group. We haven't gone to an overtime game so this
is a great situation being able to execute, and obviously for us getting to
the foul line 23 times is something that is huge for us.  
  
Q. Katie, talk about the contributions of KiKi (Freeman) and Danielle
(Campbell) tonight, especially with Lindsay (Wisdom-Hylton) being in the kind
of foul trouble she was.  
KATIE GEARLDS: I think KiKi and Danielle did a great job for us. I remember
yelling at D one time, I said, "you're killing us, D," and she kept letting
Danielle (Ward) turn over her right shoulder and that's the way she wanted to
go. And at the start of overtime, D was like "I got you, I got you," and then
KiKi took the ball to the basket and then D made a great strong move and
finished it for us. It seemed like both of them were getting clutch rebounds
for us, so hats off to them. They did a great job battling for us today.  
  
Q. Katie, during the last sequence, Wisconsin came down the court. You're
playing defense for a three-point shot obviously. Do you think that's what
caused (Jolene) Anderson to have to go inside the lane?  
KATIE GEARLDS: I think so. You know being up by three points, we're like just
don't give up the three. We switched everything, and FahKara did a great job
of bodying up on her. Once she got inside the three, we let her take it,
because we liked our chances of getting the ball inbounds and knocking down
two free throws. And that's what she did. And thankfully for us there was only
two seconds left on the clock.  
  
Q. Katie, there were three possessions late in regulation and one more in
over time where you were trying to take time off the clock, and you were
holding the ball and running the clock down and ended up not really getting a
good shot. What exactly were you trying to do in those sequences and what went
wrong?  
KATIE GEARLDS: There were were a couple times I didn't get good shots off and
I just missed. I liked my chances in that situation, just left them short a
little bit. The one situation where we had a shot clock violation, that was my
fault. The ball slipped out of my hands when I was going up. Other times I
thought we did a great job of running down the clock and I felt like I got the
looks, it just didn't go in.  
  
Q. Katie, with this being your last run here and being back in Indianapolis
and ending your career, what does this weekend mean for you and how important
are these games?  
KATIE GEARLDS: I think the most important thing is we're fighting to win a
championship and game momentum going into the NCAA tournament. You know, it's
special to play here at home. You hear a lot of people yelling "Katie, we love
you, Katie," just things like that. It just brings back a lot of good
memories, but hopefully we're here to make one last memory. We're going to
have our hands full on Sunday no matter who we play, and we've just got to be
ready to battle.  
  
Q. This for both of you, Katie and Erin. Could you report on the two games
you played with Michigan State this year?  
ERIN LAWLESS: Just looking back, when we played them at their place we came
out and were just aggressive and intense the whole time. I felt like we had
that momentum with us at home, it diminished a little bit in the second half.
But I think overall we've played some tough games against Michigan State.
They've always come out ready to play against us, and it's just a matter of us
being prepared mentally and physically.  
  
Q. Katie, do you want to talk about Michigan State?  
KATIE GEARLDS: Like Erin said, they're a great basketball team. I think
Minnesota is going to give them a good game today, so whoever we play, we're
going to have our hands full. Both teams are very different. Michigan State
plays the match-up zone, and it makes it hard to penetrate when you've got a
6'9" girl standing in the post ready to block your shot and send it the other
way. Been there, done that. We've just got to attack.  
I think the second time we played them we didn't attack in the second half
nearly as much as we could have, and that's something we're going to have to
do if we do get the opportunity to play Michigan State.  
  
Q. Erin, it looked like when Lindsay went out a couple times in the second
half with foul trouble, you worked on establishing yourself down low. Did you
feel you needed to do that?  
ERIN LAWLESS: I think so. Lindsay has always gotten good looks down there in
the post, and as a post player I feel like I have to take over, not only as a
senior but as a leader for this team. I had to make sure I got out there and
got it done. I mean senior year, it's a matter of winning a championship at
this point.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the job that FahKara did especially there down the
stretch, really taking charge?  
KATIE GEARLDS: She did a great job for team. You look at her stat line, she
had an unbelievable game. Her presence on the floor and handling the ball for
us for 45 minutes, you can't say enough about the kid. She took one shot and I
was like, oh, my goodness, there's like eight feet behind the three, but she's
got guts and that's the type of kid she is.  
We've just really been blessed to have her on our team this year. When she's
leading the way for us, we're doing a pretty good job.  
  
Q. Coach, the contributions of KiKi and Danielle and the two buckets to
start the overtime, how much did that relax the team a little bit and set them
on their way?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Yeah, KiKi and Danielle, they needed to step up and
they've stepped up all year for us, and that's why we've been as successful as
we have because of our bench. Danielle needs to settle down. She's been
practicing well and she can take anybody to the hole when she wants to. KiKi
knew that she had to do a great job defensively in boarding, and for those two
to come out in the very beginning of that overtime and score those two
baskets, obviously that's a huge confidence boost for our entire team.  
  
Q. Just to follow up on KiKi, it seemed like in the first half when you guys
were sort of sluggish there for a while. When you put her in she scored a
couple of jumpers and made a couple of rebounds and gave you a boost?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Yeah, I get on KiKi all the time because I think she's
the fastest kid on the team and she doesn't run hard all the time, so I got
after her a little bit. But her defense and her rebounding, they were key
today. She had some key rebounds and key offensive boards. She was being
aggressive like we expect her to be and was very consistent for us and that's
what we need through this whole tournament.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about what you remember about the two games
with Michigan State, please?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: When we went to Michigan State, Jodi Howell just had a
tremendous game. She hit six threes, and that really just built a lot of --
six or seven, correct me. I'm not a stat person (laughter). But hit seven
threes, and I think when somebody is knocking down shots like that, it just
builds confidence for everybody else.  
We both play a match-up zone, we both battle, we both have strengths and
weaknesses. Playing there, we had that mentality of playing on the road,
playing at home, giving them credit. We were ahead by 17 and we just folded
and they did a great job of being able to come back and win that game.  
But if it is Michigan State, again, like Katie said, it's going to be a tough
opponent no matter who it is.  
  
Q. Right after that Michigan State game, you had some close games, battled
through and won. How much do you think that helped today in fighting through
things?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Well, I think every practice or every game situation you
learn from. If you're accumulating knowledge and you're learning lessons every
game, then when that happens again, we need to make sure we do things
exceptionally well. You know, we've spent a lot of time on game situations and
that type of stuff, but I think that Michigan game was the turnaround for us.
You know, I think we've played pretty good basketball since then.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the job that Erin did in stepping up with
Lindsay?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Erin did great. I mean, she just exploded at senior
night, our Iowa game, had great rebounding, great points, and she did the same
thing at Illinois. This is the line that I expect from Erin, having ten boards
and 15 points and doing her stepback jump shots and being a dominating factor
and being a leader out there.  
So again, like Erin and Katie, this is their last hurrah and they want to make
sure they step up because they're seniors as well as they're leaders.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the job that FahKara did especially there in the
first half when you made the run to get back into it? It seemed like she was
getting a transition, probably had like six assists in a row?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: FahKara is our engine. When she runs, we run. She's
exceptionally quick. She just handled the ball so well. She's that floor
leader, she's the coach on the floor, and to have that with the people that
are surrounding her, she's very empowered. She loves it.  
You know, she's always the key. I mean, defensively, her and Lindsay have
always been the key, and today was a whole team effort with Lindsay getting in
foul trouble. But FahKara is the key to this team.  
  
Q. Sharon, Purdue is the winningest team in this tournament. Your team is
obviously going to the NCAA tournament, so how important is this tourney for
you and how do you look at this tournament?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Well, I think at the beginning of the year we have goals
that we set. To me every game is just as important as the next one. I don't
look at well, we're getting in the NCAA so this doesn't mean anything. This
means a lot. These young kids have worked so hard, and having a brand new
coaching staff come in within a year and having our record and doing as well
as we do, people think it's about X's and O's and it's not.  
This group, I'm really proud of them. Our goal is to get it done every time we
take the floor and that we leave the floor knowing that we gave it our all. So
my mentality for this tournament might be different than other coaches'.  
  
Q. In the opening round of the tournament for you guys, you have three key
players that play over 40 minutes. How is that going to affect you for the
rest of the tournament and what kind of things are you going to do to rest up
in a short amount of time?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Well, these young ladies have played this many minutes
all year. For me as a coach I've got to make sure that they get rest and that
I do the right things to keep them ready to go.  
We played in the WNIT, we played in a Vegas tournament where you had to play
back-to-back games. Those tournaments is what prepared us for this. It's
tournament time; you can't be tired.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2007

  

### [Allyssa DeHaan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16885)

### [Rene Haynes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16886)

### [Joanne P. McCallie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14490)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening statement from Coach McCallie and then
we'll turn it over to the student athletes.  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Just a great battle, a great game. Minnesota plays very
hard. I liked a lot of the things that we did, absolutely love our 22 assists.
I'm not sure what to say about the turnovers, though, in that regard. But I
just loved how we shared the ball inside and out. I thought Al was very
dominant and very focused. I thought Aisha was doing lots of nice things for
us in terms of ball movement, and I thought Rene (Haynes) was extremely solid
and smart.  
Overall, it was great team effort and the rebounding does sting a little bit,
the rebounding margin and not doing a better job there. That's something we're
going to continue to work on and needs to change. We need to get better at
that.  
  
Q. Allyssa, what was the key for your being able to score 24 points and be
so dominant inside today?  
ALLYSSA DeHAAN: I just had to keep the focus of getting open and wanting the
ball and demanding the ball, and I have such great teammates and they know
when to throw it to me. It was just my job to convert it.  
  
Q. Rene, could you talk about Allyssa's improvement over the course of the
season and your confidence in using her as a go-to player at this point?  
RENE HAYNES: Allyssa is one of our go-to players. I have the utmost confidence
in her. She came a long way from -- I'd bring it all the way back to
preseason, to my first time coming on the floor with her. And I think she's
just improved tremendously. She's become more physical, she hustles. I mean,
anything you ask her to do, she'll do it, and she's there for us 100 percent.
She's a great body in the post.  
  
Q. Aisha, after last week, how much better do you guys feel with this
performance against Minnesota?  
AISHA JEFFERSON: Obviously we have the March Madness spirit right now so
that's a big factor as to why we're playing a lot better, and just coming off
that loss to Illinois, we were just eager to come back on the floor, and just
the assists, 21 assists. And that's a lot of improvement from our last two
games. So we're excited about that.  
  
Q. Rene, can you talk about down the stretch when Minnesota was coming back
they were hitting a lot of threes and what you guys did to hold them off?  
RENE HAYNES: Well, this is March, and anything can happen in March. The game
goes all the way down to the last second, and I think it was just our
composure. We kept composure.  
We didn't let up, we kept attacking, and even though we were kind of switching
points, it's just keeping my focus and just staying together. I think we
stayed together the whole game, and that's what it's about.  
  
Q. Rene, the pressure didn't seem to bother you guys, but when they started
to come back at the end there, every time they got close, you guys seemed to
break it and get a layup.  
RENE HAYNES: Again, that's the togetherness. We had great patience this game
and we had great focus, patience and determination to get the win.  
We did anything it took to get the win. It's just great togetherness and team
effort and having the energy and the intensity to keep going.  
  
Q. Allyssa, if I you could get you to look ahead to Sunday and talk a little
about the match-up with Purdue. I assume you'll be seeing a lot of Lindsay
Wisdom-Hylton and she'll be seeing a lot of you. If you could talk about that
a little bit.  
ALLYSSA DeHAAN: We're very excited for Sunday. It's just all about coming out
with energy and maintaining that energy and focus and just having fun and
getting the job done.  
  
Q. Allyssa, did you come out more offensive-minded today looking to score
more?  
ALLYSSA DeHAAN: Not necessarily. I think overall I'm trying to be more
aggressive and that just kind of shined through on the offensive end tonight,
I guess. Just demanding the ball is what I'm trying to work on, and as I said,
all credit to my teammates, they know where to throw me the ball and they're
great at it, and I just convert it.  
  
Q. Rene, does your experience in this kind of setting help in avoiding this
kind of a letdown, especially in a game like this where you guys are expected
to win?  
RENE HAYNES: I think experience helps tremendously, and I think it was up to
me and my fellow seniors to just lead our team and just to work together, let
them know that this is what happens in March. This is going to happen all of
March every game we play, and experience does matter.  
  
Q. For any of the three, what do you remember about the first two games with
Purdue?  
AISHA JEFFERSON: First two games with Purdue? Well, the first game obviously
didn't turn out the way we wanted it to, but I just remember us just being
out-hustled in the first game.  
And the second game was probably the most exciting game I've played in, just
coming down from 17 and just fighting our way back. I thought we executed a
lot more and took advantage of our weapons the second game. You know, we were
just in attack mode that whole second half. It started off with Rene's shot at
the end, and that was just one exciting game.  
I know both teams are just ready to come back for the rematch.  
  
Q. Allyssa, were you surprised they kept trying to go inside as much as they
did so much of the game and didn't really get their outside game going until
the last seven or eight minutes?  
ALLYSSA DeHAAN: What do you mean, tonight?  
  
Q. Yeah. Were you surprised the Gophers kept trying to go inside for so much
of the game and didn't really get their outside game going until the last
seven or eight minutes of the game?  
ALLYSSA DeHAAN: I don't know what to say.  
RENE HAYNES: I think credit to our post players. They did a great job down
low. We had some little pitty-patty fouls or whatever, but the first half
starting off they really kept the paint solid. Not very many shots went up in
the paint.  
Allyssa had her hands up, Aisha had her hands up, all our post players, I
think they did a pretty good job. They kept going inside and going inside and
going inside, and I think our post did a pretty good job defending them.  
  
AISHA JEFFERSON: The first game they killed us, so why not go back to their
inside. I thought we did a much better job with our defense, our post defense.
We got called a lot playing behind, going out to the corners when we're not
supposed to, and I think we did a better job.  
They were just doing what they were supposed to do, kept going inside when
they beat us up in the first game with that, but we definitely turned around
our defense this game.  
  
Q. Aisha, I know you're not supposed to, but with the schedule you guys
play, having a lot of good teams, do you guys get up a little bit differently
for opponents like Purdue on Sunday, Ohio State, things like that?  
AISHA JEFFERSON: We come out with the same focus, and we don't take any other
opponents differently. But when you have games like you had against Ohio State
and Purdue, you still come out with that state of mind that you have something
to prove.  
You know, we've got to come out knowing that we took Purdue on their home
court, we took Ohio State on their home court and the margins weren't that
large, just the way we won. So we're definitely going to be, I guess, you
could say extra focused when it comes to those games.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Joanne?  
  
Q. Joanne, what were your instructions after the 19-point lead dwindled to
five? Did you just tell them to get back to doing what they were doing?  
JOANNE McCALLIE: You can't be really concerned. It's not scoreboard
basketball. You know, leads come and go. We just wanted to focus on some
things. I was really pleased with how we came out after timeouts. We generally
scored or something good happened. I think you just can't expect anything to
be easy.  
It was a little easy early on, and I was not expecting that to continue. Not
at this level, not at this time of year. All these teams are very good. You
saw they had four people in double figures. They played a great game. It
wasn't like Minnesota played poorly. They played a very, very good strong
game. We were able to do some things and we shot the ball a lot better. So
it's just -- I guess I'm not really concerned. I love the fact that we had to
convert.  
Our team made some smart plays while we were getting pressed, so we've just
got to take advantage of every opportunity because games are going to be
tough. I mean, nothing is easy. From this point out, it's a lot of work.  
  
Q. Allyssa's offense, is this just something that's getting better and
better as the season has progressed, going more to her as a gradual
progression here?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: I think it is. She's been such a tremendous person and
player. It's hard to believe she's a freshman. And she's allowed to have some
lulls when she's had some, and everybody wants all these stats from her.  
We've told Al to be herself and to enjoy her game, and I think she has great
confidence. I think she's excited for March. I think Al has got this figured
out, that this is the fun time of year, and I really credit her teammates for
being patient getting the ball in.  
I think we took some lessons from the Ohio State game obviously in terms of
being more patient, getting the ball to Allyssa. She's just phenomenal. She's
a phenomenal person, and there's just really nothing she can't do out there.  
What I loved about her was her movement. See, generally on defense and on
offense Al was moving more, either moving to the ball or moving more
defensively to get to the spots. When she does that, she's going to be one of
the very best.  
  
Q. You mentioned her movement, but I watched her play earlier in the season,
and it seemed to me just as big was her confidence level. It seems like she's
really sure of herself at this point.  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: I agree with you. I think her confidence is at an all-
time high. I think just the experience alone and different things that have
occurred -- players have just got to play games and get in game situations. I
think Allyssa has just been coming along. It's been an everyday thing, it's
been an every practice thing, and now she's starting to show up more with some
pretty impressive stats. This is no surprise to us. We see her do all kinds of
interesting things in practice. I'm just happy for her because I think you're
right, her confidence is at an all-time high and that's fantastic.  
  
Q. The rebound margin wasn't where you wanted it to be but a lot better than
a week ago. Did you guys do anything differently?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: It's hard to do worse than that, my gosh.  
  
Q. Especially with Campbell; she had 17 this time. Did you guys focus on
her?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: I like the fact that Victoria was in there battling.
Vic didn't have the greatest offensive game for her. She's very capable, she's
very good. But she had eight from a guard perspective. You're looking at Mia
Johnson, also offensively maybe not as good as she can be, but she's got
seven. I loved the guard rebounding, I loved Allyssa's rebounding.  
We have to get better at it, we have to keep working on it, and obviously for
Sunday, Purdue is a terrific rebounding team and we're going to have to be on
it.  
  
Q. What do you remember about the two Purdue games and what do you think
about Sunday's game?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Purdue at home I remember a young, silly team losing
double zero at all costs, leaving people wide open on the floor. I thought it
was a very poor game in Breslin.  
At Purdue, some really funny things in the first half. The second half was
just entirely different, very focused and just very tough. I thought we were
very tough in the second half. We just crawled back in that game, and again, I
think that the smarts paid off for the team in terms of finding each other and
making plays down the stretch. I think that was key for that second game.  
They're very, very good. Purdue kind of gets a home court here in terms of
fans, and I know everyone likes it when Purdue is advancing because they bring
a lot of fans. So it will be a home court advantage a little bit for them, but
it'll be a great opportunity for us. They're a very good team.  
  
Q. You've talked about focusing on March. Are you guys where you want to be
right now?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Well, I'm getting there. You're never there. It's
existential that way (laughing). You're never there. You've never arrived,
you're just always sort of moving towards something.  
  
Q. Never heard that word in a press conference.  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: My daughter is here and my son and I have to educate
them at every turn. They'll have to look that up (laughing).  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Joanne.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2007

  

### [Amanda Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16899)

### [Kamela Gissendanner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16898)

### [Rene Portland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14537)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will take an opening statement from Coach Portland and then
we will turn it over to the student athletes.  
COACH RENE PORTLAND: We're very happy and very thrilled for our players. We
are happy that this game had the turnout that it did, because it keeps us
going in the direction that we want to keep going.  
Amanda did a tremendous job tonight, probably the most threes I've seen on my
team in a long time, and some I thought were going to hit the bottom of the
scoreboard, a few rainbows.  
But the rebounding situation at halftime was not good for us. Even in the
middle of the first half, so we evened that up, and I'm extremely proud of
these kids. They fought hard for a game they really wanted.  
  
Q. Kamela, in terms of three-point shooting in the first half, what were you
seeing? Was it just something you were feeling before the game? Just talk a
little bit about that.  
KAMELA GISSENDANNER: My teammates just found me in the open spot and I was
just open, so I was just confident and just shot the ball.  
  
Q. Amanda, Illinois shot 33 percent from the field and seemed to take some
pretty bad shots. Is that something you were doing or were you surprised at
some of the shots they were taking?  
AMANDA BROWN: All week we focused on how we were going to play them, and we
always run through what they usually do on offense. I think that we just did a
very good job on the defensive end. We had a few lapses, but all in all we
played pretty good team defense, and I think that's what helped?  
  
Q. Kam, given the way you guys have struggled a little bit away from home
this year, how important was that 11-0 start to get you guys going in the
right direction?  
KAMELA GISSENDANNER: This is a new season, and you know, just like Coach Rene
always says, nobody remembers what you did the past three or four months, it's
always what you do in March. So we are just so focused on March and playing
into March and doing the things that we know that we can do, whether it be
home or away. We just have to play our game and everything will be A-ok.  
  
Q. Amanda, you guys just out-rebounded the No. 1 rebounding team in the Big
Ten. Did you guys talk about that going into the game, and was there an extra
emphasis put on that?  
AMANDA BROWN: There was an extra emphasis, but every game we go into, it's one
of our goals to out-rebound them. Whether it was Illinois some other team, we
go out there and, our big emphasis is to out-rebound them.  
  
Q. Amanda, could you talk about the challenge that lies ahead for you with
Ohio State? You played them close one game.  
AMANDA BROWN: You know, we're excited, very excited. We came into this
tournament wanting to go out there, play our hardest. We've played Ohio State
twice and both games have been pretty close games, and we know we can go out
there and give them a good game, so we're excited for that game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Portland?  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the defense down the stretch? I don't
think they had a bucket for the last four minutes after they cut it to four.  
COACH RENE PORTLAND: We didn't have a bucket. Both teams did not -- I can see
both sides of it now. I think we knew -- both teams knew what had to be done,
and it was great. They had to play some great defense in our last three
possessions. We just tried to slow the ball down because the end of the first
half we didn't have very good clock management at all.  
We went down second to the last play and didn't do a good job, and then the
last play when we could have run it out and done nothing, we went just a
little too quick and that gave them an opportunity to hit the three that
really shattered us when we went into the locker room.  
I think both teams -- everybody knows each other so well, not just our team,
but in the conference play, we're just coming out of conference play; that's
why we're seeing such great games at the tournament right now.  
But rebounding was a real issue for us and not letting them get any more
threes in that late part of the game.  
  
Q. You talked about the three at the end of the first half; you said it
shattered you guys. Can you talk about the team mentality and some things that
were said in the locker room just given the fact that they made that little
run at the end, and Bri especially?  
COACH RENE PORTLAND: Our kids talked to each other before the coaches got in
there, and by the time we walked in there, they obviously had said their piece
and they were willing to put it behind them. But we didn't stop the ball --
the time management on the offensive end was really the first thing that we
addressed when I spoke to the team. You know, I said, let's talk about the
second half, what could we have done better; talked to Brianne about those two
plays, time management-wise. We're always teaching them, they're still young.  
And then forget it, they've got 20 minutes left, we gave them a little bit of
air, take it away from them by playing defense, and the rebounding piece was
important to us.  
  
Q. In terms of defending (Lori) Bjork, was the game plan to get up on her
and make her beat you off the dribble?  
COACH RENE PORTLAND: She's awesome, she really is. I mean, we went into
overtime with them at Illinois and watching obviously the films that we did
because we had played them the first game, she's -- a lefty is tough to play,
and the fact that she can shoot the three, I think she's doing a tremendous
job with the role with Theresa has made her into a point guard. We trapped her
any time that she came off of a pick, I think that slowed her down a piece,
and we just knew we can't give up the threes -- was it Harris that got the
threes on us? Yeah, it was Harris that hit two threes, and then we had double
problems because we knew that we had to stay on Bjork the whole time.  
  
Q. How far does this win go in terms of cracking that 0-8 record in Big Ten
road games? How far does this go in terms of your team's confidence?  
COACH RENE PORTLAND: Well, unless they're University building, that doesn't do
anything; this is a neutral court. That's a challenge we have to take care of
next season, protecting the Jordan Center. And then that will be a big focus
of how do we travel and how do we play. What I tried to sell the players today
was 11 of us are on a neutral court, and at the pep rally we talked about the
Jordan Center and bringing the magic with us. It's just a great win for us. It
really is a great win. It's over a hump. We have a great challenge on Sunday,
but we get to stay here. We're not going home tonight and that's great.  
  
Q. What does it say about your team that you beat an Illinois team that has
been talked about as an NCAA tournament team.?  
COACH RENE PORTLAND: Our team owes a lot to Amanda Brown and Charity (Renfro).
You saw at the end of the game Charity came up with a great rebound, she hit
her two foul shots. Our team owes a lot to our seniors. We talked about that
the whole time. Senior day was a week ago for us, but we have to be fair in
how we let Amanda and Charity leave us and what kind of legacy do they leave.  
We were begging for seniors. With about three minutes to go in our timeout, I
mean, I'm sitting in my chair, I got on my knees and I said, "I'm begging you,
just keep doing what you're doing," and they were doing it for the kids.  
  
Q. You mentioned Charity. She doesn't show much on the stat line today, but
the interior defense that she played --  
COACH RENE PORTLAND: She's awesome. She got a steal -- she got around and got
a steal. I thought we played their post players very, very well. I thought we
played the inside game because we couldn't give them much help because of the
three-point shooters. Charity played very, very well tonight. I thought Amanda
did a good job. Any posts we pulled in I thought did a fine job. If you look
at their stat line, we played their post players well. They're very strong.  
  
Q. Of all of Brianne's performances you've seen these past few years, where
did this one rank?  
COACH RENE PORTLAND: She can shoot the three any time she's open and can make
it. Her threes were big tonight.  
At the beginning of the game when we were running so well, it was nice that
she was seeing the floor. Other than the last minute in the first half, I
thought Brianne did a special job for us being a point guard.  
  
Q. Brianne's ball control, no turnovers, how important was that, especially
after they started to come back a little bit from that run?  
COACH RENE PORTLAND: She played great defense when we needed her to play
defense and she took care of the basketball. Amanda is going to have turnovers
because people are just pounding on her and sometimes she thinks she's a guard
and she dribbles the ball a little too much. But Brianne had great control
other than that little bit of time, and at the end of the game when we were
telling her just to stay still and run this thing, she was very patient and
did what she had to do. But her threes were helpful.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will open it up with an opening statement from Coach Borton
and then go to the student athletes.  
COACH PAM BORTON: I thought we dug ourselves a hole at the beginning of the
game and I was very proud of our team and our kids for playing with the heart
and the tenacity that they did to cut the game to five points.  
The senior leadership really stepped up towards the end of the game when Rene
Haynes came out of the timeout to run and hit two straight baskets and scored
seven straight points there I think it was. I felt like the difference of the
game was obviously our post play with the turnovers and the lack of production
that we had inside on the offensive end. It made it a little more difficult
for us to score from the perimeter.  
Again, I was very pleased with the heart and the effort that our kids played
with and coming back from being down by 19, and hopefully got some basketball
left here yet in the postseason to play.  
  
Q. Kelly and Emily, what do you think the reason was for the slow start?  
KELLY ROYSLAND: You know, I'm not quite sure. I think that we turned the ball
over. We wanted to make pulse presence right away, try to get into the pulse
and kind of start off with that. It just seemed like we either didn't deliver
them a good pass and they bobbled the ball, and also DeHaan hit a couple shots
off the bat; she played a great game and I think she kind of jump-started
their offense.  
Like you said, we dug ourselves a hole right away, and once again, turnovers
kind of bit us in the butt. But that's kind of what it has been like all year.
Like I said, I'm proud of this team. This has been a great year and I hope to
continue it in some sort of tournament and postseason play.  
EMILY FOX: Maybe we were a little too excited. The posts, we tried to get in
-- and like Coach said, the turnovers, we just dug ourselves too deep. We
couldn't get out of it.  
  
Q. Kelly, what allowed you guys to get your outside game going in the last
seven or eight minutes when you couldn't get it going before that?  
KELLY ROYSLAND: I think we started to have more focus on getting the ball into
the corners and that baseline runner. Once I started around the baseline I was
able to get a few open looks. That definitely helped, and once I was able to
knock down a few shots it kind of boosted the team's confidence and got us
going.  
Unfortunately, at the other end they made a couple big buckets, we fouled,
different things like that. But I think it was just executing our offense
more, getting the ball in the corners. It's what we talked about doing, but we
didn't execute it as well as we wanted to early in the game. I think that was
the difference.  
  
Q. Question for Breanna. It seemed like your attitude got going after
Allyssa offensively, kind of helped the rest of the team get back into it. Can
you talk about the mentality you need to have against a player of that size?  
BREANNA SALLEY: I think that's just part of my role on this team is to bring a
little bit of energy when my team needs it the most. You know, I might not
score 20 points a game, but energy and just starting chipping away is what
really brought our confidence up. And I think that once you start to get into
it and it seemed a little bit more realistic, that hey, we can go at this team
and we can put a fight all the way to the end, and that's what we did.  
  
Q. Emily, every time it seemed like you guys got back within range, they
just didn't have a problem solving your pressure. Is that just the mark of a
team that has a lot of veteran leadership, a lot of seniors, and it seemed
every time you needed a stop they got it away at the other end?  
EMILY FOX: Yeah, we would make a big play and then their seniors would step up
and make a big play right back in our face. I think their leadership really
showed in that. But Breanna brought a lot of energy and just that tenacity.
But they kept coming back.  
  
Q. Kelly, what's it like to play against a player who has the kind of
physical presence like DeHaan has?  
KELLY ROYSLAND: It's very challenging. I mean, to have someone in the lane
that's 6'9", always there to probably contest your shots. Even if you get
around her, she's got an arm span that can reach four feet to get you from
behind, too. That's just a great player for their team post presence, and
she's only going to get better with time. Like I said, even though she might
not block shots, she disturbs a lot of people's shots trying to get into the
lane. You know, it wasn't easy for our post tonight, either, to have to go up
against that all night.  
It's definitely a challenge, but I give our posts credit. They've come a long
way this year, Zoe and Ashley, for first year playing in the Big Ten and all
that. But DeHaan is a great player and she just creates a good presence all
around, and when she's got it going, I think their team is quite unstoppable.  
  
Q. For Emily, what's the thought process for you just not knowing what's
next? Obviously with one win and then a game against a tough team, your play
down the stretch, what does that do for your confidence the rest of the way?  
EMILY FOX: I think we're just going to stay positive. We've had so much time
together we don't want to stop. We're just going to go into it with positive
mindset, practice hard, and just know that we're not done yet.  
THE MODERATOR: Now we'll continue with Coach Borton.  
  
Q. In the first game it seemed like Allyssa didn't have as much an impact,
and some of the student athletes are talking about how you continued to go
after them inside and really had an advantage there. Do you think the fact
that you didn't have an advantage inside to start off kind of hurt the team?  
COACH PAM BORTON: I think it did, and I thought we wanted to really try to
establish a post presence inside. I thought that's one thing that we did
extremely well when we were at Michigan State a week ago is we took it right
at them.  
I think Allyssa picked up two quick fouls in the first half, and our post
players stood back down, and we wanted to try to do that but instead we missed
some layups and we turned the ball over, and I think that really set the tone
from the beginning of the game.  
  
Q. After the game did you talk at all about what's next for this team and
whether it might have to be kind of going into a little uncertainty at this
point?  
COACH PAM BORTON: We didn't talk about where our minds are, but we still feel
like we have more basketball in us and that we still have a shot to
potentially get in the NCAA tournament, and if not, the NIT.  
I think the best thing for this team to do is to continue playing and get some
more experience and more games under our belt. I think this team is very young
and very, very talented, and I'm very excited to look at the future of this
team, and the more games we can play the more experience, the better it is for
us.  
  
Q. Do you think you have any NCAA chances, or are you looking probably at
WNIT and getting a couple more games of experience for this team?  
COACH PAM BORTON: I'm hoping we can still get in the NCAA tournament, with 17
wins, with South Dakota counting as a win, 17-14, there's teams a couple years
ago that got in at 17 -14 and they did not win their conference. It depends
what everybody else in the country is doing. There's a lot of teams on the
bubble, and to our advantage those teams get knocked off early in their
tournaments, and we'll just hope for the best right now. It's not in our
control, and worst-case scenario we can get ourselves in the NIT.  
  
Q. How much did it help just to have Kelly kind of get out of her funk, and
not only to make this a game but for your chances of possibly making a run,
whatever tournament that you play in?  
COACH PAM BORTON: I thought it was very important. She had all of her 18
points in the second half, and I think for her to be a senior and to really
kind of help lead this team, she's been leading this team all year, for her to
lead the run back in the second half, I think she really ended the game like
she wanted to be -- she ended the game like a champion. That's the best way I
can say it. I think everybody fed off of that. Some younger kids I think will
look up to -- I think some of the younger kids really fed off of that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2007

  

### [Jolene Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16860)

### [Janese Banks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16859)

### [Lisa Stone](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16858)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will take an opening comment from Coach Stone and then we'll
go to the student athletes for questions.  
COACH LISA STONE: I am so proud of the Wisconsin Badger women's basketball
team. I could not be more proud of them. They battled, they fought, got down
by eight in the second half and didn't waver. We competed, we battled against
one of the top teams in the country into over time, and just played with
tremendous resolve, tremendous intensity. People stepped up and did what they
needed to do.  
We out-rebounded a great team, and the way we played, I hope that somebody
takes notice because we competed at a very, very high level. And with 19 wins
and taking Purdue, who's just tremendous, they've got great, great players and
very well-coached, and again, I couldn't be more proud of our players. They
gave it everything they had and left themselves on the court.  
I feel bad for them because this is a win that I thought they deserved.  
  
Q. Jo, they took you out of the game a little bit the first time around, you
had 11 points and Gearlds and Wisdom-Hylton did some of that. How did you find
openings today and talk about your day.  
JOLENE ANDERSON: They played us the same as the first time at home. But I kept
on attacking. I knew they were going to be at my feet when I caught it, so
that's been something I was working on, penetrating to the basket more,
whether it was kicking or going up for a layup.  
My effort was okay today. Obviously is would have been better if we got the
win, but you've just got to live with that. Purdue is a great basketball team
and they're going to go far in the tournament. We just can't hang our heads.
We battled as best we could and unfortunately came up short.  
  
Q. Jolene, if you could describe a few plays that you were involved with.
The runner you made at the end of regulation time and the half court shot, I
guess, and then obviously at the end with the two-point shot rather than a
three-point shot.  
JOLENE ANDERSON: Well, the first play at the end of regulation it was a double
stack play. Obviously I was going to come up and get the ball from Janese on
the inbounds and Rae was supposed to set an on ball screen. Danielle Campbell
had a great hedge but I knew she wasn't coming up and forcing me back. I just
took her to the basket. The fans were cheering down the clock so I just kind
of threw it up there, and I knew once it left my hand it was going in, but the
game wasn't over there. We had to get a stop on defense and that's what we
did. Unfortunately I looked at the clock and it was a half court, and I had to
go up; I had to give our team to win a chance to win the basketball game right
there, but it didn't go in.  
With the second play, you'd rather score. If I took a three-point shot and I
missed it, that doesn't help us, so the two-point shot obviously gave us a
one-point -- we were still losing, but it still gave us an opportunity to win
the basketball game at that point.  
  
Q. Janese, can you just talk about how this team battles? As Lisa said, you
guys played really well, played defense, hit some tough shots, and especially
the first half you guys played strong.  
JANESE BANKS: I think everyone on this team knew we could win this game. There
wasn't a doubt in my mind. I looked up I think with two minutes left, we were
still down four, and I thought, We're not losing. We were either going to take
it overtime or we were going to win this game.  
I just think we just kept battling and that was a great mindset and we've got
to continue this. Like Coach Stone keeps saying, the biggest thing about this,
we're not done yet, and each and every game we've just got to keep battling
like that, no matter who we're playing, the No. 13 in the nation or if we're
playing a team that's not ranked. Each and every game, we've got to come out
and battle like we did today.  
  
Q. Janese, at halftime were there specific adjustments that you made or was
it more of a -- just a mental adjustment to get the comeback that you did
right away?  
JANESE BANKS: I don't think we did anything specifically. I think we focused a
lot on rebounding and I think we accomplished that. I think we talked about
getting to the basket and getting the ball inside. I thought our post players
played very well today.  
So I think that was maybe the only adjustments. We didn't make any.
Defensively, they thought they were playing really well. Like I said, even
though we were leading at halftime, Coach Stone wanted us to emphasize that
even more.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about your young players, especially Mariah
and Rae Lin and how strong that they played in this tournament and how you
feel that will impact the team going forward with postseason?  
JOLENE ANDERSON: They played great. Not just Mariah and Rae Lin; obviously all
of them did, all the ones that haven't been here before. It's been an
adjustment for them, and they accepted the adjustment, they played great the
whole tournament. They're young and they're excited, they want to win.  
So we're just going to battle back and practice next week. We'll just go at
it. We can't stop now. Our season is not over with. We've just got to continue
and go for what we want to go for.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue on with Coach Stone.  
  
Q. Lisa, same question for you. Just how you think your freshmen did,
specifically, like I said, Rae Lin and Mariah really had a big impact in this
tournament in particular.  
COACH LISA STONE: Without question. Starting with Rae Lin, certainly, she has
19 assists in two games; that's pretty good. That's nine, ten assists --
that's unbelievable. She plays with poise and confidence and is a -- has been
just a true joy, there's no question. We go on her.  
She was so mad at herself for missing layups early on, and after that we --
after that point she didn't waver. I mean, she could have panicked and didn't.  
It's a great match-up; FahKara Malone is tremendous. Those two are going to be
fun to watch for four years. It's a run match-up. Mariah Dunham got an open
look for a three that I thought was in. From my angle it looked like it was a
little bit long. We got the offensive board, we're going to need to clean that
up a little bit. But Mariah, too, both of them are emotional leaders for us in
their small way. They're young and they're freelance, but I love the way they
play. Defensively they've gotten better, offensively they've gotten better, as
well.  
But we needed Brittany Heins today, too. When you go to our bench and look at
our bench production throughout the year, it's been terrific. And a lot of
those kids are 18 or 19 years old.  
I stood before that team and I said, "Ladies, we're not done playing. That's
the best part of this." The best part of it is we're not finished playing this
season. We've been here many times before where this is it and then you're
done.  
We're going to take the week off and we're going to practice next week and
we're excited about playing postseason, and my hope is at the highest level.
But these young players, the experience that they gained today playing against
one of the best teams in the country in overtime with a lot of freshmen on the
floor, it's a great lead into what's to come in the future for us.  
  
Q. I was actually going to ask you about FahKara Malone a little bit. It
seemed like she actually hurt you guys with a couple of rebounds here and
there, some clutch free throws, even though she missed one. Can you talk about
her overall impact on the game today?  
COACH LISA STONE: I think when you talk about FahKara Malone you talk about
how fast she is. I think it's a little bit underestimated. If you tried to go
out there, if all of us in this room, there's no way we could stop her. She is
very, very quick, deceivingly quick.  
We talked to Rae and our guards about tracking and transitioning just to keep
her in front. Don't go for the steal, just keep her in front of you. That's
the main thing.  
I thought Rae Lin did a great job. I thought our guards -- Rae Lin is a safety
and someone else picks her up, but their run in the first half, that four-
minute stretch, came from our quick shots and they got the ball -- they were
in transition, and they were in transition because of her quickness. She finds
people.  
She also in the second half and in overtime got inside us. We've got to stay
on Lawless. We've been there, done that with her, scoring -- I'm sorry,
Gearlds. And we had to stick to her, so it gave her a driving lane, and she
finishes. She's very quick, a very solid, great leader for them, and again,
it's going to be a great match-up for the next three years.  
  
Q. After the tie ball with 15.4 seconds left and you had the ball, what were
you looking for? Being down three --  
COACH LISA STONE: A three. You know, you can go, you can look at that a lot of
ways. It's a stack four. It's a ball screen flare screen. Jo lost her balance
a little bit and took a shot.  
There's more plays to the game than just that one. It's unfortunate because
that may have gone in, may not have gone in. She did so much for us that that
is not the reason why we lost the basketball game. But the play is designed to
-- it's a ball screen flare screen play. Everybody in the world runs it.  
We got a score out of it, as she had mentioned, just a little bit too late.
They came out and they scored I think their first three or four baskets in
overtime and we got our backs against the wall. So I think you can go back to
that. I stand behind my team and a great player in Jolene Anderson. It's more
than that. But once again, a courageous battle by a great young feisty little
team.  
  
Q. I guess you can talk about your postseason hopes now. Just your thoughts,
I mean, very strong tournament --  
COACH LISA STONE: I think we looked like an NCAA team today. I don't know if
anybody in the room wants to disagree with me, but I thought we looked like
one today. We played hard, we did a lot of great, great things out there. I
just hope they take a look at us.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening comment from Coach Foster, then take it
to the student athletes.  
COACH JIM FOSTER: I'll just wait for questions.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes?  
  
Q. Jess, what was the toughest part of that game for you guys? Was it
Marscilla's injury or was it just the way Indiana was scrambling the game?  
JESSICA DAVENPORT: We've played without players before, but we have to give
credit to a good Indiana game. They were hungry for a win. They weren't going
to go down easy, so it's hard to just pinpoint one thing.  
  
Q. Jess, you planted yourself underneath the basket most of the game and you
never removed yourself. Was that Ohio State's intention to get you deep into
the paint?  
JESSICA DAVENPORT: Yeah, definitely. My teammates know I'm able to score
inside, and if I'm getting triple- or double-teamed, I'm going to hit them
back outside for shots, so our plan was to get good ball movement and execute
our offense.  
  
Q. Jessica, more along those lines, your 30 points, how good do you feel
about 14 of them coming from free throws?  
JESSICA DAVENPORT: It was nice. Those are free shots that you get to take at
the basket. Nobody is hanging on you, nobody is trying to get in your face and
make you miss it. It just takes concentration to knock them down.  
  
Q. Was that part of your personal strategy coming in? Do you think, I may
not be able to score every time against McKay but at least I'll get to the
line?  
JESSICA DAVENPORT: Since the start of basketball season, my was goal was to
get to the foul line a lot more than I did last year. Throughout the year I've
been working on my moves, and I've been able to get to the free throw line
more.  
  
Q. Star, you wound up with 13 rebounds. How focused were you on the boards
in this game and when did you really start going after them?  
STAR ALLEN: I think I really started going after them at the beginning of the
game. I don't think there was any time where I felt I wasn't going to get that
rebound. I just went for every rebound. I was real determined about getting
all the rebounds.  
  
Q. Star, you were sitting for a long time and you finally got back in the
game and made a couple of baskets real quick just to settle. Did you feel like
you helped settle things back there at the end?  
STAR ALLEN: I think when I came in and made a couple shots, I think it brought
a lot of energy to the team and it just lifted the team, as far as
transitioning on offense.  
  
Q. Jim, I've got a question for you. What's Packer's condition, and now that
you're playing without Brandie Hoskins, how do you think people will step up
to that challenge, and how is Packer?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: I don't know, the doctors will tell us. I think she's got an
ankle sprain. I don't know what -- there's degrees and there's low ones and
high ones, and we don't know the ins and outs yet.  
But we have players. It's just an opportunity for somebody else to step up and
be ready. I thought Stephanie (Blanton) came in and played some very good
defense, and Shavelle Little came off the bench, and Cherise Daniel, we as a
team know that she's been playing good in practice and she's ready to help us
in games. We'll just go down the list and get somebody out there.  
  
Q. Maria, can you talk a little bit about playing against their pressure
throughout the game and what they were trying to do with you guys?  
MARIA MOELLER: They were trying to pressure us so our post entrance pass
wasn't as easy, and then it was tough throughout the game just to take the
ball down the court. I just have to be smart with the ball come Sunday and
just take care of the ball and play as more of a point guard. I want the ball
in my hands at the start of the game.  
  
Q. We've talked about this a lot, Jess, but you guys have been in a lot of
close games this year. Did you call upon that again this time when they got it
down to about four?  
JESSICA DAVENPORT: I guess we did. We've had players on the floor who've been
in close games all year. Nobody got rattled. We've been in those positions
before, like you said, so it was just a matter of us going out there
executing, breaking down their pressure and making sure we got the ball in the
right people's hands.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Foster?  
  
Q. I want to go back to Marscilla, same thing, same ankle in the first half,
and do you know how she did it the second time?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: She wasn't really ready to play defense on that possession,
and when you're not ready to do something and then you have to do it kind of
quickly, it's like you moving quickly at your age or me moving quickly at my
age, you tend to injure something. Well, young people do it when they're not
ready. She was a little out of position and then had to react very quickly,
and sort of an awkward -- there was an awkwardness to it.  
  
Q. How much did not having her hurt you during Indiana's comeback in the
second half?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: I don't know, I thought -- today's game, with the three-
point field goal being what it is, and TV timeouts being what they are, it's
just a series of mini-games. So they had some runs, and then we answered their
runs. I think we had people make good choices and I think we had people make
some bad choices.  
But it's not like we had preparation time; we had to do it on the run and do
it within the framework of the game. I think the ball got in the right
person's hands, and everybody that played scored. I thought Ashlee made some
timely baskets for us. I think Shavelle came in and picked up some of the
defensive slack, so I don't think there's any one person that stepped up to
take Marscilla's place. I think a lot of people just did a little bit of her
job.  
  
Q. I suppose I could have asked her this, but talk about Maria. She only
took one shot but she was out there for 40 minutes.  
COACH JIM FOSTER: She's a tough kid, hard-nosed. By class she would be called
a freshman, but 29 games into the season playing the amount of minutes that
she's played, she's not that. But she did lapse into it a couple times and she
made a couple freshman mistakes.  
When you have somebody as skilled with the ball as Brandie and as skilled as
Marscilla, you're very willing to give it up. Now it's her time to step up to
the challenge, and I think she will, and has.  
  
Q. You've been asked for years about just Jess. But is tonight's game
another reminder that it starts with her?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Inside-out. We're an inside-outside basketball team. I've
been fortunate to coach some pretty good centers, and when you have a pretty
good center, it seems like a pretty good idea to throw the ball in. And when
you have somebody as unselfish as Jess, the ball will come out. Four assists
puts her up close to 70. That's a lot of assists for a post player.  
Sometimes you look at post players, and they have six, seven, eight, nine, ten
assists for a season. I don't think she's given credit for the kind of passes
that she makes and finds her teammates with. She's got a pretty good partner
in Star, and then with Tam (Riley) and Star, and then we can go big with 'Dre
(Andrea Walker). So we're comfortable with our post game.  
  
Q. You held them to 33 percent shooting. It looked like they were never in
rhythm. A lot of their shots were awkward shots. What did you do defensively
to rattle them?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: We just talked about staying in front of the ball. I think
the last time we played them at our place, I think our containment of the ball
was not good, and I think we really talked about that and emphasized that, and
I think did a very good job.  
If someone is determined to drive and you're sliding your feet, they're going
to have to take a difficult shot. So I think we just did a pretty good job of
moving our feet defensively.  
  
Q. Jim, one more question. I know Penn State and Illinois are playing each
other so you'll have to go through one of them. Which poison do you want,
Purdue or Michigan State?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: We're going to play the winner of Illinois-Penn State game.
And Sunday, if we're fortunate enough to win that game, I'll talk about the
game after that.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2007

  

### [Felisha Legette-Jack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16871)

### [Sarah McKay](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16873)

### [Kim Roberson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16872)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: We're just honored to be here and we just hope we
represent the Big Ten in a great light. Our team is very focused, we're going
to overachieve all the way to the end, and I'm just really proud of them. I'm
proud of them from yesterday, I'm proud of them today, and I'm proud of what
they're going to do moving forward in this tournament. I thought it was a
collective effort on our part, and we played as one. We were not going to be
bigger, stronger and faster than any team possibly in this tournament,
however, if we stay together, I think that we can continue to make good things
happen for our program.  
THE MODERATOR: Now questions for the student athletes.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the offensive spark you gave the team in the first
half and then again in the second half?  
KIM ROBERSON: I was just fortunate enough to run the court. We talked all week
about pushing the ball, and I was fortunate to attack and make things happen
on the wings.  
  
Q. Sarah, talk about the defensive game you guys played tonight. I know they
scored a whole lot in your last game, but your defense tonight probably, as
much as anything was key.  
SARAH MCKAY: Our defense was all about talking, the way we move from position
to position, letting each other know where we are on the court. When we talk,
we're pretty good out there. We try and switch it up and try and take teams by
surprise, and as long as we do our job, we can stop pretty much anyone.  
  
Q. Sarah, you've got a chance tomorrow night to be going head to head with
Jessica Davenport. What are your thoughts on that?  
SARAH MCKAY: I go into every game the same way, play hard, do what I can and
know my teammates are going to back me up. It's just another game, it just
happens to be a big one, and we're just going to get the job done.  
  
Q. Kim, good scoring, but talk about some of the little things you were
doing, hustling, made that diving play right before the timeout, things like
that, and as always, your defense?  
KIM ROBERSON: Well, I'm going to always try to give my team whatever I can.
The little things is hard, so I'm going to try to play with all that so our
team is going to be on top in the end.  
  
Q. Sarah, you've gotten off with a big lead of like 18 to 6, they have got
back on you, and then Kim scored like seven, eight points in a row. Could you
talk about the offensive spark she gave at that point to kind of give you guys
some breathing room?  
SARAH MCKAY: It's all about the momentum. Anyone on our team can step up at
any time, and we've seen that all season long. Kim was feeling it and we knew
she was so we tried to do what we could to get her the ball, give her the
confidence and be there to rebound for her if she missed. It's all about
momentum, and even when they start climbing their way back in, just keep
taking it away.  
  
Q. This is for both of you. This team scored 103 points five days ago. You
guys held them to half of that. Can you talk a little bit about what your
mindset was defensively to be able to shut them down as well as you did?  
KIM ROBERSON: We come in every game, our staple is our defense. We try to hold
our teams to 59 points. Our defense creates offense, so we were lucky to stop
people and be in the right positions. As Sarah said, we communicated very well
tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, ladies. Now questions for Coach Jack.  
  
Q. Coach, they shot 11 three-point shots before they finally made one. What
was working well for you guys defensively that wasn't allowing them to make
these three-point shots?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: The first time we played them, we realized we
stood around and stayed in one defense too long, and what we tried to do was
put them on their heels a little bit by changing up the defense, whether it
was just a small tweak or a major change in the defense, and that created them
to think a little bit longer, and then when they had to take the shot, the
clock was ticking and it was a little bit more duress.  
  
Q. I know you said you were excited to get back to the tournament after
beating Michigan State before, so talk about what kind of nerves did you have
tonight?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Just excitement. I love this time of year. You
know, ever since I was a kid March just did something for me. I love the game
of basketball, and just to be a part of competing in March is really exciting
to me. The Big Ten is first class, and when we were here four, five years ago
with Michigan State and we were trying to build a program then, I just really
wanted to be a part of it a little bit longer than the one game that we played
them. And I hoped that I'd have this opportunity, and God blessed me with an
opportunity to be the head coach here and we got to a second game here. My cup
overflows. I just really want to continue to represent Indiana in the Big Ten
in a first class way.  
  
Q. I thought Shanice had a very good solid point guard game tonight, dishing
out, playing her role? Can you talk about her improvements in the season until
now?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Shanice has been almost -- it's been brewing. You
know how you have something brewing and it's not quite done yet? She said to
me at the beginning of the year that she's going to help us get to postseason,
and I kept reminding her of that and she kind of kept coming to the edge and
not flying, and it was really neat that we went to her early and she came to
the edge and she kind of flew.  
Now she realizes that she actually was the Gatorade Player of the Year in
Connecticut and she can actually play this game of basketball. We hope this
wasn't a fluke; we hope she can bring it again tomorrow.  
  
Q. How important is it that some of the players that you have here made the
semis last year, had some success going into a game against a team that's so
highly ranked?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: I don't know about last year's team. I certainly
was on the East Coast and I don't want to take any credit for what happened
last year. Our team this year, we're going to stay in the moment. We're going
to believe everybody is great. We're certainly not going to fear anybody,
though. We always talk about the game of basketball is a microcosm of life,
and if you go in there with a sense of fear you're going to get what you
deserve that's nothing or half of what you probably should have gotten. So
we're going to take away fear. We're going to go and represent us as best we
can and we're going to respect Coach Foster and what he's done, and we just
hope we can go out there and play good basketball and make it a good game.  
  
Q. You've talked several times this year about anybody can do anything for
you on any given night. Nikki did not score tonight, Jamie didn't seem like
she had one of her usual games, but you had the players that did come through.
Is this as good of an example of that as you've had this year?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Yeah, that's my example of -- I don't believe in
go-to players. If Jamie and Nikki were our go-to players and they don't have a
good night we'd pack our bags and go. On any given night anybody can emerge
and be someone special. We take that lid off everybody and say it's your time
to fly, you have to go out there and try, just do that, go out there and try
to fly. I thought Sarah did a great job, and Whitney, her rebounds will never
indicate how hard she works and how much she means to our program, but she
goes out there and gives us everything she can give us.  
And Kim coming off the bench was just amazing for us to see. A kid that -- I
just have a lot of respect for Kim. I thought she got a little bit overlooked
and I think this is a time where she can show our conference how good she can
possibly be.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about that bench play you got today.  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: I don't believe in the bench, I believe that we
have eight players. We can't start eight, so we have to play -- our walk-on
came in and gave some incredible minutes. Kim did a great job, and Leah and
Nikki had to come off the bench in the second half, and they became bench
players if you look at it that way. And I thought Leah gave some attack mode
down the stretch that really gave us a little bit more energy. We're just the
elite eight, and we're going to continue to ride this train until the wheels
fall off.  
  
Q. No ties, no allegiance in this game, so is that what you thought, you've
got to get up ahead and stay ahead?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: No. We say don't ever look up at the score, have
the passion, lay on that floor and when you walk in the locker room, just look
in the mirror and let yourself know if you gave it all you got, and if you
didn't -- if we get blessed for tomorrow, then you can bring something extra
tomorrow. But the score really don't matter right now; it's about how hard you
work.  
I've got some great assistance coaches, they need to watch the score, they
need to look where the rhythm is coming, whether we have to make a timeout,
make some adjustments, but the kids just have to play basketball and play as
free as they can.  
  
Q. Coach, you seemed to do a better job on the defensive glass in the second
half. Can you just comment on that?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: I thought our kids were boxing out but they were
boxing out on the wrong side. They were boxing out on the side where the shot
was coming from, and the weak side glass was wide open and they were able to
sneak in there and get some opportunities.  
We made that adjustment in the second half. Lo and behold, the coach kind of
knew what she was talking about and those rebounds came to us. So they fought
both halves, they just had to change their thought process a little bit.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2007

  

### [Beth Combs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16862)

### [A.J. Glasauer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16863)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask the coach for an opening statement and then we'll
take questions for the student athletes and then we will dismiss them and
continue with Coach Combs. Go ahead.  
COACH BETH COMBS: Obviously a very disappointing day for the Wildcats. We
expected to come out here and do a much better job and have a much different
outcome. So it's a disappointing day. We have a great group of young women who
are with me today that are going to help us, and in many cases have done a
great deal for this program. I'm proud of what they've done, I'm proud of what
we will do, and unfortunately it wasn't the day we had planned.  
  
Q. AJ, the Gophers hadn't seen you guys since January since you guys mixed
up the lineup a little bit. Seemed like they were intent on taking the ball
out of Beth Marshall's hands and making her work. How did that disrupt you
guys getting into your offense?  
A.J. GLASAUER: Yeah, we made adjustments in the second half, but yeah, we were
a little hesitant, especially on the wings. We need to be more aggressive in
helping our time to the ball, which we didn't do first half.  
  
Q. Is this kind of disappointing in a way to lose in this particular manner,
considering the improvement that you've made in the last six games?  
COACH BETH COMBS: It's very disappointing. You know, we've been playing great
basketball as of late, the last three weeks of the season, even with some
losses. We were doing some great things and being able to move forward. We
really thought the layoff was going to pay off for us and be able to give us a
little bit of extra rest and extra prep time. It is a very disappointing way
to lose.  
  
Q. How much is the pressure and double-teaming your point guard, how much of
that kind of gets you off to a slow start?  
COACH BETH COMBS: They did a great job. We talked about their press, we talked
about their half court and full court traps. They were able to really put us
back on our heels. Beth Marshall -- looked like a freshman tonight. She didn't
play as well and wasn't able to handle the pressure as well as she has done in
the last three weeks. All around we didn't have anybody that stepped up today
and were able to handle it. We were able to do a little bit better job in the
second half but couldn't get out of our own way there to put the ball in the
hole.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Beth. Look forward to seeing you next year.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Once again we will ask Coach Borton for an opening statement
and then we'll direct questions to the student athletes and then we'll
continue again with Pam Borton.  
COACH PAM BORTON: I think we're really excited to be playing another day
tomorrow with this basketball team. This team really deserves to go onto the
next round. I thought this was one of our better defensive efforts for the
evening all season. I thought our shooting percentage obviously in the second
half was a lot better. Again, we did a great job on the boards, and this time
of the year you've really got to hone up your defense and really rely on your
rebounding to win basketball games in March.  
We've got to take care of the turnovers. We had 23 turnovers tonight, so
that's something we've got to improve upon for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kelly and Emily, the last time you were in a Big Ten tournament you had a
tough loss in the first round against Indiana. Is there something you wanted
to establish right from the start in this game to keep that from happening
again?  
KELLY ROYSLAND: Yeah, definitely. We didn't want to be -- wanting to play one
game and be done. We wanted to keep playing together as long as we could. We
definitely knew Northwestern was going to put up a fight. They played us tough
at their place last time. We have a high regard for this team. We want to make
a run at this tournament and we feel like we've been playing good basketball,
just haven't been able to finish games down the stretch. It was nice today to
be able to play fairly well, shoot well in the second half to get a decent
lead and not worry so much at the end of the game. But we're looking forward
to getting on track with Michigan State. Like you said, they're a great team,
but we're playing good basketball and are totally confident in ourselves, with
what we're doing, and it should be a lot of fun, and we're looking forward to
it, like I said playing as long as we can with one another. Because it's just
a great team.  
EMILY FOX: Yeah. We came into this game with the mentality that this is the
toughest game of the season and that we were going to bring our best game. We
knew Northwestern was going to bring it, and I thought defensively we really
mixed them up, and that's where we created a lot of our offense.  
Q. You guys hadn't seen Northwestern since they kind of mixed up their
lineup and put the ball in the hands of their freshman point guard No. 3 Beth
Marshall. It seemed like your plan today was to make life as tough as you
could for her.  
EMILY FOX: Yeah, we were trying to mix up our defenses. I thought Leslie
(Knight) did a great job helping me out in the beginning trying to mix it up
and get the ball out of her hands because she didn't want it. So just mixing
up our defenses really worked out.  
  
Q. Zoe, what was it like to get serenaded there at the end by the fans?  
ZOE HARPER: Yeah, it was good. I wish I hadn't gone out with five fouls again.
It was really good, the fans were behind us, and it's great.  
  
Q. Kelly, how tough has it been for you to get back into your groove
shooting? You've had a few games where you've scored under double figures, but
you've found a way to impact the game.  
KELLY ROYSLAND: You know I feel like I've gone in streaks where I've hit a few
shots and will go 0-for-5. I was very disappointed with my effort at Michigan
State. I really did not feel comfortable there with what I was doing, but it
was great for me to get back out there, knock down a couple shots tonight, and
play a lot more minutes. I had been playing just to get my confidence back, my
wind back, and I'm personally am excited to get back and play Michigan State.
I was personally disappointed in the effort that I gave and how the game
turned out. I'm really looking forward to tomorrow. I don't want to use my
injury as an excuse as to why I have been shooting bad. I mean I've been
trying to get in there and working with Danny to get my exercise up. I think
the big thing is getting it in the groove from the get-go and getting off a
few shots right off the bat, so hopefully that will work out for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Zoe, do you get to celebrate your birthday two days, one today for
Australia and one for here?  
ZOE HARPER: No, just one today. My parents were going to call me today, but
unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to talk to them, so I think I'll be
calling them instead.  
No, I think just one day is good enough, and hopefully tomorrow we'll get
another win, so hey, I'll take it as a second birthday present.  
  
Q. Zoe, what have you seemed to find here in the last couple weeks? You seem
to be playing a lot better, more productive.  
ZOE HARPER: Yeah, definitely. I think I just feel like that I needed to step
up, and I knew I could do it, so it was just a matter of time for me to step
up and do the moves that I know I have, and I think it's just working well for
me. It feels good.  
  
Q. Did you just realize you were close to a double- double?  
KELLY ROYSLAND: Before the game coach said we needed to go in there and
rebound. I just found the ball and went and grabbed it every time. I don't
know, I think that's good that the guards are getting more involved with
rebounding.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, ladies. Questions for Coach Borton?  
Q. How important was it to start off strong, because most of your team
hadn't experienced playing in the Big Ten tournament?  
COACH PAM BORTON: You know, I thought that it was important to start off
strong because we've only got two players that played in a Big Ten tournament
game, but I thought they played well. I thought we played intense and played
aggressive, and we played like it was going to be our last game of the season,
and we didn't want that to happen. I was pleased with our play, and obviously
we've just got to fix the turnover category.  
  
Q. How concerned were you about this game? It looked like Northwestern has
really improved in the last maybe six, seven games or so you guys have been on
a little bit of a downslide. How concerned were you about the improvement
Northwestern had made?  
COACH PAM BORTON: No matter what we're playing in the Big Ten Tournament, I'm
concerned about everybody because everybody knows each other like the back of
their hand, and Northwestern, they've improved a lot in the last four games.
They've switched their lineup a little bit, they've been shooting the ball a
little bit better the last four games, so I figured it was going to take a
great defensive effort for us to really throw them off balance, force them to
take shots not within their offensive sets, and I thought our defense really
made that happen.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the presence of Korinne (Campbell) on the floor and
kind of the opportunity she's opened up for herself and others in the last
couple games?  
COACH PAM BORTON: The last couple games she's played her best basketball of
the season. She's out there, playing smart, playing within herself, and we
really need her on the floor. She's just got to stop following so we can keep
her on the floor a little longer. She's playing great for us. She's playing
great on the boards and that's a big part of our game. She's a great defensive
presence out there, and I think she's feeling more comfortable on the
offensive end, as well.  
  
Q. How important is it to get balanced in scoring when you have Kelly
(Roysland) not shooting the ball the way she's used to and then Emily (Fox)
maybe not having the big game?  
COACH PAM BORTON: Well, I think everybody has got Kelly and Emmy's number.
They're two of our best players on the team and they're going to make them
take very difficult shots, but it's important for us especially during
tournament time and towards the end of the season to really establish an
inside presence. I thought Zoe did that for us tonight. I can remember back
when we made it to the Big Ten championship game that we had great inside
presence from not just Janel McCarvell but all the players on the team, and I
think that was a big reason that we were able to play from one day to the
next.  
  
Q. How do you like the setup that you're playing a team that you just played
five days ago that your players probably want another crack at?  
COACH PAM BORTON: Our players would definitely like another opportunity
against them. We know them very well and they're fresh in our minds. I thought
our defense was very successful against them. We've got to shoot better. I
think we shot 30 percent for the game, but I like our chances, and it's going
to be a different ballgame. We're on a neutral court and we'll see what
happens.  
  
Q. Do you think Zoe was auditioning for point guard there at the end?  
COACH PAM BORTON: I hope not. We'll keep her in the paint.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. We look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2007

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Kristi Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16869)

### [Krista Vandeventer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16870)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will begin by asking Coach Bluder for an opening statement
and then go to the student athletes.  
COACH LISA BLUDER: I just want to congratulate Indiana on their win tonight.
Obviously, we're disappointed with the way we shot the ball, and like all year
long, if we don't shoot the ball well, we don't play very good defense. Sarah
McKay had a very nice game, she's a tough person to stop inside, and obviously
she's had 19 against us and some real high percentage shots. You know, our
three-pointers were very uncharacteristically low and our three-point shooting
tonight, and that hurt us quite a bit.  
  
Q. Kristi, why was the offense so sluggish tonight? It was obviously a
struggle all the way through for you guys.  
KRISTI SMITH: They played great defense, and like Coach said, we weren't
hitting from the three-point line, so if our shots don't fall, we don't play
very good defense. That's kind of our downfall.  
  
Q. Krista, what can you guys take from this year? Will the frustrations
carry over to next year and will you be a better team?  
KRISTA VANDEVENTER: This was definitely a learning year for us. It didn't go
as well as we thought it would have. We're in kind of a unique position that
we get everyone back. So I think that will be good for next year, but we're
just going to evaluate ourselves and work harder in the summer and we'll have
a better year next year.  
  
Q. Kristi, did anyone do anything on defense that maybe caught you off guard
as far as what you were seeing?  
KRISTI SMITH: No, I felt like I was getting good looks, and I just wasn't
hitting them. But they (Indiana) didn't do anything that I hadn't seen before.  
  
Q. Kristi, you're 14-16 going home. On that note, how sour is that for
you?  
KRISTI SMITH: It's very disappointing. It's not what we expected, but we've
just got to work a lot harder, and next year will be better.  
  
Q. Kristi, can you talk about how difficult it was to be playing defense out
there, and to suddenly see one of these crazy shots from Kim Roberson and go
in?  
KRISTI SMITH: She's a great player. I felt like we played good defense on her,
and then she'd just sling one back and it would go in. I don't know.  
THE MODERATOR: We will dismiss the student athletes. Thanks, ladies. We'll see
you here next year.  
Questions for Coach Bluder.  
  
Q. Why do you think your team, after starting the season 5-0, could never
really get momentum after that?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Yeah, we just speculated a little bit on that, but we don't
have a tried-and-true answer that we absolutely know what the problem was with
this team this year. I wish we did because then we'd be able to solve it, and
we would have solved it before we got here.  
But we do tend to lose our confidence quicker than we should. I think that is
something that we're going to have to work on. It's a lot of mental toughness
to me, and being stronger mentally when things don't go your way. Obviously
all year long we've struggled defensively, and we're going to have to make
changes on that. We know that, and the players know it. I think they have to
challenge themselves a little harder in the off season, and I'm hoping that
this hurts bad enough that they'll want to do that.  
  
Q. How surprised were you with Wendy (Ausdemore) not being able to come up
with any points, and what was Indiana doing to keep her from being a factor in
the game?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: I was very surprised. She's an excellent three-point
shooter and she's done it all year long for us. Obviously when we don't have
that outside weapon, it hurts us.  
But the at the same time I think Indiana did a good job of staying with her
when the ball went inside. A lot of teams double off, and they really just let
us have one-on-one post moves inside, and I think we needed to take advantage
of that. If we would have taken advantage of that, then they would have had to
start doubling off of our outside players and giving us more open looks.  
  
Q. How do you work on mental toughness with the players during the off
season? What sort of things can be done?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: You know, we have a sports psychologist that works with our
team, and she works with us as a team and she works with the individuals when
they want to have help.  
But I believe in that, I really do. I believe so much in positive thinking and
believing you can do it. I think that it's a great lesson for young women to
learn at this time in their life because it's going to serve them well for the
rest of their life if they can learn it right now. So I think working with
somebody like that is valuable. But also, I think confidence is gained by your
work ethic, confidence is gained in the weight room. I think if you push
through how hard you think you can work in the weight room, that really
transpires into pushing harder on the floor than you've ever worked before.
But I do believe a lot of it starts in the weight room in the summertime.  
  
Q. I'm sure you were prepared for Kim Roberson, but talk about Indiana's
quality reserve minutes from Billington. She doesn't usually play 26
minutes.  
COACH LISA BLUDER: I mean, they had a nice balance tonight with a lot of
different players. Sarah McKay to me, is somebody you have to spend so much
time worrying about inside that it frees up a few more shots on the outside.  
Kim Roberson obviously hit a great percentage against us. She has a very hard
shot to defend because it's kind of a slingshot from behind the head and she
banks in the three tonight, so things were definitely going her way.  
  
Q. Could you talk for a brief moment about the performance you got from
Nicole (VanderPol) tonight.  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Yeah, Nicole went from being a reserve player for us at the
beginning of the year to being our leading scorer in the last game, and our
leading rebounder, as well. Nicole is a good athlete but she's not as gifted
as a lot of kids, she just works so hard. The kid just works so hard in there.  
You know, I'm happy for her. She's a bright spot for us this year because she
really developed, especially in this last three weeks, this last month.  
You know, last year when Stacy went down, Megan took advantage of an
opportunity and she had a great year. This year when Wendy went down, Nicole
took advantage of an opportunity, and I think she really grew in her game and
that's going to help her over the summer.  
  
Q. From what you saw tonight of Indiana, what kind of a chance do you give
them tomorrow against Ohio State?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: I would give them as good a chance as anybody. Ohio State
with the loss of Brandie Hoskins, I can tell you firsthand how much injuries
hurt a team. That was a big loss. Brandie Hoskins was a great player and
that's a big loss.  
Ohio State has such tournament toughness because they've been here so long.
Jess Davenport obviously is going to match up with Sarah McKay and take away
that strength, and so I'm not going to predict a winner by any means, but it
should be a great game and I look forward to seeing it.  
  
Q. After scoring 103 points against Wisconsin and then 53 here, what does a
performance like this say about your team?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Inconsistent.  
  
Q. At the beginning of the Big Ten season you just seemed to be on a roll
but then it just never seemed to happen. Was it one thing or --  
COACH LISA BLUDER: You know, we never were able to get on a roll. You know,
looking back on it, I probably over-scheduled a little bit in the non-
conference. I think maybe we should have scheduled a little bit lighter
opponents. When you look around the Big Ten at some of the other non-
conference schedules that people are playing, they're gaining a lot of
confidence with their non-conference schedule. I don't think that we ever
gained confidence with our non-conference schedule. So that's probably a
mistake, but the bad part is it's already done for next year, and it's just as
hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. We look forward to seeing you again next
year.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2007

  

### [Carly Benson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16857)

### [Cheryl Burnett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14070)

### [Stephany Skrba](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16856)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We've got Michigan with us, and we'll open up with a general
statement for you and we'll go to questions for the student athletes, and get
ready to use the microphones.  
COACH CHERYL BURNETT: Anybody's preparation going into play the Wisconsin team
is you have to prioritize, stopping Jolene Anderson and Janese Banks. You can
see by the stats sheet that they ended up getting their shots. We thought we
made them work for them.  
The first half, again, this is statistically nothing that you can't gain off
the statistics yourself, but our turnovers and their offensive transition off
their turnovers in the first half was a very big key to their lead in the
first half. We battled back, had a great beginning of the second half to get
back in the game, got within five, and again, off the stats sheet, their free
throws and their three-point shots. While they were hitting big shots, we were
missing some big shots.  
And then you're trying to play behind against a team that I think gained great
confidence off of Jolene Anderson and the things that they can do, and again,
you're playing from behind at that point.  
We really wanted to throughout the course of the game give the basketball to
our post, especially off what we call the second side on the break, the high
side of the post a little bit. We had some periods where we did that well, and
the two young ladies that you see up here today, Carly Benson and Stephany
Skrba really battled throughout the course of the game offensively. Both of
these ladies during the course of this year have really gained some
confidence.  
When you look, you see Wisconsin had four players in double figures and we
just have two.  
The two things that we continue to battle with is the turnovers. First half
wasn't good; second half, of course, we did much better. And then just really
struggling to score in specific areas. I'm very proud of these two young
ladies what they've done all year, but we've got to get -- had to get some
other players scoring, and we've been challenged by that.  
  
Q. This is for Carly or Stephany. Wisconsin had a big edge on the boards and
how they were able to generate a lot of points. What were they doing and how
tough was it to keep them off the boards?  
STEPHANY SKRBA: I think they got great inside position because I guess -- I
think that there were some times that our scramble calls and things like that
and we weren't rotating the way that they should have been, and there was just
open girls that were able to get rebounds. They were shooting quick shots
sometimes or just even the lanes that they were making we weren't boxing out
the second shot, things like that.  
  
Q. What adjustments were you able to make off the offensive end?  
STEPHANY SKRBA: Still be aggressive but not turn it over so much, still see
the shots.  
  
Q. What's the biggest difference between this game and the last two you've
played against Wisconsin? Both games were pretty tight, pretty good games.  
CARLY BENSON: I can't really tell you, but all I know is that this game our
turnovers in the first half really killed us. We didn't really have momentum
because of it and they were scoring off of those. I think that's what really
killed us this game.  
STEPHANY SKRBA: We couldn't really seem to find a groove offensively, either,
and I think that hurt us.  
  
Q. At one point you guys had the deficit down to five. And while you all
were shooting really well to open the half, Wisconsin was, too, and their
three-point shooting never really got anywhere. Were you guys not able to get
off of their shooters or what was the problem there?  
COACH CHERYL BURNETT: Can I help? What Wisconsin was doing during the stretch
is they were really trying to isolate their post players, and they were
getting some dribble penetration, and as we helped on the post, they were
doing a great job of finding their shooters, making the next pass and getting
what we call rhythm jump shots, release and wide open shots that we weren't
contesting because we weren't doing what we consider recovery. Not to steal
their thunder, but....  
  
Q. Do you think there was a point in the second half where you were out of
the game mentally?  
CARLY BENSON: No, I don't think so. I think in the second half that's where we
started to come together, be more aggressive offensively. I think we came
together better in the second half than we did -- we regrouped, I think, but
somewhere we just let it go.  
  
Q. Were there any adjustments that could have been made in the first half to
cut down the turnovers?  
STEPHANY SKRBA: Well, we were doing a pretty good job of getting the ball. We
got some good steals and things like that, just slowing down, not pushing all
the time, just sometimes reading when it's open, reading what it's not open,
taking the opportunities that we have and not forcing them.  
  
Q. Do you want to talk about maybe the energy that Krista (Clement) was able
to bring when she came in?  
STEPHANY SKRBA: Krista is a great leader. Any time she's in the game or on the
court she's always talking to everybody making sure everybody knows what
they're doing, trying to give people confidence, things like that. She's an
excellent passer. We have a lot of confidence when she's in the game because
we know that even if things start to go bad that she's going to be there and
building our confidence and saying it's okay, it's okay, we can get it back,
just steady.  
  
Q. For both of you, what is the thought you're going to take heading into
next year? What's the one thing you want to do? Obviously win more games, but
what's your mindset going to be?  
STEPHANY SKRBA: Well, mine is just to work hard in the off season, to work
hard and for us as a team to come together and play -- work hard on our
individual games, and when we go out there on the court to bring it all
together and work as one.  
CARLY BENSON: Yeah, definitely working on offensively just making sure that we
can be more consistent, getting off more shots in the summer, playing more
pickup, getting together, be able to play together, read each other, and just
working on our team camaraderie, and hopefully it'll come around next year.  
  
Q. You mentioned the defense against the three-pointers later in the game.
What was happening defensively when Anderson hit several early in the game to
get doing? Did you lose track of her?  
COACH CHERYL BURNETT: The thing that I think is very special about Jolene is
there's such a variety of ways that she can score. They definitely tried to do
a great job of posting her up off of what we call a bump cut. She's able to
come off screens and that's what was happening a little bit in the first half.
They do what we call cross, enables you to switch perimeter to perimeter and
then the posts went downscreen, and we have a specific way that we want to
defend that.  
Jolene does not make it easy because she also reads her defense extremely
well, can dribble penetrate and can read the three. She was getting those
shots off the pass, off the down screen off of where we were going through the
screen instead of -- you cannot give her three feet when she catches because
she's going to make you pay for it. We needed to get some more help from our
posts in that situation. Any little mistake you make, she's going to counter
it.  
  
Q. Do you have anything to add about the differences between the two regular
season games against Wisconsin?  
COACH CHERYL BURNETT: Well, you know, the unique thing is both teams are going
to play just a lot of man and really try to play some pressure man. Even
though we turned the ball over in the first half, taking nothing away from
them, it really wasn't a situation where it was their defense creating that. I
think the difference -- a little bit of the difference between the two teams'
defenses is I think their recovery was much better their ours, and they made
the next pass much better than we do. And that was the situation tonight. I
think the games have been very similar. We were able to hit some more shots in
the early games to keep it a little bit closer, and we knew coming into this
game we had could keep them off the offensive boards. They've gotten 15
offensive boards. I guess that's not anything different. I think that was the
same, where they got their 20 offensive rebounds.  
  
Q. You got within five. Did you run out of gas or was it something they
did?  
COACH CHERYL BURNETT: You know, all year, and just about with every single
opponent, we fought to get back in it and then we'll have three possessions
that we cannot utilize and capitalize on, where another team does. You know,
it happened again tonight. I hate to say that we're tired; that's not what we
want to say because I looked out there and their kids played a lot more
minutes than ours did, and we felt like we wanted to capitalize on the fact
that they were tired at times.  
Definitely having that go-to kid that you gain a lot of confidence off of and
being able to execute and not turn the ball over in those instances.  
If we could gain that quality of establishing those go-to kids -- I look at
these two sophomores, Carly Benson and Stephany Skrba, and really some great
minutes for us this year. They've improved a lot in a lot of areas, and
looking forward in our program, I can see those two become those players that
want the basketball in those critical positions and being able to execute and
get the big stop. The other part, and again, I give all the credit in the
world to Wisconsin, Jolene Anderson and Janese Banks, they know in critical
moments they're hitting a lot of those big shots and good enough that they
give up a shot or what we call a better shot and they can see the open player
when they get a lot of attention.  
  
Q. Talking about having players having confidence, what kind of challenges
do you think a deep rotation has towards that?  
COACH CHERYL BURNETT: Can you be a little more specific on what you're asking
me?  
  
Q. Well, this game is pretty typical, you play pretty much everybody who is
dressed. Do you think that hurts a player's confidence to take a big shot at
the end?  
COACH CHERYL BURNETT: I think all year we've talked consistency, consistency,
consistency. We needed to get consistency from players both in practice and in
games, and as soon as we gain that consistency, those are players that are
going to continue to be able to get those minutes and maintain those minutes.
I think we finally got some late in the year, but in a tournament environment,
some experience does pay off, and we try and use that experience to our
advantage, especially in the first half when we had a very experienced group
doing a great job of trying to get us back in the game, and then in the second
half we had a different group that did a great job of trying to get us back in
within five.  
  
Q. Talking about at some points in the game your shot selection was a little
bit rushed. Talk about that.  
COACH CHERYL BURNETT: Well, the time where I saw us get a bit rushed is when
you're trying to get back in the game. You know, you're trying to manufacture
something defensively, and I give a lot of credit to their freshman point
guard. She does a great job of handling the basketball, bringing it back out,
controlling the game, and now you're controlling the game, as well, with two
very good other guards where it's very hard to try to have your defense create
anything, and by that time, we're running out of possessions. We might have
looked a little bit better if we just said, hey, slow down offensively, but
we're going to go out to win, and it doesn't matter how far we're up or how
far we're down. So at that point you're right, we had to rush a few shots to
try to create something for us.  
  
Q. Coming off a year like last season, how do you measure the level of
success?  
COACH CHERYL BURNETT: It's been a challenging year, challenging in the fact
that we got really close on a number of times, and I go back to the Notre Dame
game. You can look at the Wisconsin game at home. Quite a few of those games
we're talking about the same thing, three possessions making the difference on
winning a game and staying in it or starting to lose a little bit of that
confidence and to compete. It's been challenging because you want to kids to
have payoff, you want them to have payoff for their effort, and of course you
look for the little improvements to allow them to gain confidence. But we all
know that winning makes life much easier.  
I continue to give a lot of credit to this team because they continue to try
to come out and fight and come out the next day and practice and try to do the
things that we're asking them to do. I hope that answers that question.  
  
Q. Would you consider this season a success?  
COACH CHERYL BURNETT: Well, you know, you ask a coach, and any coach is going
to want to win every single game, and any coach that doesn't win the National
Championship is thinking, well, I wish we had done better. Certainly you want
to go out and win games.

### [Janese Banks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16859)

### [Lisa Stone](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16858)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Lisa Stone with Wisconsin is with us. Coach, if you could
give us an opening comment and then we'll go to the student athletes for
questions.  
COACH LISA STONE: Very, very proud of our basketball team, maintaining focus,
overcoming some first-half jitters, turning the basketball over the first
half. But our defense was much better, forcing 25 percent from the field in
the first half. Second half we withstood a Michigan run. Again, I'm proud of
our players for that. Their confidence on both ends of the floor started to
prevail, and this is a great test for a very, very young team with no seniors.
They rode the wave of (Jolene) Anderson and (Janese) Banks. Jolene was as much
of an All-American as you've ever seen today. And then Janese, obviously the
two of them were prolific when you can put up big numbers over 20. Mariah
Dunham made her first career double-double, huge for us. And Danielle Ward was
one away from a double-double. That's four people in double figures for our
basketball team with an inside-outside attack. Rae Lin D'Alie with ten
assists.  
I love this team. They are down here with a lot on their minds in terms of
what we want to get accomplished this season, and we're playing for a lot, and
to be able to put ourselves in position to play Purdue again after just
playing them too long ago and playing very well. We came to play a lot of
basketball teams and we're excited we're still alive and we're excited about
our opportunity to play against Purdue and play very well.  
  
Q. Was there a point that you thought you knocked Michigan out of the game
mentally?  
JANESE BANKS: I think it's kind of what Coach Stone said in the locker room.
You know she wanted us to keep the five, and there was one point they were
down by seven, and hit a jump shot and missed and I think we took over from
there. First two minutes we just went back and forth trading baskets and me
and Jolene just looked at the whole team and said we got to start getting
stops. We can't keep trading baskets like this. You know we got to do what we
do best. And I think we started getting stops. Plus by the ten-minute mark,
and then I think that's when we really felt like, you know, we had the game
sewed up. We knew we had to keep playing, because Michigan is a team that can
get right back in it, they play great defense, they, you know, pressed really
hard, so we knew what our mentality was.  
  
Q. You mentioned the last couple times you played Michigan, what was the
biggest difference between -- I mean they played you pretty tight the first
two meetings. What's the biggest difference between that and a twenty-point
loss?  
JANESE BANKS: I think our mindset right now is I really don't think it matters
who we play. We're going to prepare for each team. Whatever they do best we
want to stop. Coming to the Michigan game we knew our defense had to be
prolific. They've got a very athletic team, they attack the basket hard. I
think we maintained that.  
Tomorrow is the same thing. It's going to be defense. If we can continue to
play our defense, what we do best, we're going to be an awesome team.  
  
Q. This question is for Jolene. Covering enough of these things, on Thursday
I see too many teams know who they might face on Friday looking ahead, the
proverbial toe gets stubbed. I'm asking you how important was it going into
this strictly thinking about the Wolverines and not sitting there thinking,
boy, Purdue is playing the next day?  
JOLENE ANDERSON: It was very important because if you didn't focus on Michigan
-- because Purdue was playing really well on Friday. We focused on Michigan
all week, went out there and played our 40 minutes of basketball. I don't
think it was our best basketball but we won this basketball game, now we have
Purdue tomorrow and all our focus is on Purdue now.  
  
Q. Jolene, Coach just said that you guys are playing for something. Can you
elaborate on what she's talking about and just the team's mentality coming
into this tournament?  
JOLENE ANDERSON: We came to this tournament to do something we haven't done
for a long time, playing in the postseason nobody knows, so we've got to go in
there focused, play one game at a time and play 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Jolene, some of the coaches said that they thought your focus in practice
the last couple days was more intense than they have seen from you. Is that
true? And can you just describe your mindset?  
JOLENE ANDERSON: Sure. I'll just agree with them. It was a little more
focused. This is our third season. Obviously the Big Ten is over with, now
it's tournament time. There's teams that you just -- one game and you could be
done, so you've just got to go out there and play for 40 minutes, like I said,
and play as hard as you can, and hopefully we'll get the win.  
  
Q. Mariah, the first game -- the one time you played Purdue, what's the
thing to comes to your memory bank first and foremost in your meeting in
Madison against the Boilermakers?  
MARIAH DUNHAM: Katie Gearlds. She's just an amazing player. I think we had a
great game against them the first time. It was one of our better defensive
games minus Katie Gearlds. I think basically just stopping her, and then
getting on the boards, just doing all the little things just to help us win.  
  
Q. Janese, kind of the same line of questions. You only saw Purdue once just
a couple weeks ago. What are your memories of that and what do you have to do
tomorrow?  
JANESE BANKS: I think we've got to eliminate easy baskets. Katie Gearlds is a
great player, she's going to score. I think we can eliminate her easy basket.
We can eliminate Malone getting easy baskets. I think Lindsay Wisdom-Hylton
has great moves inside, so we've got to focus on everybody. She's an all-
American. So I don't think it's about stopping one player, but I think it's
about -- when you play a team like that that knows how to win and is highly
ranked I think it's about stopping their easy baskets, not letting them get
second and third chance opportunities because they're going to score, but it's
going to eliminate the way we score and if we do what we do best then I think
we put ourselves at an advantage.  
  
Q. Coach Stone, there was a period of time right after the game, the second
half, where Michigan needed a basket and I believe you had them down to four,
but really after that they couldn't get any closer because you continued to
hit three-point baskets. Was there something about their defense that wasn't
enabling them to get any closer?  
COACH LISA STONE: Actually I didn't want it to get to five, so if it did --
well, hopefully it didn't get to five. Did it cut to five? Any closer than
that I was going to call a time-out. I didn't want them to get any closer. If
it was that I need to go back and watch the film, and I can't add very well.
The bottom line is they didn't get any closer than that because I think we
took some pride. I believe it was 11 for 16 possessions. If it was 8 for 10
then it went on to be 11 for 16. It got better for us. We committed ourselves
to the boards. You saw Heins out there pretty often and when they brought in
Phillips we went back with Danielle and Caitlin and we committed ourselves to
the boards, and that was the difference. The rebounding advantage for us
allowed us to get transitioned, allowed us to have to put some comfort zone
distance for ourselves.  
  
Q. What do you think is different about this team this year that when they
did get it to five and then you made a three-point shot that you were able to
respond and pull away?  
JANESE BANKS: I think our options. I think they may be different. We have a
lot of different options. It's not just one person that's going to do
anything, but we've got everybody. We've got inside out. We need -- we know we
can go to D or Mariah or Caitlin or anybody. We know we can finish. I think
that's the biggest thing. I think our composure. I think everybody is pretty
confident what we can do. We've got great believe in our point guards, I
think. We have a lot of faith in Rae Lin that she's going to run the show. I
think that's the biggest thing is that we don't get wrapped up in fear. I
think maybe it was the fear of teams coming back, but I think now it's the
options that we have to go through.  
  
Q. Coach, if you'd indulge, does the win over Purdue get you back in the
NCAA picture or are you already back in the picture?  
COACH LISA STONE: I'd love to have that conversation with you tomorrow. This
team has passed a lot of things. We were chosen low in the Big Ten, so to even
be talking the fourth or fifth seed going into Sunday, it's a great
breakthrough for our program. And this entire group is back next year so we're
elated by that, the fact that we've had 18 wins, now 19, no one can take that
away from us. We talk about that and battle for it, and I know my cohorts in
the Big Ten won as many games as our team before the tournament. Certainly
Purdue is a ranked team, we're playing them on neutral court, but they're a
solid team, and I think it's certainly worth consideration.  
  
Q. I know obviously there's a great amount of respect that you had for
Sharon Versyp. Is it a given in your mind that no matter what, Sharon's team
is going to be ready to play tomorrow? That's not even something you think
about; that's something that you just say that's a given and move on, let's
try and defend Katie Gearlds and so forth?  
COACH LISA STONE: Without question it's a given. They've been there, done that
for four years. I'm not sure the win-loss record of their senior class with
Erin Lawless and Katie Gearlds. Janese hit it on the head when she talked
about their entire team. They've got a freshman point guard, and that's fun.
Everybody who saw our team last time -- some of our best basketball was played
against Purdue. We came up short but we played very, very well at our place.
The fact that they're big and they're long and they can do a lot of things,
they have a tradition of success, and that's the part that our team right now
has in our mind hopefully broken through. Our expectation is very high. I go
into this game knowing full well that Purdue is going to play tomorrow, but
we're not going to have an excuse. We're going to really feel good about what
we did today because I thought we had some great things happen around the
court.  
They're young and energetic and bouncing off the walls. Eight of them have
never done this before, so to put a team on with No. 2 on it, they're young
women, and some are taking exams tomorrow. Life goes on, yes. The fact that
when the ball goes up at noon against Purdue, this team will be very, very
ready, very, very focused knowing that we have a wonderful opportunity, and
the results will be as they are and our team will play as well as we can.  
  
Q. How important is an NCAA bid for this program, and how do you look at a
win against Purdue as a must-win in solidifying that?  
COACH LISA STONE: Actually I have not even talked about that with our team. I
asked our team, I said we're not stopping here when it comes to doing what we
need to do. The goal is to win a Big Ten Championship. That secures our berth
in the NCAA tournament. That's a given. We've done a lot of great things
throughout the season. I'm not going to put that type of pressure on this
young team. I'm not going to say we have to win this game to get in the
tournament. I'm going to say we have to win this game to win this tournament.  
Why come if you don't plan on winning? So that's our focus, and that's truly
going to be my effort. As we go back to work, and we're playing a team again
that we just saw however many days ago, we'll go with confidence and composure
and we'll lay it on -- we'll play hard, I guarantee that.  
  
Q. Two things. One, this morning when we talked you said that you had hoped
that you could get Jo some time and Janese some time on the bench so they
didn't have to come back 20 hours later. That happened. Also, Rae Lin had ten
assists.  
COACH LISA STONE: Back to Janese's comment about Rae D'Alie. We have a lot of
confidence in our 5'3" kid from Waterford. She's been vocal. She's our
automatic press breaker. I can't say enough about her and her ability to allow
Janese and Jolene to play their positions. Janese and Jolene don't get 22 and
23 points without her. The fact that we're getting scoring from our post helps
a ton. Jo is like okay, okay, I want to keep playing. We need to rest you for
tomorrow.  
The bottom line is I think our team is pretty fresh. They're in there with the
trainer and we'll get fluids in us and a nice meal and we'll be ready to go
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Obviously Jolene is the leader for you all the time, but have you seen
her have a look of determination like she had the last couple days before?  
COACH LISA STONE: Well, probably -- she wants this tournament. She really,
really wants it. She texted me about five times asking if she can bring
another bag because she's got so many clothes, and I love seeing my bag this
full, and can we wash our practice gear, all these questions as she's getting
ready. I've never had that from her before. The fact that you pack a big bag
and you can hopefully stay a long time and wear everything in the bag, the
better. The more dirty clothes, the better.  
  
Q. Is there a danger tomorrow with your players focusing too much on Katie
Gearlds based on what she did the last time?  
COACH LISA STONE: The very first thing I said to them, too, is there's more
than Katie Gearlds. Katie is going to come with some confidence. She's a very
good player. She's very, very special. They know that they have a lot of other
options. I think Lindsay Wisdom-Hylton is very special; I think Erin Lawless
is an X factor. I think Malone certainly makes them go. They have a lot more
weapons than just Katie. We can't focus just on Katie Gearlds, we can't. Can
we do things to make thing more challenging so she doesn't get 41, yes. But we
can't put all of our energies on one player.  
  
Q. (Inaudible.)  
COACH LISA STONE: Well, transition baskets. Rebounding led to transitions. We
got on the glass and got off of transition. We also found the hot hands. Jo
and Janese fought hot in the second half, Mariah drained a couple threes.
Scoring went up. Scoring hasn't been an issue for us. It's usually the other
way around, that we're giving up too many. I'm proud of our kids. They're a
wonderful team, and we are look forward to staying here a long time.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

## March 10, 2007

  

### [Mallary Gillespie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16396)

### [Jeff Judkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13839)

### [Lauren Riley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17067)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Brigham Young University head coach Jeff
Judkins and student-athletes Mallary Gillespie and Lauren Riley.  
Coach, if you want to just begin with some general comments on the game,
please.  
COACH JUDKINS: I got to give a lot of credit to New Mexico. They played a real
physical game tonight. They made the plays down the stretch when they had to.
I think Marsh hit some big baskets when they needed it. We had some
opportunities and just didn't quite seem to get it done.  
I'm really proud of my team. We've had a hard week, a week that has been
challenging. We got down early in this game and we fought back like I knew
this team would. We just couldn't make the plays that we had to make. Where we
have in the past, we just couldn't do it.  
But I'm really proud of them, the hard work they've gone through.  
You know, I told them in the locker room, I've been here I think four out of
the six years. I've won one and lost three, but maybe I'm getting experienced,
hopefully it will turn around.  
We're excited about the rest of the season and what we need to do. My job will
be to get these young ladies' heads up and realize they've had a great season,
a great conference. We're just building from our program. So I'm really happy
for them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the disappointment of this one? We saw some tears on
the bench. How are you going to turn that around into motivation going into
the NCAAs?  
MALLARY GILLESPIE: Turning that around, we didn't play the best game. We came
out in the first half really flat, started slow. We just didn't have the best
game. So if we can turn that into the NCAAs coming up next weekend, play
better, we'll go farther. Like we didn't play our best game, so next week
we're going to have to play better.  
You know, we can. We just started out flat, kind of shot ourselves in the
foot. But we got it in this next week.  
LAUREN RILEY: For me, I guess just any time you lose, it just gives you
motivation to get back going, get better, work harder and come back with a win
next time. That's our next goal.  
  
Q. Why did the tide turn so much when Dani fouled out?  
MALLARY GILLESPIE: Having your best player foul out gives the other team a lot
of momentum. That's basically what it did. It got her her fifth foul. Marsh
was going to the line, got the free-throws. We got a technical right there.
Gave them two more free-throws. Just a lot of things didn't go our way right
there, so they were able to build off that.  
LAUREN RILEY: She said it (smiling).  
  
Q. Can you talk about the first half shooting? Was that a case of nerves or
was it their defense?  
MALLARY GILLESPIE: Yeah, no, a little bit of both. Came out, you know -- I
don't know, I came out flat, I came out slow. It hurt the team. It hurt my
shooting, it hurt the team.  
I tried to pick it back up that second half and get 'em in there. I should
have been there first half doing that, so...  
  
Q. Lauren, it seemed like when Katie Montgomery was driving down low, seemed
like there was some sort of miscommunication when she was going to the hoop.
Talk about that.  
LAUREN RILEY: Yeah, that was probably all my fault. I mean, I should have -- I
should have stuck with it, but I guess from the previous two baskets with
Marsh, I was just thinking in my head, Stay on Marsh.  
That was one of those stupid mental mistakes during, you know, crunch time.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, you can go. Thank you.  
Questions for Coach Judkins.  
  
Q. You said it's been a tough week. How so?  
COACH JUDKINS: Well, you know, we had an emotional game right before the
tournament against Utah. We beat them. We go to TCU, travel. We'd been on the
road forever, then come back, then go back on the road. Kubik hurts her ankle.
I have another girl that hurts her ankle. I've got kids that are just mentally
tired right now.  
Tell you the truth, I am, too. It's been a long season. I've watched so much
game film in the last three days, I'm sick of watching film. I think that
happens to you at this time of the year. It just gets that way.  
You know, we just have to do a better job as a team because next year we're
going to be in this spot again hopefully, be able to learn from that.  
I had three seniors been through a lot with me. To see them leaving, this is
their last tournament, was hard. It's been one of those times. I don't know
what we can do better as a team when this situation happens. I know yesterday
I was the happiest man in the world sitting up here. Now I'm the saddest man.
That's what happens in sport. That's what makes it so challenging.  
  
Q. You know you're in the NCAA tournament, obviously. This game, this loss,
how important is it in terms of next week, getting a seed in the tournament?  
COACH JUDKINS: I don't think the players ever see that. I think the coaches
and the media and the administration see the seeding part. I think there's
three girls on my team that have been to the NCAA tournament, then the girls
of course last year.  
They haven't really been there enough to know the seeding, how important it is
to really go somewhere in the tournament.  
Hopefully some of these young kids will understand that and realize when you
get to this stage of the season, you've had a great season, just to move it up
a little more, just step up one more. Kind of like climbing a mountain: you're
almost to the top, you can get there, you can see the whole valley, or you can
just stay one more step. That's what I got to get my team to try to
understand.  
  
Q. Talk about the play of Shawnee Slade. I know earlier in the year you
wanted her to look for her shot. She had 16 points against New Mexico at New
Mexico. To come here and play like she did, talk about how impressed you were
with her play.  
COACH JUDKINS: I think the way you saw Shawnee tonight is the way I see her
every day in practice. Shawnee's biggest issue with her game right now is not
her athletic ability or being coached or working hard, it's the mental part of
the game. She has to mentally get in the game and do what she did tonight: be
aggressive offensively.  
I think she has flashes of it. You see it. For some reason against New Mexico,
I don't know if it's matchups, I don't know if it's because it's always a big
game and she enjoys that, she seems to just rise to the occasion.  
Hopefully next season she'll have games like this on a regular basis. I think
she can do that for our team. But she had a great game tonight. She started
off slow. I pulled her out and just went over to her and said, Shawnee, you
just got to relax. Go out there, let the game come. She came out in the second
half, I thought played really well for us.  
  
Q. On the technical foul, obviously you lose Dani, they get two free-throws.
Those were missed. What other impact do you feel that little swing had on the
game?  
COACH JUDKINS: First of all, that foul went on Kubik, that fouls her out, that
was Marsh fouling Kubik. She had four fouls also, might have been a different
situation. Referees said one of my players said something to the other
official.  
I told the ref, You don't know that girl like I know her. She wouldn't say
that. He said that she said something not in the best of language. Gave her a
technical. She missed both of them, so that happening didn't hurt us as bad. I
think losing Kubik hurt us more than the technical.  
Sometimes a technical can fire your team up. I kind of thought when that
happened maybe it would. But it kind of backfired a little bit.  
But you got to give them some credit. They ran their stuff. Marsh, she
finished. I hope someday in the women's game they'll get rid of flops, get rid
of that, because the NBA doesn't do that, the men don't do that. I'd like to
see our game be more like that. But they make great plays.  
Montgomery is a very smart player. She knows what she needs to do for the
team. The two-man game you were talking about earlier, we defended it pretty
well until right at the end. Then we just kind of slipped a little bit. That's
what you got to give them a lot of credit for that.  
  
Q. What do you think your seed will be next week?  
COACH JUDKINS: I hope not eighth and ninth. If that's the case, I'd like to be
11th. I think 11th is a great seed. We have a chance -- done well when they
have that number. Seems like when I look at the tournament, one Mountain West
team is always 11th. They probably have us slotted in there.  
Hopefully we'll be able to get that. I knew if we won today, we'd have a
pretty good opportunity of maybe getting a little higher seed in the
tournament.  
You got to play somebody. You got to go out and do it. Doesn't really make a
difference. We just got to go out and have a great week of practice, be ready
to go.  
  
Q. You talked about yesterday the team that executed best would win. Both
teams struggled out of the gate. Did they pick up their execution? Is that
what happened?  
COACH JUDKINS: I think the first half -- first five minutes, both teams
struggled. We just -- I don't know, seemed like we were just out in left field
the first 15 minutes of the game. We missed a lot of easy shots. We didn't
finish when we had it. They came in and Briody hit a couple of baskets, got
them going. Then, you know, we had spurts the first half.  
The second half I thought we played a lot better. Mallary looked for her shot
better. She let it come more. But for some reason Kubik just didn't get the
ball where she normally gets it. You got to give New Mexico credit for that.
Their post defense was a lot better.  
I don't know if we get it into her like we should have early in the game.
Kubik for some reason has a better second half than first half. Try to tell
her she needs to be aggressive the first half, but she worries about fouls. We
shot 20% in the first half, which we usually don't. We're a better shooting
team than that.  
  
Q. What was it when Kubik fouled out, did the teammates miss her leadership?
Were they rattled by her departure?  
COACH JUDKINS: I don't know if they were rattled because Kubik's fouled out of
a lot of games this year. I think the way she fouled out, the way the ref
called it, the crucial part of the game, just maybe that was upsetting to
them.  
I don't know. I think it was a lot of combinations of things. Usually this
team, when somebody fouls out, your best player, sometimes -- this team the
whole season kind of got closer together and just kind of buckled it up. I
thought we'd be fine. Riley was playing well today.  
I thought, you know, we're all right. I had Riley rested. We came down and
just didn't execute, turned it over a couple times when we shouldn't have.
Just can't do that against a good team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks very much, coach. Good luck next week.  
COACH JUDKINS: Thank you very much.

### [Katie Montgomery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16961)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Mountain West Conference champion
University of New Mexico, head coach Don Flanagan, student-athletes Dionne
Marsh, Katie Montgomery and Julie Briody.  
Coach, if you want to start with some opening remarks on the game.  
COACH FLANAGAN: First of all, congratulations to BYU. Terrific team. Played an
outstanding game. They have an excellent coaching staff and an excellent group
of young athletes, so congratulations to them.  
It was such an evenly-matched game that I wasn't sure who was going to win
about four minutes left to go, and then all of a sudden we separated in a
hurry. But I thought it was a great game to watch. I'm sure our athletes will
tell you it was a great game to be involved in.  
I don't know what determined the outcome. I think it was maybe both teams were
tired. It's a tough grind to play three games in four days. Every team that we
played was a physical team. We got pressed in the first game. We ran over at
least 500 screens against Wyoming, then play a team like BYU that's another
screening team, it's very, very difficult, these players.  
Somehow about four minutes left to go they found a way to win this game. So
I'm very proud of their effort. I'm very proud of the game that they played
today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions now directed to the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Dionne, can you talk about how important it was when Kubik fouled out
there with five minutes to go? Did you expect the tide to turn that much as it
did in the final five minutes?  
DIONNE MARSH: Not necessarily. I mean, they have good post players. They're
very strong. They kind of outsize us. That was one of the difficult things.  
Coach had been saying the whole game, Drive to the basket, get them to foul
you. I just tried to do that a little bit more, be more conscious of it in the
last few minutes.  
  
Q. Dionne, can you say what came out of you when you drew your fourth foul?
You looked frustrated. After that you scored 13 of or 20 points.  
DIONNE MARSH: Yeah, I guess I was just a little frustrated. I'm undersized. I
just thought I was just trying to work hard basically on defense. I mean, just
working hard. The refs just called it the way they did. You just have to play
the game how they're calling it.  
  
Q. You came out kind of slow, not really into the flow early. Was that just
the result of having played three games in four days, fatigue setting in?  
KATIE MONTGOMERY: I think so. I mean, like coach said, it's kind of tough,
difficult to play three games in four days just physically, especially against
the teams we played against. They're real physical teams. A lot of our girls
are playing major minutes.  
But, I mean, you have so much adrenaline going on out there and stuff that you
just kind of got to fight through it. I thought we did a particularly good job
the last five minutes of coming together and playing hard. They were tired,
too. We just took it at 'em.  
  
Q. The first half you struggled from the outside but kept on shooting. Do
you feel like if you keep on shooting you'll work through the slumps, shots
will fall?  
KATIE MONTGOMERY: Oh, yeah. I mean, I just got to keep shooting. That's what
everybody was telling me. My teammates were hitting shots. I didn't
particularly need to hit those shots. Julie, Brandi, Dionne, people were
hitting shots in the first half. That's when you got to try to get them the
ball.  
I mean, I just thought we had a great team effort the whole game. I took the
shots when I was open. Luckily some of them fell in the second half.  
  
Q. You've been saying for a while now that you didn't want to be the senior
class that didn't get to the NCAA tournament. Now that you've gotten there,
how does it feel?  
JULIE BRIODY: I mean, that was our whole goal coming into the tournament, was
that, you know, we weren't just happy to be here, we wanted to make sure we
won the tournament. So there was no doubt whether we were going to be in the
NCAA tournament.  
I think just by the way that we played in the first two games, people saw that
we were for real, we were determined, we wanted to win this game. Like they
were saying, everybody was tired during this game, but we gave it all we had
because we knew that if we won, we were going to get an automatic bid to the
tournament.  
KATIE MONTGOMERY: Just kind of what Julie said. I think we came down here on
our first game Wednesday and I think we kind of wanted to prove something. We
got out the first round last year. That kind of left a bad taste in our mouth.  
We wanted to come out, we were real motivated, real determined. We knew if we
played hard, we played together, we'd be able to win this tournament. That's
what we did.  
I mean, obviously we want to go to the NCAA tournament. That's our goal. But I
think winning the conference championship, you know, is just as big a goal.
You know, that's what you want to do from the very beginning of the season.  
We've been able to do that the three out of the four years we've been here.
It's a good feeling. It's good that the younger kids got to experience that
young so hopefully they'll keep that tradition going.  
  
Q. After BYU went on that run and took the lead in the second half, how much
of the fact that that happened to you in the Wyoming game, do you think that
helped?  
JULIE BRIODY: I mean, we just knew we just needed to calm down, bring back our
focus that we had before. I thought that's what we did. During the timeouts we
were just talking about making sure we stayed together. BYU's a great team. We
knew they were going to go on their runs.  
I thought we did a great job of withstanding those runs and was able to pull
out in the end.  
  
Q. Having won so many games now, 12 of 13, how much confidence does that
give you going into the NCAA tournament?  
KATIE MONTGOMERY: I think that gives us a lot of confidence. I think we're
playing real well right now. We're playing the best we have all season. I
think just the last three games -- obviously the last 13, however many games
we've won in a row, we turned it around.  
We didn't start the conference season off the way we wanted to. I think we've
been determined since that point. I think it just gives us a lot of
confidence. People have been playing well. Brandi had a great tournament. Timi
has been playing great defense. We got some younger kids in there in the first
few games. I think everybody's, you know, real determined and we're playing
well together and real excited.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, ladies. You three can go. Congratulations.  
Questions now for Coach Flanagan.  
  
Q. After the Wyoming game you talked about how maybe this wasn't your most
gifted physical team, but you said the effort was there. Does that make this
conference tournament championship more special maybe?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Well, they're all pretty special, to tell you the truth. No,
not really. What I really admired about this group of players was even when we
had -- early on in the conference we had some problems, and we overcame those.
They always worked hard.  
I mean, we had games where it was very disappointing. We lost a one-point game
to Utah at home. It was a very disappointing game. The next day our players
came to practice, worked hard.  
They remind me of just a blue-collar team. It didn't matter what had happened
the day prior, they were going to come to work, work hard, try to improve, and
it paid off. It paid off at the end of the year right now in the conference
championship.  
I'm really proud of what they did and how they approached improving.  
  
Q. You held Dani Wright to five points, six boards. Was that in your game
plan originally? In your view, what did you do to limit her?  
COACH FLANAGAN: She missed a few easy shots, which is unlike her. She normally
hits those shots. They're very focused on getting the ball inside. I used
several different players, but I never thought anybody was really stopping her
because she got a lot of offensive rebounds. I'm not sure, some them might
have been missed shots of her own.  
I don't know how. I mean, it was just a team effort. We rotated people on her.
Tried not to give her a deep hand. By "deep hand" I mean catch the ball over
her shoulder, catch it towards the basket. She's very good at that. If you let
her catch it in front of you, she's not quite as good.  
If you can move her off the block just a little bit she's not quite as
effective, but she's very difficult to move off the block.  
We just used a lot of players and tried our hardest to stop the pass from
getting inside. You saw late in the game Dionne did a great job with Riley,
because Riley also is another player that's big like that and can get the ball
inside and be effective. Dionne was denying that pass inside pretty
effectively.  
  
Q. Did you think Dionne became more aggressive after her fourth foul?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Yeah. You know, I hate to do this, but Dionne plays better
when she's mad. She got mad at her fourth foul. I don't think she thought that
she got fouled. As soon as she got mad, she got motivated.  
When they made their run, we talked that we weren't being aggressive enough
offensively. A lot of times what you can do is one team gets the momentum and
they get very, very aggressive, and they keep -- with their confidence,
they're attacking you, and pretty soon you're not attacking anybody. So we
turned that around with some talk about attacking back at them.  
When Dionne started to do that, she got people in foul trouble. Then she hit
her free-throws, which sometimes she doesn't do, but she did it this time.  
  
Q. Coach --  
COACH FLANAGAN: Yes, we are going to the NCAA tournament (smiling).  
  
Q. At what point in the season did you feel the team had this kind of
toughness and ability to turn things around?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Yesterday. Honestly, you know, I mean, there was a period of
time when I wasn't really sure. I wasn't sure we were going to the NIT, never
mind the NCAA tournament. We struggled a little bit with this team.  
As I said before, we have a different kind of personnel. We don't have the
normal personnel that I've had in the past. So we had some uniqueness about
this team. That uniqueness learned to play well together. I think that's what
created the team that you saw today.  
  
Q. I voted for Brandi for MVP. She didn't even make the all-tournament team.
Katie, too. Is that kind of the definition of this team, the way they pulled
together?  
COACH FLANAGAN: I said to Brandi afterwards, we talked in the locker room, I
said, If there was a defensive MVP, you were it. She did a terrific job. She
defended the toughest player on every team. She did a great job. None of those
kids she guarded were easy guards. She did a great job. She got beat up a
little bit and bounced right back and came back in and played good defense
again.  
I thought Katie's play and poise right down the stretch late, we tried to get
a little ball screen with Dionne and Katie because I felt those two were the
keys for us to score, clear the other side, then Katie drove a couple times,
got layups, then Dionne got the ball inside on a roll a couple times and
scored or got fouled. Those two players played particularly well.  
I thought Julie Briody played well. But, you're right, we kind of shared the
limelight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Congratulations.  
COACH FLANAGAN: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2007

  

### [Joe Legerski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13841)

### [Megan McGuffey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17036)

### [Hanna Zavecz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16287)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined now by University of Wyoming head coach Joe Legerski,
student-athletes Megan McGuffey and Hanna Zavecz. Coach, if you just want to
begin with some comments on the game, please.  
COACH LEGERSKI: I was really proud of the way we came back and took the
initial first 10 minutes. I know on Wednesday New Mexico jumped out to a big
lead and then just kind of managed the game. I was really proud of the way we
responded and got back into the game by halftime.  
But I thought we were overwhelmed on the offensive glass in the second half.
That was a big part of giving them more opportunities than we had from the
field.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Hanna, can you talk about how difficult it was playing most of the second
half with four fouls? Did it affect you on one end of the floor more than the
other?  
HANNA ZAVECZ: Yeah, it was definitely difficult. I had to back off a bit on
the offensive end and defensive end. I mean, I wasn't being as aggressive
towards the basket.  
Defensively, I was -- you know, I couldn't do much. I just stood there with my
hands up and did what I could. Yeah, it really limited me in my game.  
  
Q. Either player, you had two big games scoring-wise. What were they doing
defensively on everyone else to frustrate you guys?  
COACH LEGERSKI: Do you want me to answer that (laughter)?  
MEGAN McGUFFEY: Well, we've always had, you know, our three main scorers in
Jodi, Hanna and Czarna. They'll pretty much get double-teamed all night. I
mean, Hanna is so athletic, she's great to the basket, has a great outside
shot.  
I think they were just really doubling down, making it tough for Jodi and
Czarna out there, kind of getting them out of their games.  
HANNA ZAVECZ: You know, Megan is right, they were really pressuring the ball.
You know, they were really aggressive. They tried to get us out of our offense
and it worked at times.  
They took away our strengths in some places. They took away, you know, we like
to shoot more three-pointers, especially Jodi and Czarna, and they didn't give
us what we usually get.  
So they did a good job of getting us out of what we're used to.  
  
Q. Hanna, New Mexico has some great tournament experience. You're still
getting there. Do you think that made a difference in that second run, second
half?  
HANNA ZAVECZ: Yeah, definitely. I mean, experience is a big part of this
tournament because it can go either way. Really, the experienced teams are the
ones who usually pull it off. So, yeah, it played a part.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll let you two go. Thank you.  
Questions for Coach Legerski.  
  
Q. Defensively for New Mexico, Megan and Hanna had big games, but no one
else could really get going. Were they doing anything else to try to take the
other players out? What did you see out there?  
COACH LEGERSKI: Defensively they were switching our motion offense. We have
faced teams that way before. You know, New Mexico's very talented. They're
long, aggressive, and they make things difficult.  
You know, we cannot survive having three starters go 3 for 18. It's very
difficult. When I take a look at the box score I think one of the big lifts
that New Mexico had was they ended up having five other players score four
points, and that's 20 points off your bench from that scenario.  
That is a huge lift for any team. We just have to be able to find more points
from a number of players. When we're able to do that, we usually come out on
the top end.  
Tonight, New Mexico was able to make it difficult for those three to be able
to score.  
  
Q. You talked about their offensive boards. Julie Briody was a big part of
that. Having coached against her her whole career, what changes or
improvements have you seen in her over the four years?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I'll tell you what, she's very talented, first of all. She has
a great desire to win. I think that's something that you can see out on the
floor. Julie gets after you both offensively, defensively. She's a threat from
three-point range. She can shoot off the dribble. She can really take a
smaller guard down inside and post up.  
But I probably, you know, taking a look at competing against her, her desire
to win is very evident.  
  
Q. Your team was able to pull within six a couple times late in the game. It
seemed like New Mexico would come back and hit a big shot. Did you feel like
you were one stop or one big shot of your own away from getting the
momentum?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I tell you what, I thought we were 1-3 from Justyna from
swinging a little momentum. She went 0 for five today from three. I thought
she had three really good looks at the basket. I think that's what's
difficult, is that when you're trying to build a program you're trying to
scrap and find a way to be able to get one.  
New Mexico answered every time. They came down and made big shot after big
shot. All of a sudden you're playing well, but you're not closing the gap. I
just thought that that's what ended up happening today.  
  
Q. You don't have any control, but post-season hopefully in front of this
team, what are your thoughts? You're going to be playing in the post-season in
some tournament? What do you think your NCAA chances might be?  
COACH LEGERSKI: You know, first of all, you're right, I don't have any
control. I wish I had some. I think the Mountain West Conference plays at a
very high level.  
Hopefully there's a place somewhere for a team that wins 21 games, ends up
getting a No. 2 seed in this tournament. It was a long two months in the
Mountain West Conference. This team responded for those two months. Very proud
of this group.  
Hopefully there's a place in post-season for Wyoming.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Thank you, everybody.

## March 9, 2007

  

### [Mallary Gillespie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16396)

### [Jeff Judkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13839)

### [Dani Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17038)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Brigham Young University head coach Jeff
Judkins and student-athletes Dani Wright and Mallary Gillespie.  
Coach, general comments on the game.  
COACH JUDKINS: Well, it was a great game. Utah is a really good team. They
play great team defense. They execute offensively very well.  
I knew it would be kind of a game like this. They call it an ugly game
sometimes where both teams know each other so well. But, I mean, to come out
the second half, we had a good lead, come out the second half, we just
couldn't buy a basket.  
Then Dani gets her fourth foul. Had to make a tough decision. I've done this a
lot in my career as a coach. I've always believed to play your player and take
the chance. Sometimes it wins, sometimes you lose.  
But Dani has been used to that. She's been used to coming in with four fouls.
I thought she did a great job of coming in and getting some key baskets down
the stretch.  
I'm real happy for Melinda and Jennie Keele. They've been open the whole
night, couldn't hit a basket the first half. Both of them made some big shots
down the stretch. I think that just shows that their teammates have a lot of
confidence in them.  
Of course, their coaching staff does, too. I'm real happy with these guys
because, you know, being down like that and bouncing back is not real easy. I
think they showed the character of this team and why we've been successful
this year.  
THE MODERATOR TAKER: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your ankle, how that felt? Also what happened there
with your chin?  
DANI WRIGHT: The ankle, just got a little twisted in Air Force. Carolyn helped
me out, the trainer and the doc really just rehabbed me and tried to get it
going better. You know, say a little prayer and go on it.  
It helped. Today just got a little knocked up on the chin, but nothing big.
Came out with a win, so I'm happy. Doesn't bother me at all (smiling).  
  
Q. Talk about how it is as a senior coming in, last year you guys lost to
Utah. How does it feel to get revenge?  
DANI WRIGHT: Oh, it's great. You know, it's your rival school. You want to
come out, you want to play hard. You know, got a little nervous in the second
half. Me and Mal were talking here. We all stepped out, played our game. It's
a great feeling. We owed them from last year because they beat us by 30. It
felt good. It felt really good to beat 'em today.  
  
Q. Mallary, when you were in that rough stretch in the second half, did you
talk about what you needed to do? How much do you think experience played in
getting through that stuff?  
MALLARY GILLESPIE: Yeah, we all got together and basically said, you know, We
got to D up. We hadn't really -- they got some quick baskets on us. They were
starting to come back. Got ahead.  
You know what, we got to shut them down again. First thing first was D up.
Next thing was we got to slow down on offense, take care of the ball, go back
to fundamentals. Wait for screens, get people open.  
We've been in tough situations this year a lot. So that plays a role in it,
so...  
  
Q. Dani, the second half you guys early on found yourselves in a hole, then
all of a sudden you took over for a small stretch to take the lead back. What
happened in that key stretch that you kind of took over?  
DANI WRIGHT: Well, you know, you just kind of tell yourself, you know, you're
the best post player in there. You need to get it in there, do what you do
best, put it in the hoop, help your team out. I just came out with that fire
and intensity. I just wanted to help my team.  
  
Q. Talk about what was going on the first part of the second half, what took
you so long to get it going offensively?  
DANI WRIGHT: We just wanted to give everyone a good game to watch, so...  
No, I don't know. We just went in a little funk. We got ourselves out of it,
though.  
MALLARY GILLESPIE: We got a little complacent. Just relaxed a little bit,
whereas we needed to stay up, stay aggressive. We pulled it back out, you
know. We got on each other, said, The time is now. We got to get out there. We
got to do it now. We can't wait.  
That's when Kubik stepped it up, coach drew up some good plays, got her open.
We did it.  
THE MODERATOR TAKER: Ladies, thank you.  
COACH JUDKINS: Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR TAKER: Questions for Coach Judkins.  
  
Q. You have a 7-12 record against Utah. Is that something you focus on
personally before a game saying, I really need to improve this record? Does
your team know that? Do they really try to win this for you?  
COACH JUDKINS: I think my team, a lot of them have been with me for four
years, so that 7-12 record comes on them a little bit, too.  
But, yeah, it's hard. When Elaine has done a great job of dominating this
league and she's had excellent teams. She's a great coach. You don't win 500
games because you can't coach.  
They've beat us when it come down to the end, like tonight, they executed a
little bit better or whatever. Tonight, the ball just bounced our way. We had
some shots that went in that normally in that 7-12, you know, came off the
rim.  
I'm just proud of these guys. It's been an up-and-down season. It's been hard.
This is a hard game to play because we know each other so well. We know the
tendencies of both coaches. It just becomes a dogfight out there.  
I think they struggled a little bit offensively. We struggled offensively.
But, you know, it's tough. I mean, my team, when we scored four opinions in 10
minutes, it was hard. Kubik was the big key. That's why I put her in the game.
I drew up a little play that we have not run the whole year, 'cause I knew
Elaine is so prepared if I just ran a play to get her she'd know it.  
I've been very fortunate as a coach to have a quick mind to be able to think
of that sometimes. I drew up a little play to get her the ball inside. She
made me look smart as a coach because she scored it.  
You know, it's tough out there (smiling).  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit more about that cold streak. You were 2 for 15
coming out of the locker room at halftime. What specifically did you do to get
Dani the ball down low?  
COACH JUDKINS: I think what happened the second half is we came out and we
started standing around. We didn't move in screen and get in the flow. You
know, a lot of teams have that tendency for some reason.  
You sit out at halftime for a period of time, you just don't get going.
Usually they kind of count on me to draw up a play and get a basket early, and
I did. Riley missed the layup. I think that kind of maybe set the tone. Then
we just stopped really attacking the basket. We started wanting somebody else
to do it, somebody else to do it.  
Then, of course, Kubik gets her third and her fourth foul pretty quick and I
have to sit her there for a while. Usually she's the one that comes in and
makes a big play for us. I just had to take the chance.  
I thought the game was right there. Luckily she didn't foul out. But, you
know, it's hard. I told my team, We all go in streaks. The key is when you're
in a good streak, go a long time, when you're not playing very well, try to
make it short.  
But Utah caused a lot of it. They really stepped up defensively. They didn't
give us any easy baskets like they did early in the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about New Mexico and your thoughts on playing them tomorrow
in the championship?  
COACH JUDKINS: New Mexico is a great team. They probably have as good inside
out as anybody in the league - probably the two of us are the best with an
inside presence and outside. We split with them. We beat them in the Pit, then
lose at home. They had a very hard-fought game tonight, too.  
It will be interesting to see what happens. I know in Provo we fowled them too
much. We put them at the foul line 42 times. We cannot do that. We have to
limit them at the foul line. They're an excellent foul shooting team, like
Utah. They go 13-13. It's like automatic when they get fouled.  
We're going to have to come out and be able to not let Marsh have 22 foul
pitches. We got to make sure she's (indiscernible) over us. Should be a great
game.  
Both teams will play good defense. It will be a physical game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the fact that you shut Warburton down, what the key to
that was tonight.  
COACH JUDKINS: There's a kid named Shawnee Slade. People don't realize what
kind of player that kid is. As a coach, you love her. As an opposing coach,
you hate her.  
I thought she did a real good job. Warburton is a real good player. Shawnee
did a good job at making her earn anything. I'm very fortunate. I switched a
lot. I switched Johnson, Slade and Keele. They had to kind of guard her.  
I thought Shawnee did a good job without letting her get penetration, not
getting a lot of easy looks.  
I mean, she didn't shoot a lot of shots tonight. Part of it, I don't think she
had a lot of good looks. You got to give Shawnee a lot of credit for that.  
THE MODERATOR TAKER: Thanks, coach. Good luck tomorrow.  
COACH JUDKINS: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2007

  

### [Elaine Elliott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15524)

### [Morgan Warburton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16975)

### [Kalee Whipple](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16974)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: University of Utah head coach Elaine Elliott, student-athletes
Kalee Whipple, and Morgan Warburton.  
Coach Elliott, if you want to just provide some opening comments on the game.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, I was really proud of our team. You know, we just don't
ever want to be associated with an effort that would include quitting or
somehow, you know, not giving your best shot. I am really proud to say I don't
have to worry about that.  
They come back strong. They listen. They try. They really have improved and
have a long bright futures, I think, as well. Just real proud of the season.
Real proud of the effort.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Morgan, you played behind Shauna and Kim Smith last year. At what point
this year did you realize this was your team and you would have to shoulder
the burden of scoring?  
MORGAN WARBURTON: It was actually after our last game with Maryland. I was
thinking about that year, but I was also thinking about what I needed to do
for my career as well. I knew I was going to step into that position. So far I
think I've done a pretty good job. I've got two more years to prove myself.  
  
Q. You sort of have had a pattern this year of falling behind early. Why do
you think that happened again today? Is it just bad shooting?  
MORGAN WARBURTON: I think it's just, you know, we're young. Things happen that
way. We've got a lot of growth.  
At the same time this last part of our season, we've learned a lot about
ourselves. We're still looking forward to hopefully playing a few more games
this season.  
It just comes with the youth of our team, including myself. We have things to
work on.  
KALEE WHIPPLE: Yeah, I think Morgan talked a lot about it, it's kind of mental
for us just coming out. We're getting better at it. As she said, we're just a
young team. We're trying to learn things each game, trying to learn new
things.  
  
Q. Morgan, can you talk about their defense. Seemed like they shut you down
and kept you from getting the ball, getting some looks out there tonight.  
MORGAN WARBURTON: Yeah, I mean, it's frustrating at times. At the same time I
knew it was going to happen. I just tried my best to get my other teammates
open. I knew they were going to probably double-team sometimes.  
I had to work the ball around. I don't mind doing that either because I have
confidence in my team.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, you can take off.  
Questions for Coach Elliott.  
  
Q. Seemed like a game where there was a lot of ebb and flow. What did you
tell your team to try to help maintain the effort, especially in the second
half when you caught up?  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, we talked about that that would be the reality of the
game before the game started. The biggest key would be whether or not we
handled that properly, both ways. When you're getting up, things are going,
you don't think that it's done.  
And when things are a struggle for you, you find yourself in that situation,
you don't succumb to that mentally or emotionally.  
We try to prepare them for the fact we believed the game would be that way
because most competitions are that way, and it's your response to those
situations that are key.  
  
Q. You talked about Kalee Whipple at the beginning of the year, thought she
would be able to contribute as a freshman. How impressed were you with how she
played this season, leading the league in scoring and rebounding for a
freshman?  
COACH ELLIOTT: Yeah, she was no surprise to us. I think she's proven herself.
I think she's made a name for herself. This league knows that, you know, she's
a rising star. She's a fine, fine player. Got a lot of good experience this
year. I think that will help.  
We'll try to do the best we can to bring her along as coaches, be sure we're
coaching her well and properly. She's a great one to have.  
  
Q. You took that five-point lead and then went eight possessions without
scoring. What happened during that stretch, from your standpoint?  
COACH ELLIOTT: We didn't score.  
  
Q. In the past you've turned down WNIT bids. Would that be the case if you
get one this year?  
COACH ELLIOTT: No, this is a good team; this is a good match. My decisions on
those have always been unique to what I think a team, you know, where they are
emotionally. Our decisions in the past have been they weren't a good match for
where we were, the expectations that we have.  
This year it's a great match. We simply are extremely young. It would be the
next step for this team. There's no disappointment as far as somehow not
reaching our goals, we're not reaching our expectations not to be in the NCAA
tournament. It's a great match for this team, the youth of this team. We would
love to have that opportunity.  
  
Q. You talked about this season as being a learning process, almost sort of
like a class. As far as progress, what grade would you give your team for this
season?  
COACH ELLIOTT: They won 18 games. In the semifinals of the championships,
we're playing for a conference championship the last week of the season. You
know, I give these kids an A.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Thank you.

### [Julie Briody](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17034)

### [Don Flanagan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13837)

### [Brandi Kimble](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17035)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by University of New Mexico head coach Don
Flanagan and student-athletes Julie Briody and Brandi Kimble.  
Coach Flanagan, if you want to just give some general comments on the game,
please.  
COACH FLANAGAN: First of all, I want to congratulate Wyoming. They're a class
program. Joe Legerski and his coaching staff are great to work against, to
compete against. Their kids play very, very hard. Well, well coached. Very
difficult to defend.  
We had a little bit of concerns because their post players are really
interchangeable. They play just as well outside as they do inside. Very
difficult to guard. They probably run as complex or execute an offense as well
as any team we've played this year.  
So congratulations to them.  
Then for our players, I was really proud of the comeback. First half we got
out to a good start, then they made a nice comeback, got back within the game.
The momentum had shifted. Second half we had to grab that momentum back. I
thought our defense was quite good in the second half.  
Then as we started to get some movement and get the ball inside, create some
opportunities for our inside players, I thought that helped. Then late in the
game, our activity on offense bothered them a little bit.  
But overall I thought it was a great defensive game for us. We shot 50% the
second half. When we shoot 50%, we usually are pretty successful.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Julie, you were up 21-9. Looked like maybe you were going to run away
with this one like you did Wednesday. When that didn't happen, what went
through your mind? How did you regroup?  
JULIE BRIODY: I mean, we knew Wyoming's a great team. We knew that they were
going to make their runs. We had to make sure that we stayed focused. I
thought we did a nice job going into the half. They made a little bit of a
run, but we didn't let it bother us. We came out the first four minutes of the
second half and just kept taking it at them. That's why we were successful.  
  
Q. For either player, Zavecz had a big game, McGuffey had a big game, but no
one else really did. What did you do defensively to frustrate everyone else?  
BRANDI KIMBLE: I think our help defense was really good. We knew Hanna was
still going to get her points and everything. But just to play her a hard,
physical game, and that's what we did.  
  
Q. Julie, with so many of your post players in foul trouble, did you feel
like it was on you to kind of take over?  
JULIE BRIODY: I mean, I don't know. I mean, I thought we didn't stray from our
game plan. But, you know, I just got a lot of good screens from my teammates
and was able to get, you know, some decent open looks, was able to knock 'em
down, as well as Brandi was and Katie.  
I thought everybody, it was just a team effort and everybody did really well
to do their part to make sure that we won.  
  
Q. Brandi, what is it about this team this time of the year? It looked like
early on when teams would put some pressure you would not regroup, but now
lately you've been playing where if teams make runs you're able to withstand
those, come out on top. What's the difference between now and earlier in the
year?  
BRANDI KIMBLE: I think we're playing both halves. We're playing really hard
team ball. We're improving. Every game we're improving all aspects of the
game.  
  
Q. Either player, do you think your team's greater tournament experience
relative to Wyoming played a factor at all in the second half?  
JULIE BRIODY: I don't know if that's necessarily true. I just thought that
both teams were just going at each other really hard. I just thought that we
played with tremendous effort and intensity throughout the game, and that
enabled us to keep the lead, you know, and in turn win the game.  
  
Q. Julie, after they went ahead early in the second half, you scored off
offensive rebounds. Once you got fouled, you hit both free-throws and then
scored off a put-back. Is that something you take pride in?  
JULIE BRIODY: Most definitely. Rebounds are going to win us games. I know they
were going to need me to do a little bit more than just score. So I was
getting in pretty good position on the offensive side of the ball to get
rebounds and was able to, you know, get it, you know, score or, you know, get
fouled, like you said.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, ladies. We'll let you two go.  
Questions for Coach Flanagan.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the game that Julie had, especially in the second
half.  
COACH FLANAGAN: Well, you know, Julie's -- this has been an outstanding year
for her. By far her best year. She's reached her potential I think as a player
this year. She's improved in almost every aspect of the game. She defends
well. She's a long player, not really a strong player, but she's strong enough
to compete against bigger players.  
She's got a terrific repertoire of moves. She can shoot the three, she can
shoot the pull-up, and she's got a soft touch. You don't want to foul her
because she's one of the top free-throw shooters in the nation. She can drive.
Now she's starting to rebound. That really completes her game.  
I'm amazed how much she's improved just this year. Usually when they're
seniors, you don't see that much improvement over a one-year period of time.
She's just been terrific in progressing. She loves the game of basketball. Now
she's playing the way she always wanted to play.  
  
Q. Do you think the past 11 games, you talked about confidence, that helped
them withstand the Wyoming run, especially in the first half? Do you think
this solidified a tournament bid?  
COACH FLANAGAN: I think confidence and energy are extremely important in games
like this. We want our kids to be confident. I want them to go in the game and
believe in themselves, each individual.  
Everybody on our team can add to the confidence by believing in themselves -
not just the players that are playing but the kids on the bench that are
involved in the game, the coaching staff that's involved in the game. I want
all of our players to believe that we're going to be successful.  
At halftime we're just talking about what we're going to do the second half to
play better and play with more confidence, more energy, where we can be
effective. I think that's probably the best way to approach a game.  
I think as soon as you lose a little confidence you lose that energy, and then
pretty soon you're playing, worried about losing. You have a fear of failure.
I think this group has overcome that fear of failure.  
At some point in the season when we were losing a few games, I think we were a
little bit afraid to fail. Now I think we've overcome that and we're playing
with much more confidence.  
  
Q. How does this year's team compare to the ones that won three straight
Mountain West titles?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Well, you know, this team's really a lot different than those
teams. This year we didn't have -- I normally have a three player that's a
physical player. I don't this year. I normally have a four player that shoots
the three, and I don't this year. For about 10 years we had those kinds of
players.  
Now we're a completely different kind of team. I mean, Timi is not a scorer at
all, our four player. She brings a great deal of energy. We found a way for
Timi to be effective and help this team be effective.  
Brandi is not a big strong three, but her quickness and her aggressiveness
have helped put more pressure on the ball than my normal three does.  
So we found a way for this team to be more effective. It doesn't compare with
the other teams physically, but it does in effort, it does in a belief in
themselves, a belief that they're going to be successful.  
  
Q. Could you talk specifically about how tough Julie is, how tough she's
gotten over the course of her career? She hits the floor and keeps getting
up.  
COACH FLANAGAN: It's kind of like a skeleton hitting the floor when she hits
the floor. You can hear every bone (smiling). That's why she wears knee pads.
In fact, I make her wear knee pads in practice, too, because I know eventually
she's going to hit the floor.  
She's not afraid of the contact. In fact, she kind of likes to jump in the air
through people, shoot the shot, and create the contact type of situation.
She's active with her feet. She actually -- I mean, she has an injury that's
pretty substantial. We can't talk about injuries.  
I mean, if you had this pain you wouldn't be playing the way she plays. So she
plays with so much effort. She loves the game so much. She can't play any
other way. Consequently, that's the way you see her play.  
I mean, she spent three years where she wasn't a great player for us. This
year's been so terrific. I mean, I just wish we'd started a little bit earlier
getting her potential. But she grew into her potential.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Good luck tomorrow.  
COACH FLANAGAN: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UNLV head coach Regina Miller, student-athletes
Kameca Simmons and Sequoia Holmes.  
Coach, if you want to begin with some opening remarks on the game.  
COACH MILLER: Well, New Mexico, I thought, came out firing on all cylinders.
They jumped on us right away from the beginning of the game, hit a lot of
shots out the gate. We were not able to finish some plays offensively. Got
down early.  
But I thought we were okay at that point. You know, like I say, I think they
hit their first five out of six shots. All we needed to do was turn up our
defense and try to make some plays offensively. But they continued to do that
for 40 minutes.  
It was difficult because I felt like we never really got in the fight today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sequoia, what do you think was the big difference in today's game as
opposed to when you beat them last week?  
SEQUOIA HOLMES: I think our defensive intensity wasn't as good as it was the
day we played them here at home in the Cox. I also didn't think we made plays
well offensively.  
  
Q. It seems like you girls couldn't get into any offensive rhythm today.
Could you talk about that? What was the biggest issue today?  
KAMECA SIMMONS: Seems like we couldn't really get into a rhythm with our
offense. We kind of really didn't set and use our screens to get each other
open and to get shots, to get easy shots. So that kind of had a lot to do with
our offense not going well.  
We didn't get the shots that we needed. We didn't finish baskets. We didn't
get and use -- set new screens. That's a big part of our offense. That's how
we get most of our shots out of our main offense, so we didn't execute that
well.  
  
Q. Kameca, probably not the game you wanted to finish your career on. Could
you reflect on your feelings about your career coming to an end today with
this game.  
KAMECA SIMMONS: Well, I never looked at it coming to an end from this game
here. I don't know, I just wish that -- if I could change and turn back the
hands of time that, you know, I could have been healthy enough to be here for
my team when they needed me most in the beginning of the season so it could
have just carried over right now.  
I'm just, you know, overall I wish I could have been here for my team.
Injuries limited me. And tonight it was just an overall -- I felt like I
tried, but I didn't give enough effort.  
  
Q. Sequoia, No. 41 was face guarding you. Did that kind of make it hard for
you to get into any kind of rhythm offensively?  
SEQUOIA HOLMES: Well, Brandi Kimble is a good defender. She's about my same
height. She's long. It's hard to get open when you got somebody face guarding
you. Like Kameca said, we needed to set new screens. I felt like it would have
been easier for me to get open had we done that better.  
But I feel like if you got somebody at that athleticism, it's going to bother
you somewhat. So, I mean, she did a good job.  
  
Q. Were you bothered at all or did it surprise you at all that it was kind
of as if new Mexico had the home court advantage with all their fans here?
Almost like an away game?  
KAMECA SIMMONS: The way I looked at it, all I saw was red in the stands, so it
kind of took effect that that could have been our fans. So it kind of really
didn't bother us. Personally for me it didn't bother me. Kind of just looked
at it like they were our fans.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach Miller.  
  
Q. Could you sum up the season now that it's over, how it went for you, the
season as a whole.  
COACH MILLER: Did you say evaluate the season?  
  
Q. Sum it up, how it went for you.  
COACH MILLER: About five games ago we kind of had a little mini season. Our
goal was to have seven games. We were going to take one at a time. I thought
we were well on our way to reaching our goal when we pulled off four wins in a
row.  
This was the fifth game. If we could have gotten two more it would have been a
great season, considering that we've dealt with quite a bit of adversity this
season. Physically, as Kameca alluded to earlier, with some of the injuries
earlier. A lot of the returning players that we expected to be contributors
really didn't start out with this team.  
The positive for us is, if you noticed tonight on the court, at the end of the
game I had all freshmen, sophomores and Sequoia Holmes. Basically that's what
we played the majority of this season with.  
Overall I guess I'm really proud of this team from the standpoint of being a
young team, the leadership, basically has been in our freshman/sophomore
class, our junior class some with Sequoia Holmes. We were at a point where we
could have gave in when we lost four games in a row during the middle of
conference play.  
We dug our heels in the dirt and we won four games. So that showed me that
this team is well on our way to developing into becoming a very competitive
team with any of our teams in the league, with the returning players we have.  
You know, I look at it, no one likes to lose. You learn a lot from losing.
This is the most we've lost since I've been here. Sometimes you have to
sacrifice to get to where you want to be. For us this season obviously has
been in the win/loss record. I think that certainly can turn around in a year.  
It's kind of interesting. I look at the year that even our men's team, they
were left out of the post-season tournament last year. Over the summer they
made sure they worked real hard to get themselves in a position that they're
having a great year. So that's certainly some incentive for the Lady Rebels.  
  
Q. Do you think the result would have been different if you had Shamela
Hampton in there today? How much of a factor was that?  
COACH MILLER: I'm huge at not using excuses because we always look to make
adjustments. But I will have to admit not having Shamela in the middle did
make a difference. It changed a lot of what we like to do and what we have
done. She is a post player that's played a lot of minutes.  
That's another young player on this team that went from playing very little to
35 minutes a game. So I felt like we made a pretty good adjustment fairly
quickly to go over and beat Colorado State. But then to come back and -- I
mean, New Mexico's got depth. They shoot the three, spread you out with the
three-point shot, then they have Dionne Marsh in the middle. You have to pay
attention to her.  
Our goal today was to try to defend that three well, as well as we could, and
not give up the -- give up the two a little bit, but not uncontested. Today we
gave up a lot of uncontested everything.  
Again, not having Shamela in the middle, it was probably too big of an
adjustment not having her to play against players like Marsh and some of the
depth they have on their team in the post. Having to move Sequoia from a guard
spot into the post area, you know, we were just really undersized. We played
three guards and two forwards most of the time.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH MILLER: Thanks, guys.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2007

  

### [Mallary Gillespie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16396)

### [Melinda Johnsen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14525)

### [Jeff Judkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13839)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Brigham Young University head coach Jeff
Judkins, student-athletes Mallary Gillespie and Melinda Johnsen.  
Coach, if you want to start with some opening remarks.  
COACH JUDKINS: We're glad we pulled this off tonight. It's hard playing Air
Force. They're so well-coached and disciplined and play so hard. If you're not
ready to play, they'll come out and punch you and fight. You know, I think my
team knew that tonight.  
Of course, losing Dani Wright early in the game was a scary moment. But I
think you saw tonight that we have other players that can step it up. I was
really proud of our team. I thought a couple players realized they had to do a
little bit more offensively. I think they took it upon their shoulders. These
two young ladies next to me I think really took it upon themselves to look a
little bit more at the basket.  
But I'm real happy for my team. It's good to see Cheesman and Cassie and
Shawnee get some good minutes tonight and get some confidence. Ashley has
worked very hard. To be able to come in tonight and get some quality minutes I
really think will help her confidence for this tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Let's have questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Mallary, what passed between the players when Dani went down?  
MALLARY GILLESPIE: Huge part of our offense, big defender, helps out tons. We
knew like right off the bat we had to step it up in different ways and help
each other out more. We all got together, we're all right; we can still do
this. Just need to slow down a little bit and look to score different ways and
defend in different ways.  
Granted, we have been able to be in like foul trouble this year, so it wasn't
too new because she's been out with foul trouble a bunch this year so we've
been kind of experienced in that.  
But we knew we had to step it up as soon as she went out.  
  
Q. Melinda, not normally like you to be looking for your shot like that. How
important could that be to the team for you to be looking for more of those
shots this weekend and in the future?  
MELINDA JOHNSEN: Don't kid yourself. There's only three shots in there
(smiling).  
I know for my team I'm kind of unselfish I guess you could say when it comes
to the offensive end. I feel confident in what I do offensively. I know when
the shot's there for me, I'm going to take it.  
Yeah, like Mal said, when one of your players goes down that you're looking to
go to a lot you start looking at different things and you make adjustments.
When she went down, I think it opened things up for us because, you know,
usually everyone's worrying about Kubik. It kind of freed things up for us a
little.  
  
Q. Do you know what the status of Dani Wright is? How do you like your
chances to win the tournament without her?  
MELINDA JOHNSEN: I think for right now she looks like she's going to be back
for us. Just kind of both Shawnee and her got just some tweaks in their
ankles. They should be back for us on Friday.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll let you go. Thank you.  
COACH JUDKINS: Thank you, ladies.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Judkins.  
COACH JUDKINS: Basically I think Mallary hit it on the head with that same
question. We've been used to Kubik being in foul trouble a lot. This team has
had to deal with it. The reason I didn't play her in the second half is
because the trainer told me if I didn't play her she'd have a lot better
chance of recovering and playing on Friday.  
I told the trainer, No matter what, if we were going to lose the game I wasn't
going to put her in the game. That's why I went in at halftime and I really
got into Riley and Cassie King and said, Hey, I'm not playing her. It's up to
you two. You better step it up or I'm going to go small. I'll go five smalls
and run five-man motion, trap, and do those things.  
I think by those things I got Riley a little fired up, realized she needs to
take the load because next year it's going to be her. It's going to be her in
the paint scoring it.  
That's what's so good about this team. I think you just hear the two, they
take what the TV gives them. They've been that way the whole year. One night
it's Mallary, one night it's Keele, Slade, Kubik. I think that's why this team
has been special. Hasn't been just one person. It's been a team effort.  
It's been a lot of fun to coach that.  
  
Q. You call Dani Wright Kubik?  
COACH JUDKINS: Her real name to all of us is Kubik. She got married this
summer. It's been hard when you've been yelling at a kid for three years and
then change it to Wright. I have done a pretty good job with Jennie Keele.
She's married, but she's been married a little bit longer. I've been able to
adjust. Plus I can pronounce Keele a lot better than her other name. Maybe
that's part of it.  
You know, I'm real proud of this team because they could have got really
discouraged when she went down and kind of like, What's up? But they came
together in that timeout, looked at each other, said, Hey, let's to it.  
  
Q. Knowing you're coming into this game as a big favorite, did you
accomplish today what you wanted to accomplish as a coach with your team?  
COACH JUDKINS: I think so. It was good to be able to have Cheesman come in and
play as well as she did. I think Jennie Keele played a lot better tonight than
she has the last couple games. Mallary seemed to be more in the flow. Our last
game with TCU she was kind of not moving a little bit too quick. I think
Riley, second half especially, came in a lot more physical and doing it.  
It's hard. I mean, you know, I started seeing all those guys go down. I'm
going, I don't have that deep a bench and everything. But I think it was good
for us to get in this tournament. Usually the first game is hard. I don't know
what causes it. I don't know if it's because it's a tournament, you have
practice on the court. But it was nice to get that out of the way.  
You know, when you work hard during the conference, to be able to play either
the eight or ninth team, that makes it a little bit easier for you.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
COACH JUDKINS: Thank you very much.

### [Don Flanagan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13837)

### [Dionne Marsh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14530)

### [Katie Montgomery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16961)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by University of New Mexico head coach Don
Flanagan and student-athletes Dionne Marsh and Katie Montgomery. Coach, if you
want to begin with some general comments on the game.  
COACH FLANAGAN: Started out very well. We don't normally start out that well.
I thought that the beginning of the game was excellent for us, hit our shots
early.  
Our game plan was to make sure we didn't give them anything in transition,
take care of the ball in the back court, not give them any turnovers where
they could score in transition, make 'em work on offense.  
Brandi Kimble did a great job defending Sequoia Holmes. Kind of took her out
of the game. Kind of defended her nose to nose wherever she goes, and that
definitely helped. They got a little bit frustrated from that.  
Then we ran our offense quite well, shot a high percentage in the first half.
Then we did it again in the second half. So we put together back-to-back
halves and put together a whole game that I thought maybe was our best game of
the season.  
I was real happy with the effort. We're happy to play Wyoming on Friday.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about coming into this game how much was it on your minds?
You were 2-16 here against them previously, and what happened last time you
played them, was that on your minds at all?  
KATIE MONTGOMERY: I think so a little bit. I think we were real motivated. We
knew we didn't play particularly well last time or last week when we were
here. We kind of had the game, kind of let it slip through our hands. We
wanted to come out hard and play hard. We wanted to come out intense from the
very beginning and match their intensity and match how hard they were going to
work. I thought we did a great job. We hit some shots early and that gave us
some confidence.  
  
Q. How important was that defensive play early on?  
KATIE MONTGOMERY: Defensively I thought we helped each other really well. Like
coach said, Brandi did a great job on Sequoia Holmes, not giving her too many
touches. We were just helping a lot. We were talking a lot and that helped us
out.  
I mean, defense has been strong for us all season. If we can play that kind of
defense, I think we can win some games.  
  
Q. Dionne, you were pretty confident before the game about welcoming a
chance to play them again. What was it about you wanting to have the rematch,
wanting this game even though you lost to them a week earlier?  
DIONNE MARSH: It was a lot of motivation for us, especially some of the older
girls, because we got knocked out by them in the first round last year. Our
last game playing against them we lost, so there was a lot of motivation for
that.  
We had something to prove. The girls, we talked about it before the game. We
knew we weren't going to lose.  
  
Q. Dionne, how much easier was it inside without Shamela Hampton in there?
What do you think was the big difference from last week's lost to them?  
DIONNE MARSH: I think the big difference between this week and last week is we
practiced against pressure a lot in practice. That was one thing that kind of
hurt us last game when we played them. Her post presence is very good. For
their team last time we played them, she was very strong, very physical. That
helped us out a little bit.  
Our post players, we did a good job today helping, basically rebounding, do
all the little things. We have a little room to improve obviously. Hopefully
we can practice tomorrow and get ready for Wyoming on Friday.  
  
Q. Both players, would you look ahead to Wyoming. What do you think of the
match-up? What is going to be the key?  
KATIE MONTGOMERY: Wyoming, I mean, they're a tough team obviously. They're one
of the top five in the conference. We all kind of have the same record.
Everybody's kind of beaten everybody. We just got to make sure -- they're a
great three-point shooting team. We have to make sure we keep that away from
them.  
They're a team that works incredibly hard. We're going to have to match their
intensity, their hard work, come out hard against them. Hopefully we will get
a quick start like we did today and that will help a lot.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Valerie's play?  
DIONNE MARSH: Val did very well. She helps us a lot. She's 6'6". Against a lot
of teams, that's a good height for us, especially in this conference. All you
have to do is just keep throwing it in to her. She's pretty good about
finishing. She's got good hands. Hopefully she'll continue to help us
throughout the tournament.  
  
Q. Katie, you guys just blew a team out of the gym. There were thousands of
fans here from New Mexico. Does this feel like New Mexico's tournament to lose
right now?  
KATIE MONTGOMERY: I don't know. Obviously it's kind of nice having a couple
thousand fans cheering for you. I mean, it was a very good atmosphere out
there for us. I think, you know, probably a few more will be coming once the
weekend comes around.  
You know, we just got to make sure we come out and not really than -- you
know, we can't really focus on how many fans we have. We got to come out, play
hard, play smart, play together. If we play like a team we did today, we're
going to be hard to beat.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, ladies. We'll let you go. Questions now for Coach
Flanagan.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the motivation factor from the previous meeting?  
COACH FLANAGAN: It probably helped. You know, this is our fourth straight
athletic team. UNLV we played just a week ago. I think we had some flaws in
our game against some quickness and some athleticism and some pressure. I
thought we did a good job resolving those problems.  
It was evident today that we were more patient. We were calmer. We showed more
poise against a team that is quite athletic and puts a lot of pressure on you.  
Now we've got to play Wyoming, who doesn't do that at all. So the conference
is divided with teams that play halfcourt and teams that pressure you full
court. We just had all three of those teams that pressure you in a row full
court. I think we grew accustomed to it and figured out how to beat that
pressure.  
Now we got to figure out how to beat that halfcourt set in running an
effective offense.  
  
Q. You had 14 steals, forced 23 turnovers. Was the defense more of a key
this game than scoring over 60 like it is in your usual games?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Well, defense has always been important to us. We're one of
the top teams actually in the nation I guess point-wise. It's always important
to us. We felt like Sequoia Holmes was the key. She really had an effective
game against us last time we played. She's very difficult to stop. She jumps
over guards. So we tried to take the ball out of her hands and not let her get
very many catches. That seemed to be quite effective.  
Once she couldn't quite get her shot off she got a little bit frustrated and
other players had to step up and score. And that definitely was one of the
reasons why we were successful.  
  
Q. Valerie averages like five minutes a game. Do you normally put her in in
the first half, or is that strictly to go against UNLV's 6'6 " center there,
Stickler?   
COACH FLANAGAN: It was fun to watch those two play anyway. I thought that
would be a nice match-up for the fans, so I figured I'd put them both in at
the same time of (smiling). If she put her in, we put our big kid in.  
Actually Val has been making some advances in practice. I think that's the
main reason why I gave her a chance. Then, of course, she goes in and she
starts playing pretty well, and I'm not taking her out when she's playing
pretty well. But in practice, we've been working very hard on her focusing in
practice and working harder in practice.  
She's got a great deal of talent. This game I gave her a chance and she
showed, after good practices, that she could play with some discipline. She
was listening, she was focused. I was very happy with her success today.  
So I put her in the first half, had good minutes. Put her back in the second
half. If she keeps playing like that, I'm not holding anybody out of a game if
they can have a game like that obviously. But the key for us is practice hard,
practice with focus, and then we'll get you some time in the game. And she
showed that lately. Then she had a chance, and she sure made the most of that
chance.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.  
COACH FLANAGAN: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2007

  

### [Elaine Elliott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15524)

### [Morgan Warburton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16975)

### [Kalee Whipple](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16974)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by University of Utah head coach Elaine Elliott
and student-athletes Morgan Warburton and Kalee Whipple.  
Coach, if you want to begin with some opening comments on the game.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, I'm extremely proud of the effort. We just really wanted
to feel like this after the game, and I'm not referring to just winning a
game, I'm referring to just knowing that we gave a great effort. We really
prepared ourselves to play hard, play together, you know, not let the ebbs and
flows of the game change us.  
So we did that, and that gave us a chance.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kalee, what were your thoughts going to the basket there? Probably the
biggest shot you've ever taken in your life.  
KALEE WHIPPLE: By far the biggest. Coach just told us to get it out if they
made the basket, just get out and run. Mo took it down. I saw she obviously
had my player on her. She passed me the ball. I didn't think twice about it. I
knew time was running out. Just took it to the hole.  
  
Q. Morgan, you were on fire there in the first half. What did that feel
like?  
MORGAN WARBURTON: It felt really good. The last couple games in the season, I
wasn't doing what I thought I should have been doing. I mean, it was my time
to like redeem myself and, you know, get some shots up that I wasn't getting
up in the last couple games. So it was really good.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts on meeting up with BYU?  
MORGAN WARBURTON: That game is going to be good. It's always an exciting game.
We're going to be ready.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the effort Adrianne Ross displayed in the second half
when she started to take over for TC and brought them back?  
MORGAN WARBURTON: She definitely showed she was Player of the Year this year.
I give her a lot of credit for coming out and playing their game, even though
their team was down, we were pushing on them. She's a great player, I really
respect her.  
KALEE WHIPPLE: Like Mo said, great, great player. She never gave up, not once.
Kept going till the very last second. I give all the credit in the world to
her. She did a great job tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let you two guys go. Thank you. Questions for Coach
Elliott.  
  
Q. Seemed like you really got a different effort tonight than you got out of
the Wyoming game. How did you get so pumped up for this?  
COACH ELLIOTT: We worked at it for the last couple days. Yeah, it was a
disappointment to, again, not have a real clear drive and preparation for that
final game at home. That was the goal, was for them to learn that that's part
of playing. You don't just show up. Young players don't really know how to
prepare to play.  
So we spent a lot of time, you know, Monday and Tuesday talking about it and
trying to address, you know, why that might be and what we might want to do to
change that, and that our goal was to be sure we didn't feel that way again
regardless of the outcome.  
So, obviously I was extremely proud because the kids just really showed a fire
that, you know, was lacking in the last month of the season almost.  
  
Q. Your two leaders, Morgan and Kalee, really stepped up today. Do you have
any comments on that?  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, they are our studs in the same way that Adrianne Ross
practically carried them to the win. That's what your good players have to do.
They have to take it on their shoulders and they have to be prepared to take
that burden on.  
Now, to their credit, that's a freshman and sophomore stepping up to try to
get it done and getting it done in a big game. It is difficult. There's a real
psychology and a real mentality to that besides whatever skills they might
have. It's not easy to understand how to bring that out as a young player. The
credit certainly is due them.  
  
Q. You battled BYU in Provo about a week ago. What are your thoughts on
getting another shot at them?  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, again, our goal is that we're going to really come out
with a drive and intention and a fire to compete. I really don't doubt that
we'll be able to do that.  
  
Q. TCU, along with a few other teams, might be tournament bubble teams. What
are your thoughts on the strength of the conference and chances for yourselves
to get at-large berths?  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, as much as the committee never talks about the RPI or
says, you know, you don't get so hung up in that, it doesn't really matter,
it's always really mattered for our league's teams. That concerns me.  
In terms of the strength of this league and whether they deserve to be in the
post-season play, there's just no doubt. TCU is extremely talented and can
play with anybody. And certainly, you know, it shouldn't be a matter of sort
of when you lose in a tournament.  
I hope it's going to come down to exactly what are these teams, how good are
these teams in our league, and what they done, and not sitting there waiting
to see what you are going to do next.  
I mean, TCU is loaded with upperclassmen, too, and really have proven
themselves as a program that can compete. I mean, I definitely think that our
league teams should be well-represented. I just wish I got to choose.  
  
Q. Can you talk about after they were able to come back, the composure of
your team, such a young team, to be able to weather that storm?  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, you know, that's been sort of a hit-and-miss proposition
for us. We've done that certain times this season and we haven't done that.
Our goal was the rest of this season, however long that was going to be, we
were not going to have to look back and say we didn't give that, that we at
some point folded.  
When you do it's because you get into yourself. Your focus is in the wrong
place. If your focus is in the right place, which is just being there every
play, being there for your teammate if they need it, then you're not going to.
You're going to force the other team to make plays to beat you as compared to
beating yourself.  
So I don't think that that will happen to us any more. I think that we're
going to make that commitment however long this season lasts.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2007

  

### [Ashley Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16397)

### [Jeff Mittie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13840)

### [Adrianne Ross](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16393)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Mittie will be here in a moment. We can start with
questions for Adrianne or Ashley.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your performance in the second half and what your
mindset was.  
ADRIANNE ROSS: Basically my mindset the second half was to do totally opposite
to what I did the first half, and that was to keep my composure and be
patient. Obviously it worked, but I dug myself to big of a hole in the first
half to make the second half to be worth anything.  
  
Q. Do you think the game was decided in the first half when you struggled
there over basically the first 15 minutes?  
ADRIANNE ROSS: I didn't understand the question.  
  
Q. Do you think the game was decided in the first half when you went cold
for the first 12 minutes?  
ASHLEY DAVIS: I don't think it necessarily was decided in the first half. I
think we dug ourselves a hole in the first half. Offensively we weren't just
clicking, getting our normal good shots that we usually get.  
I do think we struggled in the first half, but I don't think the game was over
at all.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the emotion of seeing that shot trickle in at the
end.  
ADRIANNE ROSS: At the end? I just remember watching the Air Force shot with
Colorado State. I was like, Man, that must really suck because both teams
played hard. Then de'ja vu and it happened to us.  
Credit to them, you know, for not rushing down the court and getting a wild
one like Coach Mittie said. All we can do is put that behind us and go from
there.  
  
Q. What are the next few days going to be like until you find out your post-
season fate?  
ASHLEY DAVIS: I think the next couple days it's going to be hard, hoping we'll
get in the tournament. We've been there pretty much every year since I've been
here. That's definitely one of our goals going into the season.  
I guess now it's just practice, stay in shape, just get some shots up, hope to
see our name come up on Selection Sunday.  
  
Q. What do you think the biggest feather in your cap is if you were to make
a pitch to the selection committee?  
ADRIANNE ROSS: Well, usually we win the first round, so put us in there. We'll
get up there and stir up some trouble.  
I mean, we're a tournament team. This game is uncharacteristic because we like
tournament play, short warmups, get in there and give it your all. We just
didn't get it started the way we wanted to get it started.  
I think bouncing back from tonight, taking these couple days, seeing if our
name comes up on Sunday, keeping our fingers crossed, we put a lot of hard
work into it. I think we'll get refocused and we'll find our niche that got us
here in the tournament the last couple years.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach Mittie.  
  
Q. What are the next few days going to be like for you?  
COACH MITTIE: You're asking me right after the game. I don't know. We'll get
back home, probably take a couple days off, just kind of maybe get a workout
or two in, just kind of stay in shape for selection. I think it's Monday,
isn't it? So we'll wait on that and see where we go from there.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the second half when Adrianne led you guys back, Helen
contributed, Jen, as well?  
COACH MITTIE: I thought we had a lot of players play well in the second half,
I really did. Adrianne was quick off the dribble, made some good reads in
motion. We had better movement. She hit some big shots.  
Helen I thought hit some big shots. Jenna kind of cleaned up the scraps. I
thought we were big on the glass. We didn't give them many second looks. But
they didn't miss many shots tonight. There wasn't a whole lot of opportunities
for them to rebound. I thought we did a solid job on the glass. I thought we
fought hard.  
Unfortunately, we did dig ourselves a hole. I thought in the first half we did
not play well at all. I did not think we did things necessary to be a good
team in the first half.  
  
Q. What was that?  
COACH MITTIE: We showed a lot of impatience, a lack of composure, things that
we've talked about for a long time - too long really. This is not a young
basketball team. We're 31 games in. These should not be things we're still
talking about, which is one of the reasons why we're sitting here talking
about a loss.  
  
Q. Do you think you have made enough of a case to go to the tournament?  
COACH MITTIE: You know, probably out of all the years, I have less of a feel
for this year than any of 'em. I think it's going to be real -- things will
have to fall right, I think. I don't know. I mean, like I said, out of all the
years, I probably have less of a feel for this year's tournament stuff than
any year because I think the RPI's been a little bit different. Last year our
RPI was so good. This year our RPI has really been upper 40s, low 50s. That's
a tough spot to be in.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH MITTIE: Thank you.

## March 7, 2007

  

### [Letrecia Castillo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16920)

### [Ardie McInelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13836)

### [Alecia Steele](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16386)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined now by United States Air Force Academy head coach Ardie
McInelly and student-athletes Letricia Castillo and Alecia Steele.  
Coach, if you would start with couple comments on the game.  
COACH McINELLY: I'd like to congratulate BYU. They're a very good team, many
weapons. They certainly outplayed us tonight on both ends of the court
offensively and defensively.  
I really believed the first part of the game, I thought we did a pretty good
job of staying with them, then all of a sudden, who was it, Dani Wright goes
out? I thought, Man, we might have a chance, you know.  
But a team like BYU, they saw that one of their main players had gone out and
they picked it up and they played even better. They just took it to us. We
never did respond.  
I give a lot of credit to them, what they've done, the job that Jeff Judkins
has done, as well as his assistants. We have a ways to go. We feel very
privileged that we even had an opportunity to play them. I'll turn it over to
my players.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Letricia or Alecia.  
  
Q. Alecia, when you look at the last two nights, won a tournament game last
night, tonight did you step back a little bit? How do you assess the two
nights?  
ALECIA STEELE: Yesterday or last night I think we were a little more focused.
We stuck to our game plan. Today we started out pretty good, and then we lost
focus. We didn't make smart decisions. Basically that's what happened. The
team that was there last night was not there tonight.  
LETRICIA CASTILLO: We just didn't have the same intensity and focus that we
had last night. It's kind of unfortunate because we started off pretty well
against them, but we lost our intensity. We just didn't make the smart
decisions that we made last night. Our defense wasn't on point like it was
yesterday. If we would have played like we played last night, I think it could
have been a different game.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. We'll let you two go. Questions for Coach
McInelly.  
  
Q. Would you address that same thing as far as how you look at the two
nights, made a step forward last night, and did you take two steps back
tonight do you think or what?  
COACH McINELLY: I thought last night we played a 40-minute game. I thought
tonight we didn't do that. Granted, BYU is No. 1 in our conference for a
reason. As I said, they have many players that can come in and score, whether
it be Wright or Riley or Gillespie or Johnsen. You know, they're No. 1 for
that reason in that many people on their team can step up.  
We've relied on a couple people on our team throughout the year. When those
couple people are shut down, then we struggle. It is our goal to hopefully
continue to recruit players that can come in, we can have winning records.  
It was night and day from last night to tonight. But it was certainly due to
BYU, I think their outstanding defense, I think their solid offense. It's a
team that will not only do well in this conference tournament but will
continue to go on and do well in the NCAAs.  
As I said, I have a lot of respect for them, what he's done there at BYU. If
there's any BYU papers, make sure you put that in there so people cheer for us
instead of boo for us when we go to the Marriott Center.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
COACH McINELLY: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by San Diego State University head coach Beth
Burns, student-athletes Quenese Davis and Shanna Demus. Coach, if you want to
begin with some opening comments.  
COACH BURNS: Certainly. I think that what sometimes gets lost in Wyoming's
team when you talk about what makes Wyoming work, they're such a fantastic
shooting team. They run such great rhythm offense. I think what some people
don't realize is that they also give up the least amount of points in the
league. They're the No. 1 team in our league in terms of points.  
I think, you know, at halftime, my assistant coach leaned over and said, I
think the winner of this game is going to a Bowl game because I believe it was
17-14. But what they did that was most critical and most challenging to us was
they eliminated any easy points.  
We got nothing in transition. We have to get that in order to be able to
score. They put a lot of pressure on our halfcourt offense. We had to work
really, really hard for our points. I think as the game wore on, that was the
difference in the game.  
With that said, I could not be prouder of our effort. We gave them everything
we had and then some. I think that's a difficult offense to guard. I thought
that we did just as good a job as we could. Tip your cap to them for really
that run that got us on our heels. We stepped it a little bit, but we just
really couldn't score enough points to put us in a position to be successful.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Either player, what did you do well defensively against Wyoming today?
16% in the first half is what they shot. What specifically did you do well
defensively against them?  
QUENESE DAVIS: I say we limited their outside shooting. They were, what, 0-5
for threes? Probably take away more shots than that. They average more shots
than that making. That's what we took away from them.  
  
Q. If you had known you were going to hold them without a three-pointer in
this game, would you have believed that you would have lost this game?  
QUENESE DAVIS: I think it would take more than just us limiting them in
threes. We stopped their inside game, too.  
SHANNA DEMUS: I guess from the beginning, probably, because they're a great
shooting three-point team. I think they're leading the conference in three-
pointers. I think they're like 22nd in the nation.  
Of course, it's in the back of our head. Going into the game we were prepared
and we were ready. But, hey, what can I say?  
  
Q. How frustrated did they have you offensively just with the defense they
played in this game?  
SHANNA DEMUS: I don't think they had us frustrated more than just ourselves,
the ability. I had open shots. Just the inability to knock them down or to
make the open layups we did have. Not them more than ourselves.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let you two ladies go. Thank you.  
COACH BURNS: Good job, ladies.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Burns.  
  
Q. Beth, can you talk about the first seven or eight minutes of the second
half. Obviously you couldn't do anything in transition. They kind of buckled
you down a little bit. Can you talk about that stretch.  
COACH BURNS: I think beginning, middle and end, we just didn't, couldn't,
wouldn't rebound. You know, we are a team that works really, really hard to
get in the high 50s. I mean, that's against anybody that we play. So that's a
common theme.  
Our challenge is - and has been - our energy level has to be so high to be --
we got people guarding people that are six and seven inches bigger than they
are, so our energy level has to be so high to prevent them from doing what
they're doing.  
It does get a little frustrating, even though I guess these two weren't
frustrated. I'll be honest and say I was a little frustrated. It gets hard to
keep working that hard and coming up empty.  
I think it puts so much pressure on your offense that when, you know, who
doesn't miss a layup? Layups get missed. For us, it's like Oh, my goodness. It
puts so much more pressure on our offense because it was our first easy shot
we had.  
That's credit to them. They're a team that has an opportunity to not only get
into the tournament but to win in the tournament. I think they're older and
they looked it. They're experienced and they looked it. They made a run and
they never -- you know, I think we guarded them a little bit in the first
half. I don't think they just didn't shoot well.  
Great ones never let you see them sweat. They never changed their composure,
never came out of their stuff. That's a credit to Joe and to his team.  
It's tough for us to score.  
  
Q. What was the feeling at halftime when you're up three, but at the same
time they're only shooting 16%?  
COACH BURNS: We did about everything we can do well. I will agree with Shanna
that I thought we did get some nice looks, but they didn't drop. All we could
do was to encourage them to keep taking those same shots to try to help us
help each other getting on the offensive boards. But, of course, expect that
we have to have the same kind of focus and intensity.  
Really I think in the second half it was they shot a lot of free-throws. It
was a great crew. But that was the difference, too. As you got a little bit
more fatigued, a great shooting team is usually great from the stripe, as
well, and they are. That was just too much for us.  
But we felt good. I mean, I had told the team yesterday that, you know, If we
win 2-1 we still win. We still get to play on Friday. That's the way we think
we have to play with our team this year.  
  
Q. Can you recap this season in a nutshell, if you can, and what's down the
road.  
COACH BURNS: It went fast. Last year did not go fast. Last year went really
long (smiling).  
It went fast. I think we improved tremendously. I think the opportunity for
Quenese -- Quenese Davis has had a fantastic freshman year. We really didn't
have a sub for her. She is 125 pounds with rocks in her pockets and we never
took her out. I think we'll be the benefactor of that next year.  
She's seen it all, played against the great teams in this league. I think we
lose two seniors. We have four redshirts that have been practicing with us in
the gym. We had a recruiting class that we're proud of.  
I think right now, you know, I said to one of my coaches last week in
practice, If you didn't know any better you'd think we were the No. 1 seed.
And that's why the year went fast. Everybody likes and respects one another.
We work hard in practice every day.  
I think you feel bad today, but when you look back over your shoulder, we've
made great strides. We've won 12 games from three games. Now, knock on wood,
injuries and things, we feel like we're ready. We haven't pulled our weight in
the Mountain West Conference. We feel that we're ready to do that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks very much.  
COACH BURNS: Thank you, everyone.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by University of Wyoming head coach Joe Legerski,
and student-athletes Jodi Bolerjack, Hanna Zavecz and Dominique Sisk.  
Coach, if you want to begin with some general comments on the game.  
COACH LEGERSKI: It was a first-round ballgame. There was nervousness on our
side. We had to try to find a comfort zone where offensively we ended up
getting a little more focused.  
But, more importantly, we had to make some shots just to be able to get back
and be able to defend in a halfcourt game as well as possibly just relax our
shooters, and I thought we were able to do that in the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Was it nerves? Seemed like that first half, 16% shooting, I know you're
much better shooters. Something defensively from San Diego State? What was
happening there?  
HANNA ZAVECZ: I think it was a mixture of both. San Diego State are really
intense on defense. There were some nerves on our part.  
A mixture of the both led to our poor shooting. They were getting us out of
our game. But we turned things around in the second half and were more
relaxed.  
  
Q. Any of the players, it looked like a pretty physical first half. Did you
make some adjustments in the second half to sort of be the aggressor? Jodi, on
one drive I saw you getting hounded. You went to the lane, made a layup. Did
you make a decision at the half to be more aggressive?  
JODI BOLERJACK: Yeah, coach told us we needed to keep going strong, just take
a little more time on our shots, make sure that we put a little extra umph on
it because we were getting pressured all the way down.  
  
Q. You finally caught them, and then had to play with a lead. They made a
run at the end. What did you have to do to hold off that run?  
DOMINIQUE SISK: We just had to keep our composure. We knew they were going to
make a run because they're a very intense ballclub. No one's ever going to
back down, you know.  
All we had to do was keep our composure, be strong, keep the ball in our
possession, have as many possessions as we could, stay strong with the ball.  
  
Q. Hanna, at one point in the game you were crying, visibly upset or hurt.
How do you keep your head in the game? How did you pull yourself through?  
HANNA ZAVECZ: I don't know. I just have to refocus. Yeah, it is a mental
thing. I just have to pull myself together, realize that lots of people play
with pain, I know that. So it's really just a mental thing. Just stay in it
for the sake of my team, for everyone.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll let you go. Thank you.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Thank you, ladies.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Legerski.  
  
Q. What was the key at halftime? I know you're guys are only scoring 14
points. You can't be please with that. Did you tell them anything? Was there
anything you said or did to calm them down, to get out of that funk?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I think one of the difficult things for a team, we've gone
through a very difficult season, and to be able to, on the last Saturday, end
up getting a second seed was a remarkable effort. You have to turn right back
around and try to refocus for a tournament where the first game is always the
most difficult from the standpoint of nerves and being focused.  
We talked at halftime about just hanging in there, shots are going to start
falling. But you have to shoot with the conviction to make a shot. Try not to
let the pressure bother you. I thought we started doing that in the second
half. We also talked about having to go strong to the basket so you can get to
the free-throw line. That's where you can pick up some easy points.  
You know, I think San Diego State had a great deal to do with us scoring 14
points in the first half. Then we ended up getting on a roll in the second
half. Once we got up to a seven-point lead you could see the team relax a
great deal, and we did very well in attacking the zone full court press.
Elisabeth Dissen came through with three big shots.  
  
Q. You've said all season your team needs to shoot the ball well from the
perimeter, take care of the basketball to win. They didn't do either very
well, but you're still moving on. Is that something positive to take away from
today?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I tell you what, winning's positive. That's the bottom line in
this game: you win, you advance. That's what we were able to do.  
The big thing that stays with the Wyoming program is defense. In the second
half, we were able to shoot 50% from the field. But defensively we got San
Diego State down around 27%. Once again, to hold a team to 44 points is a big
defensive effort. I knew we could get enough baskets to be able to get the
lead and then to hang on to the lead.  
  
Q. Talk about what's next. Now you have a day to prepare. Is that a good or
bad thing? Do you need to catch your breath a little bit?  
COACH LEGERSKI: Right now what's next is we enjoy this victory. One of the
things we've always talked about all season long for this team is to learn to
enjoy a win. We'll wait and watch the games today. We'll get to work tonight
as a coaching staff. We'll have something in place for tomorrow to be able to
play on Friday.  
But it's nice to be able to win and stay around in the tournament.  
  
Q. I know you just talked about enjoying the victory. There's a possibility
you could be playing New Mexico. Could you talk about the last encounter you
had, so physical? Talk about what it's like going up against them?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I tell you what, it's a challenge, because this league is very
talented. When you end up taking a look at how many 20-win ball clubs we have,
it really speaks volumes of what this league's been about.  
New Mexico is a quality ballclub. They are used to winning at this level, and
that's going to be a big challenge for this young group. We're still a team
that does not put a senior on the floor. We're still learning how to win. When
I take a look at New Mexico, with Montgomery, Briody, they've been around.
I'll be anxious to watch the next game and see if it's New Mexico or UNLV.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Marilyn Moulton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16921)

### [Jen Warden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13833)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Now we're joined by Colorado State University head coach Jen
Warden, student-athletes Sara Hunter and Marilyn Moulton. Coach, if you want
to begin with some opening remarks.  
COACH WARDEN: Congratulations to Air Force. I thought they played very tough.
They're a very tough-minded team. I said at halftime that they're a
tremendously well-coached team. I think Ardie McInelly does a great job with
her team, with her recruiting. I think they're a very formidable opponent, so
congratulations to them. Good luck against BYU.  
I'm very proud of our players. I'm proud of our season. I'm proud of our
players sitting to my left. Sara Hunter, again, I don't know if I've taken
Sara out of a game since December. She's just been a terrific, terrific focal
point for us. I think you could see down the stretch what she means to us
because we trusted her with the ball every possession of the game, bar none.  
Marilyn, again, seven offensive boards, tremendous consistency, tremendous
temperament. You know, it's going to be difficult to see her go from the
program. But I just look forward to her donations back to the program in the
future as a radiologist.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Sara, it seemed like your shots were not falling there a lot of times,
especially the threes. They changed who guarded you. You had a much taller
player guarding you. Did that have an impact or the shot wasn't there early
tonight? Finally came late, I guess.  
SARA HUNTER: No, I mean, it didn't really -- some nights your shots don't
fall. I just picked a bad night, I guess. That's when you got to make
adjustments as an offensive player and find something that does work, go to
the basket, create for your teammates.  
  
Q. Marilyn, could you recount those last seconds and what was going on out
there?  
MARILYN MOULTON: Well, we just needed a stop at the end. I think we did pretty
well. We held them off till the last second. It was a good defensive stand,
but the last no-board was the game winner, so...  
  
Q. Were you close to the ball?  
MARILYN MOULTON: Yeah.  
  
Q. Looked like you were fairly close.  
MARILYN MOULTON: Yeah.  
  
Q. Did you get your hands on it?  
MARILYN MOULTON: No, I didn't.  
  
Q. It seemed like when the shots weren't falling, you started getting a lot
more aggressive, driving, got them on one possession alone I think they
committed five fouls. Was that a very intentional, if we can't hit from the
outside, let's get something somehow, get to the line, whatever?  
SARA HUNTER: Yeah. You know, every timeout that was called or media timeout,
coach came to the huddle. You know, she said, We can't play finesse. If we're
not hitting from the outside, we've got to create something from the inside.
Everything else will fall into place.  
It just came too late. Ultimately, you know, it was really rebounds that
killed us.  
  
Q. Do you feel if you had started doing that a little earlier in the game,
because that did get you right back in, it became a fairly tight game again,
maybe it could have changed the outcome?  
SARA HUNTER: Yeah, I think, you know, we could have gotten on a roll a little
bit sooner and probably gained momentum, you know, potentially it couldn't
even have been that close of a game.  
But like coach said, Air Force is a tough-nosed team. You know, they outplayed
us tonight when it mattered.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys, we'll let you two go. Questions for Coach Warden.  
  
Q. What do you take from the season? Obviously some gnarly things happened.
It was a struggle throughout. What are the positives you take from your second
season here and where can you go forward from there?  
COACH WARDEN: Well, I think the truest test of this profession, the truest
test of any program, is the test of time. I've done this before. The Boise
State players that I recruited just won the WAC championship. It's not going
to happen overnight.  
You've got to get talented freshmen in here. They've got to commit to what
they're doing. They've got to believe in the future. They've got to see the
players you're recruiting around them. You've got to love 'em.  
That's what we got to do at Colorado State. Those things are going to happen.
Those things are going to take time. Okay, we had a hiccup this year. It might
take a little bit more time, but not that much more.  
  
Q. How tough was it to be struggling as much as you were offensively? It
looked like the things that looked like normally would go weren't going in the
first half especially, yet you're still ahead by a point. What do you
attribute that to? As bad as things might have been going offensively, you
were still up.  
COACH WARDEN: I think what you do is you reach a certain point in the game,
and we were down nine, and you take notes on this so you know better than I
do, I believe maybe with 9:50 left. It was getting close. It was getting
point-per-minute.  
The focus on the timeout, a lot of times teams start to gain energy and
intensity when they hit a couple threes or their layups fall or they get a
three-point play, and that gets them charged. So on the bench to that moment,
you know, as you said, we're coaching them. Our threes aren't going, let's get
physical on drives, let's force the fouls, let's get to the free-throw line.  
Pretty soon you got to figure out, Guess what, this ain't going to be no
offensive shoot out, this is going to be a defensive game. You almost flip
your paradigm at that moment, and the next timeout we had we flipped our
paradigm and said, Guess what, we're not going to do it with offense, we're
going to do it with defense.  
That's when you stick with Marilyn and you put your best, toughest, hard-nosed
defenders around her. You don't let Air Force score, and you make it a 47-46
ballgame. And that's what we did.  
I think you saw until the 1:21 mark, when we went with Nya, to get a bucket,
we committed to defensive players and a defensive scheme. Every time we had to
set something up, Sara Hunter was going to take the shot. Otherwise we wanted
to score out of our defense and let our defense lead us and get encouragement
out of stops, and not frustration out of not scoring.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.  
COACH WARDEN: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2007

  

### [Letrecia Castillo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16920)

### [Ardie McInelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13836)

### [Alecia Steele](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16386)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Air Force academy head coach Ardie McInelly and
the two student-athletes, Alecia Steele and Letricia Castillo.  
Coach, if you would begin with some opening remarks.  
COACH McINELLY: First of all, I'm just very proud of these young women for
what they've accomplished. It's the first time in the history of the academy
that they've won a tournament game, both men and women. I just wish we had our
men's record (laughter).  
We're very proud of what our players did tonight. I thought it was a well-
fought game. I think that, I'll tell you what, Sara Hunter, she's remarkable.
We did something a little bit different today. We ended up putting Pam Findley
on her. Pam's almost 6'. She's 5'11". We were thinking maybe if we could have
a taller player guard Sara, we could keep her under her average. She's a very
good player. She still ended up scoring 17 points on us.  
But, you know, we made the plays at the end of the game, especially Alecia
Steele putting in a put-back that won us the game.  
Very proud of these young women. We're just going to get ready for BYU
tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: The next couple minutes, let's have our questions directed to
the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Alecia, can you explain the last play there, what you saw? Were you aware
of how little time there was left?  
ALECIA STEELE: I knew that once Pam got the ball, when she was driving, people
were counting down seven, six. We had seven seconds left on the clock. I knew
she was more than capable of driving to the basket and creating the shot.  
I was just following her for the rebound. I seen it didn't go in. I was going
to do whatever I had to do to grab that rebound and put it back, and that's
what I did.  
  
Q. It seemed like you missed shot after shot right there in that stretch.
How confident were you it was going to finally go in when you did put it up?  
ALECIA STEELE: Hey, we decided that we weren't going to give up, we weren't
going to stop playing till that buzzer sounded. So we were very confident.  
We knew we were still in it. Until the clock said zero seconds, we were going
to keep playing.  
  
Q. For both you girls, it's been kind of a disappointing season I would say.
How much does this make up for it, I guess, or does it?  
LETRICIA CASTILLO: It has been a disappointing season. But this just shows
that our hard work has paid off and that we keep trying, keep perservering. It
just makes us really excited for tomorrow, to prepare for tomorrow, so...  
ALECIA STEELE: Like Trish said, we were very frustrated with our season. But,
hey, it's a clean slate in the tournament, so we're finally going to put 40
minutes together and do our best to continue to do well.  
  
Q. Alecia, did you actually see the rim when you shot the last shot, or was
it just kind of a throw and hoper?  
ALECIA STEELE: It was just the reaction. I'm used to grabbing rebounds, so I
grabbed it. There wasn't any time to try to pass it back out, so I just put it
back up.  
  
Q. Either player, this was not necessarily a pretty game for either team.
There were a lot of missed shots, a lot of turnovers, a lot of sloppy play.
Was that just two teams that were desperate, or was there something else that
caused it to be kind of that way?  
LETRICIA CASTILLO: I think it's more we both were trying so hard to pick it up
on the defensive end. We were going to do whatever it took to stop the other
team from scoring, just prevent them from doing what they normally do. So that
just comes with the game, turnovers, missed shots.  
But it took a lot of drive and determination to finally put the last one in,
so that's the one we were really excited went in. It was just mostly pressure
defense that really kind of changed momentum of the game.  
  
Q. For both girls, first conference tournament victory ever in the history
of the program. There will never be another first again. How does this feel?  
ALECIA STEELE: I just keep smiling. I keep clapping. It feels great. It feels
so good to finally, you know, get that win and to know that, you know, we're
more than capable of achieving a victory.  
So we're happy. I don't think we'll stop smiling.  
LETRICIA CASTILLO: I think that's it. We're both screaming and shouting. We're
really excited because we knew that we were capable of winning that first-ever
tournament game for Air Force, men or women. We're just excited because we
worked so hard and finally it paid off today.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll let you two go. Thank you, congratulations.  
Questions for coach McInelly.  
  
Q. Kind of the same thing I asked the girls, certainly there were a lot of
things, both teams looked like they were struggling in a lot of ways. You
looked frustrated on the sidelines much of the game. Jen Warden looked
frustrated. Was it just two teams playing really hard that are fairly similar,
or were there other reasons that things just didn't seem to be going right for
either team for much of the game and yet it ended up being a great finish?  
COACH McINELLY: I'll tell you what, I think that, as I said before, Sara
Hunter is one of the best players out there. I thought that we tried to do
whatever we could to stop her. I would get really frustrated when she could
still make those very tough shots, you know, with someone in her face. So I
have a lot of respect for the young lady. I have a lot of respect for Colorado
State and some of the things that they did.  
I know that, you know, they're only going to continue to get better. Our
frustration is probably a culmination of our record. It's nice to know that at
the end of the game, our players could pull out this win. It's nice to be able
to say that we're going to be able to play tomorrow night.  
You know, maybe the game wasn't pretty, but doesn't matter to us. We won it,
and that's the most important thing.  
  
Q. Was there a team in America that needed a victory more than the Air Force
women's team right at this time of the season?  
COACH McINELLY: Nope (laughter). I mean, it was nice. It was nice to finally
get that win. You know, wish we could have gotten a lot more. But, you know,
you can't look behind; you can only look ahead. So we're going to start
preparing for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Not to shuttle the celebration right now, but in very short time you've
got to play the best team in the league. What do you need to do to play better
against them than you did the first two games?  
COACH McINELLY: Well, what we have to do against BYU, if my memory serves me
correctly (smiling), we've got to do a better job defensively; we've got to do
a better job boxing out; we've got to take care of the ball; we've got to take
high-personal shots.  
BYU is a team very similar to, I kind of want to say Utah and Wyoming, in that
they don't play a pressure defense, they basically kind of gap it up. They
play off you. They make you hit outside shots. We've got to do a good job of,
you know, executing our offense against them.  
You know, we'll have some time to go back and look at some game film to see if
coaches, and -- you know, use that hour we have tomorrow to prepare for BYU.  
They're a great team. You know, it's just fun because, you know, that's why we
play the game. They're No. 1 and we're No. 9. All of a sudden we just moved up
a spot, so you never know what can happen.  
If our players can keep the energy and keep a positive attitude, hopefully
execute the things that we need to do, then we'll have a chance.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. We'll see you tomorrow.  
COACH McINELLY: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 3, 2007

  

### [Essence Carson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17191)

### [C. Vivian Stringer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16227)

  
_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Stringer and
then go to questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH STRINGER: What can I say? Tennessee played great. I think that we played
hard. Tried to play hard a little bit too late. We needed to come out maybe a
little more aggressive and it might have made a difference. But just it's all
credit to Tennessee. They have a great team. If you want to ask me how do I
feel if we had to lose, something to someone, you know, would it be Tennessee,
um, I think most of you know that she and I are personal friends so I have
respect for her as a professional and certainly as a coach.  
Would we have liked to have won? Yeah. Yeah. I've been coaching a long time
and she's won about eight or nine of them so we would really like to have one.
So it hurts a lot. Because as I said, I was saying to the team, you get to
that point -- you don't get to that point often in life, and I'm a living
testimony. And wish that we had maybe seized the moment right from the tap,
you know, and played it the way that we had from the beginning of the year.
That's what defined us. For some reason, I don't know that we believed that.
Now, notwithstanding Tennessee was big and all those other things, but they
killed us on the boards. And it was a matter of blocking out. We have played
against other big people, blocking out is an effort thing that anybody and
everybody can do.  
When you look at a team as big as that, you have to do it. And we just didn't.
We tried to jump with them. And we just didn't. And I'm sorry for the young
ladies because it would have been something that -- I know that this whole
experience is something that they will never forget. But I'll always know that
we are just that close. And I'm sorry for the great coaches who worked
extremely hard and did a great job. But I don't want to put such a damper on
it that it defines us and we're nothing.  
I think that just so much credit has to be given to the young ladies who came
from nothing to do so much, and basically stun everybody and everybody in the
world, to the point where people could actually believe that we might be able
to do some things. And I think that probably for the most part when we saw the
light at the end of the tunnel that we actually believed that too.  
But for some reason, maybe we read the headlines, maybe we realized that it
was a national championship game. We looked like we were a deer stuck in the
headlights. Simple as that. And by the time we rocked from that, just decided
to settle down, it was a bit much. And that's -- I'm sorry about that for the
players. And for us and so many other people. That they would have liked to
have shared that.  
But I still love my team and I think they did a wonderful job and I'm really
proud because they gave me a lot of confidence and young people who struggle,
I think that as a coach what you want to see is you want to see the
opportunity to mold young people's minds and the character and all those other
things. And this was no doubt the most rewarding year that I have had. So I
guess I'm good for awhile. I feel good about that.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes first.  
  
Q. E, did you feel that way? Did you feel like y'all kind of weren't
fighting from the start, that you were unsettled at the beginning?  
ESSENCE CARSON: I just believe that we did a horrible job on the boards and
from the beginning. And that's pretty much what she said. By the time we
thought about rebounding it was all over. It was too late. It was the
rebounding that really did us in.  
  
Q. Can you say what prompted that? Were y'all out of sorts? Do you think
that you finally realized, hey, we're on a big stage?  
ESSENCE CARSON: I looked at it as another game. I know that I tried to put as
much as I could into the team. I know Coach did. But I don't know. At this
point and with that kind of question I can only speak for myself.  
  
Q. For any of the players, I know it's tough to think about next year, but
you guys could be a pretty good team next year. Do you feel that this is
something that you can build on for next season?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Wow, once one season is over and another season begins it
starts all over. You can bring -- you can have the same team and not get
anything done. You can fall out and in the second round of the NCAA tournament
or you can try to repeat what you did the previous season. Like Florida.  
I mean, but this is the hardest stage to come back to for any team. Just
because of different competitors each and every season. Teams, just as much as
we grow, other teams that we go against grow. So it's definitely hard to tell
but I really do hope that we can build on this.  
  
Q. They seem to have two players attacking the ball every time you came
across mid-court. I guess do you think they were just trying to deny the
3-pointer as much when they saw what happened with LSU?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Wow, I don't know. They have always done that. Just watching
games. It was our job to handle the pressure. And we definitely didn't do a
good job of that tonight. Usually throughout the second half of the season we
did a great job with handling any type of pressure no matter what team that we
came up against. But tonight that definitely didn't happen. So it was a great
game plan from Coach Summitt and unfortunately it didn't work in our favor.  
THE MODERATOR: Great. Thank you for joining us. Take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about what was behind the decision to go to the zone in
the first half and to stick with it through the end of the game. What was
behind that?  
COACH STRINGER: No one was going to handle Candace Parker. So the only thing
we were trying to do was initially -- I won't second-guess myself on that.
Trust me when I tell you that. Because we already played Candace, the best
thing we could do was -- we really were playing her man as she was in the
perimeter position. The only person that could play her with that size and
challenge her shots was Essence Carson.  
But what was happening is once she came into the key area we did pick it up
and went to the zone. Now, maybe y'all didn't recognize what was happening.
But what we were trying to do really is to -- if you notice the first time she
went through the lane, you saw her not get to the box where she would have
liked to have been, that was because she was being switched off by Kia Vaughn.  
She's a great player. Personally, our team does not play zones very well. If
they did, I would be the happiest person in the world. We just don't seem to
have the mindset for that. But the time comes when you do need to be able to
play a zone. So the best thing we could do is in a short period of time is to
manufacture something that could be simple enough to -- it's a drill that we
do every day, so box and one. So we practice just because it's not a zone. But
what we were trying to do is basically pick up Parker. And if we hadn't she
would have eaten us up. Trust me when I tell you tell you that.  
At that, when she caught the ball she always looks to weak side blocks, the
reason why I was upset is I guess maybe six out of the first ten points was
that exact same thing. She caught the ball on the left block, she reversed
pivot and looked to hit that. We for some reason we were a step slow. I don't
know whether we were tired, excited about the game, we knew that hit. That's
what was so frustrating. We knew the hit that she had to take. And we did. We
in other instances, although obviously Tennessee's the biggest team, everybody
else knows that too. But unfortunately for us we did not put a serious body on
any of those players and really box them out hard. We did not do that.  
  
Q. How did you address the team after the game? What did you say to them in
the locker room?  
COACH STRINGER: I really don't know what I'm thinking right now. As I was
sharing with them, I appreciate as I do them, we went some places that nobody
thought we could go. I'm not in position because, quite frankly, I didn't
expect to lose the game. I really didn't. I was very calm. But what surprised
me is I just thought we were very quiet and that scared me a little bit. We
just seemed to be quiet. And I was thinking would somebody tell us that we
were playing a national championship game because as long as we have been
playing we haven't really focused on that. It's just like let's just go ahead
and do what we need to do.  
So I don't know what it was. We just seemed to be a step slow and very anxious
to get started. And maybe it was because we anticipated the size of Nicky
Anosike and Parker and the rest of these guys, we're five-nine and they're
six-three. Maybe that's what it is.  
But as Essence said, we still could have done a much better job in my mind. So
I'll talk to them more. I'm kind of numb as I have been really through this
whole thing. I don't know what I think right now.  
  
Q. Could you comment on how Candace played and were you satisfied with the
job you did? I mean, she -- I think she had 17 but didn't shoot great, 5 for
15, something like that.  
COACH STRINGER: Yeah, yeah. Think about that. Candace is capable of a 50-point
performance. You are a witnessing the best player in the world. There's nobody
that comes close to her. Think about what we're trying to do. We're trying to
play a quick, a good quick player in the perimeter, but when she goes back
down, Essence is not strong enough to handle her in the post position. So
that's when Kia plays her. If we had taken her out, Kia wouldn't have been
quick enough to play her outside. So we took a half of this and a half of
that. So it's almost like -- but I tell you what broke our backs, it wasn't
Candace Parker, I think we could have withstood that. The person that broke
our back was Bobbitt. I was upset because Epiphanny came out and we told her
that the girl has four-point range. What else do we need to say? She's
standing at three-point range and now you let people who are streak shooters
more get happy and be convinced that that's what they can do, that' what
happens. She came down with her hands down.  
Epiphanny has been suffering a cold. I had to talk to her. She's -- that's not
the reason. She seemed to be very sluggish today right from the beginning, so
I was very upset and she said, dang, I didn't know she did that, she knew
that. But she wasn't registering. And I think that's all part of the
atmosphere and everybody else was delayed in their reaction.  
  
Q. You kind of just touched on it the threes. How much did that kind of
break your back, those three threes in a row right there when you got it back
to I think like six points or something? She hit three threes in like a matter
of a minute and a half?  
COACH STRINGER: Yeah. You know what? Here is what's incredible about it. First
of all, she's a midget on the floor. So all you had to do was be relatively
close. So that's disturbing. But it might speak to the respect that she
commands also because she is so little and then so quick with the ball. So we
stayed off way too far. And in retrospect maybe I should have played Essence
on her. But no one would have thought that she was going to drop threes like
that. She is one of their better 3-point shooters, shooting players, but that
very clearly broke our back.  
But when I get visions of this game, I see Shannon Bobbitt knocking those
threes down and us really not coming out and playing her. Which is unusual
when you are playing for a national championship you play anything and
everything. If you see a gnat moving on the floor you try to stomp it out. You
don't second-guess, you react. This was kind of strange.  
But also the second opportunities there were a number of times that they get
three and four opportunities at the boards. You cannot win with that kind of
relentless, pursuit. And that's what they did. Now, for a smaller team, then
with the smaller teams, what they have to do is instead of trying to jump with
them you're not going to jump with them and we will never jump with them.
They're too big but what we should have done is stepped in and blocked out.  
That's about a will and a focus and at one time I was saying to the team and
at the time-out, if I told you how to win a national championship would you be
interested in listening? And can we all get on the same page? This is how we
must do this. And one of the things that we spoke to was just getting in body
contact. Strong physical contact to back them up. It was clear that the
officials weren't going to call anything and that's good, that's fine. I don't
have any complaints about what the officials were doing. But we needed to go
ahead and be physical and we weren't.  
And Pat did a great job. They played well. As Candace said, it was nice for
them to return. And I'll never know why. We just seemed to be a little just a
little off. And yes, we would like to come back next year, but it's not that
simple. So we know what it took to get here this time and I appreciate the
team and the support that we have gotten and if we end up here, that's good.
If we don't, wow, I won't be 25 more years, I'm going to tell you that, doing
it.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH STRINGER: Thank you.

_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement by the coach and then go
to questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH SUMMITT: Before our game started we talked about the importance of
playing defense. And rebounding the basketball. And I've always believed that
obviously rebounding wins championships. And today or tonight I think we saw
the effort on the board was significant in this win. And our defensive play
was obviously a difference maker. We have struggled to knock down shots. We
struggle because Rutgers has a fine defensive system. And it was probably two
of the best defensive teams in the country going at it.  
Obviously the boards really separated us out and it was great to see us
execute when we had to and be able to take some time off the clock and
obviously get to the free throw line and make free throws down the stretch.  
I am so proud of this basketball team. It's hard for me to put into words what
they have meant to me personally, to our coaching staff, to the university, to
our fans. They have just been one of the best groups because they decided they
wanted to be good in the off season and worked really hard and came together
and they have been very, very coachable and we have just grown as a team and
obviously our goal all along was to win a national championship. I just felt
like they were a team that did not want to be denied and they did what they
had to do to make it happen.  
THE MODERATOR: And questions for the student-athletes first.  
  
Q. Candace, you said all along that this was never a one-woman team and
sometimes we didn't believe you. But Nicky Anosike's 16 rebounds and Shannon's
four three-pointers and Auguste's play off the bench in the first half and all
those 3-points by Shannon, is this the best proof that perhaps Tennessee could
have given that this was a whole team effort?  
CANDACE PARKER: All year it's been pick your poison. I think if you take one
option away we have four others and I was just proud at how everybody came
together and fought and made corrections and adjustments and we just took it
to them.  
  
Q. Candace, can you just describe your feelings overall? Did they kind of
just run the gamut of everything from joy to relief, I would imagine too. I
mean, this is a big thing for you to accomplish in your career.  
CANDACE PARKER: This is something that we have wanted from day one. And we set
our minds to it and Nicky said on the way over here, it's weird because we
said take it one game at a time and we really did just that. Our focus was
just one game and then the next and the next and then we looked up and we were
in the national championship game. And I can't describe the feeling. It's
amazing. It's something that we have all wanted and I'm just happy that we did
it.  
  
Q. Candace, about the 12-minute mark in the first half you started really
calling for the ball. Did you see something and did you really want the ball
to go through the low post to work your offense a little bit more?  
CANDACE PARKER: Our philosophy is inside out. And I think that we did that.
And it opened up things for outside. I know when we did shoot the ball from
outside, Nicky did a great job of getting early position and rebounding and
things like that. So we really tried to run the ball through inside out,
whether it's paint points, whether it's us ducking in and posting, things like
that. So it worked out.  
  
Q. Candace, could you just specifically talk about their defense against
you. I guess they had Carson and pretty much playing you man-to-man at the
perimeter and maybe kind of switched off when you went in the post to kind of
a zone.  
CANDACE PARKER: We knew that Rutgers is a great defensive team so they were
going to throw a lot of different looks at us. Sometimes they came out and
doubled when we got the ball in the post. And sometimes they came out and
zone. So I think we did a good job of just moving the ball and just finding
the open person. Once we settled down.  
  
Q. Candace, will you be back next year and how difficult of a decision has
it been?  
CANDACE PARKER: Yes, I'll be back. I answered it. I've answered like -- I have
answered it a bunch. I'm coming back to Tennessee. I answered it like a lot,
so I guess I'll just say it one more time. I'll be back wearing orange next
year to hang the banner in 2007. So that's all I can say.  
  
Q. Nicky, was there something in particular that you saw in Rutgers, was
there a soft spot that allowed you to get position all these times and get all
these rebounds, especially on the offensive glass?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: No, I don't think there was anything like that. I just think
that Coach said before the game, offense sells tickets, defense wins games,
and rebounding wins championships. And that really just stuck with me
throughout the whole game. And I just tried to go out there and rebound to the
best of my ability.  
  
Q. Sidney, being the senior up here, speaking for you and Dom and Elizabeth
being seniors, what is it like going out on top like this?  
SIDNEY SPENCER: It's definitely a dream come true. Right now the feelings are
all surreal and I haven't really let it sink in, it hasn't sunk in yet. But, I
mean, it's just amazing and I'm so glad for this team and all the hard work
has really paid off.  
  
Q. Shannon, talk about those sequence earlier in the second half, seemed
like you hit a 3-pointer, got a couple plays that not just ignited your team
but yourself, you get a steal, couple of -- just a that whole little fury
there that really allowed you guys to separate and get some breathing room.  
SHANNON BOBBITT: First, I would like to say God is good and I just took what
the defense gave me. And I just wanted to leave everything out on the floor.
And that's what I did tonight.  
  
Q. Candace, can you tell me what was the first thing that went through your
mind when you realized you guys were going to win?  
CANDACE PARKER: Just I think that at first it was just excitement. Realizing
that we won. Obviously relief, obviously, because we ever done so -- we worked
so hard to get to the point where we're at right now. We're just really
excited that we're national champs.  
  
Q. Alexis, can you talk about just the commitment to offensive rebounding
you guys made tonight and could you sense a frustration on Rutgers' part
because of that?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: Well, I think Nicky said it best. When Coach said -- just
emphasized that rebounding wins championships. And we have to allow ourselves
to get second and third chances. We're not -- we hadn't shot the ball last
night too well and we didn't really expect things to change. And if you go in
like that, you're going to get the offensive rebound. Rebounding is not all
about the height or who can jump the highest, it's about the heart and hustle
and who wants the ball the most. And that's how we approached it.  
  
Q. Shannon, Coach Stringer was a little bit frustrated that Epiphanny Prince
didn't close down on you after you made one three and two threes, but she said
the girl was shooting from four-point range. You better get out there on her.
Were you surprised that you wound up with that much room after you started
getting hot?  
SHANNON BOBBITT: I just definitely took what the defense gave me. I felt like
I had enough room to release the ball. I stand five-foot-two, so I definitely
got to create space. And I felt like I had enough space to shoot the ball and
that's what I did.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. All five of you. Take questions for Coach now.  
  
Q. Rutgers prides itself on their man-to-man. Were you a little bit
surprised that they kind of fluctuated back and forth in the first half and
the second half primarily went zone?  
COACH SUMMITT: I expected to see some zone. I think that our basketball team
just with our offensive execution versus man has been pretty sharp. And I
really anticipated that we would see zone. We spend some significant minutes
on just working and rehearsing all of our zone action. And because I told had
our team even before the game, it won't surprise me at all if we see a lot of
zone.  
I think we'll see man in the initial stages, because with Candace Parker, in
the offensive schemes that we have for her, she's much more difficult to
defend if we're going against man. Because we can play her at all five
positions. And get some good screening action.  
In the zone, it's a little more difficult because they really packed it in.
The good part of that is that's when Shannon hit her threes. I thought that
was a key time in the game to really take some pressure off of us. And then
our defense stayed where it needed to stay. But I wasn't surprised we saw a
significant amount of zone.  
  
Q. Do you think it's possible that next year we could see Candace elevate
her game to a even higher level simply because she will have this whole
pressure of winning a national championship off her back, she will have that
relief and be able to play more freely even?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think Candace is very serious about her game. So I think she
will get better. I don't know that the pressure really affected Candace in a
negative way.  
I think she got a little frustrated today, but I think that had more to do
with Rutgers' defense. We had some possessions where we really couldn't get
her on the block. They did a nice job of playing from behind and forcing her
out somewhat. And she's accustomed to -- and that came more in the zone than
the man. And I think that probably caused her to face up more and fade a
little bit in her shooting.  
But Candace will be better next year because Candace is very serious about her
game. And she's constantly working on it. And that's why this team sat here
tonight and won the national championship is because of their dedication in
the off season. And I just preach that over and over and over last spring
before they went into their summer school that if you want to win a national
championship, you're going to do it in the offseason.  
  
Q. That said about Candace obviously not having a great offensive night,
what does it speak to her maturity that she found open people, she rebounded,
she did everything else despite her frustration?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think that's a big part of her maturity as a player. A year
ago she might have been more frustrated by not being able to be as efficient
on the court and having double-team action on her. Her composure this year is
-- has been significant to the success of our half court offense when teams
elect to double team her. It's like pick your poison if you're going to double
her. She will find players and get the ball into the open hands and it's very
unselfish in that regard.  
I think that that's been a big part of her maturity and not getting
frustrated. There have been some -- there were games early on that Candace got
very frustrated because she would not only get double-teamed, she would get
triple-teamed and people would really bring physical play against her. And she
just matured as we have gone along and our schedule has had a lot to do with
our success in post season.  
We played North Carolina and having played North Carolina, I think that helped
us on this stage. And obviously having played against LSU and the North
Carolina team, I thought about going into this game against Rutgers, who they
reminded me of from just a defensive standpoint and their ability, obviously,
to run the floor and make plays, and those two teams came to my mind.  
  
Q. You had said yesterday that you had been back so many times to this Final
Four and you hadn't had the best player. Is that what happened tonight? You
still had the best player, is that partially why you won?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think Candace Parker is the best player in the country. And
she makes everyone else better. And having Candace Parker, yes, you got a
Candace Parker, you got a chance to win a national championship. But it's not
because she's the only player on our team. It's because she makes everyone
else better. And this team takes a lot of pride individually and being a part
of the plan of attack and the success.  
Nicky Anosike has great pride in her game. Alexis. Alexis didn't shoot the
ball well in recent -- in our last three games in post season. But just her
leadership. We needed her leadership. Shannon got open looks because I really
think because they paid more attention to what was going on on the inside than
the outside.  
  
Q. Two things: One, Alberta Auguste in the first half and, two, while you
talk about all your sets and all the things you played, a couple one-on-one
plays, one by Alexis, and one by Sidney Spencer really there late went
baseline and just kind of pulled up. Can you kind of address those, because
those kind of separated you as well.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well first of all, Alberta Auguste had a great game. She's had
a great tournament for us. And she's -- I probably have been harder on her
than anyone else on this team. Other than Dominique Redding. It's been
Dominique and Alberta. As coaches I guess sometimes you just got the ones that
you think you have to stay on. But the reason I stayed on the two of them is I
knew that one of those two players had to be ready to contribute and
contribute in a very positive way for us in post-season. And Alberta was the
one that had the biggest impact. And I think that she played with a lot of
confidence and I kept telling her, I'm on you for a reason because I really
think that you can make a difference. And if a Alexis is in foul trouble or if
we want to go with our quickest lineup you're going to be on the floor. So
obviously she did a great job.  
  
Q. The steal and the --  
COACH SUMMITT: You know, I think that both those players understood that they
had to step up and contribute. Obviously they had not shot the ball
particularly well. But I thought that we got really aggressive when we had to
be aggressive offensively, and those were big plays for us.  
  
Q. From a personal standpoint, is this one a little sweeter or more special
because of the time that had past since the last one?  
COACH SUMMITT: Actually, no. And I'm just being honest with you. This is not
about winning No. 7. This is about this team winning their first. And I think
-- it's different for me now. And all I can tell you it was like another game.
When I came here today it wasn't like we were playing for a national
championship, it's like we went through our same routine. But my thought was,
and I told them, we sat in the center court and in Stokely in our hot gym that
we practice in, because we're not in our main arena. And I told them, I said,
I want this so much for you all and our staff is going to work hard for you.
My assistants have just been incredible in their preparation, their
motivation, and just how they have helped manage the game as it went along.  
But for me tonight it was all about helping this team. And that's why in our
game against North Carolina I said we're not leaving here without a national
championship because I really believe this team deserved to be national
champions. And so it's, you know, it's obviously great for the university, the
state of Tennessee, and our fans, and I'm proud, very proud.  
  
Q. Given the parity that's gone on in women's college basketball in the last
ten years, did you ever think it might be almost impossible to get that 7th
one?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I knew it was going to be difficult. And I think that
it's going to be difficult to win another championship. Because there is more
parity in the game. And certainly on a given night, I mean, if you're in the
ready to play, in post-season, you look at all of the upsets this year, and
certainly I recognize the fact that you just can't count on it every year by
any means. And we had some great runs at Tennessee. And obviously in '96, '97,
'98, I don't know that we'll see that in the women's game again.  
  
Q. When you pulled Bobbitt in the first half, didn't look like you were real
happy with her. What did you say and how did it help turn her around?  
COACH SUMMITT: I just wanted to get her focused on what we needed to do and I
wanted a little bit more structure and leadership from her offensively. And I
-- I think Shannon just really needed to kind of calm down. I think she was
pretty hyped up. And she did a great job from that time on. And she wants --
she aims to please and wants to do exactly what you want her to do.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. Congratulations.  
COACH SUMMITT: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2007

  

### [Sue Donohoe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15066)

### [Judy Southard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16910)

  
_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's get started. We welcome to the podium Sue Donohoe, vice
president for Division I Women's Basketball at the NCAA, as well as Judy
Southard, who is the chair of this year's Women's Basketball Committee
Division I. Let's go ahead and let you guys do an opening statement. Sue, if
you want to go first, followed by Judy, and then we'll take questions.  
SUE DONOHOE: Sure. First of all, just like to say thank you for all of you
coming out this morning. Certainly we have had a championship that has been
remarkable. A lot of great stories with a lot of great teams. A lot of
exciting play and so we're certainly pleased with the last three and a half
weeks and all that's happened in the game of women's basketball.  
I think certainly that we know that we have some challenges and I believe that
the Division I Women's Basketball Committee, the NCAA, is ready to address
those challenges and continue to grow our game. Because truly we have
something that's very valuable. We have got student-athletes that play at the
highest level. That compete on the floor. That are excellent student-athletes
and great role models. So it's our commitment to continue to grow the game
both at the championship level and at the institutional level and at the
conference level.  
I'll let Judy make a few comments and then we look forward to your questions
and dialog.  
JUDY SOUTHARD: Thank you. And some of this will to some degree echo what Sue
just said. I had an opportunity to visit with the Coach's Association this
morning and I shared some of the same comments with them so I'm going to kind
of give some opening remarks and certainly we'll take your questions. We
appreciate the opportunity of course to be here and first thing that I would
like to do is certainly congratulate the Cleveland folks for what a great job
they have done, the Greater Cleveland Sports Commission, the organizing
committee, the Mid-American Conference, as well as Cleveland State University
of course served as our host institution. All of the folks at the Quicken
Arena, these are only a few of the people who have helped make this truly a
memorable championship. And I think we're all looking forward to the
championship game tomorrow night.  
With that said, let me just kind of turn to what we're really here about and
that's to talk about women's basketball and our championship. And I think I
can say that in general we're pleased with the competitive environment of our
championship. As Sue said, we have some very solid performances by teams that
you would expect solid performances from and then of course we had the
unexpected strong performances by some teams that gave us a exceptional ride
through somewhat of a dramatic and a magical tour of the bracket this year.
There was some great stories to be had with some of the games that we saw this
year and all in all I think that it's been a great championship event from
start to finish.  
I would like to say that we understand that we're going to have some questions
about attendance and I would first want you to know that our attendance
actually increased by 25,000 fans at our first and second round sites this
year. As compared to the attendance figures for last year.  
Now we are concerned of course with the fact that the attendance dropped some
at the Regional level. We have had to take a step back though and realize a
little bit about of what happened at the Regional level. And we're trying to
some degree evaluate what the elimination of Duke Texas A & M and Stanford may
have meant to the attendance figures at Greensboro, Dallas, and Fresno. And of
course what might have been if those teams had in fact advanced. But we do
know that we have got a lot of challenges ahead of us. We certainly are
working hard as a committee and as a group to do the best we can to grow our
game and to try to do a better job of cultivating the casual fan and finding
or cultivating those folks who will be women's basketball fans. Not just fans
of a certain program. And I think probably therein lies one of the of the
greatest differences between the men's and women's game right now is that we
do have basketball fans on the men's side, whereas on the women's side we tend
to still have more fans of the specific institutions as opposed to fans of our
game.  
This is the 15th consecutive year that we have had a sell out. And we have
sold out 16 out of the 26 years that we have hosted this championship. And
overall of the 26 year history of the event we have averaged 5,000 people per
session. Which we feel like is certainly not a figure we want to stay
stagnant, but we do feel like it's a impressive figure at this point in time
in our history.  
The other thing that we know is a issue for some of you and it is an issue for
our coaches and our fans are our TV times start times, our game order. And we
certainly expect to have some questions about that and we'll be happy to
answer those. I would like to tell you that the NCAA national office the
Division I women's basketball and ESPN all collaborate to try to determine the
game times and the game orders for all rounds of our championship. And
obviously there is a careful balance and strategy at that that we must strike
in doing that. We are, of course, trying as diligently as we can to avoid as
many head to head conflicts with men's basketball as we possible can. And that
certainly creates a lot of challenges for us. But we are, we do spend a lot of
time on that. And incidentally, this past year we only had three situations in
which the home team played a start time or had a start time after nine o'clock
p.m. on their home court and that was at Pittsburgh and in the first round and
then at Connecticut in both the first round and second round. That 9: 30
window and trust me, I understand the late window, because I was in Dayton for
the regionals there and then stayed up until 1: 30 in the morning to watch LSU
play before I got up at 4 to catch a plane the next place I was going. So I
certainly understand as a fan of the game what the TV windows are doing to it
us and we certainly know that we have got some challenges there and we're
going to take plenty of time to study that a and work on that. At this time
I'll just open the floor for questions and Sue, if you'll help me and jump in
we'll both take questions.  
THE MODERATOR: Let's open it up for questions.  
  
Q. You had mentioned that you met with the coaches association. We have
within been hearing from several coaches who are concerned about what the
attendance has been. What did they say to you and did they have any
suggestions for the problems with attendance?  
JUDY SOUTHARD: We met with them this morning at 8:30 the Coaches Association,
and we certainly had a representative group there. We had some people there
that certainly are very interested. I will tell you though we did not get a
lot of questions from them which did surprise us very much. We pretty much, I
pretty much went over the same type of things that I just finished going over
with you. We had a few questions from the floor from them as it related to
some of the issues regarding the selection seeding or bracketing process, but
honestly and truly we didn't really get a question about that from them.  
SUE DONOHOE: If I could add to that, one thing as we were meeting with the
coaches this morning we told them that we really wanted to have some good open
dialog. And they did ask a question to us about if the committee would
consider selecting eight cities throughout the country that are strong hot
beds of women's basketball, and taking the first and second rounds into those
cities and keeping them therefore several years to try and build some equity
into the market.  
And certainly I think that we're very much interested in doing that. We are
doing that at the Regional round level. Greensboro was a pilot test for us. We
have pilot tested out at Stanford. We had Greensboro this year as a Regional
there going to serve as a Regional site for us next year and hopes to building
that equity in that, in and building women's basketball NCAA women's
basketball in that market. Same thing at Stanford we're piloting that program.
So that's something certainly that the coaches brought to the table this
morning that I think we would be very interested in having further discussions
about.  
  
Q. For either of you, can you talk about what ESPN is doing tomorrow with
that total coverage where all its not network is going to have something on it
and do you think that maybe that's going to create a little bit more interest
for the game?  
SUE DONOHOE: I think it's a great sign of commitment by ESPN. Certainly this
is the first and only ever women's sporting event that they have done the full
circle coverage on. And to, if you had the chance to watch the Miami-Florida
State football game, and look at the different platforms that they used and
the way that they activated those platforms, it was great coverage for that
football game. And again, this is the first time they have done this for a
women's sporting event. So that shows the commitment that ESPN has to try and
promote market and showcase this championship. And we're very fortunate that
they have elected to do that. It has brought in a lot of interest from a lot
of different areas and we're excited to see it put into place tomorrow night.
We think it's a great initiative for us and we're appreciative of ESPN
bringing it and making it available to us.  
  
Q. You do have that all the coverage from ESPN you have now on the crawl it
says NCAA M, and W, as opposed to basketball and then well the little women
over here, so that's what they changed.  
SUE DONOHOE: That did not go unnoticed.  
  
Q. There are lots of things, Title IX clearly is here to stay so it's not
desire. But so you get all this, you get this platform, all the games on ESPN,
here's your big stage, and any concern at all about how it looked last night
50 turnovers in the second game, lowest score LSU 35 points by nine points the
lowest total score ever in a women's Final Four. I asked Pat and Vivian and
they both said, well, it's defense and the game and blah, blah, blah, I
understand all that, any concern though, this is your big showcase and it
looked pretty kind of ragged out there.  
JUDY SOUTHARD: Well that's a tough question. I don't want to sound trite when
I say this, but it is what it is. We don't have anyway to balance guessing or
trying to know in advance. We don't have the crystal ball here that's going to
really tell us. Those of us who love basketball and who know basketball and
have been involved in it a long time, there are things that you can find in
those games that were really fun to see. I just thought the Rutgers kids
absolutely shot the lights out and it just, if you weren't -- I was sitting
there dying all night. Obviously, because I'm from LSU, but just as a person
who loves basketball, to watch what those kids did from the 3-point line and
the way their crowd just rows to the atmosphere in the Arena it was electric
during that game, even though it was a, you know, not a real pretty game in
some regards. But I think that we can find great things in our game and I
probably haven't answered that question for you but as I said it really is
what it is. There's really not a whole lot -- we can't predict how that's
going to be from year to year and certainly we would love for everything to be
perfect from both sides, and a down to the wire, 72-71 final. But I don't
think you can anticipate that and I would just simply say that we, our game is
growing and it's getting better and better and I think if nothing else the
quality of the student-athletes was certainly on center stage last night
because there was some great young women athletes out there competing.  
  
Q. The fan base and even some of the game's most prominent coaches including
Coach Summitt and Coach Hatchell we did this too soon in terms of
predetermined eight sites. And so people keep saying is there any chance of
bringing back 16 home sites. Can we, should we just put that to rest that it's
never going to happen or is there any chance in the future that might happen
if the attendance doesn't pick up in the next few years?  
JUDY SOUTHARD: I don't think I would -- I would never say never. Because I
think that part of our mission as a committee and the mission of the staff at
the NCAA that works with women's basketball is to do everything within our
power to try to find the best solutions to what we need to do to grow our game
and make our game attractive to the public and to again as I said a few
moments ago, to grow the fan base to a level where people enjoy watching
women's basketball whether it's Duke playing North Carolina, Tennessee playing
LSU or Stanford playing Connecticut.  
So I don't think we would ever say never. Because we are in dialog every time
we sit down as a group to meet we're in dialog about what do we need to do? We
are in the business of wanting to accept any and all creative ideas for what
we can do better for our game. And I told the coaches that this morning. I
said just come to us with whatever idea you have. It may seem like it's off
the charts, but we will sit down and we will talk about it. Because what we
want to do is and it's a trite, I said it over and over, we want to grow our
game. I think we have to be very careful that we don't lose sight of where we
are in our history. And I used this analogy before, you got to crawl before
you walk. You got to walk before you run. And you got to run before you can
make the track team and run the 50 yard sprint. And if you want to go back and
compare our game to the men's game, we are still somewhat in our youthful
stage. And I think that what has happened to our game in the last ten years
and everything that surrounds our game is absolutely tremendous. But we are
still a very young sport by all measures from an historical perspective of
where we would compare with our men's counter part.  
SUE DONOHOE: I would add to that, I think in -- and we shared this with our
coaches did -- and certainly with our membership. Folks are not going to wake
up on Tuesday morning after Selection Monday and say, you know what, I'm going
to become a women's basketball fan today. That's a developmental process. And
it's got to start at the grass roots level. It's got to extend into the
conference level and then certainly at the championship level. I give a lot of
credit to our host sites they work extraordinarily hard for about 18 months to
prepare to market and prepare for the championship rounds. I think that we
have got to continue to work at that institutional level to develop that fan
base so that when a institution has the opportunity to participate in the
championship that fan base is there and that fan base will travel with them.  
To talk a little bit about a commitment that we have made from a NCAA
standpoint, as many of you know Doctor Miles Brand pulled together a
discussion group a ad hoc committee, if you would, of the brightest and best
minds of women's basketball. We brought coaches to the table, we brought media
representatives to the table, we brought administrators to the table to talk
about what are for or five real key initiatives that we can look at that would
possible help us to grow the game. And one of the initiatives that remains on
the table that we feel confident that we'll put into place over the next
months is a matching grant program. That we can work with our conferences and
our institutions to grow that fan base at that grass roots level. Because we
know if we grow at the grass roots level we grow at the championship level and
vice versa. And that's got to be a collaborative effort for all of us in the
women's basketball community. Certainly you as media representatives do a
great job of helping us promote the game, but as we continue to grow, it's
going to be a effort for all of us all the stake holders in the game.  
JUDY SOUTHARD: Let me say one more thing about that. The only reason I think
that, not the only reason, one of the reasons I think that we're so intent to
continue to try what we're doing is because we feel like it's one of the only
ways that we can grow our new fan base. I'm not sure that it would serve our
game well to just be isolating ourselves to the five or six communities in the
country that have demonstrated their support for the game because then we're
not really spreading ourselves out and exposing our game to potentially new
fans. So there may be a delicate balance in there and we may have to look and
find that balance, but certainly again repeating what I said a moment ago, I
think we're open to any and all creative solutions or suggestions for ways to
solve our problem.  
  
Q. How long are you locked into this format and could you possible consider
moving the dates to not conflict with the men's tournament, go earlier or go
later?  
SUE DONOHOE: That's another initiative that remains on the table with this
discussion group. There are a lot of pieces to that puzzle. But I think that
from a women's basketball community I think it's worthy of consideration and
worthy of good thoughtful discussion. Right now for our first and second
rounds regionals, we are named through 2009, 2010. For the women's Final Four
we're named for 2011. Where we are with that discussion and dialog, certainly
the discussion group has spent a great deal of time discussing it. We have
sent information out to our conferences asking contractually what are your
obligations right now, how far are you out, what is the format of your
tournament, men's and women's together, men's and women's in the same city,
playing at the same time in different venues. So we asked all those questions.
We compiled the responses to those questions and the discussion group will
gather again here in the next several weeks via tele-conference to say, here's
what we have learned, here's what the status is of our conferences and their
conference championships, now what other information do we want to gather and
what feedback do we need to receive? The other piece that we still have to do
from our championship perspective is to talk with our first and second round
Regional hosts, Final Four hosts for the next years to say, if, if we were to
make this kind of change, what is your availability, what's the hotel
availability, so those are a lot of pieces that we need to get a lot of
answers to. The other things that are really critical about this decision
aside from is this the thing that will help us grow the game give us some
opportunities from for us to visit with ESPN about some television windows and
work on the end venue attendance the other pieces that we have to look at a
decision like this is going to impact the timing of conference championships,
it's going to impact the timing of practice dates first practice date it's
going to impact the first playing date. It's also going to impact the
recruiting calendar. So it's not a very simplistic evaluation of the issue,
it's pretty complex. But I would say this: I think every one believes that
it's very much worthy of the discussion and consideration.  
  
Q. Culture and all these issues, since we're on that topic, the use of the
adjective lady, they don't of course call them the Gentleman Vols, and it's
2007. And with all due respect to the Regional aspect and the branding, Vivian
just said you know let's drop the lady and play ball. Would there be any
thought at all, especially in light of what's gone on with mascots, of having
the NCAA say, this is 2007 and let's just be Volunteers or Wildcats or
whatever and drop the lady thing.  
SUE DONOHOE: I would say this: I think certainly Tennessee and what they have
done with their branding of their women's program, it certainly is a very,
very strong brand. There's no doubt about that. I think that through our
governing structure and membership if there was some push from our membership
up to the national office to consider that and have any kind of discussion
through our committee structure, certainly that would be the appropriate way
that it would come to us so it would have to be something certainly that would
be driven from our membership up to be activated and discussed on a national
platform.  
  
Q. Some coaches have made the case that because of ticket prices and TV
times you're driving away women's basketball's core audience senior citizens
and families with young children. What are your thoughts on that?  
JUDY SOUTHARD: Not sure I disagree with that. And again as I said, we have got
a tremendous television partner with ESPN. I think the same coaches who are
concerned about that would also tell you in the next breath that TV exposure
is extremely important to them as they build their programs, market their
programs and of course it's a very valuable recruiting tool for them.  
So again, I think that the challenge lies with us working very closely in
concert with our partners from ESPN. There's a unique partnership there
because the ESPN viewing demographics are obviously quite different and I
don't think I'm off base when I say this, are quite different from what we
characteristically consider the demographics of our women's basketball fans to
be. And again it's a delicate balance and it's a balance that we have to work
very hard to try to achieve. We are seeing some meeting of the minds there. We
have in recent years this past year particularly have worked closely with ESPN
on reducing the number of late windows. We had late -- we had less late
windows this year than we had in previous years. We certainly -- and they're
very interested in listening to us and they're very interested in trying to
work with us. At the same time keeping in mind that ESPN is a business, that
they have to make decisions that are in the best interests of what they have
invested in our game also. So I know I'm -- I -- it may sound like double
talk, but again it is what it is. It's a delicate balance that we are
continuing to work closely with ESPN in trying to come to grips with that
concern.  
  
Q. You talk about growing the women's game and when you look at the LSU
situation, with Pokey Chatman and the Penn State situation with Coach
Portland, is there anything that's good that comes out of that for the
coverage of women's basketball because it's been covered so much even though
they're negative stories?  
SUE DONOHOE: I think certainly in every sport and in every probably in every
walk of life there's things that can have aim pact on our sport. I think that
it's incumbent upon the stake holders of women's basketball to determine how
do we turn something that might be a negative into a positive. And how do we
learn, how do we educate from experiences and situations that might arise. I
think that the WBCA made a very, very strong statement on their web site about
the role of coaches as mentors and role models. And I think they feel very,
very strongly about that. So as a women's basketball community, I think
certainly the situations that might occur whether it's on the Penn State
campus or LSU campus are best left to be handled by those institutions and
their administrators. But then those of us that are in the women's basketball
community must find ways to continue to educate, to continue to help our young
professionals learn and grow and serve in the capacity and the role that they
should.  
THE MODERATOR: Sue and Judy, thank you very much.

_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with a opening statement from Coach Summitt and
then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH SUMMITT: I'll be very quick. Obviously delighted to be working today. It
was an incredible finish for us. I was asked if we had been in a situation
like that, and it was -- it seemed a little ironic that the '98 team in order
to get to the Final Four in Kansas City we were down with 7:19 going, 7
minutes 19 seconds, we were down 12. And against North Carolina.  
So it's hard to come back against a team like that that is playing the way
they were playing. But really proud of our basketball team and their composure
and execution to finish out that game. So we're delighted to be here and
preparing to play against a great Rutgers team.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For Nicky Anosike, seems appropriate that two of the best defensive teams
are playing for the title tomorrow night. Can you talk a little bit about
defense and why it matters so much at this time of year?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: Coach always says defense wins games, and I think it's evident
that the two best defensive teams are the in championship game. Especially
Rutgers, who, like Vivian said, didn't even expect to be here, but their
defense carried them through. So I think it only makes sense that the two of
us are in the championship game.  
  
Q. Candace, Rutgers obviously knows the challenge that you present them, but
can you talk about what you think they're going to do that will challenge
you?  
CANDACE PARKER: Rutgers is a great defensive team. Hadn't really had the
opportunity to really focus and see the different looks that they have done
against their different opponents. I got to see briefly on the highlights of
the LSU game on how they collapsed on Sylvia Fowles and really wanted to make
other people beat them.  
I think it's just us, we played one of the toughest schedules in the country
and we have seen a lot of different looks, so I think it's just coming out and
playing Tennessee basketball is what's going to help us in that game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Candace, Nicky Anosike was saying last night that she considers herself
somebody that's always going to have your back in games. Just want to know,
what is it like to know that you have that kind of support that you don't
always have to be the show every single minute you're on the court?  
CANDACE PARKER: I don't feel like I ever felt like that, to be honest with
you. Because at Tennessee we're different people who are able to step up at
different times. And it may not always be on the offensive end. I know Nicky
was huge for us last night, playing 40 minutes and just having that warrior
mentality and always leading by example. And as well as Alexis and Sidney as
well, and Shannon coming in and really frustrating the point guard and
creating trouble.  
So I think that it's really good for me to know that I have a lot of people
that have my back. And I'll have their back as well.  
  
Q. Nicky, can you talk a little bit about you picked up two pretty quick
fouls, but you never looked to the bench and of course Coach never even took
you out, which she did with several other players. Can you kind of -- is that
normal? She had mentioned afterwards something about that.  
NICKY ANOSIKE: No, it's definitely different that she left me in with two
fouls. But I was focused on the game and I was really set on not getting into
foul trouble and not getting that third foul. I think she just trusted me and
I trusted myself not to get that third. And I just wanted to do it for my
team. I think I'm a lot smarter than I used to be.  
  
Q. Alexis, this is now the third year in a row that you'll see Rutgers and I
guess try to end their season. What's different about this team from the
previous two?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: I think they have a lot more offensive weapons as a whole
this year than the previous two. Cappie led their team the first two times
that I played them in the tournament and I don't think that Matee's game was
as developed then as it is now. And Essence has elevated her game as well. So
it's like they're having a more balanced attack.  
  
Q. Why is that so dangerous?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: Well, obviously it's hard to stop five or four, even four
people from scoring. It's easier to concentrate on one or two, but when you
have a balanced scoring option it's a lot harder to continue to get great
stops.  
  
Q. Nicky, at one point last night it looked like Shannon was just screaming
at you and you had a kind of quizzical look on your face. Is that -- she
obviously is an emotional player, but is she always that emotional and does it
amuse you or do you have to calm her down sometimes?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: We all yell at each other. Nothing different. I yell at
Candace, she yells back. Alexis yells at me. I might yell back. We just yell
at each other. But we all know that we have the same goal and we're just here
to help each other. So I might have looked confused when she was yelling at
me, but I love her to death and I'm going to listen to what she has to say,
and I hope she will listen to what I have to say also.  
  
Q. Shannon, what can you tell us about Epiphanny. How is she different from
high school? Are you excited to go up against her or pretty sure you got her
number, since you're older?  
SHANNON BOBBITT: Oh, it's definitely going to be a great game to watch. And
Epiphanny is a great player. I'm just going to respect all of them and not
fear any of them.  
But it's been great playing with her in high school and I'm sure she's gotten
better and smarter. But we definitely are going to stay tuned on all of them
and play our hardest and leave everything out on the hardwood.  
  
Q. Did she try to convince you to come to Rutgers with her?  
SHANNON BOBBITT: Yes, she has. But I had to follow my heart and do what's best
for my career.  
  
Q. Candace, you guys haven't won a -- Tennessee hasn't won a national title
since 1998. What would it mean not only for the team but for you in particular
to win a national title for your legacy, not only at the school but in the
women's game.  
CANDACE PARKER: Well, I think that it would be huge for us. That's something
that we came to Tennessee to do, to win a national championship. And I
remember in the locker room yesterday earlier in the season some members of
the '87 team came back. I didn't know what year it was. '87 team came back.
And the first championship team. And they were sharing their stories and
different things like that. We were just like, In 20 years we want to be able
to come back and have our banner in the rafters and be able to celebrate and
tell famous Pat stories and things like that. Roll her in in a wheelchair.  
(Laughter.)  
COACH SUMMITT: That was my suggestion. I just want to be there.  
CANDACE PARKER: She will be there.  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: Yes, she will.  
  
Q. Sidney, you're the only senior up there, can you talk a little bit about
how special it is to get back to this game? You were there as a freshman and
now you're back as a senior.  
SIDNEY SPENCER: Just to be able to contend and play in a national championship
game as a senior it's a dream come true, and I wouldn't want to do it with any
other players than the ones we have on this team. And I think that this team
has worked extremely hard in the summer, fall and up to now and just getting
better and just being committed to one another. So it's definitely a dream
come true.  
  
Q. For any of the players up there, do you ever think about the history of
the game with the two coaches that are in this game, Coach Stringer and Pat
Summitt, and what it means to have these two coaches going up against each
other for like the future of women's basketball?  
CANDACE PARKER: I get to answer it. It's -- our game has grown a lot. And it
has to do with the two coaches that are going to be facing each other in
tomorrow's game.  
Coach Summitt and Vivian Stringer, they have meant a lot to women's basketball
and its growth. And it wouldn't -- the game wouldn't be where it is at right
now without those two women. So it's just a great thing and we're really
excited and I know Coach Summitt and Coach Stringer are very good friends, so
it just makes it all better.  
  
Q. For any of the players. Can you talk about the aura that is Tennessee
women's basketball and do you feel like not necessarily you have a advantage
with that, but it kind of is tough playing against Tennessee because who you
guys are and the tradition and everything like that.  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: I think it's not as tough as it used to be because the
parity in women's basketball game has grown so much that people don't really
fear Tennessee just because you have Tennessee written on your chest. But at
the same time it is a advantage to play for a school such as Tennessee where
you have great fan support which helps us and makes it difficult for our
opponents in post-season. But I don't think it makes it any harder to play us
now.  
  
Q. What was the most impressive thing you saw Rutgers do yesterday?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: I think how they stopped Sylvia. A lot of teams haven't been
able to do that. Even as good of a defensive team as we are, we still didn't
hold her to five. They did. So I think that's just a tribute to how committed
they are to defense and how great of a defensive team they are. But that was
the most impressive thing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you to all five of you. We're going to take questions now
for the coach.  
  
Q. Do you see Shannon as being kind of a missing piece of the puzzle and how
many junior college players have you ever had? I assume it's very few.  
COACH SUMMITT: First part of your question, Shannon has really been terrific
as a competitor, as a teammate, and she has been one of the most coachable
point guards in my career. I think she came in just wanting to learn the
system, wanting to do things the right way.  
I've just really -- I've just watched her day-to-day develop into a very heady
point guard and she obviously is a very fierce competitor. She came out of the
junior college ranks having to score a lot for herself and to create for her
own game. But what she's been able to do is to create for others on our
basketball team. Which has made us a much better not only transition team but
I think specifically in the half court game.  
I've had three junior college players. Obviously Alberta Auguste and Shannon
Bobbitt came in together. The only other junior college player I had was
Zandra Montgomery. And Zandra was from Tennessee. And actually when she came
to play for me she was 26 and if my memory serves me right, I was 26 also. So
it has just been a situation where we haven't needed to do that, we had some
transfers which obviously triggered we got to have more quickness and speed in
the back court and we definitely need a point guard because I think Alexis
benefits and we benefit as a team when she can go the off guard.  
  
Q. How much is having won six times before since 1998 helped you through the
last nine years and when Vivian -- and not having won for nine now. And when
Vivian says that she just wants to know what it feels like ones, can you
imagine that void of never having won?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, we were in seven Final Fours and four championship games
before we cut down nets. So it's not like Tennessee just won championships and
it was easy. It is one of the hardest things to do in sports.  
After we won six and in looking now at not having won, I think that is a
reflection of the parity. If you just look at what we are seeing in women's
basketball in terms of the caliber of play and the caliber of go-to players
and just how our game has grown, the landscape has changed. And we have better
post play, we -- you had to think back when -- somebody asked me this the
other day, who was the best post player we faced, it was Lucia Harris, and
that was back in the late '70s. So the game has now evolved into more of a
power game as well as outside shooting, the 3-point shot has been great.  
But I certainly will tell you that winning a championship is special for any
team and any coach, but I don't think it necessarily defines that you are
better than anyone else. You just usually it means you have better players.  
  
Q. Can you just -- when Nicky says that she's a lot smarter than she used to
be, can you just sort of trace for those of us who are ignorant just a little
bit of the evolution of her game over the last couple years?  
COACH SUMMITT: Nicky Anosike is very bright young woman. She's the type of
person that when you challenge her, whether it's to work on her low post game,
which she has done, this past summer she devoted the majority of her skill
preparation to her face-up game. I think that you have to really credit her
because whatever she wants to do -- I mean, academically she's one of the best
students I've ever had in the program. She's very serious about her academics,
very serious about her game.  
I think now her composure, she used to get -- she picked up two, three fouls,
I couldn't get her out fast enough. Why I left her in last night is because of
her maturity and her composure and I knew she knew when Candace went out that
she had to keep herself on the floor. And that's where her basketball IQ came
into play. I just felt like she would do what she needed to do to help this
team and to keep herself on the court so we would be able to at least hold our
own. We just wanted to hold our own by half-time.  
  
Q. Back on that evolution of the game theme, you were in the first NCAA
Final Four. How was it different then than it is now?  
COACH SUMMITT: When we went to the first NCAA championships, I thought that
the people involved, the players probably didn't realize, the coaches
realized, I'm not sure the fans realized, that going under or being taken
under the umbrella of the NCAA was the best thing that ever happened to our
game.  
We got instant credibility, exposure, and respect for our game. That to me was
just the very beginning of what you see now in women's basketball. And without
the NCAA, I mean, we would not have made the great strides at a relatively
fast pace. It seemed a little slow at times, but just having that opportunity
for the national championships to be on national TV and for our players to be
seen and our coaches to have a chance to really help showcase the game with
the help of the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the genesis of your friendship with Coach Stringer and
having knowing what she's gone through personally over the years, what she's
put into this through the decades, how difficult it's been to beat her in
decisive moments, truly decisive moments in the tournament and what it might
be like to have to do it again tomorrow night.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, Vivian is someone that I consider a great friend first, a
colleague next.  
When obviously Vivian was at Iowa we visited for a long time. I remember she
called me one night -- Vivian can talk. And I don't mean for a few minutes. I
think that we were on the phone for like three, three and a half hours. And it
was in the wee hours of the morning. And she was talking about making the
decision whether to leave Iowa.  
I just know when she made that move, it took a lot of courage. But what she's
been able to do at different programs, it just speaks volumes for who she is.
It doesn't matter. You could take Vivian and put her in three more programs
and in the next 15 years, and she would be successful.  
She has great passion. And I think that the woman has handled adversity better
than anyone else I know in this profession. And just the personal adversity
that she's faced, and I know at times even professionally. And she just keeps
the student-athletes first. She's obviously given back to this game. A lot of
coaches give back to this game, but Vivian certainly has.  
I'm excited for her. I really am excited for her. And as I go into this game,
I just -- it has to be Tennessee and Rutgers, not Pat and Vivian. We're going
to work hard for our teams, but the players are the ones that will have to lay
it all on the line.  
And obviously I remember when she lost her husband and we played them in Iowa
as a No. 1 seed there. And the building was absolutely packed and it was --
the volume was something that I haven't probably heard before or since.  
Her team obviously advanced to the Final Four, and I just remember that
moment. And I think the people were there because of Vivian and what she had
meant to the program and to the community. And she's a special lady. She's had
tough times, but let me tell you, she's a tough lady. And she's also a great
person.  
  
Q. With all the attention that Candace gets, how do you feel the other girls
on the team, particularly the starters, have handled that? And also could you
give us maybe a couple of off-the-court anecdotes about Candace that kind of
describe her personality and what she's like as a person.  
COACH SUMMITT: It's interesting. A year ago I think that we probably did not
have the kind of chemistry that we have now. Because we had a lot of high-
profile players coming in. And then here comes Candace Parker back from her
injury and I'm not sure that they were committed as a team to really accepting
what each person could bring. Candace included. And we just didn't have good
team chemistry.  
Losing last year to North Carolina was a defining moment for this team and all
the players that were returning. Because I think they realized how much they
needed each other. And then in the off season they went to work. And I think
that they respected Candace at a different level because Candace has changed
her work ethic.  
They talked about calling each other out. After the SEC game in which Candace
only had four points in the tournament and we had our meeting, I mean they
just spoke their mind. And they just said to Candace, and I said to Candace,
if you pull this in post-season we lose, we can't win. And the big thing that
Nicky challenged her to do was to be a defensive player. She said, You have
got to step up and be a defensive player.  
So I think that the fact that they hold each other accountable because they
respect each other, they respect the fact that every one worked on their game
in the off season.  
It's just a great thing to see them have the maturity and obviously the
confidence and the communication across the board as a team. And, I don't
know, with Candace off the court -- Candace, I think she is the type of player
she doesn't necessarily want attention. And I think she likes just being with
them and hanging out and having fun and taking the spot light and turning it
off. That's pretty much how this team has been.  
  
Q. Can you remember when you first met Coach Stringer? Was it at the first
Final Four in '82? And how do two people from two different corners of the
earth and two different types of programs develop a friendship like that?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think it was through our USA basketball. We had the sports
festival and all that. And we served on a committee with USA basketball. I
know we went out to -- I think it was actually the University of Illinois and
we roomed together on that trip. And that's when I really got to know her and
we were there to select a team from that particular area of the best young
players in the game to play in the sports festival. If my memory serves me
correct. And that's when I first really got to know Vivian and I spent time
with her.  
We just stayed in touch. It was a lot just through the USA basketball
experiences at that particular time.  
  
Q. A year ago Coach Stringer told us that one of the most encouraging things
that happened after losing in the Big East tournament was your phone call. She
talked to us about how this season was her bleakest and she expected the
worst. Have y'all talked a lot this season? When was the last time you talked?
And did she really say to you, What am I going to do with these freshmen?  
COACH SUMMITT: No, we didn't talk early on. But we talked -- I guess it was
right after the Big East tournament and right after the SEC's. And it's never
a short conversation, as I said.  
(Laughter.) And when she called me, Girl, what are you doing? And I thought,
well, hopefully nothing for the next hour and a half but talk to you.  
(Laughter.) You know. But we had a great time and we just kind of caught up.
And she was talking about her team and now I tried to call her after both her
big wins and I called even before the final horn sounded and her voice mail
was full both times. So I told my assistant, Nikki Caldwell, who is great
friends with Jolette Law, I said, Tell Jolette to tell her congratulations,
and I at least tried to call. But she's got a lot of people, obviously, that
have her phone number.  
  
Q. When you spoke to her after the Big East tournament, did she express
pride? Did she saying, My team's going to do something?  
COACH SUMMITT: She was excited. Just unbelievable. Unbelievable. Couldn't
believe it. You wouldn't believe what they were like, and even she said at the
Salute dinner she sent all her assistants to go out to recruit. She said, Go
get me some players, these people can't play. And obviously they must have
heard her.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the drought between championships, has it motivated
you, frustrated you, and are you hungrier now like back when you were for your
first title or are is it different?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think it's really different for me. Obviously at Tennessee we
have a goal every year of winning the SEC championship. And winning a national
championship. And the fact that we hadn't won one since '98, you know, the one
thing that I just tried to evaluate is why.  
I think you have to have -- in order to win a national championship, I think
you have to have a go-to player. And that's -- that's something that we didn't
always consistently have. We had balance and we have won championships with
balanced teams. But I do think it makes a difference when you have someone
that can step up and make the big plays and make everyone else better on the
floor.  
That's what Chamique Holdsclaw did. She's one of the best I ever coached at
that, but that's what Bridgette Gordon did. I went to four Final Fours with
her and we tested her heart in every game. She made big plays for us. And we
won two championships while she was there.  
For me, it's not about me feeling pressure, I just want to help this team. I
just want to help every student-athlete that chooses to come to Tennessee, I
think they come therefore a reason. And I think they come there believing that
they will have a chance to win a championship. And I feel like my job now is
to be the best leader and the best motivator and put together the best staff,
which my staff's just been incredible, to try and help these young women win.
Because that's why they came to Tennessee.  
Candace Parker could have gone anywhere in the country, so could Alexis
Hornbuckle, Nicky Anosike. We won recruiting battles because they felt like
they would have a great chance to win at Tennessee. And because of the great
fan support and the environment that they would play in.  
  
Q. Just to get back to Shannon, she really hasn't been the typical Tennessee
recruit with her size and the junior college aspect. Can you talk a little bit
about what you saw before that made you decide, okay, I'm going to offer her a
scholarship and bring her on board.  
COACH SUMMITT: One thing I learned is that it's not about the size of the
body, it's the size of the heart and the toughness and the mind and the
skills.  
When I saw her play at the junior college tournament of course I had seen her
on film, and Dean Lockwood had been the one to go down and watch her play and
just watching her on tape. I mean, you can't really appreciate what she brings
in terms of her speed and her quickness. But watching her play in the national
championship, I just felt like she was a player that could get other people
the ball. She was a hard player to defend. And in the open court I really
liked what she did with the basketball and that she was in the attack mode.
Very confident. Self-assured. A self-assured point guard. And I just felt like
this is a player that could make a difference for us. It was just a matter of
-- it wasn't a matter of how hard she would work, it was a matter of how long
it would take her to really fit in and learn the system both offensively and
defensively.  
And she -- I mean, she would watch film with me every day. If I would let her.
She would just -- we watch film on our North Carolina game before the North
Carolina game last night we watched in the afternoon. And she really is a very
committed player to learning and trying to do it right.  
  
Q. Since '98 have there been any years that haunt you, that you feel like
you should have won as opposed to teams that you ran into and just ran into
better teams?  
COACH SUMMITT: It's always tough to be on that stage and lose. But quite
honestly, I don't know that we had a team that was really favored during that
time. We got some teams to a Final Four and to a championship game that a lot
of people didn't think could get there. And in a lot of cases we overachieved.
But the missing ingredient was just having the players that on that stage
could step up and make the big plays. And that's where maybe we got -- we lost
out on a couple of those players in the recruiting, but that's why when
Candace Parker said I'm going to Tennessee, I felt like we got -- we got a
different situation now just because of what I had anticipated she would bring
along with obviously Alexis and Nicky, and in particular those three.  
  
Q. You've had a lot of great players come through Tennessee. Where does
Candace rank among them, what makes her so special, and does she need a title
to validate her career at Tennessee?  
COACH SUMMITT: She would tell you she definitely needs a title to validate her
career and her place at Tennessee because people compare her to Tameka
Catchings and Chamique Holdsclaw. If I had to say today who has been the
player that's had the greatest impact on championships, it's Chamique
Holdsclaw. And Candace knows that and understands that and she said, Don't
talk about Candace Parker along with Chamique and Temeka until Candace
Parker's a part of a national championship. Which I think is -- I think that
that speaks volumes for who she is and she's willing to put it on the line and
right or wrong, that's how people will most likely define her career.  
  
Q. Little bit out of left field, but would love to get your thoughts on
this. The use of the term lady, the adjective lady, Lady Vols. Of course
there's no Gentlemen Vols and it is 2007 and with all due respect to the brand
and what you have created there, is it time to get rid of that adjective and
just have every one be Vols or Wildcats or whatever, understanding that it
could be seen as a bit demeaning or somehow having to need a adjective as
making it somewhat less than the whole.  
COACH SUMMITT: I don't think that will ever change at Tennessee.  
  
Q. Should they?  
COACH SUMMITT: That started back in '74. No. No. Because that's who we're
known as, as the Lady Vols. I think our players would be the first to say we
don't want to change it. That's who we are, that's how people know us, and
most of these players up here -- Nicky Anosike would be the first to tell you
that we're proud to be called ladies and Lady Vols.  
  
Q. Do you understand though at least the --  
COACH SUMMITT: I understand.  
  
Q. -- the conversation?  
COACH SUMMITT: Yes, I do. I understand the question and the conversation. But,
I mean, I just think within the state of Tennessee and nationally, that logo,
the Lady Vol logo, is known throughout this country and throughout the world.
And I don't know. I just -- I can't see that changing.  
  
Q. 1982, I hate to take you back that far, your recollections of the
tournament and maybe any interaction you had with Vivian at the time.  
COACH SUMMITT: My recollection of the tournament was we were playing against
Louisiana Tech. And the biggest thing I remember is we could not make a entry
pass into our offense. And we got killed in that game.  
It was a long, miserable game. And I remember telling Sonja Hogg, I will stay
in this profession until we beat Louisiana Tech. Count on it. Because they
were pressing us, even in the last two minutes and, I mean, we were down. And
down by a significant margin. And I just -- it was a tough -- it was just a
tough weekend for us. It was really tough. And I do remember thinking that
this is going to really change women's basketball and just a great crowd and
great environment for women's -- for the women's game.  
And it definitely did impact, but it wasn't a great weekend for Tennessee. And
it's -- I hate to tell you, but that's what you remember so much is how you
end and we know only one team ends with a victory. But we had hoped that we
could make a better showing on national TV and we didn't do it. But I was
proud for the game to be on that stage.  
  
Q. Was there any interaction between you back then?  
COACH SUMMITT: Oh, yes. Yes. Vivian and I, we certainly talked and I was
really proud for her. I thought her team had played well and she's -- it
doesn't matter. I mean, she could coach any team that someone wanted to sign
her to and say, go win with this team. She figures out away to win.  
  
Q. Along the theme of staying in the game until something is achieved, Bob
Starkey was in here the other day talking about how he didn't want -- wasn't
interested in head coaching job because of all the demands and the pressure
and all that stuff. Was there ever a point in your career where you kind of
felt, I'm accomplished, I've done a lot, built a program, and started to
question how long you wanted to do it or even continue at all? And if there
was a point in your career when you kind of had felt yourself getting a little
sideways in it and how did you overcome that?  
COACH SUMMITT: This may seem a little strange, but I've never thought about
not doing what I do. I love it. I live for it.  
My most favorite part of my day is the time I spend in practice. I prefer
practice over games because it's -- that's where you teach. That's where you
hopefully teach and lead and impact how these young women will then take over
when they get on the court.  
And I just -- when I go in the gym and it's no longer fun for me or I don't
feel like I'm connecting with these student-athletes, then I obviously would
make a change.  
I will tell you, there was a time that I did not feel that I had the energy.
And that was in 1985 after coaching the Olympic team and also playing for the
national championship and losing to USC. And I went right from that experience
to coaching the Olympic team in Los Angeles and I had never felt that -- now,
that was pressure. That was -- in my opinion, I probably put more pressure on
myself than I should have for us to win the gold medal. And it was even more
pressure when the Russians decided not to come, to boycott. Then we had to
win.  
But when I came back I did not have as much energy then as I've had since
then. And I think that was just because of the demands and all of the stress
that I felt in winning the gold medal.  
  
Q. Some of the kids upstairs were just talking about the manifesto that
Nicky came up with before you guys played UCONN, the one that they signed, I
guess it was something that they said that was done among players, not the
coaches. I just wondered what your reaction was when you found out about it?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, obviously all I knew is that they -- they did it. But I
don't -- I haven't seen anything. That's off limits to the coaches. I know
that they pretty much made a pact for how they wanted to come together and
stay together and play together. And that's been the difference this year. I
think Nicky and Alexis have been probably the two players that have provided
the kind of leadership that is necessary for a team to really have that
chemistry and togetherness. And they have -- the two of them have been
terrific in that area. Even when Alexis is struggling last night, and in there
with -- at times in the past she would have thrown in the towel. Nicky wasn't
going to let her do that. They just hold each other accountable. And I think
that's probably where it all started. Because I think that was our big road
game that they felt like, hey, we got to win on the road and we got to win
against a great opponent.  
  
Q. Coach Stringer last couple of weeks has used the words team of destiny
quite a bit when describing their run through the tournament. Have you found
through the years the concept team of destiny? Is that viable? Does it have
any place in the game? And if so, how do you game plan against such an
intangible?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, if you believe it and you make it happen, then it is
viable.  
And obviously with what this team has done I can see where Coach Stringer
would go in that direction and inspire her team.  
At the same time, I told our team we're not leaving here without a national
championship. So I think you have two teams that really feel it and believe
it. And that's why I think you're going to have a great game and obviously
it's going to be the kind of game where players have to make plays. And they
have to make stops. They have to score. To me, it's two teams that want this
and in such a way that I think you're going to see a basketball game played
with tremendous intensity and competitiveness.  
  
Q. Was Cait's enthusiasm and exuberance easily accepted by the older players
on the team? And even last night when she didn't play, she still kept that
energy level up court side. Can you talk a little bit about that.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well Cait's -- Cait's high energy every day. And I think this
team just knows that Cait's going to speak her mind. She's probably been the
one player on the bench that has inspired others more than anyone else with
her enthusiasm and she's obviously speaks her mind. But I think that she's the
kind of player that gets this team fired up. And she's willing to do whatever
it takes. And she's handled the role very, very well.  
We talked about the bench before we went out last night. And obviously when
the game was over I talked about how much energy the bench gave the players on
the court. And the players all responded. They felt it. And you have to have
that. But it starts with Cait McMahan.  
  
Q. I was talking to Sidney last night and she had mentioned this magic six
running program that you guys do, I guess in the preseason. She thought that
was very appropriate that because the last run of it is the longest and the
hardest, and that now you're in the national championship game, which is the
hardest thing to accomplish, could you talk a little bit about what prepares
your players with this program and how they will go up, Rutgers is equally as
conditioned?  
COACH SUMMITT: Sure.  
  
Q. And how does this make it better? Does this make you guys better than
them or is it sort of just one more thing that will help you get over the
top?  
COACH SUMMITT: Heather Mason is our strength and conditioning coach. And the
best I've ever worked with. And Heather designs her program so that it is --
it's very, very competitive and very tough. And within our sprint work you
have an opponent. And your opponent might be Georgia, it could be Vanderbilt,
we usually have SEC, we usually take outside opponents as well. I mean, with
our schedule having played North Carolina and Duke, that's certainly names
that come up. But it's like who we're competing against today. And we have to
win this.  
I think that the way she presents it and challenges this team and holds people
accountable is, it gives them a mental toughness, if you will. Not that we're
going to be physically stronger, but in the huddle last night we talked about
we can do this. This is -- we're down the home stretch. And I felt like their
energy stayed at the level it needed to and they do feel like they're the best
conditioned team in the country.  
There's something to be said for what you believe in. And they believe that.
But it's -- we have obviously progressed significantly with Heather's -- just
her discipline. If you don't -- if everyone doesn't touch the line the right
way and turn the right way, then we start over. So and in everything she does
-- I mean, you to have the discipline. She's better at that than I am. I'm
learning from her.  
  
Q. You addressed this last week, but in watching -- of course there was a
great crowd here last week, Lady Vols enjoy tremendous support. But as you
watched the other regionals last week there were a lot of empty seats. What
does -- when this game is over, what does women's basketball do to address
that?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think we have great leadership in our game. And I do think
that that is something that we have to carefully examine and try to figure out
what is the best plan to implement to make sure that we have people in the
stands in post-season. We have a lot of -- we have a lot of teams throughout
the country that draw well. And I went and supported the neutral sites.  
I now question whether or not our game is ready for that. But I do think that
we can look at some venues that are regionally positioned to allow us to see
teams and to seed teams and obviously we're seeding a lot of teams
geographically to draw more fan support. And then marketing. Marketing is so
key. And we may have to look at the marketing efforts not only for our
respective institutions, but also what we're doing in the post season to try
and generate more fan interest. And have people in the seats.  
  
Q. Alexis said that this is the most balanced offensive team of the Rutgers
teams that you faced in the last couple years. How much of a threat I guess
does that pose to you when they do still play defense like a Stringer-coached
team?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think this is a great team because of that. Because they are
committed to defense and board play. But they have a lot of confidence
offensively and you've got the big four that are scoring. And they can make
shots. We struggled last night offensively. And I am hoping that we got that
out of our system.  
But we also understand it's going to be very difficult to score against
Rutgers defense. And also that we have to defend at all positions. But
typically when you're, when you're in this position and you're competing for a
national championship, you're going to have to guard people and you're going
to have to make plays. And that's true on both sides of the ball. We have to
do it.  
  
Q. Shannon said she likes your swagger. And maybe we can relate. Do you see
something about -- of you in her confidence level that she has?  
COACH SUMMITT: I never thought of myself having a swagger.  
  
Q. There's something New York about you too in there somewhere.  
COACH SUMMITT: Hardly. I think that the one thing that I've tried to do to
help Shannon is to help Shannon realize how good she is. Before the game last
night when we talked I just told her, You're going to be the best point guard
on the floor. And you have to believe it and you have to make these things
happen.  
I think Shannon has a lot of confidence. I think she came in with a lot of
confidence. Candace Parker has a lot of confidence, Alexis, Nicky Anosike,
those in particular come to my mind right off. And I do think that that's
filtered throughout our team.  
But with me, I just -- my objective is just to be strong for our team and to
stay focused. And think of how I can help them. And the one thing is not --
and this is where I've changed over the years, is not to get frustrated
because of what I'm feeling, but to try to stay in tune with what they're
feeling and what they need from me at that moment. And with Shannon I tried to
stay extremely positive. I can't really think of many times that I've ever
been tough on her in a game.  
  
Q. Along the lines ever fan interest, while there was intensity and good
defense in both games last night, there was also an inordinate amount of air
balls and turnovers and missed layups. Is it somewhat troubling to you that in
this big showcase event that there would be bad basketball like that?  
COACH SUMMITT: No, I think that's part of post-season. Watch the men's games.
And you're seeing obviously struggles, particularly early on in those games.
And a lot of the men's games and the women's games are very similar. And what
happens is that you don't necessarily shoot the ball that well. There's a lot
on the line, there's a lot of pressure. And for whatever reason defense goes
to another level. And I think that just the defensive intensity that we have
seen in the women's tournament as well as the men's tournament, that sometimes
it's made for ugly basketball.  
It's just a matter of just battling it out and trying to improve as you move
through a game or as you go through a possession. Because that's -- teams are
going to bring the intensity. Last night I thought with North Carolina, the
intensity between our two teams was terrific. At times the game looked ugly.  
  
Q. This question may have been asked, I've been floating around. Did you
know about this manifesto or paper that the players signed? When did that come
back around to you and what did you think of it and have you seen it?  
COACH SUMMITT: I didn't know about it until the players wanted their time in
the locker room before we met as a team. And this was when we were at
Connecticut. So up until then I knew nothing about it. And I've asked nothing
about it. That's their deal.  
I'm not going to get all up in their business. I don't want them all up in
mine. We do what we have to do as a staff. They do what they have to do as a
team. I just trusted them. I guess over the years it's -- I pick and choose
what I've really wanted to know. So they did this and that's their deal.
That's their plan. But obviously it's been effective for them.  
  
Q. I'm just curious how you would compare your coaching philosophy and your
personality with Vivian Stringer. You are both legends in coaching basketball
but you seem to have different personalities.  
COACH SUMMITT: I think there's a lot of similarities because we both believe
strongly in defense and rebounding. Very committed to it.  
I don't know. I'm not around Vivian in her practices and -- but I think that
she does a great job communicating with her teams and getting them to believe
and I would like to believe that our players believe in our system.
Personality-wise, I don't know, I'm obviously a -- I talk a lot slower but I
don't talk quite as long. But that's okay. She's very effective. And I think
she's a great motivator. And I think her kids just -- they bring it. And they
bring it for her. I think they really -- they love their Coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the aura that is Tennessee basketball and do you agree
with Alexis that maybe it's not as intimidating as it used to be or what do
you think about that?  
COACH SUMMITT: I would somewhat agree that because we haven't won national
championships in recent years that maybe we're not viewed as big of a threat.  
But I will tell you, just having the schedule that we have and traveling
across the country, I'm amazed at the number of fans that come out, Tennessee
fans or fans when we travel on the road. So obviously I think Tennessee has
been around for a long time. And I do think that our national -- not only our
national schedule but our national exposure has allowed our Tennessee teams to
enjoy a lot of support on the road as well as obviously at home.  
But I don't think that when you get on -- you know, in this situation,
competing in the Regional or Final Four, that teams are going to be
intimidated. I think if anything they're going to be more motivated and
focused.  
  
Q. Coach Stringer has said that this is her best coaching job in her career.
You've seen a fair amount of her teams. Would you go as far as to agree with
that?  
COACH SUMMITT: I've seen a number of her teams and it's hard for me to
compare. Obviously she says it, I'll agree with her. But from where they
started, absolutely. I mean, when I saw them play Duke I was like, oh, it's
going to be along year for Vivian. If she can't get this young group to really
step up and believe in her system. But knowing Vivian, I'm not surprised.
She's very persistent. Very persistent.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
COACH SUMMITT: Thank you.

_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with a opening statement from the coach and then go
to questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH STRINGER: We're excited to be here. We have got a busy day today. We
hope to get some rest tomorrow because we recognize that we're on stage with
the biggest game in women's basketball.  
It seems only appropriate that we would have a opportunity to play Tennessee.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Essence, I wanted to ask you about Katie Adams. Coach said the other day
that she's been sort of a person who goes unheralded as kind of a great leader
for you guys and do you think you would have -- I mean, it's kind of a strange
question, do you think you would be here without somebody like her?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Not at all. Katie, she's definitely -- she was a big help in
the preseason. Throughout the entire year as well. Especially with the
freshmen. There are five freshmen. So without any upperclassmen we would have
never gotten this far. Without Katie especially, because she's just so
inspirational. She shows you what hard work is all about. Even if you don't
get a chance to come on the floor she never gives up. She's always on the
sidelines cheering you on, telling you what you're doing wrong and how you can
fix it: And those are definitely the people that you need on your team.  
  
Q. Epiphanny, what can you tell us about Shannon from high school and did
you talk to her about coming to Rutgers with you?  
EPIPHANNY PRINCE: Shannon is a great point guard who likes to score, in
transition and run the team. And, yes, I did try to get her to come to
Rutgers, but I guess she liked Tennessee better.  
  
Q. Any good stories about her?  
EPIPHANNY PRINCE: No. Sorry.  
  
Q. Have you ever taken her on in practice? Did you play her one-on-one?  
EPIPHANNY PRINCE: No, we just used to shoot around after practice to get -- to
try to help our jump shots get better.  
  
Q. And who was the better shooter?  
EPIPHANNY PRINCE: I don't know.  
  
Q. Question for Kia. Your team did a good job, you and your team did a good
job defensing Fowles. Can you talk about the difficulty you'll have with
Parker?  
KIA VAUGHN: That I would have? Or we will have? As a team?  
  
Q. Well, the team, because she's a little more versatile player than a
Fowles.  
KIA VAUGHN: Well, the team, we're going to play her like we normally play
anybody else. No difference.  
  
Q. For Matee, I wanted to ask you, Candace has said that it wouldn't be
complete if she didn't win a national title at Tennessee. Do you feel that
same way about winning a national title at Rutgers? Do you need that to
complete your career there?  
MATEE AJAVON: Of course. I think that every one who comes to college has a
goal of one day winning a national championship. So in her perspective, yes,
you know, that may fulfill her. Yes, in my perspective it may fulfill us too.
But we just look to play a hard 40 minutes and may the best person win. Best
team, that is.  
  
Q. You five and your teammates, how did you sleep last night? Have you
talked about that? Did you get a full eight hours? Were you too excited? How
did you sleep?  
ESSENCE CARSON: We slept pretty well.  
(Laughter.) The tournament isn't over yet. For us, yesterday was a great game
for us. Yes, we can be excited, but we can't be overly excited because we
still have a goal that's still ahead of us and we're still trying to reach
that.  
So we won't -- after tomorrow's game, you know, if the outcome is positive on
our part, then we probably won't get any sleep. Probably be out celebrating
amongst each other.  
But we still have a job to be done. And we're looking to be well rested,
bodies and mentally, and looking just to go into the game and just play the
game, the game of our lives.  
  
Q. Did anybody else not sleep well last night? Everybody got their eight
hours?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Yes.  
  
Q. E, this is now the third year in a row that you'll play Tennessee here on
this stage. Why are you more prepared for them this year, and how do you just
feel about constantly seeing them?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Yes, it's the third time that I've gotten a chance to play
them. And especially in the NCAA's. I feel that we're well prepared this year
as a team, as a whole. The players, one through ten, I believe that we're all
prepared. We have all gotten the chance to experience some type of game time
during this NCAA tournament. And especially since we're -- we have a more
balanced scoring team and we are playing defense just as well as any other of
Coach Stringer's teams.  
And right now we're just working together. We're rolling and we're just
believing in ourselves. And I believe that all ten of us believe in ourselves.
And I believe that's something that we might have lacked in past years.  
  
Q. For any of the players, curious how often or if there's times in which
Coach Stringer has referenced the 1982 team that -- the last team she took to
a championship game at Cheyney? Just stories or something she's pointed to. Is
that something that comes up often for you guys?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Well, Coach Stringer references a lot of things?  
(Laughter.) But she has brought up the 1982 team. She has brought up the Iowa
team that she's coached. She has brought up many things that has happened to
her in her life to show us that no matter when you're struggling, or how much
you're struggling, that there's still light at the end of the tunnel. So we're
just as motivated. We have talked to past players and we use them as
motivation as well.  
But most importantly Coach Stringer's our motivator just simply because we
exemplify her character. She definitely let's us know time in and time out
that it's not where you come from, it's where you're going.  
  
Q. Kia, can you give us an idea how tough Coach Stringer's practices are?  
MATEE AJAVON: No.  
(Laughter.) I think that's impossible.  
KIA VAUGHN: It really is. You really can't tell. Each and every day is
different. Very different. It depends on how you react and how you turn out
and how you start the practice. So what she may throw at you there.  
Basically we just go in there with an open mind and we're ready for anything.  
  
Q. For any of the players, can you talk about the underdog role and do you
guys sort of kind of like that role going into this game?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Honestly, we never really pay attention to the seedings,
rankings, or whichever you may call it. But we just look to go into the game
and just play the best game on that day to be the best team on that day.  
Throughout this entire month -- well, it's April now, and throughout the
entire month of March, there's been upsets. Any day can be any team's game.
And we're just looking just to take that and just to continue to play the
basketball that we have been playing throughout the second half of the season.  
  
Q. I talked to some people last night back in New Jersey and this morning,
and they said there is no way this team can not win tomorrow night, based on
the play of what they saw last night versus what Tennessee did with North
Carolina. Do you feel that?  
ESSENCE CARSON: You can't make a definite prediction at this point. It's going
to -- you're going to be able to tell when the ball goes up in the air
tomorrow. For me to say that, no, that we don't have enough power to face a
Tennessee team, that would be wrong. And for me to say that, yeah, we're too
strong for them, that would be wrong as well.  
It's a 50/50 chance here. And it just goes by how well we play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Last night Governor Corzine was here, Coach Schiano was here, Coach Fred
Hill was here. Can you just talk about like playing this game for like for New
Jersey and for Rutgers.  
HEATHER ZURICH: It definitely meant a lot for us just to have such big people
from New Jersey come to our game. It's just been a great opportunity and
representing the state of New Jersey, we're just really proud. Even having
like Coach Schiano here, what the football team did this year, we're just
happy to carry on and be in the championship game.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you. You can head to the break out room. We'll
take questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Your teams throughout the years have developed reputations for not
letting one player beat you. You did a great job on Fowles in the semis. Can
you just talk about the challenge Parker will pose in the championship?  
COACH STRINGER: Well, I think that Fowles is probably the most dominating
center with all that she could do. And clearly Candace Parker is the national
Player of the Year.  
There's nothing that she can't do. I think everybody's always impressed with
the beautiful athlete, the beautiful body. I mean she can rebound, dunk, shoot
the ball, play the point. I mean, how many players in this world can do that?
None.  
She's Candace Parker all by herself. But maybe between today and tomorrow,
whatever time the game is played, we'll try to figure out something to make it
a little less easy, and right now I don't know what we're going to do. I've
been up all night thinking about it and looking at some tapes and I'll be
talking with the coaches.  
But I think that people should remember though Candace Parker's a great
player, but that's not -- that doesn't define the Tennessee team. I think the
Tennessee team is a huge team. I mean across the board. Once you deal with
Bobbitt, who is a 5-3 player, then you jump 5-11 and then 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 across
the board. Remember, these are all select athletes that Tennessee picks. They
have first choice on the blue chip athletes. There's not one player that's not
a first team All-American or a probably a national Player of the Year.  
These young ladies have a great deal of pride, they're extremely versatile.
They can flat out get it done. Some players are this-and-that players. They
can either do this or they can do that. These players are this and that. They
can do this or that.  
And Pat, you know, is just the greatest coach in my opinion, period. So they
have got the great players and a great coach and a great tradition. They're
used to playing in pressure situations. They have been to the Final Four. This
group of young people haven't been, but the team has. So Candace says that her
career isn't complete, I imagine that that's the way she feels, and that
should be.  
But we'll have to figure out what we're going to do. I know it's not going to
be just one person that's going to handle her.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Shannon Bobbitt, the player you saw in high school to
the player you're seeing now, how close you came to getting her. Just in
general terms what she's added to the Tennessee team over the team that you
saw last year.  
COACH STRINGER: It's a much needed piece. I think that was the smartest move
that Tennessee could have made. Because they have always had the giant
players, what I call pro sized guards, and we all have seen that. But they
have never had the quickness that they have needed.  
So you add the quickness of Shannon, few people can take the ball away from
her and what's so great about her is she's so extremely intense and
fundamentally sound defensively. She probably went to one of the best junior
colleges in the country that definitely emphasizes great offense and great
defense, and it's a real tribute to Coach Landers. We were aware of Shannon
earlier in the year and obviously she went to the junior college for a variety
of reasons, so I'll say it like that.  
But I remember my nephew sending me a tape because there was something online
with her handling the ball. She was just as smooth as Allen Iverson. She's
just a little itty-bitty person, you know. And I sort of lost track of her.
And then realized where she was in the junior college. And I would like to
have brought Shannon to Rutgers. We did have her visit and I'll leave it like
that.  
A long story short is by Final Four time she decided to go to Tennessee. And
that's good for them. Because she did improve her shot which she didn't have
as consistently in high school. But she's doing it all right now and she
brings fire and fight and she's a true point guard because she's unselfish and
she doesn't care who gets the job done as long as they win. And that's what
you want from a point guard.  
  
Q. You talked last week about the six player game. Is that what you grew up
playing or do you just -- you were aware of it? And also in the 25 years since
your first Final Four, some of the things that struck you as how the game has
evolved.  
COACH STRINGER: Well, no, I always played with the guys down -- no, I always
played with the boys all the time. And most of the time I was the one that was
choosing the team. So I don't know. The six player game -- although, in my
high school we didn't have sports for girls and that's so unfortunate. I was
so excited to go to college because I figured I could put my talents to use
and we started off that way. With the 3-up and 3 back. My reference had to do
more with when I went to Iowa the entire state was a six on six and of course
that's where they would average 15- to 20,000 people at the girls high school
game. I was in awe of that. So it was difficult and I knew better than to try
to get the state to change. E. Wayne Cooley, who was the head of the Iowa
Federation, was the -- the politically correct thing would have been for he
and I to get together. I was explaining why we needed to have these athletes
from Iowa play for the University of Iowa. I thought they were the best
shooters in the world and fundamentally sound, but when it came to facing up
with the basket and seeing all this other movement that it was going to be
difficult. So Pat Summitt called me and we talked about that because Tennessee
was one of the few last states to change from the six on six game to the five
on five game as well.  
And Elaine and I continue to remain friends. But it was just a matter of
things eventually evolving. And the statement was that girls couldn't run as
much because they may have a heart attack. And they just couldn't -- their
hearts couldn't take it. But we see now that they can and now they're even
dunking. So the game has evolved quite a bit. Quite a bit. The athleticism on
the part of the centers is incredible. So right now it seems like a center is
not the complete player if she can't shoot the ball well at the three point
range and go inside and pretty soon it's going to come down to, hey, how many
players do you have that can dunk. And that's what it's going to come to.  
  
Q. Between you and Pat, fuzzy math, maybe, I got 1,700 victories, 68 years
combined coaching experience, is it a mistake to reduce this kind of a game,
say that it's a chess match between two of the greatest coaches in women's
history? Is there overemphasis on that at the college level or is that the
correct way to look at the game?  
COACH STRINGER: It probably is a chess match. She has her pieces and I have my
pieces. And we're trying to, at the right time, make the move. There will be
moves and countermoves. And as you may know, Pat and I are very good friends.
And I've enjoyed coaching -- I just enjoy these kind of games. And I know that
she does too as well. The players, I mean, there's a lot of things. That's why
I thought Essence answered someone's questions brilliantly because you can't
tell what's going to go on. It depends on how calm the players are and what
moves they make and basically how calm we can be and the skills of the
players.  
But basketball is a game of chess. You just don't throw it out there randomly
hoping and react to it. You hope to make a move and cause someone else to
react and you look at players that are put in and you consider what you need
to do with that. The decisions you make with regards to the patterns has
everything to do with how well people handle certain kinds of offensive
schemes. Whether it's a screen and roll or a post pattern or whatever.  
So every time -- if you notice every time someone comes in, as for me, my
coaches, I'll think more in terms of the patterns, my assistant coach, whoever
did that game, will think more in terms of the matchups. And sometimes you get
the matchups right and sometimes you don't.  
  
Q. Just a quick follow-up, there's a scene in a movie Patton where George C.
Scott's character is having a battle with Rommel's Panzers and he says,
Rommel, you magnificent bastard, I read your book.  
COACH STRINGER: I love it.  
  
Q. Have you read Pat's book? Has she read yours? Is there anything that you
guys do that the other doesn't know backwards and forwards?  
COACH STRINGER: I can tell you this: Yeah, her book, "The Summit," to go into
her mind and in terms of what was happening at the time that we were going to
play them, I think it was for the -- it was either at the Elite 8 level --
yeah, it must have been. What was going through her mind. Yeah. Most coaches I
think read or admire Rommel and Patton and all the great generals. I think
it's appropriate that they call Bob Knight "the general." Because he is a
general.  
You move; it is a chess match. It is that very much. It's important to know
the mind, the player. Sometimes you might even know from the clothes, the
decision of the clothes that they might wear. It's really very interesting.
You must know the mind because the players may change, the names and the faces
of the players, but I study the coaches. Other tendencies that they have.  
We say that all the time. Because you can't change. If you have been
successful you may tweak and come up a little more here or there. For example,
this year I tried to allow the team to run full blown for all out. We have
never had offensive players -- and that's the mistake I think that so many
times people think, well, Vivian just likes to walk the ball up the floor. At
championship times we have been known to turn the ball over four or five times
and that's an incredible statistic. But it's not that I want to walk the ball
up the floor, I much prefer to run like I would much prefer to press, the
problem is we have not had the players to run in too many instances and better
still we haven't had people that have been consistent with their shooting.  
But I couldn't -- it was against my own -- it was against my own grain when we
were out there scoring a thundered points and other people were scoring 80 and
85 points on us, so someone should have known that pretty soon Vivian would go
back to herself. You know. And not lose my mind and go ahead and do the things
I'm most comfortable with. But it's great.  
  
Q. You've told us in the past when Coach Summitt has called you at trying
times and things like that. Can you tell us when she called you this season,
when was the last time y'all talked and do you kind of feel like you owe her?
That you're due a win?  
COACH STRINGER: She owes me or I owe her?  
  
Q. You owe her.  
COACH STRINGER: Depends on what you want to say about that.  
  
Q. It's been a long, and a lot in a row now that she's kind of gotten the
best of you.  
COACH STRINGER: You know what? I think that for me I would be wasting energy
and stressing out too much. I sort of like the way I'm approaching everything.
I don't know why. The same thing with the players. The players alluded to all
of our -- so many of the Cheyney, Iowa and Rutgers players came because
they're a part of the same family at a reception and so many of them gave
testimony and they spoke because it is one large family.  
To me it's overwhelming the cumulative affect of all of that. It's like a mom
watching all of her children come home and you love them and see the things
that they have done. With regards to Tennessee, it always seems that we always
are playing one another. And we're such good friends. I'm sure that we -- I
know that we prefer not to play. But on the other hand, we continue to want to
make ourselves worthy to be considered in that elite company. To have an
opportunity to play them time and time again. And so for those schools that
avoid great competition, it's like this, you can run, but you can't hide. You
can run, but you can't hide. Because ultimately if what you say you want is a
national championship, they're going to be there. Lurking somewhere.  
That is what we want. We want -- so we want to play the best. I'm excited
about playing them. I'm not going to get hung up on, well, they just keep on
beating you. I've lasted this many years, you know, so I got it in me. That's
one thing about it. I can persevere. And thank goodness we have an opportunity
to play now and we have been on them, if you want to go by the numbers, but it
doesn't matter, because unfortunately, you know, the things don't work out
quite the way that people want all the time.  
Who would have not wanted, for example, North Carolina State to win their game
against Connecticut just because they would be the sentimental favorite. It
doesn't work that way. So we just -- I just got to think with a clear mind and
let these guys play and be free of any of the burdens of the past. They just
need to deal with here and now.  
  
Q. Two questions: One, Nicky Anosike, was that somebody that you recruited?
And if so, could you give us a little background there? And, two, what is it
about her that coaches seem to appreciate that maybe the casual fans don't?  
COACH STRINGER: Of course we would have wanted to recruit her. We want to keep
every player in New York and New Jersey. I think that if we could really just
recruit there, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., the
parents would be happy, we could win at the highest levels. And that's what we
have attempted to do. We need to own the Eastern corridor. We don't even have
to go down the coast, if you will.  
I was at a lot of her practices and talked to her coach at length. Long story
short is that the name Tennessee and its rich tradition, and let's say Pat,
was too much for me. I couldn't have recruited anyone harder. I love her
because she's 6-3, she's got unlimited energy, she's quick, she runs the floor
well, she is just a fundamentally sound player. I try tried to call her at the
last second to speak -- do you want to speak to her mom or someone to explain
to them why they should come to Rutgers. And we are the program that needs
people, you know, we're careful with the people that we select. We're very
careful, that's why you don't see large numbers of players. Because it's a
certain kind of player and, first of all, it's a player that is not looking
for stardom.  
Nicky is not that kind of a player. She went to Tennessee not because it was
Tennessee; I think that she was excited to go there. We probably needed her
more. We always do need her, I think we always need players more than what
Tennessee has. They got people in the cupboards getting ready to come out.
Really, they just dust them off and put them on out there.  
But as you can see with us, we take advantage of every player that we have and
so when we say to you, come to us because as a freshman you'll play, I mean,
what could be better? But Nicky, you know, she went to Tennessee and that was
our loss and Tennessee's gain.  
  
Q. You may have answered this in bits and pieces, but when you said in your
opening that it's appropriate that you're playing Tennessee, could you
elaborate on that as to what you meant and also how unfulfilled have you felt
that you haven't won a national championship to this point?  
COACH STRINGER: I think that it's important every year that I have an
opportunity to Coach because it burns so much in my soul. It being coaching. I
think that when the day comes that I regret sitting down and writing out a
practice or going over a tape. I get excited, during the season, my nanny will
tell you, I never eat, just eat. I will take -- I have a huge bathroom with
televisions in there and all that. Huge. I mean huge. So I'll just sit in
there and eat. And so it's almost like it's a treat. I sit there and I smile
and I really enjoy breaking things down. Breaking tapes down. I enjoy
developing and putting things together. Every year I approach it, every year
believe that we can win a national championship. This year, different. I
really didn't think so. I didn't know if I could even last as a coach.  
So to be here now I'm not going to spoil it by being obsessed with it. I
really haven't been obsessed. I'm always hurt more often, I'm hurt because I'm
losing young people and I won't see them again. I still have pain in my heart
when I looked at that last shot the time that we played Tennessee and Cappie
Pondexter just played her heart out. And the rest of the young people tried to
play as well and we just came up short. And I remember looking at the clock
and looking so deflated that it's almost like it's like a -- it's really like
a noose on a neck and it's a mental thing and I wanted to cry for them. And
because I take it so personal and I do cry. It means everything in the world
to me because I don't want to see my kids' hearts broken. They play too hard.  
But somehow we have come to a little balance that we really can't appreciate
all of what we have gotten out of the season, and we're going to do everything
we can to be fulfilled. Pat has won a lot of times. I really would like to
know what it feels like and I don't need her to tell me what it feels like. I
want to experience it myself. You know. And who wouldn't?  
But in this you have to be good and you also have to be somewhat lucky. There
are people who have won a national championship that you probably would have a
hard time remembering their names now. Because it's a flash in the pan. It
just happened overnight. I think most people will think about me because
somehow we're that team that you're going to always have to mention because
we're going to be somewhere there that's dangerously close. And even if we're
out of the numbers, as you can see with the rankings, you always know that
sometimes, somehow those Scarlet Knights are going to be a team that needs to
be counted on. Somehow they're just going to find it, they're going to get
that fight and they're going to be able to put it together.  
So ask me that question, you know, Tuesday night. When do we play? Monday
night? Tuesday night. Yeah. Ask me that question Tuesday night. I sure hope
that I can tell you that I no he what it feels like. I just want to experience
it. It would be nice.  
  
Q. And would it be appropriate to play Tennessee?  
COACH STRINGER: It is appropriate that we would play Tennessee because
Tennessee has been that team -- it's kind of interesting, the year that my
husband passed, it was Tennessee that came to Iowa. I think we at the time we
were a No. 1 seed or whatever. Tennessee I think was considered one of the top
teams, if not the top team in the nation, and certainly the SEC was the
strongest team and so the NCAA selection committee found it appropriate that
Tennessee and Auburn would come. And to our good fortune we emerged from that
and we went on to a Final Four. When we went to Philadelphia, no matter what,
Pat and I are connected at the hip. This year she called me just before the
thing and says, Vivian, I promise you we're not going to be in the same
region. But somehow Rutgers, me, let's say it like this, not me, not Iowa and
not Rutgers, not Cheyney, because, you know, the first Final Four it was
Tennessee, although they were on the other side of the brackets, I think they
won their game against Maryland or lost their game against Maryland and we
were with Louisiana Tech, so we have always been in that company.  
But appropriate because I can think of no other team that on a more consistent
basis or no other coach on a more consistent basis that has always been that
person that says, I'm standing here, you have to come by me in order to get it
all. And Pat is such a great competitor the great coach that she is, a great
competitor, that if she has 50, she wants 60, and I don't blame her. She works
hard and the team deserves that.  
It's appropriate. That's the team that it should be. Anything short of that
probably is like, well, but you didn't play the mighty Tennessee. So you know
we get a chance to play them and if we're not good enough, we're not good
enough. If we're good enough you'll find out Tuesday night. You'll know.  
  
Q. Can you remember the circumstances the first time you met Pat and why the
two of you hit it off?  
COACH STRINGER: I can't remember. I was a little fish at Cheyney. We only had
1,500 students and about $3,000 budgets. A budget and I thought, wow, here we
are playing in the first Final Four. And we were in Norfolk and she and I
never got a chance to play one another. I just -- Tennessee seemed like this
far, distant land. Unfortunately being from the East, some of us tend to think
that there's nothing going on west of the Mississippi.  
And where is Tennessee? Where is it? Okay. Ohio, Iowa, whatever. And we're
just focusing on the East Coast. So I really didn't know. I just know it was a
huge school and this coach had done great things. But, remember, television
didn't bring those games and these situations to the front.  
I think that Pat and I had a casual conversation because we met there for the
meeting that they would have just before the Final Four. And I would come to
hear her name so many times and took pride in saying that she was my friend.
But what I do appreciate about her most is that contrary to what people think,
they might see her as a powerful person and arrogant, but she's a very warm,
caring coach, mother, and woman. With everything that she does.  
We were standing on the sidelines and in our game at Madison Square Garden
talking about clothes, believe it or not. We talk about our children. She's
been great to my sons who have been in college and needed to get reports done
and that. And she's been that person that will take time and call you and I
know that she would do anything for me. If I'm down, hey, Vivian, you know,
get your head up. We had a game where I just -- I tend to, you know, implement
a lot of things and sometimes the players can be overwhelmed. And she was
saying in our preparation for your game, I noticed that you guys were running
a lot of patterns, Vivian, maybe you want to let them run it three times in a
row because you know these kids today don't think quite as well or they don't
remember quite as much. And I thought, you know what, that might make a lot of
sense.  
And I've talked to her about very personal things. So we're coaches, but we're
people and human beings. And I appreciate that we relate more as a personal.
But I will try to do my best to take her out Tuesday.  
(Laughter.) You can bet your last dime on that. As she will me too. And we'll
hug afterwards and it hurts. It will hurt her if she wins, but you think that
she's going to take a break on me? Not at all. You know. And I love her still
afterwards. But I will do my best. That's why you see bags on my eyes. I'm
tired. But I will -- I'm going to go at it, believe me.  
  
Q. Earlier Essence spoke about -- spoke very highly of Katie Adams. What
does she mean to the girls on this team and how important is it to have
someone of that character on a team that's so young?  
COACH STRINGER: Katie's been the mom to these players. During the summer when
we were recruiting, Katie has been the person -- well, Katie, Katie told me
this or Katie gave me extra workout. Or Katie said I better not do this. Katie
has been like a mom.  
Katie is as important as you think Kia is or as important as you think Essence
is. Katie is every bit as important. What she says goes. She takes us through
the warmups, they're going to warm up and they're going to warm up the right
way. Why? Because she's a player of truth and of honesty. She has the right to
say anything to anyone. At times it's as -- a simple example, she and Mat are
extremely close. They have been roommates from the beginning. Sometimes if Mat
-- let's say that I'm jumping on Mat about something, and Mat's looking like,
dang, she's just on me. And Katie would just say, you know you're wrong. And,
you know, she can say anything to anyone of these players. She is the most
respected player of all players.  
Why? Because she always does the right thing. She's going to work extra hard.
Several players were able to go to Virgin Islands only because of Katie.
Because while Katie had done her letters and her suicides and all that, when
others mentally were so doggone weak that they couldn't meet minimum
standards, Katie would run the extra time. I would have to say, Katie, just
don't. Or if Brittany is struggling with her shot, it's Katie that's going to
take her out and continue to work on her shot. She's the most giving person.
She knows that as she prepares other people, if you want energy and fire on
your team, that's who you have.  
You want someone that's going to simulate what the other team is going to do.
Knowing that that person's going to get better. Katie deserves and I would bet
that if all of them were to vote and say who do we give the greatest heart
award to, who is the most valuable player to, not talking about the points,
the most valuable player on this team, there is not a doubt in my mind beyond
anyone it would be Katie Adams. Katie is necessary for any team, coach,
organization. She's the ultimate team player. She really is.  
  
Q. I'm sure you can find some artistic beauty in last night's games, but how
would you rebuff critics who said those two semi-finals were ugly
basketball?  
COACH STRINGER: Two semi-finals? I guess that includes ours too.  
(Laughter.) You know what? I really don't care. Because writers write and
coaches coach and players play. It's kind of interesting. Too bad coaches
can't write also. It's just like sometimes people come to our games, I tell
you, one of the most difficult games for us to play is the game to be played
against Villanova. Now people are bored to tears, but as a coach I am so
rewarded because it executes so well and I love the way our team plays
defense. You have to be so exact with angles and all that. I'm a purist, Pat
is a purist. You know, notwithstanding turnovers and things of that sort, most
people want to be entertained. So you want to see a dunk, see the breaks,
well, you can bet your last dime we're going to try and make sure you don't
see dunks and you don't see breaks.  
But, I mean, that's why they write the way that they do. I could care less. I
would hope that everybody could be happy but at this particular point since we
worked so hard we just want to be happy. And happy is winning. I know that Pat
would probably say it was an ugly game, but she's glad she won. I don't know
what everybody said about LSU, it was a defensive game. And we all should he
know that defense wins championships. We know that. So that's what they have
to say, it's too bad.  
  
Q. Just a follow-up to the question, when you started out you talked about
the showcase. This is such a showcase for women's basketball. Not any concern
at all, 50 turnovers in the second game, first game the lowest to score ever,
35, which was your defense, of course, and congratulations on that. But not
any concern as a pioneer of women's sports of how that looked on TV last
night?  
COACH STRINGER: Well, I hear what you're saying but you need to ask yourself
what are you saying? Because at the beginning of the game you hear them say
"star watch." Sylvia Fowles with the beautiful hook the most dominating center
in the country. She can dunk any time. She's finger rolling over the top. You
have to appreciate the athleticism and the beauty of that. So why can't people
get a lot more into, if she does those things, what are they going to do.
Everybody here asked me what we're going to do about Parker. What do you want
me to do? Let her dunk? Would everybody be happy? Then Pat would be sitting
with all the people with orange on, everybody's excited. Hornbuckle is going
behind the back and Shannon Bobbitt is giving you a New York show. Everybody's
happy. But Coach Stringer and crew are not happy. So you know what the star
watch is. I know what that is. If I didn't do something you would say, she's a
dumb coach. Guess what? I can't win. I cannot win. So I'm going to win. Doing
and winning the way that we need to do and get it done.  
So it's about the show, but, I mean, all I can say to you, and most of you
know that during the NBA games the guys don't play any defense. You know they
don't. All-Star Game, everybody's happy. 125, 135 points, did you see what
Kobe did? Kobe did this, he did that. When it gets down to the championship
you see some real basketball because the game is offense and the game is
defense. And so the turnovers, I mean, as you can see those teams were
pressing, they were playing so hard. They were pressing so hard. I don't know
what else you can do. Now maybe you would say on the official side of it that
the officials need to call it much tighter. Maybe they call it earlier. I
don't know. But I just hope that whatever the heck they do, they go ahead and
are very consistent with both us and Tennessee. That's all I'm asking for. If
you're going to be loose, let it be loose. If we're going to have a slugfest,
let it happen. If it's going to be smooth, but make sure it's on both sides,
and you can't tell it, and let the chips fall where they may.  
But I think you have to appreciate the beauty of the great athletes that are
there, and yet you have to appreciate the real determination on the defensive
side of the ball.  
  
Q. In a different topic, when you got to Rutgers, I believe they were still
called the Lady -- were they not called the Lady Scarlet Knights, I believe?
And you ended that immediately. What do you think about this Lady thing, this
being 2007?  
COACH STRINGER: Well, let me say that I understand that that's something more
regional or southern in that respect. And with all due respect, then that
should be the way that it is. If that's the way everybody likes to refer to
it. I just believe that basketball is basketball. And you don't need to make a
distinction. I think that we should be good enough, Coach Chaney and I used to
practice together. And we never made a distinction between the girls, this and
that. He and I were -- when I say practice, we would run 10-minute scrimmages
of the matchup zone. And the guys -- a guy by the name of Andrew Fields, who
was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers would tell the press that he learned his
jump shot from Valerie Walker, who was probably one of the finest jump
shooters in the country. She was shooting at four point range when she was way
back when. And here she is 6-1, 6-2, handled the ball like a point guard. He
didn't have any shame of that because Coach Chaney as a male taught him to
appreciate basketball is basketball.  
And so I just believe in equality of people. Not male and female. I don't
think that -- for example, that a woman should be paid less or more. I think
that you should be judged strictly on the quality of the work that you do. No
one could work harder than these young ladies when I'm practicing them at
4:35. We have had to get up at 4:00 to practice at 5:30. And they need gas and
food in their bellies and it doesn't say, well, you only weigh 120 pounds so
you only have to pay 99 cents a gallon for the gas. It's the same.  
So I just don't see a distinction. If we're going to play basketball, let's
play basketball. If our game isn't nice and pretty or as is not as it should
be, if we're not making passes, we don't need to see jump, throwing the ball
all over the floor, rolling all over the place. But, likewise, I just want
people to be respected irrespective of black, white, purple or green, male or
female, to be paid and appreciated in the same way. And the thing that I would
do most for everybody is I wish that more fans would come out and really
support women's basketball.  
We do have a responsibility to make it entertaining, and that's what I'm
saying, that, no, I'm not talking about a slugfest because this was not poor
basketball; it was just great defense and it was just a bit much. But I think
that people should come out and just support the sport. There would need to be
a lot more promotions and I think that some of the numbers and the attendance
that you saw at the other Regional sites has so much more to do with the fact
that fans as a rule with women's basketball tend to support their teams rather
than have appreciation for the sport. And you when you look at a Connecticut
executing and a Tennessee executing and as so many of the teams across the
country, at Duke, you know, there have been so many great teams and I just
think that it's time to, on my side of it, just me, you know, just me, just
drop the Lady thing, let's play basketball.  
  
Q. Let me take you back again to '82. You played Rutgers twice that season.
Manufacturers Hanover Classic, they beat you and they lost to Louisiana Tech I
think in the first night. You got them again two months later and you beat
them up. What do you remember about that Rutgers team and a 32- or 33-year-old
Theresa Grentz?  
COACH STRINGER: Well first of all, in the Manufacturers Hanover Classic, I
don't think that I was coaching. My daughter, Janine, was in intensive care
for six months. I was in the hospital. That was probably -- and I didn't leave
the hospital. That was probably in Madison Square Garden. We found out that
she had contracted meningitis in November or Thanksgiving. So I wasn't with
the team. It was amazing, too, because so much of the dreams that I had I've
not been able to be a part of. I remember my team coming to the hospital to
see me. But no, wow. So that hurt me because I would love to have coached and,
yeah, I think it was at Madison Square Garden. Vivian was never there.  
  
Q. What about Theresa, what do you remember?  
COACH STRINGER: She was great Coach. Fiery. She's living and she's doing a
great job. In fact, I think it was her game against Purdue or someone that was
impressive and just great. She's been Rutgers basketball, the spirit of
Rutgers basketball, deserves all recognition. She was the first female that
was ever paid. I thought that Fred as an athletic director had tremendous
foresight and that was the first time they ever paid a female coach.  
So many of our women coaches and men's coaches have been pioneers. She has
been. She's been a leader. And I was stunned that she left Rutgers. Actually
she and I talked and she was thinking about that. And what I remember about
her is being a very considerate and kind person. She and Rene Portland brought
their Rutgers and Penn State team, their teams to the hospital to see me. And
we go back and I really appreciate that. Because I didn't leave the hospital
and I knew that she was genuine. That was a time when coaches could be a lot
more human beings. Right now you can't do that. You got to look at tapes. But
she showed me the kind of support that she had, she and her team had for me.  
And really I think that people -- unfortunately I think people, writers, all
these people from the outside try to battle this and battle that. But I really
-- I work hard to try to help everybody to remember that we're still people,
human beings. She's a great coach. A good person. And I'm not surprised about
her having a stellar career. However, I remember her even more as a great
player at Immaculata because I started coaching -- like Cheyney was the first
job I had, so I never coached anywhere else, but that was the most dominant
center, she was mean. She was just mean. I always saw a scowl on her face and
she just took care of business. But I had a lot of respect for her and always
have and always will. And, you know, I'm glad to continue to try to keep the
connection between the Scarlet Knights and what we're trying to do going.  
  
Q. Would you talk about Kia and her development since she's been there and
how important she's been through this tournament run for you guys.  
COACH STRINGER: Kia has been incredible. I think that she's much more
confident. Kia's heart starts to flutter and her eyes start to blink and you
really have to settle her down. I am very careful when I speak to the team
because I have been known to be a motivator to the point where the players can
feel like, wow, we could just accomplish all things. But sometimes if I can
fire you up so much that someone like Kia might be too emotionally strung out,
so I try to just try to tone everything and speak specifically of what has to
happen. Because she takes a tremendous burden. I can't even tell you. She --
there were a few things -- and let me give you a example. There were a few
things that I wanted to do a little differently because Kia can shoot the ball
very well. But she can probably move around the 3-point range and just stroke
it and I probably put as much matchup zone on her as I would some of our
guards, let's say it like that. You all have not seen that.  
So but in this one game to take the post away from the basket, I was going to
have her come to the high post and start hitting those shots and bringing the
four down. Heather just reversed the positions. And she was so upset, tears
started coming from her eyes because we had changed something and she just
wanted to be -- she just wanted to do the right thing. And I said, Relax,
whatever we're doing, we're doing, we'll do it. Next year you'll see a lot of
other things. But Mary Anne has done a great job in helping her to understand
herself more as a player.  
And, again, a great credit goes to her. To the to all of the assistants who
have helped the guards to deliver the right passes, Kia, to really finish with
her. She's a much more confident player. Much more confident. I was really
pleased at the way she held herself with Fowles. She pump faked, she let her
come down and took her time. And believe me, she has great range and you'll
see a lot more from her and a lot of that has to do with her work against
Courtney Paris. I remember Essence Carson calling me from Mexico saying,
Coach, you're going to be pleased with Kia because Kia really hasn't in
practice been able to bang against someone her size and to know. Courtney
Paris, I'm sure really helped her a lot. By the time she got finished knocking
her around and by the time her arm got dislocated I think that Kia knew that
she had got to get tough and tougher. And that's the difference.  
  
Q. You mentioned before a little while ago how you got athletes or a little
bit more willing to run this year and push tempo. But it seemed like last
night after you guys got the lead, half court defense and especially on the
offensive end a lot of half court offense kind of shortened up the game like
that. If you guys can get a lead on Tennessee tomorrow night are you going to
try to dictate tempo like that again or do you want to run with them?  
COACH STRINGER: We will do one of two things. We will either put our foot on
the gas and get in the car and drive you out of control, you know, or we'll
get back we're not going to become a passenger. We can't become a passenger.
We got to dictate some things. And there's several ways that we can do that.
Either by the half court defense presses or the full court defenses and
presses. We need to know whether or not we run, we have to run at our own
speed but we can't try to run faster than what we have control of.  
I think that Matee just naturally likes to get out and go. Now, I don't know
what the heck she was thinking about last night because she started putting --
instead of her just one or two and kicking it up to the wings, she wasn't --
she was keeping her hands on the ball. Way too long. And we wanted to try to
push the ball up the floor. We will always try to do that. We'll try to score
in transition. That's what we do. But we're trying to not go out of control.
We'll just go ahead and go at the speed that we need to go and try to either
speed them up or slow it down.  
I think smart teams will do what we did. They will milk the clock and take the
shot with the lead. That's going to allow them to either drive to the inside
or like as Coach said, as you may have seen, we've jacked it up a couple times
real quick. But that's not what you do to win games. You're trying to win a
game. So we'll shorten it up of course.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the aura that sort of surrounds the Tennessee program
and how you kind of -- do you think your team will be affected by it or
because your team is so young they may not realize?  
COACH STRINGER: This team is very young. I have to remember sometimes some of
the words that I use. I mean, I look at them and they look real blank. So.  
(Laughter.) Really, you know, Coach will talk to me and say, Vivian, they
don't know what you're talking about. And they're very innocent. I mean,
people that I know to be great, they don't know. Tennessee, see what they do
is they relate -- like, for example, Epiphanny's best friend is the young lady
at UConn. They call each other after every game, the center, you know and the
other power forward. They're all great friends. I'm not surprised about the --
by the time in this day and age the way it's happening now these kids are
playing together during the summer. They may compete against each other during
the AAU's. Sometimes they encourage each other to go to each other's schools.
But in the summer they spend time going to Argentina or whatever. It becomes a
for USA basketball, it becomes a matter of them having a appreciation so they
have to become teammates. Also so they just have an appreciation for one
another and it's our job just to give them information and go fight for their
school and they will be technically -- they will just be technically sound.
They will just be technically sound.  
  
Q. When you were talking about Shannon Bobbitt she said she gives you a New
York show. Describe what a New York show is. Describe it in terms of both
Shannon and Epiphanny, the point guards, the particular thing that a point
guard gives you as a New York show a point guard or a two guard?  
COACH STRINGER: Well, we don't see a New York show from Epiphanny Prince. You
don't even see a high five. The girl barely raises her arm above her shoulders
when she's going through the line. You know how everybody does a 360 and hit a
hip or something like that? Epiphanny is very shy, quiet, drops her head. You
have to -- she's very smart so she will you have to catch what she just said.
But she doesn't -- that's not her.  
Shannon, you know, that might be Shannon's thing, you know. So she will do
that and talk some stuff. You have never seen Epiphanny say boo. You haven't
seen Epiphanny -- in fact, you know, she will be -- one day she was running
down the steps and trying to get to downstairs and one of the coaches said,
why are you running? Well, Mat's going to get on me if I'm one minute late.
She's the kind of person that is going to ask you, can I go to the bathroom? I
really have to go. Can I take a shower in the other place because it's too
cold in the other spot? She is just is a very -- she more or less is like the
person that comes off of Walton's mountain with John-boy, Walton's mountain,
you know. One of the writers referred to something about Ferris Buehler's Day
Off or whatever. She didn't know what they were talking about.  
These kids are young. They're into other things. I don't know what to say
other than the fact that if it's a New York show it will be Shannon. I think
that Epiphanny will give you a very solid, intelligent basketball game in the
purest sense. We'll see her running her. We won't see her running her mouth or
anything. Matee, you never seen her one time look at somebody like look what I
just did? You know you're not going to see her pluck her shirt. You know
you're not going to see that. Essence Carson, that's not in her nature. I was
stunned because she's the spokesperson for this group. We have worked for two
years for her. She's a straight-A student, but she never spoke. I said that
she texts 90 percent of the time until she realized that I wasn't going to
play her until -- unless she started talking to me.  
So probably the person that has the most outgoing personality is Kia. And with
Kia, Kia, Kia is so strong that you can see the fight -- you know the proudest
moment? You know when I knew she had arrived is when I saw a picture in one of
our newspapers and you could see Essence's finger, the hand's clenched, and
she said, Finally. When I saw tears coming from her eyes when she shot a foul
shot, when I saw Kia jump in the air and you could see that fight, teams that
I've had before have always shown their emotions. This group really doesn't.
You see Mat, you never see a change on her face. She might make a 360 pass.
You never see -- she got these oval eyes, she sees out of the side of her
head. She's like a snake. She's looking at you like this and she's just like
this. I mean, it's amazing. You don't see any change in expressions.  
Most of the time I think that they're not ready to play because she got this
little -- Heather, Heather will not try to lift her head up because she got
real little eyes and keeps her head down like this. I said, Heather, I know
one thing, you better not be going to sleep on me. Her as well as Mat, they
just look like they're sleeping. And then you say what you say and they say,
okay, let's go. You know.  
But they're very subdued. This is a very much like no other team that I've
coached. So I decided to fit more to them than them trying to conform to me.
Because they're not the kind of people that show much emotion. You'll probably
see it at the end of the game, but there's not one Brittany Ray, if I don't
say Brittany, tap her on her shoulder and make her answer, she's, yeah, no,
whatever you want to say. That's how they do. So it's just the style. Just
this group of kids' style and it's probably good for me and for them too.  
  
Q. You kind of touched on this a bit earlier, about how playing defense
isn't glamorous especially in this day and age. How have you been able to
impress upon your players that this type of defensive mentality is the right
way to go, the best way to go?  
COACH STRINGER: Because every time we see a team play and they look like the
next coming of Michael Jordan, the next question, and I'll run that clip back
and say, Now let's consider what's going on here. If this player got the ball
and they got a finger roll they got a hook shot, this or that, let's determine
whether or not there was any pressure. Was there? No. Somebody comes up they
just like bend over, get their head down, and so let's apply pressure when you
want to win. So this is what we have got to do if you just stand behind
someone and when they have got nice moves like that, then they're going to be
able to do that.  
But you need to play a side, force an angle and force the target to be a
moving target. Not something just standing there. And letting things happen.
So in wanting to win, and in trying to protect one another, knowing,
recognizing the Sylvia Fowles' show, we're going to have to drop two people on
her. Okay, but if they start to have the four starts to hit the shot, then we
got to be able to rotate. We're prepared. We have gone over these things a lot
of times. But right now it hurts so bad to lose that it doesn't take much to
figure out that we want to win and we'll do what we have to do.  
  
Q. Vivian, in the book that the season has begun, is it appropriate that
Tennessee be the last chapter? Of all the teams that you could be playing?  
COACH STRINGER: Wait a minute. Are you -- did you write a book?  
  
Q. No, I didn't write a book yet.  
COACH STRINGER: Oh.  
  
Q. I'm just saying if you looked at the season as a book and every game is a
chapter, is it appropriate that the final chapter be called Tennessee and not
something else?  
COACH STRINGER: Yeah. This is going to be for a great story line, isn't it? I
mean you should get together and collaborate. You'll benefit from all of this.
Over the years.  
But as I said to you before, it's only appropriate -- it's appropriate for so
many reasons, and they're too numerous to mention. It's only appropriate that
we should play Tennessee. And it should be the last chapter in the end story,
the end. I think that all of us have seen so many coaching greats retire and I
have been personally hurt to see so many of our coaches who have just been the
fiber of this profession leave. Pat is a staple. And I hope that we continue
to remember that. And some of us have just been around to do the right -- to
continue to stay. But I think it was a passion and a drive in your heart. I
can think of no more appropriate team, honestly. It started with Tennessee, in
my mind, you know, and it should end that way. So, yes, the end. You and I can
come up with a book and we'll work on it.  
  
Q. Two part question. You alluded earlier to attendance for women's
basketball games. Can you speak to your experience in the Greensboro Region
Final and during and your impressions of the turnout when you played Arizona
State. And, secondly, your thoughts on the discussions of moving the women's
tournament back a week to give it more visibility?  
COACH STRINGER: Exposure. Yeah. That's probably the reason why I mentioned
that. Because the fans were just great. It's kind of interesting. I thought
that it was interesting all the clips that I continue to see of Rutgers team,
not very many and they should have shown us all the time. Because every venue
that we played in it has been packed. Whether it's Michigan State, or whether
it's at North Carolina -- they keep showing these clips and I see empty seats.
I think that basketball fans unfortunately are fans of their particular team.
I think that men have a lot more following of basketball is basketball. So you
don't have to be from Georgetown, you're still going to come and see a
Georgetown-Ohio State game played. You know what, I mean, and that's what we
got to draw. And I really want this to be a direction and I know the NCAA
knows this, but whether they have to put more matchup zone or try to encourage
our athletic directors, our presidents and that to do a heck of a better job
of promoting teams because it's unfair. There is not that push the way that it
should. In the meantime, all you can do is take care of your particular fan
base. Duke, Rutgers, Connecticut and the likes. But when we played Arizona
State, you got a chance to see that. Because, I mean, I know they were
hurting, but still they didn't come to see Rutgers and Arizona state play.  
So that's why I said that. The idea I think that's been kicked around with the
ESPN about moving the game back so that it doesn't compete with the men's
game, I think that that's possible. They're concerned about going into the
golf and going into the start of preseason baseball. There are a lot of things
to be considered. But for sure we need our own show. We need our own show. And
as the game continues to grow, Candace Parker is good for the game. Sylvia
Fowles is good for the game. Ajavon is good for the game. So many players.  
I just think that we really got to have the good minds and the people to
promote the sport the way they should to really get together and talk about
how. Because all of you are here obviously care enough about what's going on
but we have got to do -- I think I could be real happy to see that we are
enjoying the same kind of attendance once we -- where would we go, wherever we
go. And that becomes the coaches have a job to coach, we're doing that. The
players are continuing to work to get these players to be better because we
have a job to entertain.  
But I do think that the administrative side of everything, NCAA, the
universities, have got a much more of a responsibility to promote this sport.
The matchup zone can be made in women's basketball. If other people would
believe and work to support it the way that it should. But it's not being
done. And I just have to say that and I'll take this opportunity to say that
we need to make a much bigger step because whatever we're doing is not enough.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH STRINGER: You're welcome. Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2007

  

### [Alexis Hornbuckle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16879)

### [Candace Parker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16368)

### [Pat Summitt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14068)

  
_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with a opening statement from
Coach Summitt.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, obviously to win at this level I think you have to have
great defensive pressure and influence. And I thought our defense was the key.
And the fact that we played them tough on the boards, I think, what, we
outrebounded them by one. And going into the game and we just kept talking
about the importance of stopping their transition, making them spend more time
in the court-to-court offense and just rebounding, rebounding, rebounding.  
And defensively I thought a big key for us was Sidney Spencer's defense on
Erlana Larkins.  
The fact that Erlana, which is their go-to player, was 2-4, I think that's a
very telling stat. And I give our inside people a lot of credit, as well as
our perimeter people for pressuring the basketball. And at the 8-minute mark I
basically said, We don't want to go home. They didn't want to go home. And I
said, We're not leaving here without a national championship.  
And I just saw a different -- I just saw a whole different attitude with this
team, the defense, and it started with Alexis and obviously with Shannon in
the back court. But it filtered throughout our team. Really, really excited
that we have a chance to be in this national championship game and play for a
championship.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Candace and Alexis, both, if y'all would just address, was it frustrating
for you in particular thinking the ball was never going to drop for you there
for the longest time?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: Well, it's frustrating as a player to get so many open
looks and I had a lot of long layups that just rolled out. But at the same
time I'm not the type of player that dwells on my offense. I just decided to
pick it up on the defensive end and crash the boards and try to be a emotional
leader for my team.  
CANDACE PARKER: And I feel like without my game against LSU, where I shot
2-15, and had like five rebounds, I feel like I hurt my team. And I knew that
although the ball wasn't falling for me, there's other things that I'm capable
of doing. And I feel like I'm thankful that I learned my lesson previous to
the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. When the game goes the way this one did for 34 minutes, when it may have
seemed like you were slugging your way uphill, what changed in those last six
minutes? What did you guys say to each other, what did Coach say to you? What
changed?  
CANDACE PARKER: To be honest with you we just did not want to go home. I mean,
we were looking back and at each other and just saying all the stuff that we
have been through to get to this point and not seize the moment would just be
a total waste. And we just really wanted it. And everybody on the floor, on
the bench, everybody in the stands wanted it. And when you have that, I mean
it's hard not to fight for your team.  
  
Q. To any of you, is that the kind of game you expected after having played
them before? The turnovers and -- between two teams that are averaging like
close to 160 points or more?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: It was the type of game we expected. In December I know
Tennessee was a different team. We were the type of team we relied on our
offense and we let our offense affect our defense and we just learned from
that throughout the season and realized this team is beatable. They have
weakness. We just need to exploit them. And we relied strictly on our defense
tonight and let everything else fall into place.  
  
Q. Candace, talk about the crowd and how much that helped with the momentum
when you guys started cutting into that lead in the last couple minutes
there?  
CANDACE PARKER: Our crowd is huge for us. And they have been there for my
whole career and for this whole season.  
You always look up in the crowd and you can see a whole bunch of orange. And
they were very big in our comeback.  
  
Q. You guys are very familiar with Rutgers. Candace, could you talk about
some of the special challenges that they present and especially defensively.  
CANDACE PARKER: Rutgers is playing some of the best basketball right now. They
have peaked at the right time. I haven't seen them play a lot previously to
the NCAA tournament but I know that they're a very defensive-minded team. And
they shot the ball great today. So obviously they have a lot of weapons in
Matee Ajavon and Essence Carson and Kia Vaughn. So we have our work cut out
for us.  
  
Q. Candace, you said on TV that there's a drought, you mentioned a drought.
Is that something you've talked about that it's been too long since Tennessee
won the championship?  
CANDACE PARKER: I think everybody wearing orange will say it's been way too
long. It's been way too long since Tennessee has won a national championship.
And I'm tired of going into Thompson Boling Arena and playing on the Summit
and not looking up and seeing a banner that has all our names written all over
it.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll take questions for the coach.  
COACH SUMMITT: Nick, you got off. You did a good job playing defense, so.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Both games today, you at the outset talked about defense, but I think the
word suffocating defense might be the right word for both of these games. In
fact, you may not know this, but your shooting percentage was the lowest ever
for a team that won a Final Four. All four teams out there today just --  
COACH SUMMITT: So we're in the record book again? I like that.  
  
Q. Well, I probably should have brought that up.  
COACH SUMMITT: It ain't pretty, but we're there.  
  
Q. But what about -- I don't think there's a coach on the face of this
earth, male or female, that doesn't always talk defense first. But is it a
cliche or does it always come down to defense at this time of the year?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think it is really two-fold. I think that it comes down to
defense and rebounding.  
Obviously I really feel like in some of the championships that we have won we
have not shot the basketball particularly well. But we have influenced how our
opponents played and how they shot the ball as well.  
Defense is obviously given us a lot of offensive opportunities and it did in
this game. It gave us a chance to make the kind of run that we made. Again, I
just -- I felt like we had a influence on North Carolina in this game. We
didn't have any influence on them when we played them at North Carolina. They
pretty much had their way with us.  
I would say this, I just thought our team about midway of the season decided
that they were going to allow their defense to be a number one priority. More
than their rebounding.  
Fortunately, that's what's happened for us. And without that, we couldn't have
beaten this North Carolina team. They're a great basketball team and we did
some good things, if you look at the number of shots that some of the players
got and also some of the percentage, they struggled like we did to make shots.  
  
Q. We can talk about withering defense all we want. But it was kind of ugly
out there. Both games. And this being the showcase for women's sports, the
nation watching, what have you, is there any concern that this is except for
those last few minutes which were very exciting but even then still a little
messy, any concern that you have as a -- one of the legend of women's sports
that this would be what would be displayed for the nation today?  
COACH SUMMITT: I am not the least bit concerned about that style of play. I
think people that understand basketball would have a great deal of respect for
the intensity and the defense that these two teams brought to the court. And
also understand that we influenced each other because of our defense.  
And it seems like I watched the men's game last night that wasn't quite as
fluid early on. But I think that if you understand the game, then you
understand what happened tonight. Yeah, people like to see a lot of points put
up on the board. But they may not be people that really understand the game.  
  
Q. Obviously you faced one of your best friends now for the national
championship. It's early, but any thoughts about what it would be like to go
up against Coach Stringer with these stakes on the line?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, Sylvia Hatchell was on my staff at Tennessee as a grad
student. We're both in grad school together and she coached my junior varsity
team. Sylvia and I have been great friends. Vivian and I are great friends. I
have tremendous respect for both of them and really have just enjoyed the
friendship that we have shared, but certainly I know Vivian is going to have
her team ready and prepared. I know how much that she wants to win. And she
wants her team to win a national championship. And I feel the same way.  
Regardless of what happens in that game, we'll be friends. I'm proud for what
Vivian has done. She's been great for this game, she's won and brought teams
to the Final Fours from three different programs. And I've stayed at the same
place for 33 years. So she's done a lot more things than I have, but at the
same time it will be great to see Rutgers in that game and see Vivian Stringer
on the stage because she's certainly deserves it with the job she's done with
a young basketball team that she has just really brought along and she has
them believing they can win a national championship. And obviously their
defense is really, really tough. So it should be a great game.  
  
Q. With, what, little over eight minutes it's 48-36, at that point the way
the scoring's going there's not going to be much scoring, you're down 12, are
you thinking it's still doable? And to get back you practically had to shut
them out and that's what you did. And kind of a follow-up to that, where does
this rank in the comebacks you've seen your team have and in high-stake
situations like this?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I really felt like that at that time there was a lot of
time and a lot of possessions left. And I knew that we had some players that
were a little frustrated, but we just -- we brought a lot of energy from the
bench. Our staff, my staff was tremendous. We kept talking about we can do
this. We will do this.  
As I said, we just talked about what we had to do on the floor and they
responded. And in trying to keep everyone really positive, because Alexis was
really struggling. She struggled in the last couple games with her shooting.
But I said, We have to win this with defense. We're going to have to win this
with our defense. And our rebounding. In order to get easy scoring
opportunities. And at that time I definitely thought, I mean, I thought it was
doable and then I started to feel with our defensive pressure that it was
beginning to be effective and we were starting to see the momentum change.  
  
Q. Where does this rank maybe in some of the comebacks?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, you ask me today, it's probably one of best wins of my
career, since you asked me today. But it's all part of getting to the national
championship game. And obviously this was huge today. The main thing is I'm
just proud for this team. Because they have played the toughest schedule in
the country, they have been tough, they have been together, they're committed
to defense and rebounding. And they're committed to each other. And I just --
I want it for them.  
More than anything, I want it for them. And they know we're working hard as a
staff and I've got a tremendous staff to help not only teach and coach, but
inspire these young women and we just got to be ready to play and hopefully
we're a little more efficient.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for joining us. We'll see you tomorrow.  
COACH SUMMITT: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2007

  

### [Sylvia Hatchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15656)

### [Ivory Latta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15658)

  
_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with a opening statement by Coach and then go to
questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH HATCHELL: I'm extremely proud of my team. I felt like we should have won
the game. We have never lost to a team when they shot 27 percent. I feel like
defensively we did the job when you hold a team to 27 percent.  
I'm really disappointed. And just really proud of my team. So that's really
about it.  
THE MODERATOR: Again, we'll take questions for our student-athletes first.  
  
Q. Ivory, what was it like to sit on the bench there in the first half for
so long and just not be a able to be out on the court affecting the game
there?  
IVORY LATTA: It was very -- I was just hurting because I couldn't be out there
with my team and help them get through it. But Alex did a great job of leading
the way and it just hurts so bad right now.  
  
Q. Ivory, can you talk about the defense that Tennessee put on you guys in
the last eight minutes?  
IVORY LATTA: I could just say they played aggressive defense. We was trying to
get the ball to Erlana in the post. They was definitely fronting her and
doubleteaming and they just played aggressive defense.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much for joining us. You guys can head back to
the locker room. Take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Was there anything that you saw that in the end of the game that reminded
you at all of the final regular season game against Duke where you had the
lead going into the last couple minutes and then couldn't score down the
stretch?  
COACH HATCHELL: Were we at the same game? No. They put extreme pressure on us
and we -- it's hard for us whenever Camille and LaToya are sitting on the
bench with five fouls.  
We got all of our subs in there because we don't have our regular players out
there because they have all fouled out. So it's hard to execute. So we were
trying to get the ball into Erlana and then we just started driving and I wish
if I had it to do over we had just every time just drove straight to the
basket and at least tried to get on the foul line a little bit. Because they
shot 26, we shot eight.  
At least I would have at least tried to get us on the foul line a little bit
and maybe that would have worked some.  
But they, again, we were trying to get ball inside but it's hard for us to
function whenever LaToya and Camille are sitting over there on the bench.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit LaToya and Camille, the job they did on Parker
for most of the game.  
COACH HATCHELL: Yeah, I thought they did a great job. The best offense she had
was the foul line offense. So I thought we did a great job on her defensively.
So I was real proud of the job they did.  
  
Q. You scored some -- to take that lead in the second half you scored some
fastbreak points that seemed to help you get such a big lead. Can you explain
maybe did Tennessee maybe do something to take that away near the end of the
game?  
COACH HATCHELL: We got some steals and we got some fastbreaks off the steals.
And we got the ball out. We were running the floor pretty good, especially
Rashanda McCants. And then when Camille and -- I think that we were -- we
might have -- we should have been more aggressive.  
Like I said, if I had to do over we would have just taken the ball to the
basket and not tried to get the ball inside. We just brought it down the floor
and then would have taken it until they -- if they picked us up defensively
and tried to draw some fouls and then get some just some kickouts. Because it
was hard for us to run anything because they were denying everything,
especially the passes into the post. And we were dribbling the ball too much.
We weren't passing it, moving it around. We were dribbling the ball too much.
But again, they had us a little bit out of synch and that's usually what we do
to people. But again, they shot 27 percent. So I was really proud of our
defense and the difference in the game was on the foul line. Let's be honest.  
  
Q. I was just wondering if you were surprised when you looked at the stats
being how physical the game was, that you only shot 8 free throws?  
COACH HATCHELL: Yes. I was very disappointed more than anything else. But, you
know, it's just the way it is.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH HATCHELL: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2007

  

### [Sylvia Fowles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15650)

### [Bob Starkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17183)

### [Erica White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16371)

  
_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with a opening statement from Coach Starkey and
then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH STARKEY: Well first thing I would like to do is congratulate Rutgers. I
thought they obviously had a game plan that was very well executed, let the
kids play hard.  
Obviously I hurt for our team and our fans and our administration. But I
couldn't be more happy for somebody like Coach Stringer, who I have a great
respect for a long time and realize tomorrow or Tuesday will be the first time
that she will have a opportunity to play in a championship game and that's a
good thing. I'm extremely proud of our kids. We talked about a couple things
in the locker room. The most important was they didn't need to judge
themselves based on this one outing. That they need to look at the entire body
of work.  
I told them that you don't have to win championships to be champions. And in
my eyes they're champions. We talked a little bit about the Apollo 13 movie
that we used for motivation, and even with that, their goal was to go to the
moon and I guess ours was too but what sometimes things happen and change and
the crew was supposed to bring the ship back safely.  
And I thought that's what our team did. I thought we brought our program back
to LSU, we have accomplished a lot of things and we have done it in a positive
way and I'm extremely, extremely proud of them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sylvia, Coach Stringer did pay you nice compliments and said that she
feels that you're the best center in the country. I imagine you don't feel
quite like that tonight. What did they do to you to take you out of your game
and have you had a game that you can recall that was like that?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Not taking anything from Rutgers defense, but I don't feel that
they, I don't feel that they had to do much. I just think I had a sluggish
game from the get-go and couldn't get in rhythm and I couldn't do anything to
help my team out from the jump ball.  
  
Q. Erica, they made a lot of shots early. They made a lot of shots with
hands in their face. They made a lot of 3s. Were you guys you were out there,
it wasn't like you didn't get out there. What does that do to a team? I don't
want to say does it deflate you or does it have at least a momentarily
depressing effect or did you guys just play through that?  
ERICA WHITE: A we just tried to play through it. And our saying tonight was we
want to keep an even keel and don't know any negative emotions. If they hit a
shot with a hand in their face you just say good shot. And you just come out
and try to run the offense. And I commend them, they hit tough shots tonight.  
  
Q. Sylvia, you said you couldn't do anything from the get-go from the jump
ball, it looked like you were still kind of tying your shoes when the jump
ball went up and it was like that almost set a whole mood for the team maybe
she basically took that jump ball without any opposition, were you kind of not
ready, not into the game the way you thought you would be?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I was into the game. Just couldn't get into a rhythm.  
  
Q. Sylvia, how physical was Kia Vaughn against you and how much did they
surround you with extra players?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Kia Vaughn is a tremendous defensive player. She gave her all
and she did all she had to do to keep me off the box and keep me off the
boards. And about doubling and triple teaming, what are, but it really don't
matter. I saw that all year and it didn't play a big effect.  
  
Q. Erica, after all you've been through since March 8 or March 9, do you
think it finally caught up to you, all the emotions that have been going
through your head that all of a sudden after playing so well to this point
that it all caught up to you you just came out and played plat flat?  
ERICA WHITE: I don't think so. We didn't play our best tonight and they shot
the ball extremely well and I think that's what happened here tonight and
nothing else.  
We just had a bad game. And it happened at the worst possible time. But I
don't think we have anything to be ashamed of and I told my teammates, you
know, people will say LSU has gone to the Final Four four years in a row and
have lost, but we're getting to the hump, so the fact that we can't get over
the hump, I think we should be proud of getting here and we definitely have
nothing to be ashamed of.  
  
Q. Erica, a couple of the stats that are obvious not in your favor in this
game, obviously the shooting, and then Rutgers out rebounded you guys. Could
you just talk about those two things and what was going on during the game.  
ERICA WHITE: Rutgers hit tough shots. They hit shots with a hand in their face
and I commend them for that. They shot the ball extremely well tonight. We
definitely had our nights like that, not tonight. But when a team's shooting
the ball that well, there's pretty much nothing you can do. We tried to
contest it and I think we did that. They just hit the tough shots. They out
rebounded us and we wanted to own the paint but we obviously didn't do that.
And yeah, I just commend them, they played well tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you to both our student-athletes. We'll take questions
for the coach.  
  
Q. All the screens they were able to set with their big people outside it
made it really tough for your defenders to get around. What did you try to do
to combat that or to adjust to that. But even when you got a hand in their
face they were still hitting them.  
COACH STARKEY: I want to go over a couple things first, because I think it's
really important along those lines. I think that one of the things that got us
off to the bad start was our game plan. And I'm responsible for that.  
One of the things we wanted to do is we wanted to play inside out on screens
and take the dribble penetration, the paint away. So in playing that way we
allowed them to get some open looks early that I didn't think were contested
and they weren't contested because we weren't trying to contest them.  
They came out and hit those shots early and it gave them some confidence.  
After that they were hitting some tough shots. One of the things that they did
bother us with was the ball screen plays up top. Early on we were sliding
through and I thought we made a adjustment to trap and I thought we hurt them
a little bit, but obviously the damage had been done.  
  
Q. What do you think happened to Sylvia?  
COACH STARKEY: That's a good question. Every now and then Sylvia gets
frustrated. She doesn't hit her first shot or she doesn't get a call or and
sometimes for whatever reason it's difficult for her to play through.  
She's done that in the past. She doesn't do it nearly as much as she used to.
And I think that's a positive thing.  
But obviously the goal next year I would think would be for her to work
through that on a consistent basis where it never affects her.  
  
Q. Did Rutgers do anything different defensively against her that you hadn't
seen or anything or just did it better?  
COACH STARKEY: Nothing new at all. They played man-to-man. They blocked off
our four player which was either Ashley Thomas or Porsha Phillips and doubled
her up and we probably have seen that nine out of ten times when we play. And
I thought they did a good job of it. I don't think we were necessarily
mentally sharp in terms of what we needed to do offensively. When teams play
us like that we need to reverse the basketball a little bit more and get a few
more people some touches, make them guard us. The best possession for us was
the first possession of the second half when we told our kids that we wanted
five passes and two ball reversals. And we did that and we got the dump into
Sylvia and she got the lay-up. It was just a little frustrating that we didn't
try and go about that a lot more often.  
  
Q. What's next for you? Did you say good-bye to the players or how does that
work with the head coach not being here and you not being interested in the
job?  
COACH STARKEY: I haven't given much thought obviously to that. My next thing
is to go back to the hotel and pack and get on the plane with the team
tomorrow. I did tell the team that if I never coached again that I was
thrilled that this was the last team that I coached. And if I coached for 20
more years, I would never forget what they had accomplished.  
So I think that's important for them to know. And I don't know what's ahead
for me. But I was tickled to death to be a part of them. I told -- my high
school coach was here tonight and I made the comment to him that I didn't take
them to the Final Four, they took me. And there really is a lot of truth to
that. I'm awful proud of them.  
  
Q. The fact that you have everybody or LSU has everybody coming back next
year, how do you think this team will remember tonight and use it as
motivation?  
COACH STARKEY: Let me tell you something. This was a great thing I thought. It
was a very emotional locker room. Every kid was crying. And this is the fourth
Final Four we have been to. We have lost three previous Final Fours and I
never seen a tear in there. This team really cared about each other. I think
they were not just crying for themselves, but crying for each other. And I
think it will be a great motivational factor for them. I think you'll see that
they will have a great off season, Sylvia leaves on Friday for Italy to go
work with USA Basketball. We, there's a lot of great things in place at LSU
from our strength program to our trainer and these kids, they're wonderful.
They're going to work hard. I think that obviously this team's best days are
ahead of it.  
  
Q. The question was asked of one of the players, do you think that at times
like this it can be a relief to finally be done or do you think any of that
factored in the way you guys played tonight?  
COACH STARKEY: No. I don't think that factored into it at all. I really think
that we came out and played poorly on a night against a good opponent who
played extremely well.  
I think if there was relief that it was over, the locker room wouldn't have
been emotional, there wouldn't have been all those tears. I think it hurt and
I think that's a good hurt. I'm glad they hurt. I think that's important in
terms of them being competitive and being able to take that next step. I think
this team is more prepared to take the next step than any team that we have
had prior.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH STARKEY: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2007

  

### [Matee Ajavon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17190)

### [Essence Carson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17191)

### [C. Vivian Stringer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16227)

### [Kia Vaughn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17192)

  
_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with a opening statement from Coach Stringer and
then we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH STRINGER: Wow. That's the best word to describe what's happening right
here. I am so proud of these young ladies. The great effort. You didn't see a
fight. We talked at the beginning about only believing what -- only believing
in what we know. And I think that through the course of this year we were a
team that had faith but we also believed because of what we saw.  
We had an opportunity to play before great crowds and against the No. 1 and
No. 2 team in the country. And some of the most difficult situations. How
could this be any more intimidating than this opportunity. So we took this
more as a opportunity. No one expected us to be here. But the long story short
is that the people of the state of New Jersey, these players first believed in
themselves and as a result I thought that we executed extremely well, focused
on the defensive side of it and didn't really read any of the hype.  
We're happy to be here. That's why I'm so very proud of each and every person
here. And just continue to keep the ball rolling. So I guess we'll see you all
of you guys here on Tuesday, right?  
THE MODERATOR: Let's take questions for student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kia, you essentially muscled Sylvia Fowles into irrelevance tonight. Can
you talk about from the opening tip you were on her right away. Could you talk
about what you were able to do?  
KIA VAUGHN: I just basically played her well. Tried to be tough with her. She
was a strong body and I just tried to physically make her move and keep her a
away from the basket as far as I possibly could.  
  
Q. Essence, could you talk about the development of your offensive game, you
worked on your jumper over the summer and what really worked and what really
got that thing going for you and when did you maybe during the season feel
that confidence?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Well, I really didn't take the time to work much on my jumper
over the summer. And I got to apply what I worked on during USA basketball.
And I played another summer league as well. And with that experience in
summertime it really helped me out. It's one thing to practice it but once you
get to use it in a real game situation that's when you really gain the
experience and learn how to use it effectively. And that just really helped me
throughout this entire season. It's really helped my team out that we do have
balanced scoring from four or five positions.  
  
Q. Essence, can you just describe what happened to your leg in the second
half and are you okay for Tuesday?  
ESSENCE CARSON: I'm perfectly fine. It was a cramp. Typical of athletes. Just
a little dehydration. But I'm all fine and dandy now. Walking around and
running on it. So I'll definitely be ready for Tuesday.  
  
Q. Was it your right leg?  
ESSENCE CARSON: My right quad.  
  
Q. How much of the game plan was to shoot like that from outside or were the
shots just kind of falling and were you surprised at how many went down?  
MATEE AJAVON: I think it's just it was just there. We didn't plan to like
shoot 3s. The shots were there. Which opened up for the inside. So they just
went in.  
  
Q. Kia, could you sense how frustrated Fowles got in the first half?  
KIA VAUGHN: I really didn't try to feed into that. That's her problem or
anything else. She stayed calm to me when I watched her. I just tried to do
and maintain what I was doing. And at that I was watching help and everything
else. But she's still good, I'm not taking anything away from her.  
  
Q. Essence, Coach Stringer is in the Hall of Fame and this is the first time
she's gotten this far. Can you talk about what it feels like to get her
here?  
ESSENCE CARSON: It feels great.  
  
Q. Second time. Sorry.  
ESSENCE CARSON: Well, that's okay.  
(Laughter.) It feels great to have gotten this far. But you can't give up.
When you're this close, why just settle for this. We have worked so hard this
entire season. We have come from nothing and basically built our foundation
from scratch. And to give up now would just fall short of what she's really
trying to achieve. Especially this year with this team. We're just going to
keep on believing. There's one more game left.  
  
Q. For any of the players. Coach talked a lot the other day about belief.
And a lot about where your journey has taken you this year. But with full
benefit of hindsight, if I would have told you when you were 2-4 that four and
a half months later you would be in the national championship game, would you
have believed it?  
MATEE AJAVON: Honestly, no, we wouldn't have. We probably would have looked at
you like you're crazy. But like you said, it was just belief in us, just
believing in ourselves, the coaches always believing in us and just applying
what we learned in practice to the court. So I think that's basically where it
came from. And I give a lot of thanks to the coaches who have been doing a
remarkable job of preparing us mentally and physically for what we're going
through now.  
  
Q. Kia, you looked into the in the first three or four times where Sylvia
touched the ball today you just absolutely put the body on her, took her off
her feet a couple times. And it didn't get called. Did you feel that the
officials were letting you two play and letting you -- the word was used
"muscle her" before. Have you ever muscled somebody like that off the floor?
And not gotten called for a foul?   
KIA VAUGHN: I didn't realize I lifted her off the floor. I'm sorry.  
  
Q. Kia went out with her second foul nine minutes into the first half. E,
who is the leading scorer, goes down seven minutes in into the second half.
Why did none of that matter tonight?  
MATEE AJAVON: Because we prepared for these things in practice. You got to be
prepared for it all. And no matter who is on the floor, you got to have --
everything has to flow. So I think that the coach he's did a great job
substituting and knowing who to put in at certain times.  
  
Q. Essence, and Mat, that point in the first half there was last five
minutes of the game where it was score, 55, turnover, score again, 55,
turnover, or a missed shot for them. And I think you guys had pulled away at
that point. And LSU just didn't know what to do. Is that the point at which
you guys thought, okay, this is -- we're going to go to the national
championship game?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Not at all. Because LSU, they're a great fighting team.  
At this stage, in the post season, you can't declare victory that early.
Especially in the first half. They're there's still 20-plus minus left. And, I
mean, if we were in that position we would definitely wouldn't give up. We
would keep fighting, keep fighting, keep surviving. Until our hearts pounded
out of our chest.  
So we knew that they were coming back in the second half and they would be
very strong and try to come out really intense. And they did come out second
half pretty strong. And we knew -- it wasn't over until it was over until that
horn went off.  
  
Q. For Mat, I noticed you were the fourth leading 3-point shooter on the
team. Did you -- have you ever had a game like this before and what was going
through your mind when your shots were falling?  
MATEE AJAVON: I'm not sure if I had a game like that before. It was just in
the flow of the game. My teammates did a great job of recognizing that I was
hitting the shots and passing it back to me. So I just give a lot of credit to
my teammates.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll now start with questions for Coach.  
  
Q. When Kia went out at 11:22 to go in the first half, Sylvia only got one
shot. What did you tell Rashidat? What were your instructions to her?  
COACH STRINGER: Well, if you noticed even we only have 10 players but we have
been using all 10 of those players and each person has had a game where they
have made a huge difference. They have had significant minutes. So it's not a
front. Just to go ahead when we have got a 10-point lead or whatever, Rashidat
has been in games where she's had to make a difference. So we were trying to
tell her at the beginning, you don't have time for a 30 second, you're trying
to find yourself and someone picking up a foul or have somebody get the
rebounds they're not supposed to. See yourself through every move that Kia is
involved in and that time will come. Because I only anticipated playing Kia
about three to five minutes if she didn't pick up a foul and taking her out.
So that Ra got a feel for how the game was being played to the inside any way,
so Ra knew that. So when it happened, it's like a relay, this is the
opportunity that you've been waiting for. So step in and let's go. You got to
cover it, you're not missing a beat on this. The same thing, Mat was a little
rattled at the beginning and we needed to bring in --  
What's interesting about that is they're freshmen, you know. But they seem to
be oblivious. We haven't really pounded it into their heads this the Final
Four, my God, it's the Final Four. We just tried to deal with the game in a
technical sense. We understand history, that we are fourth seed. We're not
supposed to be here. No one expected us to be here. That's all right with us.  
What we're looking to do is to feel good about ourselves. And so, you know,
when Brittany was able to step in there and spell Mat for a couple minutes,
she got a chance to talk to her, settle her down. So that gave me a good
sense. Now Brittany is ready. Now we put her back in but then of course E goes
down.  
For some strange reason in years past I have been in, you know, games that
lead to a Final Four and you've got a loss of crucial player and your whole
team tends to reflect those minutes that that player has been gone. But what's
interesting about this team is that, as Mat said, they really believe and know
that they're a team. They're not individually looking for accolades as you can
see we got none. The only thing that we're looking for is a respect -- well,
that's true. All you have to do is look at that. That tells you something
right there. But all you have to do is recognize that we're just playing
together as a team and one person asked, well, what makes us so dangerous, is
I don't know if it was going to come from E or if it was going to come from
Mat or from Brittany. You don't know where it's going to come from. They have
functioned all year long doing bad and doing well or doing good and doing,
good and bad. But they have done it together. So.  
  
Q. Can you go back to '82 and think about what it was like back with Cheney
State back then, and did you think it would take 25 years to get a shot at
another, to play for another national championship and can you just describe
the feelings now reaching the championship game as opposed to then?  
COACH STRINGER: Well, I think that if anyone were to think that -- of how long
anything would take when you're trying to excel at those levels, I don't think
that we could probably make it. I think that -- but because each year I really
love what I do in coaching and I look at it from a technical sense of
considering where the players are and molding them into the players that you
hope them to be, that the years kind of pass.  
No, I didn't think about 25 years. I do know this, my heart was broken when I
did have to make substitutions, much like what happened with Kia. And as I
shared with some you, when I took my 6-4 out I had to bring in a 5-11, and the
meantime the game was against Louisiana Tech. It was the first championship
that the NCAA put on. I was bringing a 5-11; they were bringing a 6-2, Dennis
Rodman's sister who was mad she was coming off the bench, so you know it was
just rough.  
So this was nice it was a different feeling. I really have confidence in all
the players and I don't know why other than the fact that as I said to some of
you, really do believe that our steps are in order. I do believe that this is
the team of destiny and there's a sense of calm. I was really nervous and
anxious. I had been very, very calm. Sometimes I have to ask myself, what the
heck am I doing? You know. And it's almost as though I'm free to coach and I
feel very good about it. I feel very good about the coaches that are around
me. I feel good about the players that are there. And as you know, Rutgers
athletics, our football team had such great success, and our so many of our
other programs and I just wanted to carry that ball and we know that it's
about hard work. I think I saw with the guys what they went through, the
football team, and we knew what we had to do and our men's basketball team,
too, and we believed it. Gymnastics and every other aspect of soccer,
everything that is about Rutgers, we want the people throughout the country to
know what it means to come from New Jersey and to a great extent both New York
and New Jersey are combined, joined together forces, and we really do feel as
one. This team is real proud of the fact that our governor was here, the
president of our university. Of course our athletic director was here, but our
football and basketball coaches were here. That spoke volumes. So many of the
fans that are here and perhaps they're the only people that believed in us.
We're grateful. We appreciate that. We just want to make everybody proud and
we'll continue to work hard.  
  
Q. Coaches make plans but players have to execute the plans. And have you
seen two players, your two posts ever do as solid a job as those two? You
don't ever completely stop Sylvia, but I'm guessing that that's as stopped as
she got this year.  
COACH STRINGER: Let me ask you this. Where are you from?  
  
Q. Cleveland.  
COACH STRINGER: Cleveland. Okay. But your observations are very good. Because
I'm going to tell you something, not only that, not only that, I thought that
the key to that believe it or not was Heather Zurich. Heather recognized who
she was playing, and she basically stepped to the four player and then backed
off and that made a difference, you see, because in order for Sylvia Fowles to
get into what she likes to do best, as all of you know, is that hook shot. But
in order to have a hook, you have got -- it's got to be extended to the
outside. So that the recovery was back down to the inside. So that took away
that.  
I don't think maybe she has worked this hard to get that because she wanted
that but in the meantime Kia kept pushing her up she caught her high in the
lane and kept her up. So that goes without saying that's perhaps something
that you didn't see. Or know.  
LSU is as good a team as I've seen all year. And Sylvia Fowles is the best
center in America. Period. We were on high alert and I didn't know that we
were going to do this good a job. We did. But I can honestly tell you that I
just know that this team as a whole executed the way that they did.  
And what I'm most impressed with Kia about is that normally Kia gets a little
anxious when she gets in the post position, especially with a shot blocker
that's as intimidating as Sylvia Fowles was. So my mindset was to give her
lead passes so she didn't have to do anything other than to take it to the
hole. No reads, no nothing. Catch it and make the pass that will lead her to
the basket. But I was stunned because Kia -- not so much stunned. I should say
it like this. I am so proud of the continued development of each and every
player including Rashidat, each and every -- they're so young that they grow
and learn every day. What was very significant for me was to see her catch it,
keep it tight, look over her shoulder, not get anxious, and hold the ball and
in a controlled position. And then go up over the top of her and take that
shot. Or be able to bounce the pass back out. So there was a lot of growth
that we saw today.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for joining us, we'll see you to tomorrow.  
COACH STRINGER: Thanks, every one.

_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement by
Coach Summitt.  
COACH SUMMITT: First of all, I would just say that we're excited as a
basketball team, staff, and the University of Tennessee to be back in
Cleveland. Obviously we were here for the Regional play last year and
certainly I thought we had great fan support.  
I'm looking forward to another matchup with North Carolina, a team that's
enjoyed success against us, and certainly I think they are a basketball team
that we know we have to be ready to play and bring our A game. And I think
it's going to be a great matchup and just look forward to the preparation and
obviously to game time.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sidney, it's the -- it is your last chance, it is your last trip to the
Final Four. Do you feel any sense of -- more sense of urgency than you would
when you were underclassmen or is it about the same?  
SIDNEY SPENCER: I guess as you grow up in this program or just as a college
athlete when time is running out I guess I do feel more of a -- like this is
my last opportunity. But I love this basketball team and I wouldn't want to be
here without this team. And I just think that we have a great chance at
winning it.  
  
Q. Coach Hatchell said she felt like one of the areas which you guys have
improved the most is the guard play. How do you think your play has improved
from a year ago and also how having Shannon has helped in the back court?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: Well, my game personally has improved since last year and
offensively on efficiency I worked hard this summer at getting my jump shot
together and trying to get it more effective.  
As far as having Shannon on the team, it's a great addition. Being moved to
the wing and being able to just get a rebound and get out and run and not
worry about coming back and getting the ball, and Shannon does a great job of
just pushing tempo.  
  
Q. Candace, North Carolina does a great job of rebounding, they obviously
have a bunch of tall girls that can jump. Can you just talk about you matching
up with that front lane and the challenge and what you saw in December and
some of the things you guys will have to do differently this time.  
CANDACE PARKER: North Carolina is very athletic and they pride themselves on
rebounding the basketball on the offensive end. As well as on the defensive
end.  
In December I don't think we did a great job. We allowed them to have second
and third chances. So obviously we need to limit that. And just box out.
Because you're not going to jump with especially this. They're very athletic.
So we're going to do a better job of that this time I think.  
  
Q. Alexis, how long did it take you to get comfortable again with your hand
after last season? And you had a lot of assists in the tournament, has there
been some reason why? Five or six a game. Something opening up for you that
wasn't?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: Well, as far as the question about my wrist, I wasn't
really released until about June. And so I just took all of June, July and
August just working on my jump shot and rehabbing and getting my hand, my ball
handling back together. And as far as passing, our team has done a great job
of moving. And we're just hitting the open player. We're moving, better
screening, so a lot more people are open and I just take it upon myself to hit
the open man.  
  
Q. Candace, the first player I think I've ever seen who is listed as a guard
forward and a center in the media guide. Which position do you play best? And
what do you consider yourself?  
CANDACE PARKER: I consider myself a forward. I think that that's my natural
position is at the four. And for this team that's where I spend the majority
amount of my time. But luckily in the Tennessee offense and especially in
transition, all five of us can bring the ball up the court and we fill the
lanes equally.  
Sometimes Lex can run to the paint, sometimes even Shannon can run to the
paint. So I feel like in transition it's -- we're all very, very strong.  
  
Q. Alexis, Ivory was able to make so many plays down the stretch against you
guys last year, how do you slow her down? What's the best way to stop her?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: Well, a player as versatile as that you have to play her
straight up. You have to respect her game whether it's the three ball or
driving. You just basically have to have great one-on-one defense and if you
do get beat you have to rely on your teammates to give you that help. So you
just have to leave it all on the court and realize that you do have help and
just go all out and don't hold anything back.  
  
Q. Candace, what does the Player of the Year award mean to you?  
CANDACE PARKER: It's a tremendous honor and I wouldn't be here without my
coaches and my teammates.  
But that's all put aside now because we have a goal that we came here to the
Final Four to accomplish. So that's all behind me and hopefully we can go out
and on Sunday and take care of business.  
  
Q. Sidney, how tough was that loss last year to Carolina and are you glad
it's them again here?  
SIDNEY SPENCER: That loss last year was really hard. I think. Coming in this
summer and just talking about what we want to accomplish for the year, our
team really made it a point of emphasis to become that Tennessee defensive
team that we used to be. So we wanted to step our defensive pressure up this
year and I think we have done a great job of just really focusing on defense
and our defense leading to offensive points and scoring. And in transition.  
So I'm definitely glad that we get to play them again. I think it's great for
women's basketball to have a matchup like this.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We'll take questions for Coach Summitt now.  
  
Q. How has Candace improved? What's been her biggest area of improvement
this year?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think she's improved both offensively and defensively. I
think the offensive aspect has been her development and getting in the gym and
working really hard and also just devoting time to her skills, her offensive
skills. She's worked on her post moves, she's worked on her face-up game.
Worked on playing off the dribble and her pull-up game is a lot better.  
I think just the versatility from an offensive standpoint. And then, secondly,
I think just playing with the World Championship Team, I think just the
maturity there of playing with the pro players and being around Tina Thompson
and Temeka Catchings and understanding you have to play both ends of the
floor, and I think the -- probably the biggest upside to her game of late has
been her commitment on the defensive end.  
I thought she was in our Ole Miss game she was terrific, I mean that was by
far the hardest that she's worked at both ends of the floor. But I think
that's because she really wanted to be here in Cleveland. And I just think
that she's just much more committed to her team and to the Tennessee defensive
system.  
  
Q. What are you planning on changing from your December game plan against
Erlana Larkins?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think Erlana is going to get her points and obviously
she's shooting the basketball exceptionally well. Yet I think that we have to
do a better job. You always want to try to limit touches. There's no guarantee
that you can. But we would like to do a better job just one-on-one defense. In
the paint.  
I thought she totally dominated the paint in that game. And I think that just
being able to somehow influence how many times she touches it and where she
gets it. But she's a player, you're not going to stop her. You hope you can
have some luck in containing her game, but she is just a great player. I think
she's been the real key for them.  
  
Q. The whole topic of is Candace going to leave or is she going to stay came
up this season and I'm just wondering, as a coach, how do you advise players
in this situation? I don't know if you had many or not, maybe just Candace,
but how to weigh this decision. Obviously it's a very different thing than
what the men's players have to go and decide?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, actually, I haven't even talked to Candace about it and
asked her if she was going or staying. I think there's only one choice. If you
want to make the sound choice and you're a college student-athlete, I think
these are four of the best years of your life. I think Candace right now is on
the biggest stage in women's basketball. And she understands that. But I read
in the -- I actually read that she was staying. And I just -- we were
practicing and she came down on a lay-up drill and shot a lay-up and I said I
enjoyed what I read in the paper today, Candace. And she just smiled. So we
have had no discussion.  
I think she's very intelligent. In the classroom, in her decisions off the
court, a lot of maturity. And I think she understands that it's not that she's
turning down millions of dollars. I wish we could get to that point in our pro
game, but eventually we might. But certainly I think she understands that the
college game right now is the place that she's really excelling and getting a
lot of recognition and having a lot of fun.  
  
Q. Two questions, Coach, one, game-wise, are you looking to get another post
presence other than Candace? Seems to be a lot of post presence in this
particular Final Four. Something that maybe would offset her or at least open
her up a little bit. That's game-wise. And then, two, somewhat on what you
just talked about, a lot of coaches lately in the women's game the last --
even within the last couple days have really gotten some hefty pay raises. And
there are a lot of big job openings that seem to be headed that way as well.
Could you just kind of comment on that and what you see in that regard too.  
COACH SUMMITT: To answer your first question, Nicky Anosike has really picked
up her inside play. And in post season. And then I think that's helped her and
she's also benefited from the double teams and triple teams that Candace has
seen throughout this tournament.  
She's a player that we do rely on inside. Certainly Alex Fuller has been off
the bench and done some good work for us and helped our basketball team.  
So I do think that because of the type of player that Candace is, that we can
get other people involved. The defense usually allows us that opportunity if
they want to play us straight up, then Candace will go to work on that. But I
think that we're a little bit better in our post play and have been in our
tournament games.  
I'm excited about what's happening in women's basketball in terms of the
commitment on the part of universities throughout this country to really
support the game. And because of a lot of job openings, I think it's had quite
an impact on universities making decisions at the top to provide the resources
for their teams and also the contracts are in place and the financial
opportunities for these coaches are where they should be.  
I mean, let's face it, we're seeing in a lot of programs and I have a lot of
respect for what Tennessee did because they didn't have to step up and do what
they did, but I think they recognized the popularity of women's basketball on
our campus and the attendance and just the competitiveness across this country
now. It's created a different atmosphere because of I think the whole
landscape has changed because of the commitment on the part of administrators
to pay coaches at a different level, different pay scale now.  
And it's going to become more competitive. And you're going to see coaches
move. And it's going to be interesting to see what happens between probably
now and in the next three weeks, with some of the coaches that are considering
making changes.  
  
Q. I know it's been a long time since you had signed a junior college player
and I wanted to ask you about Shannon, and first just what made her such a
match for what you needed in your back court this year, and then second, just
what she does to change games in terms of imposing a tempo on a game.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well the thing about Shannon when I saw her play is that I just
loved her style of play. She pushed the basketball really hard and that's
something that is very appealing to myself and a lot of coaches in this game
that like up-tempo basketball. I liked her handles, I thought she was very
efficient. Shoots the three ball well. And really and watching her at the
junior college level I thought she was a great creator, but a lot of those
opportunities, because she was one of the best players on her team, she
created for herself.  
But I saw the potential for her to create for other people and that's where
she's really improved her game and the thing that has impressed me is just how
much she has been willing to learn. And her ability to do so and learn our
system and run our basketball team. She's like a freshman in our program, but
she plays like a veteran.  
I think the fact that she has been so appreciative to be at Tennessee and
she's had a great attitude. I've had a lot of great point guards, but I don't
know that I've had a better relationship with any point guard that I've
coached because of her willingness to listen and learn and try to do what you
ask her to do.  
Second part, her tempo and her speed, that's had a great influence. And it can
be a difference maker in the course of a game because she can be very
explosive and again be able to create shots for herself as well as for her
teammates and she will tell you every time she goes into a game, oh, Coach,
I'm really, really nervous. I've decided that's a good thing. Because every
time she's told me she's nervous she's played well. So I hope she's nervous
when we play on Sunday.  
  
Q. Understanding she's not your most immediate concern, but could you
compare Sylvia Fowles to other low post players you've seen in the game's
history? Is she almost a evolutionary talent?  
COACH SUMMITT: It's hard to say, I think there's only one Sylvia Fowles. But
she is just a very imposing player. It's like Lucia Harris, Delta State, was
the most imposing offensive player that I had seen in the paint.  
Sylvia has been one of the most imposing defensive players and now her
offensive efficiency is -- has really allowed her to be a player that's very
difficult to stop and also to go against. She makes players alter shots, she
is a great shot blocker. And obviously in the paint she can have her way with
most of the people that she goes against. And they get her great looks.  
If you look at most of her shots they come right in front of the rim. So she
can pick and choose I want to go left, right, I want to shoot over the top of
the rim.  
But I think a lot of that is their offensive system. And she's just a great
athlete and a hard worker. You got a lot of skill post people that are good,
but her greatness comes from how hard she's willing to work and her
competitive drive.  
  
Q. Could she be near the best ever you've seen or close in that category?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think she certainly has the potential to be one of the best
everyone the inside. When you talk about low post presence at both ends.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the LSU, what they have been able to overcome in the
past few weeks, just their focus in this situation?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think through adversity you learn a lot about your
basketball team. And there's no question that they have faced adversity. But
the way they have come through this and the focus that they have had I think
it's made them even stronger. And certainly I know they're even more
determined. I think that Bob Starkey's done a great job. But you have to
understand, Bob Starkey's been teaching the offensive system for years and
he's as good as anyone in the game. Men or women. Men or women's game. On
teaching motion offense.  
Watching them in the Regional finals, I just thought they were so in synch and
so together and so inspired, and it's clearly a team that has come together
and they're playing with a purpose.  
  
Q. I know you and Vivian have been close friends for many years. What do you
think of the job she did this year?  
COACH SUMMITT: It's a incredible story, I think, when you look at the
beginning and with Vivian, I'm sure what she was feeling was that, as she said
last night at the Salute dinner, she sent her assistant coaches out and told
them to go get some players. She needed players. She didn't think she could
win with these players. Obviously they must have heard her because they took
it to heart.  
And she was dealing with a lot of youth. But Vivian is so persistent on
bringing out the absolute best in her players. And I have a lot of respect for
her. She's one of the most patient and persistent coaches in the game. She
will try to be patient, but then when she runs out of patience, then I think
that's when she just says, We have to do it this way.  
It's amazing what she has done and the fact that she's done it in three
different programs and obviously enjoyed success at this level in all three.
It just speaks to her ability to adjust, adapt to whatever environment she's
in and bring out the absolute best in her student-athletes.  
  
Q. To piggyback on that, what would a national championship mean to Vivian
and would that sort of complete her career, do you think?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well let me just say that Vivian Stringer is a great coach. And
I think that sometimes people document coaches and their success by whether or
not they win a national championship. You can look in the women's game, in the
men's game, some of the greatest coaches of all times have never been
fortunate enough to win a national championship.  
Would that obviously be a exclamation point on her career? Yes. But she's a
great coach regardless of whether or not that happens. And I guess I'm
oftentimes amazed that that's the one standard that people look at as to
whether or not that coach is legit. Vivian is a legit leader and great coach
in this game. Regardless of whether or not she ever cuts down the nets.  
But that lady's probably going to cut down some nets.  
  
Q. What was it that made you take a chance on Shannon Bobbitt?  
COACH SUMMITT: We needed a point guard. When Gatewood transferred from our
program, I just felt like that Alexis could run the point, but also I felt
like Alexis could make a greater impact if she didn't have to run the point
all the time because she's a great rebounding guard, she's a great penetrator.
We could post her up and play her at multiple positions.  
And Shannon, I never worried about her size after I saw her play. And I just,
seeing her on tape is one thing, but actually seeing her play, I thought she
has the speed, the quickness, and the handles on it to really do what we want
to do in this program. And that's put pressure. Pressure by pushing tempo and
putting pressure on the other side of the ball.  
And, again, I just loved her personality. I've had so much enjoyment and I
just am watching her have a opportunity to do what she's done at Tennessee and
she is so appreciative of everything. I mean, you know, coming from the junior
college environment and coming into Tennessee and then obviously it's a whole
different environment as far as fan support and we're on charter planes, and
she's --  
One quick story, and some of you obviously I'm sure are aware of this, but the
managers came to me and said that some of our players were taking socks. Out
of the locker room. And that they were running out of socks. And so I called a
little meeting and I said, What's the deal with the socks? You know you have
to leave the socks for the managers to wash and leave them there. And Shannon
goes, Coach, Coach, my bad. She said, I just never had socks that nice. So she
was taking them home and wearing them to class. I said, You got to bring the
socks back here and you got to leave them here. And I said, But you can wear
them. You can wear them in practice. And she was like, Coach, I've never had
anything like this. A pair of socks. How about that?  
  
Q. You took a trip down memory lane with the question about Sylvia and I was
thinking how much do you remember about 1982 and your first trip to the Final
Four and does it seem like 25 years have gone by the board or not?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think not really. It's gone fast. Going into that first
championship -- and I don't really want to talk a whole lot about that
weekend. That wasn't the most pleasant for us. But I know how excited we were.
To be under the umbrella of the NCAA and know that women's basketball was
going to have a opportunity for greater exposure and have the opportunity to
really showcase our game, and certainly that was -- that was something that
generated so much excitement and enthusiasm for players and coaches and it
really changed our game.  
  
Q. What do you think needs to happen to take the game to the next level?  
COACH SUMMITT: I guess my biggest concern right now, and it's probably because
of we have just gone through the tournament and we are here now at the Final
Four, is I'm not sure we're ready for neutral sites. And I've been supporting
that all along. But I think that we have to put our best foot forward in our
game.  
To really showcase, not only the teams, but also to create atmosphere at all
of the sites. And I think we have to strategically figure out what the best
way is to arrive at that. And that right now is probably my biggest focus. I
think players are better, coaches are better, budgets are obviously in place,
and we're seeing our game grow significantly in that aspect.  
But now we have got to grow our fan base. We have fans that are fans of their
teams. And I think that the difference in the men's game is that obviously you
have men's basketball fans. And we need to increase our pool of support, if
you will, for people that just love the women's game. And they're going to
support it regardless of whether it's their team or it's a great women's
basketball team.  
  
Q. Two quick questions, a follow-up on that. One, why do you think it is
that women's basketball hasn't been able to get to the point where they are
fans of the sport and not just fans of the team, where most sports are like
that. And also, North Carolina, LaToya Pringle, can you tell me what she's
added to their inside game?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, first of all, I think in the women's game we don't have
the long history of the men's game in terms of exposure and just the overall
opportunities that television has provided throughout the years for people to
watch teams and get familiar with players and we're still playing catch-up in
that regard.  
We talked about '82 being the first time that the NCAA took over our game and
provided championships for women.  
So we're growing our game, our exposure is better, but it's still lagging and
if you compare it to the men's history.  
Pringle has done a great job, I mean, you look at their inside game and
players that could come in and impact, players that make Larkins better, I
mean, it's like Candace Parker has made Nicky Anosike better. And I think the
same is true with North Carolina in that regard.  
THE MODERATOR: Great. Thank you, Coach, for joining us.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 31, 2007

  

### [Sylvia Hatchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15656)

### [Erlana Larkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15661)

### [Ivory Latta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15658)

  
_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement from
Coach Hatchell.  
COACH HATCHELL: We're glad to be here, like all the other teams. We have been
on the road quite a bit the last few weeks, but we're glad we're still on the
road.  
We're excited about our opportunity to play a great Tennessee team and -- but
mainly just to be back in a Final Four. We were here in Cleveland last year
and it was fun and exciting and we have seen a lot of the same people and even
the doorman at the Marriott, he hugged my neck this morning and was glad to
see us.  
So it's -- we're glad to be here and have an opportunity to play in another
Final Four.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For Ivory, I'm sure you're frequently matched up with bigger guards that
maybe try to post you up or whatever, but Tennessee, you're going to be
playing against two small point guards. How does that impact the game for
you?  
IVORY LATTA: I'm definitely going to use that to my advantage somewhat.
Bobbitt, she's definitely a quick guard. So I'm going to have to control her
penetration. But my size, which is not that much, over Bobbitt, I'm going to
use that to my advantage.  
  
Q. Erlana, what do you think the things were that allowed you guys to beat
Tennessee the first time, the first two times actually, and what are you
hoping to carry over from those games?  
ERLANA LARKINS: I would have to say, number one, rebounding. We talked about
it this morning and it's very important that we win the rebounding match
because they're a great offensive rebounding team and Nicky Anosike and the
taller guards like to rebound. And I think that just -- I guess starting I
guess we jumped out of the cannon first, we usually tend to have a slow start
in most games. But we got off to a great start and maintained that. So that
and rebounding.  
  
Q. Ivory, I remember watching the Regional final and it looked like in the
last five to seven minutes of that game you found another gear. It was
obviously a hotly contested game and I'm sure folks were getting a little
tired, but those last five, seven minutes you just were going right by people.
What happened? Is that running drills since October or were you just on a
adrenaline high?  
IVORY LATTA: Adrenaline high. I just know that Purdue started making a run and
next thing I know in my head I just said I had to do what I had to do to get
my team back into the lead or whatever. So I just had to go up to another
gear. I don't know what was going on. But I definitely hope it's going to
carry on to the game on Sunday.  
  
Q. Did you come off the court after the game thinking, wow, what just
happened out there? Because it really did look like you found something there
that just carried you right up to a whole another level.  
IVORY LATTA: When I came off the court I was pretty much tired. I pretty much
wasn't thinking about anything. But I was just happy that my team got that
win.  
  
Q. Ivory, how has your leadership on and off the court grown over your four
years at North Carolina?  
IVORY LATTA: My leadership has definitely grown over the years. And that comes
from the confidence that my Coach has in me. She tells me every day that I'm
her best point guard, that I'm a great leader. So confidence in me definitely
gives me the confidence to go out there and lead my team. And off the court
I'm just trying to be like the coolest person, you know, I just try to crack
jokes, make sure everybody is loose and things like that. And I'm just trying
to do what it takes to help my team win the national championship.  
  
Q. For both girls, some of the Tennessee players were saying it's a little
freaky being back here, same locker room, same building, same opponent. You
guys had any d eja vu since you've been back?   
ERLANA LARKINS: No, not really. I didn't even notice. We know we played
Tennessee last year and in the Regional finals in the same gym but I would
have never thought same locker room and things like that. But that was last
year. And we can't really focus on that. It's about this year and doing what
we have to do to win.  
IVORY LATTA: No. Everything Miss Larkins said. That's all.  
  
Q. Ivory, you're in the Final Four a year ago as a junior, back now for your
last run at it. Can you share a little bit, is there a greater sense of
urgency, greater sense of expectation this year or can you still just go out
and play the game?  
IVORY LATTA: It's definitely a sense of urgency for me since this is my last
year. My main thing is I'm just trying to focus on what Coach Hatchell wants
me to do and I'm trying to go out there and do it to the best of my ability.
I'm just going to lay everything out there on the line, just any game now
could be just my last game and I'm just trying to go out there and just keep
my focus, keep my team up and make sure that everybody's loose and just go out
there and have fun. That's the main thing is to have fun.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you guys both for joining us. Take questions
for Coach.  
  
Q. You said after the loss to Duke that you were encouraged just because you
felt your team hadn't played its best yet this year and there weren't a lot of
teams in the country that could say that. What do you think has allowed your
team to play its best since that loss?  
COACH HATCHELL: I think that because we knew we had not played our best. And
that we had more to give and we could do better than we were doing, even
though we had only lost those two games, I guess, to Duke and we lost the one
to State. But we knew that we had not played as good as we could play and so I
don't think any of my players disagreed with that. And that we just had to
keep pushing buttons and that we could elevate to a higher level for
tournament time.  
That's what I challenged them to do for the ACC tournament. And I think it
started there.  
  
Q. Candace Parker does everything well. In your mind what does she do
best?  
COACH HATCHELL: Wow, I don't know if there's one thing that you would say. I
think a quality or characteristic about her. The number one thing would be
that she's so versatile. That she can score outside or score inside. And she's
just such a tremendous athlete. But just I think she's so versatile. She can
play about anywhere on the court you need her to and whatever assignments you
give her, she can do those well. So I think just probably her being so
versatile.  
  
Q. For about the last couple weeks on the network of record, TV network of
record for this event, they have been playing a promotional commercial that
prominently features you giving a -- it looks like a rather energetic
immediately pregame address to your players. Is that something that you always
do and have you heard much from people who maybe hadn't seen that side of you
before?  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, I've done that every game as long as I've been at North
Carolina, so.  
  
Q. I mean people from out in the rest of the country who don't follow you
UNC basketball that close.  
COACH HATCHELL: I had a lot of people when I'm walking down the street and
somebody will holler, Are you ready? A guy in the front of the hotel this
morning is hollering at me, Are you ready? And actually I walked into the
Kodak this morning and they had all the players in a holding room and they had
the four coaches and we had -- signing some balls and different things in
there, and when I walked in one of the players came up and she said, looked at
me and said, Coach, are you ready? And I said yeah. She said, I just had to
come talk to you. She said, I love that. That's my favorite part of all the
commercials. When we got back, Ivory came up and said, The girls were talking
about that, Coach. And I don't know, it's just something I've done for the 21
years I've been at North Carolina and it's the last thing out of the locker
room and just to make sure that we are ready. And, again, to show as players
my enthusiasm for the game and what we're getting ready to go out on the court
and do.  
But again, it's just something that I've always done. I mean, it's nothing I
did special or did it for the television, it was -- I didn't realize they were
in the locker room, tell you the truth, when it happened, but I try to be calm
on the side so the players will be. But I can get feisty if I need to.  
  
Q. Has that risen to the level -- I mean, is that just part of your coaching
pregame or has it become kind of a superstition, that you won a whole lot of
ballgames doing that before?  
COACH HATCHELL: No, it's not a superstition, but I've just always done it. The
biggest thing is we do it in the locker room right before we come out. We have
a huddle and it's very quiet and silent and we actually have a prayer. And
then I bust out with, Are you ready? And I do it three times. And we actually
we have had a lot of irate coaches and dignitaries and people like that that
we're trying to influence and everything like that. We have them in our locker
room lots of times. And when we do that, actually when I holler out, they
jump. It scares them and they jump. They don't know what to expect, and
they're like, What's going on, you know, what's gotten into her? Because it's
sort of like a different personality I guess.  
But it's just something I've always done. And the players enjoy it, I guess.
It's nothing that's special or anything like that.  
  
Q. Have you ever had a player perhaps with a well developed sense of humor
when you did that say, you know, like flat-lined and say, Coach, you know
we're ready.  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, we do it where I say, Are you ready? They say, Yeah.
They holler out, Yeah. And I say, Are you ready? And they say, Yeah. And we do
that three times. And then I, you know -- we come together and we huddle and
we say, whatever the school is that we're playing, Beat so and so, and then
the last thing is rebound. So that's just the way we always come out of the
locker room, so it's nothing to make a big deal out of, trust me.  
  
Q. Could you talk about what Bob Starkey has done over at LSU kind of under
a not so ideal situation, taking over the team and leading them here.  
COACH HATCHELL: Yes, I'll be very happy to say some things about that
situation because, first of all, I think he's done a unbelievable job.  
I did not -- I knew Bob, but I didn't really know him. I've known about him I
knew people that knew him. I knew he was a great X-and-O man. And behind the
scenes did a lot of the scouting and those type of things.  
Not only is he a good basketball person, but just the things he's done with
this team to keep them focused. And I've had a few conversations with him the
last couple days and I'm extremely impressed. Very, very nice person, I saw
him out in the hall a few minutes ago. I just can't believe he doesn't want to
be the head coach there. If I was one of the people doing the hiring, I would
do everything I could to try to get him to take that job, because he's just
done a tremendous job. And he's a very -- as I've talked to people, I've
learned that he is a well, well thought of person. And players really respect
him.  
And I just -- I mean, I'm just -- I'm not surprised or amazed, but I'm very
happy that he's done the job he has for the players, first of all, for the
players, but then also that they have got such a quality person that's in
charge of that team now. And I just can't say enough great things about how
he's handled the situation and what he's done with that team.  
  
Q. Going on to the rematch from this year, you beat them last year in the
Regional final and this year, how do you compare early in the year right now
where you were playing, where you think they were playing, to where you are
right now?  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, first of all, that was back December, what, 3rd, 4th?
Somewhere along there. It's been awhile. We have both played a lot of games
since then.  
I don't think you can look back at previous games really. Especially when it's
been so long since you played another team. But when we played in December I
know both teams played great defense. I thought. It was a little bit of a
sloppy game. But again, I think that -- but we made each other look that way
because both teams played excellent defense.  
And I think that offensively we have both played three or four games to start
the season. So our -- it was sloppy. Our timing was not good. A lot of things
were sort of out of synch. But I just remember that it was a great defensive
game and that it was for a early season game, we had a sellout crowd, it was a
national television, and I thought it was great for women's basketball.  
So I think both teams are better now. I think my players are younger players,
and have really come around and that I think our players know their roles on
their team. What we need them to do. I think that probably both teams know
their roles a little better than back in the early December time.  
  
Q. I don't know if you would ever be upset if Duke lost its coach, but do
you think Gail's going to stay in Durham?  
COACH HATCHELL: You got to ask Gail that. I saw her this morning I didn't get
a chance to talk to her. I saw her across the way at the Kodak. She wished us
good luck. You about you got to ask Gail that. I don't know.  
  
Q. Would you hate to see her go? I know you guys have become friends and
good rivals.  
COACH HATCHELL: She's done a tremendous job at Duke. There's no doubt about
that. And with Duke and NC State and Carolina, we're all right there together,
I mean we share the same newspapers and television stations and we see each
other at the mall and different things like that. So but -- and because we're
right there in each other's backyards every day, we make each other better.  
Because it's sort of like when you grow up and you got brothers and sisters
and you're always playing out in the yard and stuff, hey, if you want to
compete, you got to work at it and you got to stay on the same level as
everybody else. Or you get left behind. So again, we make each other better.
There's no doubt about that.  
I think you can look at Duke's success, our success, NC State's success and we
have all had a part in helping each other with the success because we got
three great teams in the triangle area. So but I think -- I don't think Gail
can go wrong with whatever she decides. She's done a tremendous job at Duke,
but I think it's just whatever she feels like is best for her at this point in
time in her professional and in her personal life.  
  
Q. Could you talk about how you're going to plan to guard Parker? Will
Pringle be a big part of that and what does she have to do to limit her going
off?  
COACH HATCHELL: Candace Parker, I mean, she gets my vote for Player of the
Year in the country. I think she's just -- she does so many things. I
mentioned how versatile she was. She does so many things so well. I think that
we have got to -- I don't really mean throw, but we will throw different
people at her as far as who defends her, different looks. Maybe different
sets. As far as what we're doing defensively. But I think you just got to
throw a lot of different things at her. And hopefully find something that
works. And maybe keep her from getting in a rhythm and a flow and off balance
a little bit.  
But because she's so, so dynamic and so good, especially when she gets down
inside on the block. And but we'll -- we have got lots of good defensive
players on our team, it could be Pringle, it could be Erlana, it could be
Camille, it could be Rashanda. It could be two of them at one time. You just
never know. But I think you got to throw a lot of different things at her. But
also the Tennessee team is not just Candace Parker. They have got a lot of
great players on that team. And so I think you've got to have a great game
plan defensively for the whole team.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH HATCHELL: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 31, 2007

  

### [Sylvia Fowles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15650)

### [Bob Starkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17183)

### [Erica White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16371)

  
_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with a opening statement from Coach Starkey and
then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH STARKEY: Obviously we're very pleased to be here. This is our fourth
time in four years. And I don't think the excitement changes at all.  
I think it's one of the few things certainly in my lifetime that you've been
involved with that lives up to the hype. And the NCAA does a wonderful job of
organizing everything. Everything is right where it's supposed to be when it's
supposed to be. And then what's neat is each city is different.  
The people in Cleveland have really been nice and opened their arms out to us
and we have certainly enjoyed our experience to this point.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Erica, you were teammates with Essence Carson this summer, right? What
was it like and what sort of challenge will she be tomorrow night?  
ERICA WHITE: Essence was a great teammate. She's a big shot player and she did
the same thing for us at USA basketball. One of the best things she did for
our team was defense. She played well. She will be a challenge because she's a
big shot taker and if they need a basket they're going to go to her. But I'm
sure our defense will defend her.  
  
Q. Erica and Sylvia, this is both for y'all. Talk about the way y'all play
defense and it's just really come on strong, especially in the tournament. You
look relentless out there. What kind of mindframe do you get into and what
kind of pride does this team take in their defensive performance?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It's like our second nature. We take pride in our defense and
anything it takes just to get out there and get under somebody's skin, we're
willing to do it.  
ERICA WHITE: I think that we just pride ourselves on our defense because it's
been there for us and it's been solid for us all year. It's been the one thing
that we can hang our hat on if the shots aren't falling or not playing well
offensively, I believe that you can always give your best on the defensive end
of the floor. We just are relentless and it looks like it's six people out
there sometimes, but I think the biggest thing we do, we, Coach does a great
job of scouting our opponents and we take them out of their initial sets and
then do a good job of guarding the basketball when the shot clock runs down.  
  
Q. Sylvia, there's been a lot of talk about how much you have really had a
strong tournament and how well you've played. Do you feel within yourself that
your game is, quote/unquote, elevated or do you think this is the way you've
been playing and how do you feel about your efforts over the four games so
far?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Every year my game improves. And I have to give credit to my
coaches and my teammates for helping me get to that point. But I feel that my
game has improved during the tournament time. And I feel that it's only going
to get better.  
  
Q. In any particular way? Seems like you're scoring a lot, rebounding a lot,
blocking a lot of shots?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Just being consistent with everything that I do. If that's what
it means, crashing the boards or taking more shots or getting my teammates
into the offensive set.  
  
Q. This is your third Final Four. Can you kind of speak to being here again,
Sylvia, but you don't have Temeka Johnson and Seimone Augustus and kind of the
challenges that it poses this time going into the Final Four.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Well, you just named two great players. But our coaches do a
great job at recruiting and they know who to pick, the right people to pick to
fit in the system. But just going into the tournament without them I think
it's kind of different, but it's also a plus for us because we also just are
one team. It's not a one-man team. Everybody can get out there on the floor
and perform what we're asked to do. So I say that's kind of different this
year.  
  
Q. Sylvia, being back here your fourth straight time, I guess -- well, not
you, but as a program, does it give y'all any of an advantage that you've been
here before, you've been here, done that, you know what to expect? What kind
of advantage does that give you over a Rutgers or over any team that's here
right now?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Truthfully, I don't think it gives you no kind of advantage. We
always made it here, but we never made it to the big stage where we wanted to
be.  
Just having the experience under your belt doesn't mean anything because any
opponent could come out any given night and be on. So I don't think it gives
us an uplift at all. We just got to be focused and be ready to play.  
  
Q. For Erica and Sylvia, what do you guys have to do differently to get to
that bigger stage that you haven't made the last three times?  
ERICA WHITE: I think the biggest thing that's going to help us this year is
we're playing well right now. I remember last year's tournament run the best,
and I said this before, you just look at those games and getting here we
struggled every game, we came out and it took a second-half effort to win the
game. It finally caught up with us in the Final Four.  
But this year every game in the tournament we're playing better. We're getting
better. And we believe that. Our confidence is high. And we know we're playing
good basketball. So I think this is the biggest thing that's going to help us
right now.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I say there's no room for error. You just got to come out good
on a good note from the get-go. So I think that's what we need to do.  
  
Q. Erica, has Coach changed at all since becoming the head coach from being
the assistant to the head coach?  
ERICA WHITE: I wouldn't say he's changed. He's doing some different things.
Standing out in front of the program and speaking to the media more, but as
far as the basketball goes, he's pretty much the same guy. He's just -- I
think he's been sensitive to the situation and he's done a great job and given
the team the things that we need. A lot of positive feedback and taking good
care of us. So he's doing a great job.  
  
Q. Erica, they're known for their ball pressure and the things they try to
do against the other team's point guard. What can you do? What can your team
help you to do to prepare for the kind of defense they're going to try to play
on your position particularly, and what help can RaShonta give?  
ERICA WHITE: I think that RaShonta can give a lot of help being that she's
played point guard. So she has the same mentality that I have. And can handle
the ball. Our offense is sound. Our principles are in place to handle the
pressure. Personally, I don't shy away from it. I know that I can handle it.
So it shouldn't bother me too much, and like I say, our program is sound and
we can handle the pressure.  
  
Q. Sylvia, are you seeing more double teams and how are you handling them?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Yes, I'm seeing more double teams, but it's nothing new. To me,
I just have the mindset that you are going to shut me down or you're going to
give up a three or give up a shot on the perimeter. So either way it goes it's
a 50/50 chance for me.  
  
Q. Sylvia, do you think that Kia Vaughn could be a challenge and if so, what
does she do that might make her a challenge?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Most definitely I think Kia Vaughn will be a challenge. She put
the ball on the floor very well and she can also get out and run. She can step
away from the paint and she can rebound. It's going to be very competitive
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Do you look forward to that more when you know you're facing another
center who is not easy to back down?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Yeah, I like a challenge. I think my best game is when I play
against challenging people.  
  
Q. I haven't seen you dunk very often in games, but I guess you did it today
and it got a rise out of the crowd. Is that just something that you did for
show today or was it something to fire you up or just something you always do
in practice? Talk about that?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It's something I always do in practice, it just so happened we
had fans in there to be able to watch and see it. So that's something I do
every day in practice.  
  
Q. Any reason? Can you talk about why we haven't seen it much in games? Is
it just the circumstance or talk about that.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: To tell you the truth, I really don't worry about it as much as
some people think I should. But I just worry about doing what I have to do to
help my teammates out. And if a opportunity for me to dunk comes, if I get
one, I'm pretty sure I'll knock it down, but that's not my main focus right
now.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we'll take questions now for Coach.  
  
Q. You guys played I think the lowest scoring Final Four game ever against
Tennessee. This game certainly looks like it could have the makings of a game
similar to that. Just talk about the importance of winning the, as you said
before, the hollow possessions. But you know they're going to come for both
teams and how much you have to value each possession because the points could
be at such a premium?  
COACH STARKEY: I think the hollow possessions come about more from us not
executing. But when you play against a team like Rutgers, you may not even get
deep into that possession if you don't take care of the basketball.  
I think that's certainly a concern for us. That's something that we have
talked about with our team when we're watching tape and when we're practicing
is the ability to handle their pressure. Sometimes they don't let you get very
deep into your possession. That's their whole goal is to disrupt your team and
to make them run their offense faster than what they normally do.  
So we need to value the basketball and I think if we value the basketball and
take care of it, I think we'll be able to get some good shots just based on
that is what comes when teams pressure you like that. It's a little bit of a
gamble and obviously they're extremely good at it.  
  
Q. With your team's defensive ability, and Rutgers, very similar on the
defensive sides, what kind of similarities do you draw defensively? And I
guess the way your team has played through the tournament defensively it's
something special.  
COACH STARKEY: I think the biggest thing that I see is both teams enjoy
playing defense. And that can be sometimes rare. If you watch their kids play,
they get excited about it. And I feel like our kids do too. I think both teams
have the athleticism to do a variety of things. Theirs is a little bit more
full court where our ours is a little bit more half court.  
I think they're both very good at taking dribble penetration away. I think
they're both very good at getting passing lanes and I think both teams need to
play a good defensive game in order for their teams to reach their potential
when they're playing other good opponents.  
  
Q. Could you first just maybe describe what this tournament has been like
for you and then also just talk about have you had to work on focusing with
the team to get through this tournament?  
COACH STARKEY: The tournament has been exciting and it's been hectic. But it's
always been like that. You travel, you play, you come home. You travel, you
play, you come home. And that's been a good thing for me and it's been a good
thing for the team.  
We haven't did anything more differently in terms of focusing our kids and I
think that's a compliment to our kids. We were playing good basketball before
the things that unfolded after the SEC tournament, so it wasn't like we had to
re-invent the wheel or do anything new, it's just to make sure that the kids
still understood what their goals were, and fortunately and obviously that
they did.  
So I think a lot has been made of me being in this position, but these kids
have been phenomenal. They have been focused from day one and you can see it
in practices, you can see it when we watch film and certainly you can see it
in the way that we're playing right now.  
  
Q. You've been quoted as saying that you're not interested in the job
permanently under any circumstances. And even more so after the taking over
and going through the first few rounds of the tournament. Can you explain what
it is about the job so far that you've experienced that would make you more
convinced than you were even before you started doing it? And also why do you
see yourself or is there ever a point in your career where you're convinced or
at what point during your career were you convinced that you were always going
to be an assistant coach and didn't aspire to be more?  
COACH STARKEY: The things that I enjoy doing the most and, equally as
important, the things that I think I do fairly well are things such as
teaching, running practice, and watching film.  
And while I've been able to do that, through this process, it's meant me
staying up a lot later, getting up a lot earlier, being away from my wife a
lot more and being a lot more tired because of all the other things that are
going on with my job.  
And I'm still -- we haven't did anything with he recruiting. I haven't had to
go out and fundraise, I haven't done any public speaking, so there's a lot of
things that a head coach has to do. And, number one, I don't feel it is my
forte, I don't feel like that's what I do best. And, number two, I think it
takes away from the things that I do do well.  
And I just think it's important that you understand your limitations, your
strengths and your weaknesses. I'm not sure there was ever a time where I made
up my mind that I just wanted to be a assistant coach, but I just think
certainly at this point I'm 47 years old and I've always been a assistant
coach and really never given it much thought or had necessarily very many
schools come after me and offer me those type positions. So it's really never
been something that I thought about until now.  
  
Q. 47's pretty young.  
COACH STARKEY: I don't know. In coaching it's kind of like dog years.  
(Laughter.) I think I aged about two years in the last three weeks.  
  
Q. Erica mentioned that you had been sensitive to the situation, sensitive
to how you came into this position, what have you done, is it something you've
done consciously or is it just kind of -- I mean, what have you done to be
more sensitive to how -- to the team?  
COACH STARKEY: It's been said that I'm very patient. And that's probably --
that's not true. I'm very impatient in terms of coaching and teaching. And if
anybody that's watched us practice knows that I can get after individuals or
get after a team pretty good.  
I think that probably in light of what happened it's going to get more
attention than what it needs, but I think in the post-season I think that you
need to be more positive. And I think I've been able to do that. And I think
maybe they have just noticed it a little bit more because I'm the single voice
at practice right now.  
I think once you get in the post-season, you have either -- there's an old
saying the cake's in the oven. Everything's been mixed and that's it. We have
either taught our team how to play or we haven't. So when you get in the post-
season it's -- I don't think it's a time necessarily for you to be impatient
and I think that I've probably -- I've certainly been more patient with them
but a lot of credit goes to them too. They really haven't given me much
opportunity to get on them too much. So, again, they deserve a lot of credit.  
  
Q. Being here fourth straight time in the program's history, does that give
you an edge, an advantage that you have been through this process, you know
what to expect? Or does it put any pressure to say that we need to come home
with a championship or make a run?  
COACH STARKEY: I think that in some ways there's a small advantage in terms of
all the things that are peripheral that go on before you play. For instance,
the autograph sessions, the open practice, yesterday we had to do some things
for ESPN. And our kids are all aware of that. And they're all aware of how
that stuff flows into the game.  
But I thought Sylvia's point was, you know, once the ball's thrown up, I don't
think it matters. If experience would have been that important, we wouldn't be
0-3 in first round games. It still comes down to playing. And we have a
different team this year. And I think that's important. That's good and bad
and all the teams can say that. But it's -- I think each one is different, and
I think it will come down to who plays well.  
  
Q. One of the things that's been well documented is that there's not many
people who have ever been in your position, taken over this late in the season
or in the post-season. There's so little to use as a guide for yourself, or
has that been difficult or do you just kind of try to rely on the things that
you have, that you've done in the past and not try to -- you said you haven't
tried to change much, but has it been difficult with nothing to fall back
on?  
COACH STARKEY: No, not really. I think that again, I'll go back to the fact
that post-season play is so hectic. So I haven't had much time to think and
that's probably been good for us and me.  
We wanted to make sure that we had as normal a setup for our team as possible.
Practices have been the same, our preparation in terms of breakdown and
scouting have been the same. Travel has been the same. Part of that was we
have had a really good year this year so there wasn't a reason to change for
anything that we weren't doing well. So we have kept things as normal as
possible.  
  
Q. You've kind of been very humble about how this has all happened to you in
the last month. I just wanted to ask you just about the challenge of falling
into a Final Four as a head coach now with three coaches that have the
experience that the other three coaches in this Final Four have.  
COACH STARKEY: Those are three great coaches. I was joking with my staff this
morning, that when you're in junior high and you have one of these aptitude
tests and there's the four pitch pictures -- there's the apple, orange, the
banana and the rock -- and you kind of have to check off the one that really
doesn't fit, I would be the rock.  
Those are just absolutely three great coaches. But I really can't think about
that. Because I'm not going to be playing against Coach Stringer. My kids are
going to play against her kids. And that's where the focus is is making sure
that they're comfortable and that they're prepared and that they're ready to
play. It was the same thing with Connecticut. I think a lot was made between
Geno and I. He's a great Coach and just because my team was more successful
that particular day doesn't change that. So I think the focus has to stay with
the kids and how they play.  
  
Q. Three straight years LSU has not got past this game. It's different, your
team is different, of course you play a different team each time, but is there
any common denominator that you learned from experience that you can a play
that as you look back on it that can help you get over the hump this time?  
COACH STARKEY: Each time we came here, the first year that we went, I don't
think anybody expected us to go. And we played Tennessee down in New Orleans
and we played really well. We just happened to fall a couple of points short.
Tennessee made a play and scored at the bucket and that was the ballgame. But
we played great.  
Then the next time we lost to Baylor and we played really well the first half
and had a great opportunity to win that basketball game and had a bad spell of
play where we allowed Baylor to get in the game and get the momentum and beat
us.  
Then last year was a third game that was completely different where we just
didn't play well at all. And I think Erica touched on that. We didn't play
well at all in the post-season. The three games leading up to the Final Four,
all three of those games we were behind at half-time and we were a No. 1 seed
last year so we just weren't playing well.  
And we feel like we're playing better right now. And I think that helps. Does
it get us over the hump? I don't know. Rutgers is an excellent basketball
team. When you get to this far in the season and you play the people that you
play, you can play well and still go home. And that's our goal right now is
just to play well and see what happens.  
  
Q. In 1989 Steve Fisher took over the Michigan basketball team and went on
and won the national championship. Now you said you're not interested in being
the coach, what are you going to do next year?  
COACH STARKEY: I haven't given that any thought at all. Right now. Things have
been such a way in terms of our schedule and our team that the only thing I
had to concentrate on is is just making sure these kids are having a good time
and that we're getting prepared to play basketball. And when that's done then
I'll probably sit down and look at my options.  
  
Q. To follow-up on a earlier question, have you seen any difference in
Sylvia's game or approach from the regular season to the tournament?  
COACH STARKEY: She's really played well on the big stage but she's done that
all year. She just went through the SEC season where she had a double-double
every game. And within the SEC season we had a couple open dates and we
plugged them in with Connecticut and South Florida. She had double-doubles
with them.  
She's had a great year. We weren't on television as much this year, so I don't
want to say she's a secret, but it's just not like she woke up against
Connecticut and decided to dominate a game for the first time. She is a
remarkable kid. For somebody that's as special as she is to be as humble as
she is, I thought it was interesting here listening to her talk, and you
mentioned Temeka Johnson and Seimone Augustus and she talked, she said, wow,
there's two great players. This year we're a team. She doesn't even realize
that she's one of those three now. That's kind of her mindset. And I think
that makes her special. And I think it's really healthy for our team.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Sylvia's hook shot and how much you have worked on her
with that. It looks quite different from most women's hook shots. It looks
like more of -- a not trying to be sexist, but more of a male's hook shot.
That is full extension and wrist related instead of slinging it. Can you talk
about what you have done with that?  
COACH STARKEY: Well, it's something we started working on. She got here as a
freshman and we put a lot of emphasis on it before her sophomore year. And
basically if you ever come to our practice we the first 30 minutes is a pre-
practice period where the post players are on one end and perimeter players on
the other and we spend a lot of time on fundamentals. And it will carry all
the way through the season. We might only practice for 30, 45 minutes late in
the season but we'll still have that 30 minute pre-practice period to work on
individual things. And that's certainly one of the things that we have worked
on. It's a jump hook. We think that's the best shot for her because at 6-6 she
can extend, it's a very difficult shot to block, probably the biggest thing
this year is we started to work on her left hand and she's got a nice left-
handed jump hook now. Two summers ago she paid her own way and went up to Don
Meyer's post camp and I know he spent some time working with her on her jump
hook as well. So it's something that I think she feels comfortable with. She
certainly knows how to use it very well and it's been really successful for
her.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us, Coach.

_CLEVELAND, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with a opening statement from Coach Stringer.  
COACH STRINGER: First of all, I'm excited to be here. When we started our
journey at the beginning the of the year, certainly when we started our games,
no one would have thought, including myself, because it was a difficult thing
to see the light at the end of the tunnel. But I think the players here and
the team you will see is a testimony to what it means to persevere and
continue to believe when all others doubt you.  
And when you work together, as a team, realizing that one person by themselves
cannot do it, but that we address the team things first, which is defense,
passing, helping to see each other, helping each other and to remember that
we're all trying to do the same thing for the same purpose. And that when all
10 members persevere throughout, that dreams can come true.  
So it doesn't matter where you come from, but it is where you're going and
what price you're willing to pay. This team paid the ultimate price. And while
I've coached many teams and I've had the good fortunate to come to some Final
Fours, there has been no team that I've ever coached that has accomplished so
much in such a short period of time that has been so young and yet, as they
learned each and every day, continue to get stronger. And I don't know that I
recognize how strong -- I tend to say maybe halfway through the season, closer
to January. But as a rule, teams that I coach generally peak like in February.
But this team began -- we were so far back that we just made a gradual
improvement and what we finally got to -- the point we finally got to is the
fact that we were not making the same mistakes, we finally embraced defense.
And we understand and learned how to win games. We played some of the toughest
teams in the country, if not the toughest teams in the country in the toughest
arenas, and I couldn't be happier of five freshmen, three players who had
played before, two young ladies while they're sophomores and juniors, really
probably logged about an hour and a half all total. So in effect you have
before you about seven freshmen.  
But you have fearless players that are happy to be here, but truly have earned
it. Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Again, we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned -- and this is for Matee. Coach mentioned there was a
point at which you guys picked up on defense. Can you identify what that point
was in the schedule?  
MATEE AJAVON: I don't think it was a particular point, but I think it was
brought to us every day in practice. Coach, she stresses defense a lot. And
you guys might have heard about it in the paper, but we were feeling it every
day in practice. So it started from the beginning. We gradually worked our way
into becoming a defensive team.  
  
Q. Essence, we heard from you know one of the ESPN commentators today about
how hard Coach Stringer worked you guys to get in shape. That she had, shall
we say, exactingly high standards. With full benefit of hindsight, how
difficult was it? And were you surprised pleasantly or unpleasant by what she
wanted in terms of your physical conditioning?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Well, I'm a junior, so I'm a veteran. So I wasn't surprised by
what she was asking for. She asked the same thing of each and every team she
has coached to her career.  
I'm -- I may say that maybe the freshmen were surprised, but we try to prepare
them as much as possible. But they were still young so they still didn't
understand the entirety of it.  
I believe once they got here, it really did hit them and as veterans, we knew
that what she was, what she wanted from us was going to make us better. I
believe that physical conditioning that she put us through in the beginning of
the season really helped us, not only physically but mentally, to withstand
anything, especially when you're tired, that's when you make poor decisions.  
So in the long run it really helped us out with decision-making as well as our
physical conditioning.  
  
Q. Rutgers hasn't won a team national championship in about six decades as a
school. What would it mean to for you to win the first one for in that long,
for Rutgers?  
ESSENCE CARSON: It would mean a lot for us to win a national championship. Not
only because Rutgers hasn't won it in, like you said, about six decades, but
just because it is a national championship. Each and every year that's each
and every team's goal. That's what every one wants to achieve at the end of
the season.  
So not only would it be special for school history, it would be special for
ourselves and special for Coach Stringer, it would be her first.  
KIA VAUGHN: Basically exactly what Essence said. It would be the same thing.
I'll be excited and not only for the school but for ourselves, for our
teammates and coaches.  
  
Q. Kia, you had a lot of success against Alyssa Hahn, Allison Bales and
Audrey Johnson. Tell us what's different about Sylvia Fowles and what's the
biggest part of the challenge that she is.  
KIA VAUGHN: You named all post players. Basically I go out and play each and
every post the same. I make them work for what they want to get done.  
Sylvia Fowles is a great player. And with that you just work with great
players and you can't really stop her, you just try to control her and
maintain her.  
  
Q. Kia, you've redefined your body since coming to Rutgers. You got in
shape. How hard was it and how has it affected your game in going up against
these girls, these post players?  
KIA VAUGHN: Hard. It wasn't hard at all. Basically because it's just the
process that I went through. Running and practicing with Coach Stringer each
and every day. The weight just dropped dramatically. And it seemed like as I
ran it just fell off. And I was running. But I was happy with all the weight
that I lost. It defined my body, it made me move faster, feel more better
about myself and confident.  
  
Q. Can you tell on the court? Is it different? Do you feel different on the
court?  
KIA VAUGHN: Yeah, I feel much faster. Healthy, yeah, I'm always healthy, I eat
everything, but it's just that the running is just what maintains the weight.  
  
Q. Had you not done that in high school, the running?  
KIA VAUGHN: College and high school are two different things. Can't really
compare.  
  
Q. You guys really don't have one super star on the team. Do you consider
that to be a strength for you guys?  
MATEE AJAVON: Actually, yes, I think that's what makes us dangerous. Any time
you have five people on the floor that could possibly score, rebound, assist,
it makes the team dangerous. So I think it's a plus for us.  
KIA VAUGHN: I think it's a plus for us too.  
  
Q. What do you think when you think about young girls who look at you as
role models? How do you want girls to look at you?  
KIA VAUGHN: I would say that if you put your mind and your heart to it you can
do anything. Nothing is impossible. Everything is possible. You just have to
work well with others and basically have the will to keep on going. Even
though you fail sometimes. And when you fall down, just have the strength to
get up and wash it off and keep going.  
  
Q. I read something about the coach stopped wearing the school colors early
on in the year when you guys were struggling. What was that about and how did
that make you feel?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Well, in the beginning of the year after we were struggling,
Coach not only didn't stop wearing the school colors, she threw us out of the
locker room and took our practice gear and everything else that said Rutgers
on it. That was just her saying that we weren't living up to the Scarlet
Knights' tradition. We weren't the warriors that she was used to coaching. And
she said she wouldn't give us our stuff back and she wouldn't wear school
colors until we proved that we played as a team and let go of all
individuality and come together. And not only buy into the defensive concept
she was trying to push on to every one, and after awhile we started playing
together. Started playing the defense that you're used to seeing by Scarlet
Knights. And she started wearing red and black again and we have our sweat
suits back.  
KIA VAUGHN: And our locker room, which I'm happy for.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Can any of you talk about the legacy that Cappy Poindexter left because
you all played with her last year and years before?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Cappy, she left a great legacy. She was a great leader. We
learned greatly from her. We learned how to manage a team, how to keep
everyone together when it feels like everything is falling apart. She was part
of the 9-20 season that Rutgers had. So she knew what it felt like to be down
and out and have no support from anyone.  
But all in all she still kept a belief in herself and in her teammates and the
coaching staff. And that's one thing that really helped us out this year.
Especially starting off struggling. And we just kept believing in ourselves,
even if no one else out there might have thought that we would make it this
far. As long as we kept the belief in ourself, we just kept pushing and
pushing ourselves and we have arrived here at the Final Four.  
  
Q. Essence, have you noticed a -- has there been a noticeable change on
campus with the success of the football team and then what you guys have been
able to do? Is there more Rutgers pride?  
ESSENCE CARSON: Yes. Definitely is. Especially with the football program doing
so well. I believe the school was used to a woman's basketball program doing
well over the years, but we were never blessed with a great football team. Not
only this year but last year they did pretty well.  
So there's a lot of pride going around, especially in sports areas. There's a
lot of fans, student fans coming out. You always have the alumni coming, but
just to see the student support is great because those are your peers and you
get to see them every day.  
THE MODERATOR: Great. Thank you all. The student-athletes may return to the
locker room and we'll start with questions for Coach Stringer.  
  
Q. On the same theme, I have friends that went to Rutgers that actually
admit they went to Rutgers now. Can you just talk about what the boost has
been like because of the football team and then obviously what you guys have
done.  
COACH STRINGER: Our football team has just instilled a level of pride unlike
anything I've ever seen within the state.  
When I left Cheney University I went to the University of Iowa where
everything, the telephones and everything else, were gold and black. And that
was just their pride. And it was like a cultlike spirit here, an obsession.
That's what I thought initially going in there.  
But I come to understand that my children, all they wanted was a Hawkeye
jacket. That's all they wanted. And I wondered, you know, as I left there, to
come here to Rutgers, why there wasn't that level of pride. There's no
question that the kind of respect that Rutgers gets across the country as an
Ivy League school and as a great academic institution is without question
there.  
But no one knows and unfortunately I guess in this educational -- in these
educational situations or institutions everybody knows about Michigan, but do
know what they're most famous for, academically, physics or astronomy or
whatever, everybody knows they've got a great football program and blah, blah,
blah. The same thing with Rutgers. What Greg Schaino has done is nothing short
of a miracle, to see the Empire State Building -- can you imagine that? What
do you think that causes that, the buildings in New York to be red or to walk
downtown and -- with Madison Square Garden where people come from all over the
world, millions of people each and every day and you see Rutgers Scarlet
Knights. They did a sidewalk interview, with people from New York. They didn't
even know Rutgers was there. And we're less than 30 minutes from New York
City. How is that? Before. Now I understand that they even had
"Congratulations Scarlet Knights Women's Basketball Team. Go Rutgers."  
And so people are identifying, and it's almost as though the two states, New
York and New Jersey, are combined as one. And it doesn't hurt when you have
people from the Sopranos out there supporting you as well.  
We have got a lot of famous people that have gone to Rutgers, but now people
will hear about it and will know about it and we are benefiting from that.
Nothing can be greater than the football program and I don't think it's going
to be long before you hear about our great men's basketball program as well.
Your friend will be talking to you a lot.  
  
Q. Having been around the game as long as you have, could you compare Sylvia
Fowles to other great, big women in the game that you've seen.  
COACH STRINGER: I probably saw one of the greatest Lucia Harris. That was at
Delta State. And they started the Wade trophy and all that behind her. I don't
know if there's anybody that can compare to her. She is phenomenal. And all
credit to Coach Starkey and certainly to Pokey, because they have done a
phenomenal job. You always want to look at players -- a lot of people can
inherit great talent and you move them and put them into a position, and but
let's be real about that. And no coach is great when you just have -- you got
to have players. Anyway you shake it.  
But there are also tremendous potential in the ability to mold that and bring
out that talent and create the kind of great player that Sylvia Fowles is. I
think that every coach that has touched her, i.e., Starkey and Pokey and Carla
Berry and whoever the other coaches are, should be really proud, because,
yeah, she did work hard, it's a testimony to her, but with all this great
talent -- but now she's got a shot that she looks extremely confident with.
Hook shots left and right. No one that is quicker. Bigger. She's like a guard.
And you've seen her grow. She was just raw before. But to see the kind of
talent that is there now is just really special. I have not seen a player grow
so quickly as I have with her.  
  
Q. Without giving away any secrets, do you have to double her, what's the
general plan?  
COACH STRINGER: We have to try to figure out how she -- she can't come out of
the locker room.  
(Laughter.) To tell you the truth. They should watch her food and make sure
she doesn't get sick.  
(Laughter.)  
I don't know what we're going to do yet. But as you know, it's going to take a
lot more than -- there's a lot more than just one person, that's why you see
teams change. She's one of the few players that she will change your scheme.
She will make you change. You can't be business as usual with her. Because
she's not a usual player. She is very -- if you even look at the offensive
rebounds you realize she's got something like 130 some offensive rebounds, the
next closest person has 40. You know what I mean?  
It's just this is a one-woman wrecking crew. I think she could play on the
vast majority of Division I men's basketball teams. She's very good. And I
just want to give her nothing but compliments. She's worked hard and the staff
has worked hard.  
  
Q. Do you see NCAA title as something that would complete your resume as a
coach?  
COACH STRINGER: Yeah, how could I not? It's something that we all pursue. I
would not start the season if I didn't think -- but as I'm saying this year,
you know, it was very obvious to me that when we couldn't pass the test and
how we broke down this team, it seems to be extrinsically motivated. It seems
that most of the time we're able to get players that are driven from within.
Essence, who has so much pride within herself, she would dare not come up
short in her work ethic. This group very clearly is stimulated when they know
that there are consequences. And having said that, I didn't think that we
would be here now. I would be lying if I told you that.  
But who wouldn't -- I just want to know what it feels like. And I worked hard,
and everybody else does. But I should tell you that for the coaches who have
had a opportunity to experience it, even if it's been once and you never heard
from them again, and we have some of those, you know, and they just sort of
fade into the sunset, I think that the measure of a coach's success has to be
the people that they have worked with, what they have been able to accomplish,
and basically where you come from and what you did with what you had.  
So within that, I can feel really good, really good. Because each year I'll
say you need about eight players, you need eight players, you need eight
players. You know. And you consider what the talents need to be and all things
need to be right. But along with that, you have to be very fortunate that
someone doesn't get sick, or you don't have something, there are always -- you
have to be lucky on the other side of it too. And I would just like to be
lucky and good and all those other good things.  
I'll always pursue excellence. And excellence is a national championship. So
I'll pursue it. The first coach we played for the national championship with
Louisiana Tech, and I just remember I had to take -- it seems like we were
matched up with everything until we started making substitutions. I was
substituting a 5-11 and Louisiana Tech was substituting a 6-3. You heard of
Dennis Rodman? He had a sister and you know how great a rebounder Dennis
Rodman was, right? Well, he had a sister named Debra Rodman, who was as good
as he was and mad as heck because she was coming off the bench at -- with
Louisiana Tech and she came in and rebounded everything. So, you know, I would
love to do that. But I'll just do the best I can and the team will as well.  
  
Q. Would you talk about how Epiphanny Prince's legal troubles may have
affected your recruiting of her and talk about the struggle or if it was a
struggle for her to overcome that as a freshman and how she's played.  
COACH STRINGER: No, it wasn't a struggle at all for me. Because I think that
everybody got a half a piece of information. Because I got the whole thing.
Only thing I was concerned about Epiphanny Prince was two things: One is
whether or not she could handle the way that we practiced and I had her
specifically come to a practice where Matee and Cappy virtually knocked each
other done down. They were going at it really hard. I wanted her to see that
it was not soft and I questioned whether or not she was tough enough.  
Two, she's darn near genius in math. And so I didn't think that it would be a
problem. She had many talents but she tests off the charts. She probably is --
probably, you know, the Waltons you hear about on a mountain top? I don't know
how you come from New York City and you come with that kind of innocence. But
that is who she is.  
Very shy. Pitifully shy. And just a wonderful, wonderful young lady. A great
human being. I really know what happened and she was more of a observer and it
was a teacher who stepped in to explain that Epiphanny Prince whose name was
big as New York City itself across the country, was a young lady whose name
was drawn into this. This incident with this other little kid and this other
kid that got into the fight. So I was clear. I was very comfortable knowing
how she was and who she was. I was very comfortable.  
I should tell you that 119 points was not the issue. Now, it might seem like
it to most people. But honestly, I told Epiphanny the night before that she
should not sign with Rutgers, should not sign with Rutgers, and the reason
that I said that is because she had come to the practice and I -- she just --
I just didn't know that she was going to be tough enough. How is that?  
And so she didn't sign the papers yet, so I said what happened and she said,
well, I don't think you really want me there and I said, no, that's not it,
that's not it. I just don't want -- I want tough people. I just want hard-
nosed basketball players. We are blue-collar workers. We're not silk-suit
people. And she said no, I always wanted to come. She thinks the world of Kia.
It's not that far. And aside from that, her mother probably keeps her in
church about six or seven hours a day on Sunday. And so her mom wanted to be
sure that she was close enough. So, you know, it worked out well. And it
hasn't been a problem. At all.  
What I will say is that Epiphanny along with another freshman probably are two
of the brightest basketball minds on the floor. There's nothing -- anything
that she does, all things that she does, how is this, all things that she
does, she will walk past you and say, well, the reason why I did this is, was
that okay. She was a young lady when we took everything away she said, Coach,
can I please run to the locker room for a second so I can shower because the
other showers are really cold and I already changed my clothes and I got to go
a class. And I said okay.  
She's a great basketball player a innocent person, great student, and we're
fortunate to have her. And I'm really happy because I didn't believe what I
saw. I came to understand another young lady.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about Sylvia Fowles a little bit, and USC played her
tough and was going to let the other players beat them. And they did. The
supporting role players, like Allison Hightower, Ashley Thomas, how do you try
to balance stopping Sylvia and stopping their shots from the perimeter?  
COACH STRINGER: You might look at the percentages, how often does Hightower or
Chaney or these other people shoot, where they shooting from, who the person
that is feeding the ball to Fowles is. What are their contributions. You play
the odds. If you got to put another player on her then that's the way it is.  
Now I'm not sure exactly how we're going to handle this. We're a little
different team than Connecticut. I think that we do apply a little more
pressure than what Connecticut does.  
So it will be interesting. We can either just go set it up one-on-one and then
apply a lot more pressure on the ball handler and make her make a difficult
decision. But we do need to protect Kia Vaughn. And so it poses a problem,
there's no question about that. And what's great about the LSU team is that a
lot of players will -- a lot of teams will have great players, but they don't
have guards that can get it to her, nor do they have people that are smart
enough to know that you have something that no one else has. If you look at
the second half of the UConn game, I would say 95 percent of all passes, it
went into her. Against West Virginia, they were down, West Virginia, we beat
them. They played them as well. So who are the common people?  
Well, in the first half, Fowles didn't touch it much. Second half, just chart
the number of times that she touched that ball. To finish it up. She shot 8-9.
And I can tell you that she touched that ball 95 percent of the time. Sylvia
Fowles is the board for LSU. But don't make a mistake, because Hightower,
Erica, you know, Chaney, all of these players can get it done. They're
powerful and they complement each other well. And Bob Starkey was right about
this.  
What also is exciting about the LSU team is they're very bright. It's very
difficult for us to know the patterns, which we generally do. 99 percent of
the times we can probably run a pattern as well as the team that we're
playing. That also is what helps us to be there a little bit quicker because
we have run -- we run so many patterns ourselves that we can anticipate, we
know, but this team, it makes it very difficult because they read. You cannot
guess anything. They read, they understand spacing extremely well. They're not
turning that ball over. They do and can apply pressure and they will play you
according to what you do.  
For example, if Matee is a 3-point shooter, they will play her close. If
Epiphanny Prince doesn't take drives or takes drives, then they're going to
back off. This team plays personnel and they should be given a lot of credit.
Smart team, excellent offenses, execution and playing together as a team and
they're playing for a purpose.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you very much, Coach, and we'll see you
tomorrow.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Now joined by LSU head coach Pokey Chatman and players Rashonta
LeBlanc and Sylvia Fowles.  
Coach, if you could make an opening comment.  
COACH CHATMAN: I want to start by congratulating Vanderbilt for the conference
tournament championship. You know, we knew going into the game we were going
to face a very good offensive team with a ton of weapons, but also a team that
probably doesn't get the credit they deserve for the match-up zone that they
play. We thought we had some things figured out in terms of what we needed to
do in order to attack that.  
But I didn't think we gave ourselves enough opportunity. We didn't quite have
our offensive moxy or mojo. We're were not as poised as we had been throughout
the tournament. A lot of credit goes to Vanderbilt for that. We have to take
responsibility for it, as well. But we kept relying on the defense to create
more opportunities for us to experience success, and we didn't quite
capitalize on it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. The game was slowly paced all through the night with few fastbreaks. Did
you consider putting any press to up-tempo it, or was that something that was
never part of the thought?  
COACH CHATMAN: You know, you could think about several different things. I
thought initially we had a good game plan in terms of the number of
opportunities we were creating for ourselves, rebound opportunities,
opportunities to get back and run. They're a good transition defense team. A
lot of those opportunities didn't present itself.  
But you don't want to, you know, play six one way, half dozen of another in
terms of if you get beat by one and you get it up to three. I wanted to take
away opportunities for their shooters. We wanted to stay close to them. The
best way to do that was in the halfcourt. We cut this court down.  
One for nine in three-point land for that team, holding them to 51 points
gives a good chance to win, but you have to marry that with some good offense
to give yourself an even better chance.  
  
Q. What does it say about the balance in the SEC in particular and in
women's college basketball in general when you have the No. 3 and No. 4 seed
in the finals here?  
COACH CHATMAN: It says what the coaches and players in the league have been
saying for years. It always gets questioned. It was put to the test today.
Quality coaches, quality players. It's not just a fly-by-night thing. I think
it's been that way for as long as I can remember. That's what makes it fun.  
  
Q. This is three years in a row you have come so close. How difficult is
that to go through year in and year out?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It's very difficult knowing you work so hard to get here and to
come up short every time. It's definitely difficult. Just knowing that we're
better and what we're capable of, to see us come up short every time is just
depressing.  
  
Q. Pokey, what did they do to make it difficult to try to get the ball to
Sylvia earlier in the shot clock? Seems like they would sag down low, y'all
would get 15 seconds, 20 seconds, sag down low, make it difficult to make the
pass. Why not the ability to get it into her very quickly?  
COACH CHATMAN: I think it's several things. I think it's the concept of team
defense. When you think of someone doubling the post, you delegate that just
to the post players and not to the perimeter players who are quick enough, big
enough, and anticipate well enough to where that happens and maybe Sylvia is
open maybe their view is obscured and you can't see that.  
I think it's just a total team concept. You do a good job of anticipating,
jumping, moving, making you think your guard is in certain areas, those
opportunities are not quite as long as most team's. But they do a good job.  
  
Q. Winners bounce back after they're faced with adversity. Does that add
fuel to the fire?  
COACH CHATMAN: Definitely. These kids are competitors. But they also
understand in the grand scheme of things what this tournament is about.
Obviously it's an opportunity to gain momentum. It's an opportunity to win a
championship.  
But because this league is so tough, it's an opportunity to make you realize
and understand why you're good, where you need to be better, what you struggle
with going into the next season because you don't have that window. You have a
true indication of what you need to work on when you go back to practice.  
  
Q. Rashonta, could you talk about your view of this game, the role you tried
to play, maybe some of the things coach talked about that didn't work out for
you to get the victory?  
RASHONTA LeBLANC: Well, my role was just to knock down open shots. We have to
take the pressure off of Sylvia, knock down some open shots. I just tried to
knock down open shots and play hard on defense against Caroline Williams, who
is a great three-point shooter. Just try to hold her down.  
  
Q. If somebody told you before the game you were going to hold Vanderbilt to
one three-pointer, would you think you would probably have a pretty good
chance to win the game?  
COACH CHATMAN: Most definitely. I know what my team is capable of. I know what
they bring to the table. Just happens tonight we fell short.  
  
Q. You talked about addressing your strengths and weaknesses heading into
the tournament. What are some of those strengths and weaknesses you're going
to be addressing this week in practice?  
COACH CHATMAN: Score with the basketball and find different ways to do it.
Everyone knows about the woman in the middle. They're not quite sure about
everyone else. We know what we're capable of doing.  
It's not about having a No. 1, 2, 3 scorer. The game will present itself, who
that person is going to be. It happened to be Rashonta tonight. The other day
it was Allison. The game and their scouting report defense was they take that.
But just more an offensive poise, some discipline.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2007

  

### [Melanie Balcomb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13863)

### [Dee Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16908)

### [Carla Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15515)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Vanderbilt head coach Melanie Balcomb and players Dee
Davis and Carla Thomas.  
Coach, if you would make an opening statement.  
COACH BALCOMB: I know it wasn't as pretty as our first two games. I think
what's important is we showed we can play any tempo. I know it was their
tempo, their low score. And we battled. We battled down the stretch. I was
really proud of our defensive effort, and defense wins championships. I think
that's what happened tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Did the three-point shooting get you to the championship?  
COACH BALCOMB: [] yeah, it got us there, but they took away our threes
(laughter). They took away our high-low. We did get the ball inside, but not
as much. They did a good job on us inside. We scored in spurts. But they
forget about Dee Davis. She stepped up. She penetrated. She got fouled. She
hit pull-ups and a big three. It's like pick your poison. I'm just so proud
how it can be somebody different every night. I thought Dee really stepped up
and put us in key spots for us tonight.  
  
Q. Can you describe the play where you cut by Fowles with about a minute to
go in the game at mid-court and then you had the breakaway? What happened on
that play?  
DEE DAVIS: I honestly didn't see her at first. It was a press breaker play
that we have. I was hoping that Carla was going to throw the ball because I
knew I was going to get down there. She reached for the ball and I was able to
move it out of the way and get down the court.  
  
Q. What does it say about the strength of the SEC to have a No. 3 and No. 4
seed in the finals?  
COACH BALCOMB: I think it says a lot about this conference. I thought it was
deep from top to bottom this year. I thought there were a lot of great games
in the tournament. I think hopefully we'll get six teams in at least, if not
more. I just think night in and night out you can't rest. You've always got to
be ready.  
  
Q. Coach, you played LSU recently. Did you make any adjustments or changes
between last and this game?  
COACH BALCOMB: No, we didn't make a lot of adjustments. You have less than 24
hours to come back, rebound after your last game. There's not a lot of prep
time. What was nice is we knew them, but at the same time they knew us.  
I didn't think the game plan -- their game plan wasn't going to change a lot
and our game plan. It was going to be who executed the game plan better and
down the stretch who wanted it more. It comes down to such a mental toughness
game in games like this. I just thought we gutted it out.  
  
Q. Dee, at what point did you realize how important you were going to be in
this game? Was it early on, coming into the game? Was it when you guys started
missing some three-points?  
DEE DAVIS: For sure, when we started missing a few outside shots, I knew that
I had to step it up. Coach said, Do what you do. If you can't get all the way
to the basket because Sylvia is down there, you got to pull up. It was a
championship game and I knew I had a lot of heart coming into this game. I
knew senior night, we played with a lot of heart. I knew it was a championship
game. Felt like the same motivation going in.  
I knew we had a freshman SEC championship under our belt and we wanted to
leave out with one.  
  
Q. Melanie, Sylvia had a dominant game against Tennessee last night. What
were the keys on cutting down on both her rebounds and points tonight?  
COACH BALCOMB: The thing, we play team defense. We talked a lot about where we
want to double her from and how we want to force her up as high as possible so
that we could recover back out. If she got us too deep, it's too late to
double. She'll just jump up over you and score.  
We wanted to force her to try to make a post move, force her out high, come
and double from the closest person, and then recover back out.  
It's the same game plan we had when we played them at home. We thought we
executed it well again.  
  
Q. Carla, it looked like stopping Sylvia you were going to run out of fouls
early. Talk about how you managed your fouls after the first half.  
CARLA THOMAS: It was frustrating at first to come out and get those early
fouls. But I think Liz stepped up amazingly well. She was banging in there
with Fowles. She made her work hard for every basket she got. So I think with
that rotation we had, we could go to the bench when we need to.  
  
Q. Carla, your coach is talking about keeping fouls from setting up too low
near the basket. But that's easier said than done because she gets low and
gets position so often. What did you do against her? What were you conscious
of doing against her?  
CARLA THOMAS: Coach just talked about moving our feet, just trying to get
around as much as possible. Can't really move her off the block. You just have
to sort of use her momentum against her. So when she's trying to cut
somewhere, you make her cut where she doesn't want to. It's not really a
matter of doing anything special. Just keep moving your feet, trying to keep
her from getting somewhere where she doesn't want to be.  
  
Q. Dee, coach touched on it a little bit. You've flown a little under the
radar the first couple games of this tournament. How meaningful for you is it
as a senior to have a huge game in the championship, get a championship on
your way out the door?  
DEE DAVIS: It was overdue, especially how I played last night. I didn't even
play 20 minutes. I knew I needed to be on the floor with my teammates. Being a
senior you need to be a leader, make smarter decisions on the floor. I just
made it a point to tonight come out and do everything that the team needed.  
  
Q. Melanie, what kind of NCAA seed do you think you're looking at now? 2 or
3?  
COACH BALCOMB: Yeah, you know, I try so hard not to read the projected things
because, again, so much of it is just pure opinion and projection. There's so
much that goes into it. You never know what the selection committee is
thinking.  
My opinion is very biased, but I think we deserve a 2 seed. I know when we ran
the tables when they were freshmen, that's what we got was a 2 seed. I didn't
think we made any mistakes.  
We scheduled -- I know last night we had the ninth-best schedule in the
country. We scheduled higher. We made no mistakes. We have no bad losses. We
have a couple real good wins now. We're playing our best basketball down the
stretch. I hope they take all those things into consideration.  
If they do, I think we're going to get a 2 seed - a 3 at the lowest. To be
honest with you, I'd be disappointed with a 3.  
  
Q. Carla, you talked a lot coming into this tournament about how meaningful
it would be to be able to win an SEC championship your senior year after
winning it your freshman year. Put into words what it means to have
accomplished what you set out to do.  
CARLA THOMAS: Wow, that's hard to do. I would say it's sweet. It's
bittersweet, but it's a great feeling. You know you're going out, you know
you're finishing up, but you went out the right way. I guess that's how I'd
put it.  
  
Q. Coach, seemed like keeping them off the offensive glass was an important
key today. Talk about that if you would.  
COACH BALCOMB: Yeah, I talked a lot about on TV that we held them to 28% field
goal percentage, which is awesome. It's amazing. Then to hold them in the last
six minutes without a basket is playing great defense down the stretch.  
I ended up saying the key was checking it out. We knew we were doing a good
job on their first shot, but they didn't get second or third shots. I thought
we did an awesome job just going after the basketball and wanting it. I just
really am proud of how bad they wanted this game and how they gutted it out.
That's just effort. Their skills. They showed a lot of heart.  
I didn't even worry about it. I knew they would. If there was a loose ball, we
were on it. We've been that way all the way down the stretch in all these
games. It's so nice to coach a team that I don't have to coach effort, because
you can't coach effort.  
  
Q. Could you put into words as a coach how meaningful it is to you to watch
them be able to win this championship on their way out?  
COACH BALCOMB: It's awesome. That's why I coach, to see them be happy,
accomplish this. They've been through a lot and they've worked really hard for
it. I'm so happy for them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 3, 2007

  

### [Tasha Humphrey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16883)

### [Andy Landers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13868)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Georgia head coach Andy Landers and players
Cori Chambers and Tasha Humphrey.  
Coach, if you would make an opening comment, we'll take questions.  
COACH LANDERS: Well, you know, I think it's pretty obvious, Vanderbilt did
what Vanderbilt wanted to do. They did it the way they wanted to do it. We
didn't affect it very much.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach or players.  
  
Q. Tasha, coach had already said there was no intensity when you guys were
coming out. Why was that?  
TASHA HUMPHREY: I really can't say. We had a defensive game plan coming into
the game. We just didn't execute.  
  
Q. Andy, are you baffled to go from where you were yesterday to today?  
COACH LANDERS: Today is going to take a little bit more effort. It involved
our defensive play on the perimeter a lot more -- in a lot more serious
manner. Yesterday, the ball (indiscernible) laid with the post players, or at
least that being the serious part.  
Today, you know, we had to affect certain people as they were on the
perimeter. And the difficulty with their post players was they could shoot you
outside. They could go inside and play the power game.  
So, you know, you ask me if I'm surprised to go from yesterday to today. I'd
be surprised to go to today any time. When you're in a tournament and you just
don't bring the intensity and the toughness that you have to have to compete
isn't just a surprise, it's kind of shocking that you let shooters catch and
shoot, that you even let them catch let alone be wide open and shoot, you
know, that you know where they're cutting from, what screens they're using.
You can't beat 'em to those screens.  
This isn't a team that doesn't have exceptional quickness, guys. That's the
things that's interesting. There are people in this league that can make it
really hard for us to keep up with when they make their cuts. This isn't one
of those teams.  
  
Q. Is there anything you could identify in particular that they were able to
do defensively to stop the offense tonight?  
COACH LANDERS: Unfortunately I think some of the offense was tied to defense.
We go down on the defensive end. We started off in a zone. We played them a
lot of zone, almost entirely zone, in Athens earlier in the year. What do they
do? They drill it right inside, drill it right into the middle of the zone and
lay us up.  
First thing you know, they've shot one or two. We've gone down on the other
end, missed a couple of layups, missed a couple of put-backs to start the
game. Now I think our offense is tied to our defense. We can't stop them.
We're going down the floor probably think of that, and they're doing a good
job of keeping us matched. We're not attacking. We're passing.  
I'll take responsibility for the way we started the game on the offensive end.
I'll take all the responsibility for it. I'm not going to take any of the
responsibility for what we did on the defensive end, none of it.  
  
Q. You were talking yesterday about how you were building towards something.
How much does this damage what you were building towards?  
COACH LANDERS: I don't know. I really don't know. You know, I mean, tournament
teams have to bring a fight to the tournament. You know, I mean, you realize
you're one-and-done. They're an absence of fight. You know, we didn't come out
of the locker room ready. I don't know.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 3, 2007

  

### [Pokey Chatman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13865)

### [Sylvia Fowles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15650)

### [Erica White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16371)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Now joined by LSU head coach Pokey Chatman and student-athletes
Sylvia Fowles and Erica White.  
Coach Chatman, if you could make an opening comment and then we'll take
questions.  
COACH CHATMAN: I think I have to start this press conference with the effort
that we gave defensively and our ability to really carry out a scouting report
defense that, you know, starts with trying to limit some of the touches by
Candace and also get to their shooters. So I have to start there.  
More importantly, when we got off to the slow start offensively. I thought we
did a good job of executing our offensive game, spread the floor a little bit.
Knew they would be pretty aggressive. Sort of screen the passers so we could
get some good looks to the baskets.  
Kids never got rattled. It's tough to come out, get off to a slow start on
this stage. But they held their composure. I credit Erica a lot with that out
on the perimeter and Sylvia held it down in the paint. We were fortunate
enough to have the defensive effort throughout and not lose offensive momentum
when Tennessee changed their defense. They went to a little zone. We still
executed. They thought of switching screens, we still executed. All-out good
effort both intelligently and effort-wise.  
  
Q. You both know each other well. Your team knew the scouting report. What
was different from the game in Baton Rouge? What made the game plans on
offense and defense more successful?  
COACH CHATMAN: I think defensively we took the second 20 minutes from Baton
Rouge and we did a better job of running someone at Candace, not letting her
have comfortable touches. And that's not it. They're not a one-person team.
The help is not enough you have to recover.  
I thought we were help in our help and our recover and we were a lot more
disciplined when you look at the shots that we made them miss. We didn't give
up second-chance opportunities.  
We were lucky to be in the ballgame last time giving up 20. We merit defensive
effort with securing some rebounds.  
  
Q. First timeout after being down in a big hole, what did you say to the
ladies to get the momentum turned around?  
COACH CHATMAN: Basically just said the same thing we said coming out of the
locker room: Just slow down, spread the floor. They're going to be aggressive.
Someone pass the ball, screen the passer. You're going to have wide-open look.  
Because we missed a couple of them. I think Rashonta was the first person made
the pass. We screened for her. She missed a layup. Those shots are going to be
there. Slow down, calm down. Not really a change, just something to stop the
bleeding.  
  
Q. How many paychecks does Sylvia get for this game?  
COACH CHATMAN: An opportunity to advance to tomorrow. Sylvia went out, you
know, did what she's done for most of the year against a quality opponent on
this stage. She never wavered. She goes 40 minutes again. One, two, three
people on her. Really held it down in the paint for us.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Too bad I don't get a paycheck for this one. Just a great
feeling to just advance tomorrow and be ready to play is my paycheck.  
  
Q. Can you comment on the play of Allison Hightower, how she just really
stepped up big for you on the offensive end.  
COACH CHATMAN: Allison has shown that throughout the year. It's so hard for a
freshman coming in, you don't ever give them a chance to get acclimated
because you throw them to the wolves. She's finally comfortable in the open
court taking her shot or making the shot, creating something for herself.  
She sort of has that little ice water in your veins. When they're young they
don't know any better. They're just out there playing the game that they've
been playing. She knows these kids have so much confidence in her. They want
her to take that shot, because she's taken them all year at practice and
earlier in the year.  
  
Q. Erica, you seem to really have found an attacking style again on offense,
especially in this tournament. What have the coaches helped you with? What
have you told yourself leading up to these games that allowed you to go
inside?  
ERICA WHITE: Basically what I told myself is just to come out and play
fearless and smart. I think that's a deadly combination when I can put that
together.  
The biggest adjustment I made is just jump stopping in the lane, getting the
defense in the air, making my layups, usually getting a foul on the defense,
going to the line, making my free-throws.  
Offensively I'm just playing smarter, being better with the ball. Like I say,
I'm just trying to get to the paint, jump stop, create a shot for myself, and
find my teammates.  
  
Q. Sylvia and Erica, talk about how fulfilling it was to get that win after
Tennessee got the win from you at the house.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It was a great feeling. Back then when we played them at our
house, we had time to sit down and recover, look over the things that we
didn't do well and some things that they didn't do well and how can we stop
them. We just brung it out tonight. We brung it for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. You played the No. 2 team in the country. You out-rebounded them. You
beat them. You shot 44%. You held them under 40%. Is this the best game you
guys have played this year?  
COACH CHATMAN: Oh, gosh, you know, for this time of year, you'd have to say
yes just because, you know, you've gotten an opportunity not as it relates to
us but also about position. As the year goes on, Tennessee's going to get
better, and so you know the challenge is greater, especially on this stage.
It's a team that ran the table in this conference. They're the measuring
stick. If you can be successful against that measuring stick, I guess you
would have to say that, all things considered.  
But I still think there's things we can do better, like eliminate the first
four minutes of games where we have high-low possessions. We'll get there.  
  
Q. Pokey, the very end of the season you guys really lost some close games
to highly-ranked teams, a couple on your home floor. Tonight I sensed not only
defensively but offensively you really came together as a team. Can you
comment on that?  
COACH CHATMAN: Yeah, you're talking about two and three in that five-game
stretch. There's not a lot of shame in the teams you lost to, two possible No.
1 seeds, Vanderbilt at Nashville. The caveat that goes unmentioned was Ashley
Thomas. She was not with us those five games. She played 11 minutes against
Connecticut.  
She doesn't score a lot of points, but she just helps you defensively. She
knows where to go. She helps you offensively because she can set that solid
screen that's going to lead to someone helping and having a shot for a
shooter, all those coach things that we love. So it's nice having her back.
She gave us some solid minutes.  
That's why we schedule those games. You hope you can learn from them, and I
think we did.  
  
Q. Both players, third straight time in the tournament final. A little
something left in the tank for the final tomorrow?  
ERICA WHITE: Yeah, there's definitely fuel to the fire. We have an opportunity
ahead of us to take out an opponent that beat us earlier in the year, no
matter who wins the game tonight. We'll definitely be ready to play tomorrow.
Gonna get some rest and come out energized.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I agree with Erica. We're just going to enjoy this for the last
few moments, last few minutes, take it back, reenergize and bring the energy
tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2007

  

### [Melanie Balcomb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13863)

### [Carla Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15515)

### [Christina Wirth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16901)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Now joined by Vanderbilt head coach Melanie Balcomb and players
Christina Wirth and Carla Thomas.  
Coach, if you would make an opening comment.  
COACH BALCOMB: I think the best thing I can say is what I told my players. I
think that was the best defensive effort by a Vanderbilt team that I've ever
coached. That made offense real easy.  
You know, if we have that effort every game, it makes it a lot of fun - a lot
of fun to watch and a lot of fun to coach.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Some people that haven't seen you play are wondering how long can you
guys continue to shoot the three-pointer like you do? What do you say to
people like that?  
COACH BALCOMB: I say what Tina Wirth said yesterday: We're shooters so we
shoot. That's what we do. We're doing with it a lot of confidence. I don't
know why we would lose our confidence. We practice it a lot. It's repetition.
It's confidence.  
As long as we execute and get good shots and take the shot selection that
we're taking, we're going to make it. There's a good percentage that we are.
We have some players like Caroline Williams, and now Tina I would add to that,
where, you know, we call it the layup when they make a three. That's their
layup. You know, they're just that confident. That comes from practice. That
comes from preparation.  
  
Q. A lot of offensive success last night, but you came out talking about how
poorly you played defensively. Getting back to defense, what specifically were
you able to do tonight to improve that on that side of the ball?  
COACH BALCOMB: I caught some flak for halftime for getting on them at
halftime, and I haven't had to do that in a long time. We've played well. Our
effort has been good. It's been a fun team to coach. I got on them hard when
we were shooting 70% from the field.  
What I tried to explain to everybody was I didn't get on them about offense. I
didn't even talk to them about offense. What I talked about was defense, being
complacent to exchange baskets with a team like that that there was no reason
we should have.  
And you win championships by defense, and that's something that we haven't
been able to do. Put the two together, I think we can be really tough. That's
what was my point, and that's why we emphasized it so much.  
The changes that they made, you know, our staff did a great job getting a
great game plan together. They just executed the things that we tweaked and
that we talked about. They've always believed in all season what we've asked
them to do. They executed the game plan to a T.  
  
Q. Could you to talk about Merideth Marsh, your freshman point guard.  
COACH BALCOMB: What's nice is she went in early, made some mistakes, turned it
over, got a lot of pressure. The minute she came in they had to press and then
even press more because they were down, and they pressed her.  
I thought she did a really good job at getting better as the game went on and
gaining confidence. Instead of putting her head down after she made mistakes,
I love how she recovered and I love how tough she played. As it got tough and
physical, she got tougher and she got better. She went 10 for 10 from the
free-throw line. At that point she just needed to take care of the basketball
and make free-throws, and that's what she did.  
  
Q. Christina, can you talk about how this type of defense helps get open
looks?  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: Well, when we're playing a defense like we did tonight we're
pressuring the ball. We even got a lot of help side, so we're just trusting
each other. When we get -- like if we're boxing and if we get an offensive
rebound and we push the ball we got good middle runners to really focus on.
Even if you don't get the ball for a layup, you know you're just sucking
defense into the paint, and then that leaves shooters up and on the perimeter.
We did a really good job.  
Coach talked about how everyone did their roles to a T. No one else might
notice that you sprinted down the middle as hard as you could, but we noticed
it, and it really makes a difference.  
  
Q. Christina, I saw you come up with a walking boot on. Is that you think
easier?  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: Just precautionary stuff.  
  
Q. When the threes keep falling, can you see it sap something out of the
team you're playing?  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: I think so. We know what it does when someone else does that
to us. I think especially a lot of times tonight, they'd be scrambling inside,
just kick it out. That's tough when you're scrambling and, you know, all of a
sudden the other team makes a three.  
I think that's a momentum shifter. We try to take that away from other teams,
so it's nice when we can do that to them.  
  
Q. Carla, how much of an impact did coach's talking about defense at
halftime yesterday and then after the game have on you tonight in terms of how
you were able to play defensively?  
CARLA THOMAS: I think when you win like that and you're not really satisfied
with it, you know you could have played better defense than you did. She
basically called us out on it. We knew we had to come into the next game and
try to step it up. That was something we focused on all season. To come in and
not play that way post-season going into the SEC tournament, it was a
disappointment to us.  
  
Q. You had Dee Davis in foul trouble. Carla was in a bit of foul trouble. Up
and down the roster you have contributions. Talk about the depth of this team
and specifically about the importance of Christina Wirth to this club.  
COACH BALCOMB: Absolutely. That's the other thing I think we're better than
we've ever been at is depth. That's due to the way they practice and the way
they have expected each other to practice and perform.  
We have 12 players that work just as hard from 1 to 12. I have never coached a
team like that. Whether they play a minute or not, and we're talking the 11th
and 12th player. We talked about that every day. From top to bottom they
prepare very hard like they're going to play. I've never had a team to be able
to do that on into March when they know they're not playing a lot.  
So they were ready. When they got their opportunity, they were ready. And
they've been ready all season. As the season has gone on, freshmen keep
getting better. And they're sitting behind some very, very good seniors, and
not getting the playing time they would normally get.  
And I have to say I'm really impressed with their attitude and their effort,
and I think that is what I attribute them being ready and being able to come
in and perform the way they did when we needed them to. They were there for
them.  
I think that gives these guys a lot of confidence to know if they do make
mistakes or get overaggressive, that somebody can come in.  
As far as Tina and what she's worth to this team? Get it? Tina, worth
(laughter). Had to catch myself. Today she was amazing. She was on. She was in
the zone, whatever you want to call it. She was fun to watch. What I love is
she's the most improved player from last year to this year, the way she
carries herself and her confidence.  
The other part I love about her is how she keeps everything light and fun. The
seniors, there's a lot of pressure on the seniors because it's their last year
and they don't want it to end and they're having a great time. They want to go
out with a bang and do things that have never been done at Vanderbilt.  
Then you have Tina and Jen Risper, the sophomores, making it fun and laughing.
I think sometimes they want to kill them because they're keeping it light.  
But that is like the best thing that can be done for these seniors, is the way
they keep it light. So they just help them on and off the court in very unique
ways that's fun to watch.  
  
Q. Carla, if I'm not mistaken, you won the SEC tournament championship as a
freshman, correct?  
CARLA THOMAS: Yes.  
  
Q. What would it mean for you tomorrow as a senior to be able to do that
again?  
CARLA THOMAS: That would be huge. That's what we're coming back here for. Want
to go out with a bang, and that's definitely the way to do it in the SEC.  
  
Q. Coach, beat LSU a little over a week ago in Nashville, played an
outstanding game. What challenges do you foresee tomorrow night?  
COACH BALCOMB: I see a lot of the same challenges. You know, I was really
impressed with how they played today, how they just got more and more
confident as the game went on. Their body language was very impressive. That's
what I've been watching all tournament, is the body language of the teams.  
I think that they've penetrated really well. I thought that some of their
younger players stepped up in key situations. But, you know, Fowles
especially, our game plan was to limit her touches, and we're going to have to
do that again. We're going to have to stop penetration again. We're going to
have to play great transition D and limit them to one shot.  
The chances game plans change between theirs and ours in one week, I mean,
it's not going to change a lot. It's a lot going to be about confidence and
tempo and how people recover from mistakes and things that happen in the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 3, 2007

  

### [Nicky Anosike](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16903)

### [Alexis Hornbuckle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16879)

### [Pat Summitt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14068)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Now joined by Tennessee head Coach Pat Summitt and players
Nicky Anosike and Alexis Hornbuckle.  
Coach, if you could make an opening comment and then we'll take questions.  
COACH SUMMITT: I think if you just take a look at this game statistically and
you look at the paint points that LSU got, the inside presence that Sylvia
Fowles gave them, tremendous. Erica White, what she brought to their team in
terms of just how productive she was both offensively and getting her team
involved.  
You know, we got whipped right down the middle. They were just better. They
had a post game. We didn't have a post game consistently. They did an awful
lot from their point position. Obviously, very disappointed that we didn't
match the intensity. When I say that, I'm talking five people on the floor at
all times. I thought LSU was much more inspired one through five. Just really
made a lot of great plays.  
Obviously Alexis had a super effort. Nicky did a great job for us, I thought
gave us, as she always does, a tremendous defensive effort on the inside.  
Then the other thing that was glaring to me was the bench play. We didn't get
much off of our bench in terms of being productive and making a difference,
and they obviously got a lot more than they did.  
They were a better team tonight than we were. They had some better overall
play as a basketball team both defensively and offensively.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Alexis, could you talk about your play, the point production, what you
were able to accomplish offensively this evening.  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: I came out tonight with a mindset that I wanted to give
110%. No matter what the outcome of the game, I wanted to feel like I didn't
let my teammates down.  
You know, I got great looks. Tonight I was able to knock 'em down.  
  
Q. Coach, is there any way you can explain what happened with Candace
tonight? A career low in scoring. Was it what they were doing defensively? Was
she being lackadaisical? Any explanation?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I felt like, you know, obviously there were times we
couldn't get her the basketball because they did a good job of defending her
with a player and a half or two players. But then I thought she settled for a
facing up, not posting up. We really needed her to establish an inside game
for us.  
Obviously, it was physical. But, you know, I think that's where we have to
learn. She has to really just be very deliberate in getting what she wants in
the paint. It just hurt us not to have a strong presence there because as she
goes we go inside. We have to have that. She knows that. I'm sure no one feels
more pain about this than she does.  
But, again, we just felt like we just couldn't establish the inside. We didn't
establish the inside game consistently. That's where we should have been.  
  
Q. Obviously a lot of basketball ahead of you ladies. What do you tell your
team after a tough loss like this?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, we have to learn from it. You know, this team, they've
been very committed to do what we've asked them to do as a coaching staff.
They've taken ownership. I don't think that's going to change.  
You know, I think this loss hurts everyone. Everyone in the locker room's
disappointed: Coaches, players. We know we can't win post-season without five
people playing, without our bench bringing what they need to bring.  
The one concern I had coming in is, you know, what's this going to mean to our
team one through ten? How are we going to handle this? It's happened in the
past. When we've been able to win the regular season it's been far more
difficult to win the tournament.  
I think LSU, as far as looking at their motivation and their desire, their
commitment across the board, when they had five players on the floor I think
they all were on a mission to try and win this game. I don't feel like we had
that strong a commitment and desire one through five at all times.  
  
Q. Nicky, can you talk about Sylvia Fowles' performance? Is that as good a
post performance as you've ever seen?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: She was just strong in there for them. I tried to guard as best
I can, but obviously she ended up with 19 points so I didn't do as well as I
should have for this team.  
But, yeah, she was strong in there for them.  
  
Q. Coach, maybe the difference Erica White gave to them, wasn't able to
score as much at the game in Baton Rouge.  
COACH SUMMITT: I think just watching Erica, watching her play last night, I
thought very, very aggressive. I thought we did a better job when we played at
LSU. I thought our defensive pressure was much better.  
She's just the type of player that really pushes tempo. I think she's been
more involved for them offensively. We didn't match her intensity. I mean, if
I had to say, again, down the middle, point guard play, post play, we were not
where we needed to be to have a chance to win this game tonight.  
You know, I think likewise, when she's making plays, we're not getting our key
scorers involved, you know, Spencer's got to shoot better for us, Parker's got
to post up and score more for us on the block. We know what we have to do.  
They did what they had to do and scored from the positions they needed to
score from. We just didn't match it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2007

  

### [Susan Walvius](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15514)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now, South Carolina head coach Susan Walvius and
student-athletes Melanie Johnson and Lauren Simms.  
Coach, if you could make an opening comment, we'll take questions.  
COACH WALVIUS: I thought our team played hard today, didn't quit. That was
important to us. We turned the ball over a little bit too much. Stacy Booker's
twisted knee early in the first half, wasn't it, or late in the first half,
certainly affected us. She's really been a sparkplug for us recently. We've
relied on her quite a bit.  
But, you know, our team played hard. We didn't do some of the things we
typically do in guarding tendencies. We didn't rebound the ball as well as we
normally do. We turned it over a bit too much. But I thought the fight was
there. The fight was there late in the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Can you talk about being within eight late in the first half?  
COACH WALVIUS: I think, you know, coming into this game, playing Tennessee, I
think Tennessee's playing great basketball right now. We knew we would have --
this game is won or lost teams playing Tennessee before it even starts a lot
of times. Our team did not have that mentality today. It was a mentality of
resolve to go out and fight and win and do the little things well.  
You know, I thought we played with some scrap and we were able to get some
things done because of that. I wasn't surprised by that. I thought our team
did a good job.  
  
Q. You mentioned Stacy Booker's injury. Do you know how serious it is? I
know you want to be in the post-season. Would she be available? You don't know
yet?  
COACH WALVIUS: I would hope so. We will have it evaluated. We took a very
conservative approach with her today. We want to make sure she's okay. We
talked to her and she thought she could play. We have a doctor here to
evaluate it. We're going to have her evaluated in Columbia and see where it
is. Hopefully so. She's certainly very good.  
We are looking forward to post-season. I'll put in our plug for it. As I said,
of all the bubble teams, head-to-head with those teams late, we've won those
games. Of the RPIs, we're right behind Auburn with RPI. SEC is a much better
league this year. I know you all know that. You guys can see that.  
It's a league -- the league has let eight teams in in the past. It's
definitely a league that should get seven or eight teams in this year.  
  
Q. Was there any surprise by a little different look to the Tennessee
scoring, a little less reliance on Candace, more balanced than some would
expect?  
COACH WALVIUS: You know, we know when Tennessee -- we certainly talked about
that as a team and you saw this happen at points in time during the game. When
Tennessee needs a basket, they're going to go to Parker. She played hard. She
did a nice job for them.  
Everybody on their team is very, very good. They do a nice job making
decisions. They work the ball really well. They shoot the ball so well from
the outside. Their defense is very good which creates a lot of offense for
them. They're tall. They rebound the ball extremely well.  
Was it a surprise they didn't go to Parker all night? No. Spencer does a great
job shooting the ball. Hornbuckle does a great job, really takes the ball hard
to the rim, can score off the dribble. They were really balanced and that's
what makes them so hard to guard.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2007

  

### [Carolyn Peck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13864)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Now joined by Florida head coach Carolyn Peck, players Kim Dye
and Briana Phillips.  
Coach Peck, if you could make an opening comment.  
COACH PECK: Well, you know, it's been a privilege and an honor to work with
these young women, Briana and Kim Dye. Seems like the newspapers have
forgotten that Tasha Moorehead was also in the recruiting class that we signed
with this group.  
These two young women have stayed committed and loyal and shown a great deal
of determination, because you can tell a lot of character about people, not
just when times are good, but when times are bad. And these two have shined in
those times. Both of them have had injuries that have caused them to sit out
for a whole entire season. And for them to get themselves in the position, be
able to do the things that they have done, I'm extremely proud of them.  
Today was a war and a battle. There are things I can say and things I can't.
But I think that, you know, Vanderbilt, they played hard. They've got a deep
bench. You know, it was a tough battle. But the Gators, this team, they never
quit, and they won't. These two young women up here, you know what, they're
going to be successful in real life because they don't quit.  
And the returning players, they've got quite a core group now because we
cleaned up a lot of good stuff, and there's a lot of good stuff that's gonna
be there at Florida when I leave. And so a lot of you may measure wins and
losses by the points at the end of the game, but I think my group had a lot of
victories and a lot of wins because of the things that they're doing as
people, and I'm proud of 'em.  
And, like I said, it's been a real privilege to coach this team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Peck or the players.  
  
Q. You drew a technical late in the first half. Did you say something? Can
you tell us what you said, I guess?  
COACH PECK: No, my mom's here.  
You know, I had some confusion of how things were being called. I was trying
to get some clarification.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Vanderbilt's shooting. Not surprising they shoot that
well. How tough is it to defend somebody that shoots like that?  
COACH PECK: They are tremendous shooters and started out with their post
players shooting the ball with down screen from the guards, then went there to
Caroline Williams, then Marsh got hot. Vanderbilt is a very good team.  
Christina Wirth is five for five from the three-point line. Caroline Williams
is four of five. You know, that's been their MO. Vanderbilt's always been a
team that has had high field goal percentage.  
  
Q. Your career is not over obviously, you're very young, I'm sure you have
plans. If you don't mind, tell us if you know any gigs you might be pursuing,
something you'd like to do now. Also, if you could, in your mind for whatever
reason, why your team, unlike, say, Purdue back in the day, why you couldn't
take this team and compete for a national championship.  
COACH PECK: Well, I think it's two completely different situations. When I
took over at Purdue, the team that had been to the Final Four before. They
were perennially, you know, in it year after year. That's something that the
University of Florida hadn't been to yet.  
And so, you know, there were some things that we had to take care of all
across the board. And, like I said, I think now there's a core group that can
help springboard that to happen.  
You know, the thing about it is, these two women that are sitting here, the
ones that are in that locker room, are quality people, and they have just
demonstrated, as in yesterday, the kind of heart that you got to have to
compete.  
And so now there will be seven. Now you can add two. Got five good ones coming
in next year. So I think that it's now in a position to where it can grow. But
there are a lot of things that have to go into that. It's not just players.
You got to have other things to help get players. Kids nowadays want to play
in front of a crowd. They do. They want to be on television. So I think that
now's a great springboard for that to happen at Florida.  
As far as where I'm going, I'm going back to Gainesville with my team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2007

  

### [Tasha Humphrey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16883)

### [Andy Landers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13868)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Georgia, head coach Andy Landers and players
Angel Robinson and Tasha Humphrey.  
Coach, if you could start with an opening comment.  
COACH LANDERS: I thought our basketball team was very good today on both ends
of the floor. I was particularly impressed with their ability to focus on what
it was we wanted to do and how we wanted to accomplish that on the defensive
end and then just stay with it for 40 minutes.  
I thought that our kids were excellent there, and then they were excellent in
cleaning up the boards after they had played terrific defense.  
Offensively, you know, we had a couple of cool spots where we weren't as
efficient. But for the most part very efficient. I thought our guards were the
players of the game, you know, because in the first half, selfishness should
have kicked in at some point, but they just kept throwing the ball inside. I
mean, they went without shots.  
They went without a lot of shots. We got kids on the perimeter that usually
shoot the basketball. But, boy, they were just terrific on continuing to feed
the ball inside, feed the ball inside, feed it in.  
Then Angel and Tasha, terrific at finishing and scoring. I just thought our
guards were outstanding in making that kind of decision and that commitment to
our basketball team playing well. And certainly our forwards were outstanding
once they got the ball in their hands.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, getting the tournament here in the state of Georgia, fairly close
to home, a good crowd today, what kind of lift does that give your team, if
any? A lot of orange out there anyway. The advantages of being close to home
for the tournament for the first time in a while?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, I think the first advantage when you play close to home
is that you probably don't spend a day, waste a day really, traveling. Our
kids were in class yesterday. We didn't leave until they had finished classes
yesterday. So it's somewhat like a normal routine. We didn't waste a day. We
didn't tire ourselves out going somewhere else to play. That's first and
foremost.  
Then to have these fans here today and to suspect that we'll have more each
day as we move forward. I think 3:30 time is a tough time for people unless
they're rich or homeless, just a tough proposition. They got to work. That
will get better as we move forward. Certainly people today were a big support
for us.  
  
Q. Can you address the job you did against Elliott and Humphrey, given what
they did yesterday?  
COACH LANDERS: Not just what they did yesterday; they played very well against
us in Lexington. I think our kids were determined to not let that happen
again, to stop that. They just stepped up and played. We had a reasonably good
idea of what they were going to do and how they were going to go about doing
that from an execution standpoint. Our kids locked in on it, disrupted it,
stopped it, just stopped it.  
A great thing about it, you know, make no mistake about it, this game, any
game, they're down there on one end scoring, so they really feel like going
back to the other end and guarding people. You know, I mean, it would be
interesting somewhere down the road if we go out there and miss shots, see if
we go down on the other end and guard people like we did today.  
Today, just a good day. Everything's going well. But they certainly stepped up
and shut it down.  
  
Q. Only 20% from the field, new tournament record. How were you able to
limit the looks they got? You just covered them up not only on the inside but
from the outside they were not getting looks at the basket they got
yesterday.  
COACH LANDERS: Do you want me to explain what the strategy was? On the ball
screen, step up hard with the post players very, very close, jam 'em and go
under. Know that they're going to dishonor ball screens and drive it to the
baseline, which is what they did yesterday: Drive it to the baseline, drive it
to the basket and score. We're not going to let that happen. There's a way we
defend against that.  
They got a high-low game. We're going to push 'em up, push 'em out, deny the
four man out a little bit farther than she wants to be, extend the pass.
Getting all this? You're not writing anything down now. You wanted to know
this (laughter).  
You know, on stagger screens, beat the guards to the first screen. They were
running a lot of stagger screens. You can handle stagger screens. If you're
behind when you get the first screen, you're dead. A couple times they got
shots because we were behind.  
What else? The elbow-to-elbow screen with their two bigs where they screen for
each other and roll down the middle. The play we ran on them and scored, they
run that a lot. Switch hard, disrupt the ball handler, drop in.  
Anything else? I'm going to put that on a disc and I want you to buy it
(laughter).  
  
Q. Tasha, can you talk about the last game you played, went to overtime,
getting off to the quick start, not letting it go there again.  
TASHA HUMPHREY: I mean, the team they played in Lexington is not the same team
they played here tonight. I think since that point on, we knew Kentucky was a
great basketball team, well-coached by Coach DeMoss. We just came in with that
mentality that, you know, nobody's going to stop us but ourselves. We played
great on both ends of the floor. I think our guards did a great job of getting
us the ball and we did a great job finishing it.  
In the second half, we did a good job setting the guards up off screen, things
like that. They did a great job finishing. So I think it was a great team
effort on both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. When did you have an idea that Rebecca would be able to contribute today?
What did it mean to get some time on the bench for Tasha?  
COACH LANDERS: Yesterday afternoon on the way over here, I got basically the
blood report, the lab report, you know, that her whatever you call it, vital
signs, were all normal. She actually for the last week was released by the
doctor to do as much as she could tolerate.  
But I didn't want to go there. So she's done nothing until tonight. She was
probably the most surprised person in the building to have run out on the
floor three or four times and play whatever.  
How many minutes did she get, Tasha?  
TASHA HUMPHREY: Six.  
COACH LANDERS: Six minutes. She's wore out, which is what I feared. She just
asked me if she could go back to the hotel. So that's where she's headed.  
But it was nice to have a third big to match their two bigs. That was nice. We
got the medium size and big and the little big taken care of with Maria and
Megan, but that third big was handy today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Alexis Hornbuckle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16879)

### [Candace Parker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16368)

### [Pat Summitt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14068)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now, Tennessee head Coach Pat Summitt, along with
student-athletes Candace Parker and Alexis Hornbuckle.  
Coach, if you could make an opening comment.  
COACH SUMMITT: It's always good to get that first game out of the way with a
win. We knew that South Carolina would come at us, play very aggressive
basketball. I thought the first half, without question, Alexis Hornbuckle
really stepped up, made a lot of big plays for us, took on a leadership role
of our basketball team.  
In the second half, I thought we had much more balance. I thought Candace did
a better job, kept her defensive intensity, as well as all of our post people.  
Sidney got much more involved offensively in this game, particularly in the --
after the halftime.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Is it a good thing to look at the box score and see that Candace is your
third leading scorer today?  
COACH SUMMITT: That is a good thing because we know people are going to key on
Candace. She was taking obviously a lot of physical play. But I thought she
kept her composure. It's good to see other players step up and not stand
around and watch her play.  
I think Alexis has done a great job of being much more assertive on the
offensive end, much more efficient. Good to see Sidney, in particular, I guess
they'll all want to take a week off from practice, because that's what she
did. She looked okay today.  
But I think if we get a little bit more balance, people can't key on one
player, and obviously Candace has been a target all year for our opposing
defense.  
  
Q. Coach, you started that second half on a 16-5 run. Was there anything you
said or sort of adjustment you made that was allowing you to open up the game
in the second half, get that lead?  
COACH SUMMITT: Not really. I think we came out with five people playing on the
defensive end. I thought the first half we had three people playing, and two
not really putting the type of pressure in the passing lanes. I didn't think
our post defense was very strong in the first half, but we definitely stepped
that up in the second half. That matched the intensity of our perimeter
defense which generated a lot of easy scoring opportunities for us.  
It came from the players. As I told them, you can't be at Tennessee and pick
and choose when you want to play defense and rebound and expect to be very
good because everyone gives us their best shot. So I think we have to
understand who we are and how we have to play.  
  
Q. Coach, Cait and Shannon, I saw you talking to them frequently during
timeouts. Can you comment on your point guard play in this particular game.  
COACH SUMMITT: I thought we did a lot of good things. I thought we got
careless with the basketball. I thought we get in late seconds on the clock
too much. I just think game management from the point position is key.  
I expect that from Shannon and Cait. I don't want to have a put Alexis at that
position. I thought we could have done a much better job of managing the
clock. I thought we got a little careless with a couple of our decisions.  
But overall I think these two players complement each other. I've been pleased
with them. I think they've made a lot of progress. I like where we are with
our point guard play overall.  
  
Q. With so much success in this quarterfinal round historically, how do you
not let this team sort of taking these early round games for granted, overlook
some of these early-round opponents?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think it's all about leadership, it's all about what they
want. I've learned that in my career many years ago. Coaches always, always
want to go into every game, they want their team to play a certain game. It's
when they, the players themselves, decide this is important to us, this is
something that we want. If they want to be playing on Sunday, then I like our
chances. If they're not that inspired about it, I'd be concerned about our
chances.  
I think this team has had the kind of leadership that allows a team then to
step up and play and maintain that kind of intensity and focus. It's been a
great team to work with because they have taken the ownership, with only a
one-game exception. We learned from that.  
  
Q. Candace, you had four shots tonight. Were you deferring intentionally, or
shot opportunities not there? Were you looking to get Sid and Lex the ball
more often?  
CANDACE PARKER: No. I think we did a great job moving the ball. Like I said
all year, pick your poison. I think we moved the ball well. We went into our
motion offense. A lot of people were getting a lot of different open looks.  
  
Q. In reference to the physical play, there was a brief skirmish. You came
back with a block shot basket. What happened in that exchange? Were you
motivated by that?  
CANDACE PARKER: I think it's just playing basketball. That's something we've
dealt with all year, is teams are very physical against us. But, I mean, we've
been in the weight room all summer and we're willing to take it and can handle
it.  
I think, you know, that motivates us to play strong with the ball, play smart.
I think we were motivated coming into the second half. I don't think it was
just that play that got us motivated.  
  
Q. Alexis, could you talk about your offensive effort in the first half.
Were you conscientiously (sic) looking for your shot more, or were the
opportunities there and you took advantage of them?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: I just saw open opportunities, whether it was pull-up jump
shots or getting to the hole. I just took advantage of them and tried to play
on balance. It came easy to me tonight. I guess coach is right, the more I
play on balance, the more efficient I am.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2007

  

### [Alliesha Easley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16892)

### [Armintie Price](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15511)

### [Carol Ross](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13859)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Now joined bay Ole Miss head coach Carol Ross.  
Coach, open up with a comment.  
COACH ROSS: Well, obviously it wasn't our best effort in terms of how we
played. You know, I wouldn't trade how we played that last 20 minutes for
anything because it really -- that's really the team we are.  
How they competed, how they fought, just kept finding ways. That's been the
trademark of this team really all year long. That's why we've been able to do
things that people say we couldn't do, it's because of their tenacity, their
scrap, their passion.  
You know, I love being their coach when they play that way. It's really a
treat. I think certainly the fans were able to see how hard these kids played.  
LSU, you have to give them a lot of credit. Defensively they were very good.
It was very difficult for us to get any good looks. Certainly the ones we got,
we didn't hit enough of 'em. It was just a good hard-fought game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. The way you play defense, the way they play defense, you had to figure --
did you figure going into this game it wasn't going to be in the 70s like the
game in Oxford? Did you anticipate a tough defensive game like this?  
COACH ROSS: We always think big. We don't go in low balling anything. At the
same time, you know, so much of our offense comes off our defense.  
We had a bad streak in that first half where all of LSU's point were coming
off the foul line, in transition where we had some breakdowns. But we really
felt good defensively. When we got in five-on-five situations we were guarding
very well.  
We didn't turn them over enough. We needed to create turnovers to create
offense for us. We knew that would be difficult. It was difficult the first
time we played them. I think we forced maybe 20 turnovers the first time. I
think we only got 13 or so this time. It wasn't quite enough to help generate
enough points for us.  
  
Q. Alliesha and Armintie, talk about after playing yesterday, late in the
first half, you looked like you were maybe getting a lot tired. Second half
looked more energetic. Talk about being able to turn it on there.  
ARMINTIE PRICE: I think we just started to get it together. I don't think we
was too much tired. You're never too tired to win a championship. We just
started off kind of slow in the first half. In the second half we knew we had
to pick it up to compete better and play harder.  
ALLIESHA EASLEY: Basically it's the same thing. I mean, you got to go out
there and fight. We just had to go out there and do what we came here to do.  
  
Q. Armintie, could you talk about what the focus for your team is going to
be at this point moving forward?  
ARMINTIE PRICE: Well, hopefully get a bid to the NCAA tournament, take one
game at a time.  
  
Q. Armintie, what was LSU doing defensively that was tough?  
ARMINTIE PRICE: Playing good defense. They all played team defense. Sagging
off a little bit on us, making us take outside shots, kind of just having
active hands.  
But in the second half we kind of took it to 'em and tried to become the
aggressor.  
  
Q. Armintie, on that last possession, last offensive possession that you had
there, did you get to look at the basket you were looking for?  
ARMINTIE PRICE: I did. I got a pretty good look at the jump shot. I just
didn't knock it down.  
  
Q. Coach, surely you'll be in the tournament. You don't have to worry about
that. What kind of seeding do you think this team deserves? What kind of
trouble do you think you can give to a team you might play in the
tournament?  
COACH ROSS: Seeding, based on my experiences, I'm sure we're not going to get
a fair seed in terms of what we're capable of versus maybe our record. The
upside of this team is pretty good. We've shown that by beating LSU,
Vanderbilt earlier. But at the same time, you know, we've lost some games that
are regretful, for sure.  
You know, I would like to think somewhere around, you know, 5 or 6. But I'm
sure they're going to send me a letter saying it's probably 7, 8 or 9. But it
doesn't matter, we'll play. Can't control those people. I've tried for years.
Doesn't work.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 2, 2007

  

### [Mickie DeMoss](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13867)

### [Carly Ormerod](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16884)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Now joined by Kentucky head coach Mickie DeMoss, Carly Ormerod
and Jennifer Humphrey.  
Coach, if you could make a comment.  
COACH DeMOSS: I tell you, I thought Georgia played extremely well tonight, got
the ball inside. Inside game was very tough to start the game. Defensively,
you know, they shut down a lot of our scorers. We didn't have our big scorers
step up for us. Couldn't get a good luck on the inside with Elliott. Mahoney
couldn't get going. I thought their defense, you know, took a lot of things
away from us.  
We just, the first half, shot the ball miserably. Our defense was solid until
about the last five minutes of the first half, then broke down a little bit.  
But they played extremely well. You know, we just didn't have a good night.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach DeMoss or the players.  
  
Q. What do you think this means for your post-season chances? Will you take
an NIT bid if it's offered?  
COACH DeMOSS: Right now we still have our fingers crossed for the NCAA. I
think, you know, historically the NCAA's taken at least six teams from the
SEC. If they take six teams, I would think we would have to be the sixth team
they would take.  
Still have our fingers crossed for that. We'll just cross that bridge when we
come to it if we don't get in.  
  
Q. What were they doing to kind of keep the ball out of Jennifer's hands and
Elliott's hands specifically in the first half?  
COACH DeMOSS: Just I thought they were bodying us pretty good on the inside.
We were able to get it in there; just couldn't finish. They were helping in,
pinching in some from the corners, helping with the guards. Our guards
couldn't knock shots down when they were open.  
They just did a really good job of shutting down our inside game, being very
physical with us, not letting us get good looks at the basket, not letting us
get to the block.  
  
Q. Carly, can you talk about that first few minutes of the game? You were
0-14 to start. Did that get in your head at some point?  
CARLY ORMEROD: I wouldn't say so, you know. We had a couple games where we
started off a little sluggish. But we've always bounced back and been right in
the game.  
I think it's hard, though, when you shoot 16% for an entire half. It was
frustrating out there because no one could get their shots, none of them were
falling. It was a frustrating game offensively.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 2, 2007

  

### [Pokey Chatman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13865)

### [Rashonta LeBlanc](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16891)

### [Erica White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16371)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from LSU, head coach Pokey Chatman, Rashonta LeBlanc
and Erica White.  
Coach, if you could start with an opening comment and we'll take questions.  
COACH CHATMAN: I'll start with obviously what won this basketball game for us.
It's our defensive prowess, and that's why these two young ladies are sitting
up here next to me. Oftentimes that goes unnoticed when you have a game of
runs and one team is up 18 and it's a 16-2 run.  
I thought Rashonta LeBlanc did an excellent job limiting Armintie Price to one
offensive board, and Erica White on her contested shots with Awkward.  
When you're able to get that type of pressure on the perimeter, it helps your
team defense pick up. That's the reason why we were able to be successful
tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. You seemed to have some trouble getting it into Sylvia at times. What was
the problem?  
COACH CHATMAN: Several problems. Problems in the first half, nine turnovers.
Sylvia is 6'6" with a vertical. That's increased this past year by three more
inches. We were keeping her on the level with everyone else.  
Entry pass to Sylvia has to come off some ball reversal, moving the defense.
We were just a little bit anxious there. They turned us over. We played a
little bit hurried. I credit the defense. We knew what they were going to do
and we finally settled in and got a little bit of rhythm offensively.  
  
Q. Talk about what you all did defensively, maybe the main game plan coming
in.  
COACH CHATMAN: There's always scouting report defense in terms of how you want
to handle screens, how you want to guard certain people, if they're coming off
of screens. We decided to shortcut some screens as it related to Price, meet
her off at the pass. I thought Rashonta did a good job. That's only about 25%
of it with Armintie.  
She's been known to go get the balls that she's not able to score and
teammates. You can't be excited with just contesting the shot. But it started
there on Price in terms of us limiting her options.  
  
Q. I guess you didn't get what you wanted, you were having trouble trying to
get something from the forward position. You had Porsha in there, and then you
put Ashley when you could. But then Mesha, she didn't have great numbers, but
she did give you some clutch moments in the game. Talk about what you got from
that position, her play?  
COACH CHATMAN: You're right. I thought the last three minutes of the first
half is where Mesha did an excellent job for us. She was able to move a little
bit better laterally and help some of the perimeter players on that ball
screen, help when they would run the down screen and the slide-across option
for Price. She was there. She is has a little bit more mobility and some
height.  
We didn't get to this, but we thought she could help us a little bit in the
middle offense because she had a height advantage. But those last three
minutes of the first half were huge with Mesha in there rebounding.  
  
Q. Both players, could you talk about the spells that you had in this game
where you went scoreless: Five minutes at the beginning and the six minutes
where Ole Miss got back into the game? What's happening there? What can you do
to correct that?  
ERICA WHITE: I felt like we kind of let up defensively. We didn't continue to
put a lot of pressure on Ole Miss. They got a lot of free-throws, open looks.
I credit Ole Miss for knocking the shots down. I feel like it was our defense.
Offensively we just didn't attack. We didn't continue to a attack. Didn't try
to get in ball in the paint, whether it be off penetration or post feed.  
We kind of did it to ourselves, but luckily we were able to battle back and
get out of it.  
RASHONTA LEBLANC: I feel the same way. We let up a little bit on defense. We
waited too long to attack on the offensive end. The pressure was on us. We put
the pressure on ourselves. That had a little to do with it.  
  
Q. Why are you so glum?  
COACH CHATMAN: Focus.  
  
Q. What is the deal with Sylvia's shoulder?  
COACH CHATMAN: She just wanted a rubdown from the trainer, that's all. She's
fine. Just fell on it. She has one bionic shoulder from surgery. She's doing
fine.  
  
Q. You took great offense at the call with 7:50 left in the second half on
Sylvia. Were you thinking afterwards, I might get a technical foul here? Were
you like, I got to say something? You wanted too make your point?  
COACH CHATMAN: I swear it didn't feel like you're describing it. That's why I
have this puzzled look on my face. I have to show some poise, like I expect my
point guard to be poised at the point.  
Every now and again it just grates at me with Sylvia. She's 6'6". She's
difficult to handle. I guess I just needed to fight for her.  
  
Q. Erica obviously had a huge night offensively. How important was that for
her to break out not just in this game but the last few games?  
COACH CHATMAN: It's huge. There's been a couple times when E was the only one
scoring and we weren't as successful. But the free-throws at the end of the
game. I don't care what the total is -- I do care what the total is -- but
those free-throws were huge. She stepped up there. She wanted to take them.  
It gives you so many options because it came as a three, it comes with
penetration, comes off of her steal. The one at the end where she got the
layup. It's awesome when you can get double-digits out of your point guard.
But also the defensive pressure she can apply to their point guard is what
helps us the most.  
  
Q. Can you look ahead to Tennessee and what are the keys to that game? You
played them 10 days ago. There's a lot of familiarity there already.  
COACH CHATMAN: Yeah, you know, you go back -- I can easily tell you what the
key is going to be. We gave up 20 offensive boards last time. If you're going
to defend at the clip that we've been defending, pick up your paycheck at the
end of the week and get the rebound. You put in so much work.  
That's a good thing. You hold a team to 20 points below their average, you're
supposed to win. But we didn't. That's because there's no defense with second-
chance points. I think that's the first place to start.  
Then we can't allow them to turn us over. A turnover with Tennessee is a
layup. We'll be ready.  
  
Q. The game tomorrow, you play it more for winning the championship of this
league? Your seeding for the NCAA tournament? All of the above?  
COACH CHATMAN: Everything. It's that time of year, it's a great opponent that
can test you in ways that will tell you the most about your team going into
the third season, which is NCAA tournament.  
We've always had battles with Tennessee. There won't be any secrets. The scout
is out on us and on them. It's a matter of who can bump it down for 40 minutes
and dig their heels in and get it done.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2007

  

### [Melanie Balcomb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13863)

### [Caroline Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16900)

### [Christina Wirth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16901)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Vanderbilt, Coach Melanie Balcomb, players
Christina Wirth and Caroline Williams.  
COACH BALCOMB: I think when you score a lot of points people are impressed. I
think one of the things we were disappointed with tonight was our defense,
cutting off the drive and checking out. Two of the things we better bring
tomorrow.  
But overall, I liked our effort and I liked our unselfishness. Obviously, I
like when we shoot the ball that well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach or the players.  
  
Q. That's not the first time you've shot 70%. That's kind of becoming more
routine than the unusual. Talk about that.  
COACH BALCOMB: Well, you know, when we take good shots, we do a lot of
shooting, we're confident. I think tonight we're just excited to play and
we're confident. I think we know our offenses really well. When we execute
them, we know the ball's going in.  
These two people sitting next to me obviously shot it very, very well from
three. Our three-point percentage was as good as it's ever been. I think that
was the most impressive part: We shot better from three than we did from the
field.  
  
Q. Can both players talk about getting your confidence back after the last
regular-season game, shooting it well and confidently.  
THE MODERATOR: Christina.  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: After the Tennessee game, we were disappointed. Obviously we
went in there confident we would win and we didn't. We're the kind of team,
though, that I never doubt we're going to come back. We know that everyone's
going to come to practice ready to play, come to this tournament ready to
play. So that wasn't really a problem.  
I knew we were going to get it back. Like coach said, we do do a lot of
shooting. We're shooters. That's what we do. We're just going to do what we
do.  
CAROLINE WILLIAMS: I agree with Tina. I think the way we practice, the way we
focus a lot on offense and practice, it makes us confident in the game. When
we hit a couple of shots, I think it gets contagious with all of us. I think
you see it.  
It happened tonight. We hit a couple of threes. Tina hit some threes. Everyone
starts feeling it. I think we're confident. We attribute that to practicing
hard and shooting a lot in practice.  
  
Q. Coach, what are some of your concerns about Georgia?  
COACH BALCOMB: Obviously their high-low game is very good. I think that's
going to be a huge key. Tasha Humphrey is playing really well, but so is
everybody else. I think they're executing as well as everybody I've seen.
They're running a lot of stuff and executing it well on offense. I think we're
going to have to do a much better job defensively and take them out of what
they want to do. We're going to have to dictate more on defense.  
I think Ashley Houts is playing really well for them, too, in setting up the
offense, running the offense with confidence as a freshman. But, you know,
they've got so many kids to go to and Andy subbing a lot. You got to be ready
to play and know the personnel, knowing who does what and taking their
strength away.  
  
Q. How important was it to get off to a good start, considering you know
they were going to be emotional with Coach Peck's situation? Caroline, can you
address that?  
CAROLINE WILLIAMS: I think one of the main things that we've been doing a
really good job this last part of the season is we set a goal before we start
the game. We try to jump out on teams and make 'em call a timeout before the
first four minutes. I think we all knew they would be emotional. It's her last
game. A couple of seniors. All of them want to play hard for her.  
But I think that was our most important thing, was we jump out quick. We want
to get a 10-0 lead if we can, make them call a timeout. If you do that, it
immediately can take some confidence away. I think we did a good job of that
tonight.  
  
Q. Tina, obviously the seniors get a lot of the pub on this team. Your form
showed how deep this roster is. Talk about opponents can't key on one, two or
even three people in your roster, players like you, the depth in this club.  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: I know I've said this before, but our three seniors are just
great players and they're great leaders. Other teams know they're our go-to's.
The rest of us, I'm not saying the rest of us aren't good players, because we
are, that's what is so great about our team.  
But it helps with other teams have to worry about Carla inside, and Dee just
running everything, Caroline lighting it up. That gives you opportunities.  
Tonight, you know, a lot of people stepped up. We are a deep team, and that's
going to really help us down the road. I think right now our freshmen are
playing really, really well. It's a team effort every game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 1, 2007

  

### [Stephany Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13862)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now from Alabama, head coach Stephany Smith, Dedrea
McGhee and Kate Mastin.  
Coach, if you could make an opening comment.  
COACH SMITH: Obviously it's been a very difficult season for the University of
Alabama. The thing that has plagued us all SEC play was definitely another
Achilles' heel tonight with the 42 turnovers that we had. We had talked a lot
about it.  
Ole Miss really had their way with us in Oxford when we played them during the
regular season and forced a lot of turnovers. We really looked at that on
film, addressed it, and saw some easy opportunities to get the ball into the
high post and for weak-side layups, which we did sporadically. And more so in
probably the last five minutes of of the game than any other time.  
Have to give Ole Miss a lot of credit for their athleticism, their defensive
ability. Just very bothersome. It created opportunities for them in
transition, which is another thing. I think they had 22 points in transition
plus free-throws in the first half alone.

### [Imesia Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16878)

### [Marneshia Richard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16877)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Mississippi State, head coach Sharon Fanning,
Imesia Jackson and Marneshia Richard.  
Coach, make an opening comment, we'll open it up for questions.  
COACH FANNING: Felt like in the second half we ended up getting a lead and got
ourselves in a position to win a ballgame. I think you have to give credit to
Florida because they kept taking it at us.  
Big thing we said at halftime was rebounding. For the game, they had 13
offensive boards and they just kicked us there. Felt like it to me. We turned
the ball over, made mistakes mentally, did some things independently with each
other, trying to work hard at times, but just didn't see each other at the
time that we needed to.  
Very, very, very disappointed in terms of our effort. Very disappointed in
terms of our focus. You know, Florida took it at us at their place. We had to
work hard down the stretch to win a ballgame.  
They're a very athletic team. Right now they're playing very hard. We knew of
their success, you know, two of the last three ballgames. You know, you have
to play focused. We didn't play to the level that you have to play in an SEC
tournament to win a ballgame.  
Florida deserved to beat with us their work ethic. You can't make the mistakes
that we made and not rebound the basketball, let them isolate you. We have to
play better team defense.  
Just didn't step up. Have to give credit to Florida for keeping the pressure
on us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Was it your game plan to have Marneshia score the last 11 points of the
game or just the opportunity arose?  
COACH FANNING: We want to try for an entire ballgame to look at opportunity.
When someone has an open shot, you know, if it's a good shot, then you want to
take it. When we're down a little bit, then she had to come down. We want the
first open look. Depends on whether it's a two-possession game or one-
possession game.  
Just so happens she's coming down the floor with a basketball, she's going to
make a lot of decisions with it. A majority of the time, they've been very
good ones.  
  
Q. Marneshia and Imesia, can you talk about the defense of Florida,
especially when they went on that run in the second half.  
MARNESHIA RICHARD: Talking about our defense or theirs?  
  
Q. What Florida did defensively.  
MARNESHIA RICHARD: Well, they were changing up defenses, sometimes man,
sometimes zone. Just have to recognize and try to run an offense that worked.  
So I guess switching up defenses kind of got us a little confused, so we had
to regroup and try to find a way to score.  
IMESIA JACKSON: Yeah, well, I think the defense -- the defense they played was
their type of defense. With us being a team, we were supposed to come together
and figure it out, I mean, just play out of whatever defense they threw at us.
Basically all I know is we didn't come out and perform.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about did you see this as a must-win game? How
do you feel about NCAA tournament chances?  
COACH FANNING: I think a lot of things with the NCAA tournament comes down to
upsets in conferences, you know, when one team's going to go and then if
there's upsets. I hope there's still a lot of the SEC teams, probably five of
us going into this that were on a bubble.  
I hope that we still have a shot at it. I think we'll just have to leave that
up to them. You know, playing into the league, being 7-7, Florida is playing
with a lot of emotion right now.  
We'll just have to see. I hope that there's an opportunity, but it's not going
to be in my hands.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Lauren Ervin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16852)

### [Susie Gardner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13858)

### [Brittney Vaughn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16853)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now from Arkansas, head coach Susie Gardner and
Brittany Vaughan and Lauren Ervin. Coach, make an opening comment.  
COACH GARDNER: I was pleased with the way that our team started the game. We
tweaked some things for Kentucky. We had a different little game plan. It was
really working well. Felt great about our defense, trapping all ball screens
and disrupting them.  
We let their Pfeiffer get open for a couple of threes and kind of turned the
game. But, you know, we battled back. We didn't quit fighting. We just didn't
have enough offensively to win this game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Lauren, could you talk about the second half, the high-low game they got
going, why that was so hard to defend.  
LAUREN ERVIN: It was pretty hard to defend. We didn't know if we were going to
switch it or not. If we did switch, when the post was dribbling the ball over,
we switched. Elliott was right in front of us and just sealed us perfectly.
It's pretty hard to get around her when she's working.  
Even vice versa, if Elliott brings it, Humphrey was posting up in front of us.  
COACH GARDNER: It was an on-ball string post to post. What we do is we switch
posts. What they were doing is, Lauren would then be on the ball, and then
they were posting up Sarah or Danielle. 6'6" on about 6'. That's when we
decided we would go zone 'cause they just kept pounding it, pounding it. We
felt we needed to change.  
My hesitation going to zone was thinking back to last game when they shot it
so well. We did a great job of adjusting in practice. We talked about, Okay,
where the shooters were. I thought we did an excellent job in the second half
with our zone this time.  
  
Q. Brittney, did it ever become frustrating out there? They were so tall
inside. Seemed like you were fighting a losing battle because of that.  
BRITTNEY VAUGHN: Well, just having Pfeifer and Danielle, even though they're
not the biggest post, they do play big and they have big hearts. We knew we
were going in at a disadvantage at height. We still knew we could get the job
done. Even though they did have a height advantage, we still have some good
runs on 'em at the same time.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2007

  

### [Mickie DeMoss](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13867)

### [Sarah Elliott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16854)

### [Jennifer Humphrey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16855)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Kentucky, head coach Mickie DeMoss, Jennifer
Humphrey and Sarah Elliott.  
Coach, if you'd make an opening comment.  
COACH DeMOSS: Very pleased with the way we played tonight. You know, we came
out. I thought Arkansas came out strong in the first half, first 10 minutes of
the first half. We answered their run. We settled down, were able to get the
ball inside. We had some guards come in off the bench and knock some shots
down for us. Went in halftime with a lead.  
We came out, I thought the second half we were able to get the ball, our high-
low game going in the second half. Played some good defense, forced them into
38% shooting for the night.  
I was just very pleased with the win. Rebounded the ball extremely well. I
thought Jennifer Humphrey probably had the game of her career. She picked a
good time to have it. We're just going to have to have another one tomorrow
(laughter). We're excited about the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Sarah, what did you hurt and when did you hurt it?  
SARAH ELLIOTT: I banged my knee really hard on the floor, first few minutes of
the game, going after a ball.  
I'm going to be fine. I'm going to be playing tomorrow's game. It's a little
painful right now. But the plan is to keep it moving, don't let it get stiff,
keep icing it. You know, listen to my trainer, hear what she has to say about
it (laughter).  
  
Q. Jennifer, did you know where you were statistically? Did you have any
designs going for a triple-double?  
JENNIFER HUMPHREY: I didn't know till probably the last two minutes of the
game. But I just wanted to really go out there and do what I had to do to help
my team win. It would have been great to get a triple-double, but we still
won, so I'm fine with that.  
  
Q. Wondering what you had for breakfast, what got into you (laughter)?  
JENNIFER HUMPHREY: I didn't eat breakfast today. I had a good pregame meal.
Got some rest. I was ready to go today.  
It could have been our last game if we lost. We're trying to prove we're an
NCAA-caliber team. We wanted to go out there and prove it to everyone. We know
we are, we just needed to prove it. We had some close games. I just think
tonight we came out there and we did what we needed to do to show other people
we are an NCAA-caliber team.  
  
Q. You were 1 for 9 to start the game, missing layups. Was that a concern to
get them settled early?  
COACH DeMOSS: Yeah, I think it was nerves early. When you're getting those
kind of looks early, certainly you'd like for them to go down. As long as we
could get those looks, I knew eventually we were going to knock those down. If
we could keep getting them throughout the game, I thought we would be okay
once we settled down a little bit.  
  
Q. Coach, talk a little bit about how important it is for your team to take
it one game at a time, knowing that you obviously would like to get an NCAA
berth if there was any way? Talk about taking it one game at a time.  
COACH DeMOSS: That's something that, you know, we're playing for. I think you
have to play with a purpose. I think right now we know that we're still alive
in the race. We're playing with a purpose. That's something that we preach all
year, is we take it one game at a time, one possession at a time. That's the
only way you can do it.  
So far my team has been very focused with that philosophy. We're certainly not
going to change that now. It's one game at a time, one possession at a time.  
  
Q. Jennifer, if that worked so well for you today, are you going to think
about skipping breakfast tomorrow, too (laughter)?  
JENNIFER HUMPHREY: Maybe, I don't know.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
SARAH ELLIOTT: Makes my job a lot easier. A lot of worries off my chest.
Really, you know, when Lanky gets going like that, you can just feel the
energy go through the team. Even if you're on the bench, I mean, you could
just sit there and everybody is on the bench, Yeah, Lanky, good job. We're
screaming at her, all encouragement. When Lanky gets going, it's complete
energy whether it's essential or not.  
It's just a very big pick-me-up when everybody needs it. It's what we need
with every game.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2007

  

### [Sha Brooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16874)

### [Marshae Dotson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16875)

### [Carolyn Peck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13864)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Florida, head coach Carolyn Peck, Marshae
Dotson and Sha Brooks.  
Coach, if you could open with a comment.  
COACH PECK: I would say that right now I've got to be the happiest coach in
America. I have a group of nine young women that are going to leave it on the
floor. (Tearing up) I'm going to make it through this. They're battling so
hard and they're playing and showing a whole lot of heart.  
I just appreciate the effort they have put in, what they've put in. We had two
very good days of practice. Both practices lasted about 45 minutes because
their focus was where it needed to be. My motto is: Why beat a dead horse?
They were doing it right. They were working hard. 45 minutes, it's over. We
shot our free-throws, we're out of there. And it carried over.  
Our game plan, their focus, all nine players came in and did what we needed
them to do. None of us want this to be over, and they showed that tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Peck or the players.  
  
Q. Marshae and Sha, can you talk about the emotion of the last few games,
what's maybe clicked for you the last couple games?  
SHA BROOKS: Like I said, every game we're not taking lightly. We go out there,
we play our hardest. Coach tells us to penetrate, try to get to the basket. We
work in practice on free-throws because we penetrate in the game a lot, we
have to hit our free-throws.  
All nine players, like coach said, we're giving 110% because we don't want
this to be over. That's our emotion, we're not ready for this to be over.  
MARSHAE DOTSON: I'm just glad we played it out, you know, the whole 40
minutes. That was the big deal this whole season, us coming in, playing hard
in the second half and pretty much not the first. Kind of carried it on
throughout the year and just put it all together. And, of course, we don't
want it to be over.  
  
Q. Why do you feel like the results are coming now that weren't coming a few
weeks ago?  
COACH PECK: Well, you know, I just felt like it was a matter of time for it
all to click together. We've had so many different things to happen this
season. Now we have the continuity. Everybody in that locker room is on the
same mission. They are very unselfish. They're very passionate. There's a lot
of love. That's why I think, you know, now it's clicking and paying attention.  
I think also we've experienced some success now, and I think that that
experience has been a great teacher for us, showing us what works, what's good
for us, what our strengths are.  
  
Q. Marshae and then Sha, at a time when no one would blame you for worrying
about your future, what helped you stay focused on the present?  
MARSHAE DOTSON: I don't know. I mean, I love the game. You know, a lot of
people who are in my ear, Just keep playing hard and you can get to the next
level, whatnot. I'm right here right now. I'm thinking about now pretty much
not later.  
SHA BROOKS: I don't really focus too much on the future because I just take it
a day at a time. I guess our whole team just take it done day at a time. This
is how I take my days.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the defense, especially when y'all had that
stretch in the second half where you were able to hold State scoreless for a
while?  
COACH PECK: In everything that we did, whether it be man-to-man or zone, we
had to play with a team concept because Mississippi State will post your
guards up. We got to have help there. Then you have Jackson, who can post up
big inside. On the three-point shot, we mixed up between our man and our zone.  
I think a big part, a big key to that had a lot to do with rebounding. I think
Marshae played a big part in that. I think Sharielle Smith did, too. I just
looked at the stat sheet. She ends up with 11 rebounds for the game coming off
the bench. That's a lot of work. I think that also happens when, you know, you
have your guards like Kim Dye and Jennifer Mossor boxing out, too.  
I think the intensity of all nine players, because they all played, the
intensity that they brought I think definitely helped us.  
  
Q. Coach, what are some of your concerns about Vanderbilt?  
COACH PECK: You know, I think my first concern is getting my team home and in
bed tonight. I think that's our biggest concern. We know that they have great
size, they've got great scorers. Dee Davis I think is one of the top point
guards really in the country. Then you got Caroline Williams who can shoot it.
You got Carla Thomas who plays big inside, then Liz Sherwood, woman of the
year, came in. So the size factor I think, you know, is a concern.  
The turnaround time for us to get ready I think is our biggest concern. It's
why we want to go home and get to bed tonight and start letting the team
prepare for Vanderbilt tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Stacy Booker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16845)

### [Lauren Simms](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16846)

### [Susan Walvius](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15514)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now, Susan Walvius, South Carolina head coach, and
also Stacy Booker and Lauren Simms.  
Coach, open with a comment.  
COACH WALVIUS: This was an important game for us for a lot of reasons. Biggest
one being that of the bubble teams that are out there in the Southeastern
Conference this year, we are the second highest RPI behind Auburn. We knew we
would have to come in, beating Auburn twice, a 30 RPI, late in the schedule,
should show the committee how strong we are.  
We stepped out, played Stanford at Stanford, played Oklahoma at home. This
team is battle tested. Played the best teams in college basketball. We do that
in the Southeastern Conference. The conference as a whole, you will hear this
from all the coaches, is a much better league top to bottom. The RPI is No. 1.
We knew it was an important game.  
We're looking to play our way into the NCAA tournament. I thought we had some
senior players especially step up and make some big plays today. Stacy Booker
and Lauren Simms have come through in every big game that we've had that's
been an SEC win. They both made big plays today at the end of the game.  
I thought we rebounded the ball pretty well as a basketball team. We didn't
take care of it as much as we would have liked to in the first half, but we
thought we corrected that the second half.  
Just real proud of our team, excited to be advancing.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the defense on Auburn's last possession.  
COACH WALVIUS: We're bigger than a lot of times. We're a very good defensive
team. We have been for years. This group understands rotations, they
understand how to guard. We were actually a little frustrated because we'd
given up some looks earlier. We were late on our help rotation.  
Late in this game we did a great job with our back side of the defense. We did
a better job fronting the low post. We saw real resolve and commitment to get
that job done. We knew where the ball was going. I thought our team did a good
job defending.  
  
Q. Stacy, what was it like for you, playing in your backyard here?  
STACY BOOKER: It's good to be at home. Most of my family could come, my family
and friends who haven't seen me play my four years at South Carolina. It's a
nice feeling to be at home.  
  
Q. Coach, can you look ahead to Tennessee tomorrow, the match-up issues
there.  
COACH WALVIUS: Everybody's got match-up issues with Tennessee. Every program
does. They just are a great basketball team. They are big. They're athletic.
Their defense is awesome. They're a great rebounding team. They've got a lot
offensively. They're shooting the ball extremely well. They're hard to guard
because they can stretch your defense out.  
They're a tough match-up for any team. When you go undefeated in the
Southeastern Conference, it certainly shows your strength as a basketball
team. They have played the toughest schedule in the country. We've got to go
out and just fight. We've got to work.  
As I said, our players have done a great job making plays recently. It will
come down to that. I'm confident we're going to come out and work hard.  
  
Q. Stacy, your coach mentioned how important it was to beat Auburn, such a
high RPI. You certainly had a big part in both those games, especially at the
end. What is the key there with you and Auburn?  
STACY BOOKER: Uhm, I don't know. Like I said earlier, I just didn't want to
give up. I want to do anything for my team: Hustling, rebounding, shooting
threes. I was going to do anything to get my team back in this game.  
  
Q. Stacy, right before you came in here, we could hear you in the hallway
saying, Never give up. Can you talk about that mentality, how much you'll need
that tomorrow facing the top seed in the tournament?  
STACY BOOKER: I think in the beginning of the season -- well, as far as now,
we're a stronger team. If we're down, we're able to step up, play better
defense, rebound, to get our team back in the game and actually overcome and
win the game.  
I just didn't want my team to give up. I was going to jam it in their heads
the whole time. I don't care how many times I was going to say it, I was just
going to keep saying it. I guess it stuck with us. We came out with a win.  
  
Q. Coach, how much would you say the success that you had in the second half
was due to the senior leadership that you have? So many seniors that play a
lot of minutes.  
COACH WALVIUS: There's no question about it. The two guards sitting here did a
fantastic job. Our senior class did a great job. Some of our younger players
did, as well. 'Kesha Tolliver brings so much emotion. She has a physical style
of play. She's a junior player. Demetress Adams is a sophomore, brings so much
defensively, hard to shoot over her.  
Our team, for being as diverse a group of people as they are, they are a
cohesive group.  
Stacy, one of the things we talked about early in our season this year,
looking for our leadership to step up, looking for people to be a catalyst to
this group. Certainly Lauren has done that in her quiet leadership way. Stacy
Booker has done that in her very emotional, positive way. Lakesha Tolliver is
providing that for us. It's somebody different every night. It's a big part of
it, certainly, the veteran leadership.  
  
Q. Lauren, can you talk about the three you hit in front of Bonner late in
the first half of the shot clock, the lift you gave the team?  
LAUREN SIMMS: The shot clock was running down. I knew I had to put it up or
try to draw the foul. Fortunately I was able to get it up over her long arms
and it went in for me, so...  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [DeWanna Bonner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16847)

### [Nell Fortner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13860)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Coach Nell Fortner and DeWanna Bonner. Make an
opening comment and then we'll take questions.  
COACH FORTNER: It was a disappointing loss for us. The 19 offensive rebounds
killed us. I thought we played well enough to win on the first defensive
possession when we defended them, but we gave up too many offensive words, too
many second chance opportunities that killed us. 19 turnovers. The six down
the stretch, turnovers down the stretch, you just can't win games that way.  
It was just unfortunate that it happened to us that way. Just a disappointing
loss.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach and players.  
  
Q. Would you talk about the final play. Y'all got the ball with 2.3 seconds
left.  
COACH FORTNER: It was hard to get anything with them up on us like that. They
were just up on us so tight, we couldn't get any space to get any kind of look
at the basket. They're switching screens. They just weren't going to give us
any breathing room at all.  
  
Q. 2.3 seconds left, talk about that play.  
COACH FORTNER: I mean, we got the ball in. We were trying to create a little
space so we launch it. They're switching screens. There was not going to be a
lot of space to get a shot off.  
Hey, I mean, shouldn't have gotten to that point to begin with. But anyway,
that's what it was.  
  
Q. DeWanna, can you talk about the lack of offense in the last four minutes
or so. Couldn't get anything going.  
DEWANNA BONNER: I think we kind of got lax with the lead. I don't think we
attacked the basket enough.  
I think we did a good job of finding Keke the last couple minutes. She hit
some big free-throws for us down the stretch. Then we just stopped being
aggressive.  
  
Q. How much did you talk to your team about the NCAA tournament
implications? What does that mean?  
COACH FORTNER: Well, we talked about it. We try not to hammer on it or
anything like that. They knew what the implications were. They knew what was
out there, the potential that was out there for us. You know, you try not to
harp on it too much because you don't want to play a game with a lot of
pressure on you.  
That's how we came out. We were playing hard. Our offense never really got
going today. We just never really got into a good flow. I thought it was tough
for us because South Carolina, really I didn't think their offense was getting
into a good flow either. They were just getting a second and third chance
opportunity. That was just hurting us.  
That hurts our confidence. It's hard to get things going. But then we made a
great run in the second half. You hope you can hold onto it. But playing under
pressure, we're still a young team, we haven't gone into the playoffs yet. We
haven't gone into the WNIT, the NCAAs. We're trying to get there. These kids
are trying hard to get there. But you got to win games to do that. It just
didn't happen for us today.  
I don't know what the committee will do. We'd love to play in the NCAA
tournament. We'll just have to wait and see what they do. Hopefully we'll be
going somewhere, one or the other.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Armintie Price](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15511)

### [Carol Ross](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13859)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now is Ole Miss head Coach Carol Ross and players
Armintie Price and Ashley Awkward.  
Coach, if you could make an opening statement.  
COACH ROSS: It's a great way to start a great tournament. Our defense, it was
interesting. It was very effective with our deflections, our speed and
quickness really came into play. Those deflections led to a tournament record
steal, 25 steals. We forced 42 turnovers, which is also I think a tournament
high.  
The defense was very disruptive to Alabama's offense, really allowed us to
play to our strengths. When we're playing defense, our whole team gets
involved as a team effort. Certainly it allowed us to also take easy shots.  
We're happy to be advancing. Obviously we got a tough opponent in LSU waiting
on us. But it sure beats the alternative.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Ashley and Armintie, can you talk about putting Sunday behind you and
coming out strong tonight?  
ARMINITIE PRICE: We're just trying to get a fresh start. Sunday isn't
something we can control. It's in the past. We know coming into this
tournament, we have to start off positive, take it one game at a time, and
that's what we tried to do tonight.  
ASHLEY AWKWARD: I don't want to say that I'm happy that we did lose on our
senior night, but I'm glad that we got a chance to get ahead, get a feel of
the gym, get a feel of the balls and the court. I feel like we're at a little
of an advantage.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the advantage of not having the bye, getting
bench players in, people with more experience?  
COACH ROSS: We were thrilled we blew that by, could get in here early and get
that extra game.  
You know, when things happen, you always have to look for the silver lining.
You got to look for the positives. You know, I love this tournament. I love
being here, really and truly. I told the team this. I said, It's almost like
we get rewarded because we get to play longer, we get to be here first.
There's just so much good in being here. Certainly, you know, we want to stay
here a long time. But we understand to do that you got to be successful, you
got to win.  
You know, you're probably thinking we blew the game on purpose, but we didn't.
We did want to beat Auburn. We did want to be successful. But there are always
positives you can find. Certainly, you know, we found one. So we're working
it.  
  
Q. Are those your sisters up there that dressed up?  
COACH ROSS: I don't know those people (laughter). They could look like me and
have the same last name, but I really don't know them (laughter).  
  
Q. Do they do it every year?  
COACH ROSS: Yes, they have a problem this time of year (laughter). They keep
showing up. I keep ignoring them. There is some relation. My mother is a very
dignified Southern Belle sitting up there not anywhere near them.  
  
Q. Ashley and Armintie, can you talk about the defense tonight, especially
after about the first 10 minutes when it was tight and you shut them down the
rest of the half?  
ASHLEY AWKWARD: We know that us being Ole Miss, our keys to our victories is
our defense, the way we play, the way we get out on people, being aggressive.
So tonight we tried to get out and tried to I guess you can use it as a
practice, you know, for the rest of the tournament, get in good work, see what
we can do, try some new things, get it going.  
ARMINITIE PRICE: Kind of the same thing. We just wanted to just stay
aggressive, try to jump on them early, try to rotate, move fast, just try to
connect on a good level so the rest of the games we could just know what we
got to do, just move, just pick up our feet and just play together.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
