# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 17, 2007

  

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by Coach Mark Turgeon. Welcome to our media day.  
MARK TURGEON: Thank you. Just real quickly, I'm obviously excited about being
in the Big 12. I had a great job and wasn't going to leave for any job. If I
was going to move up, a so-called move up in our profession, I was going to
hopefully do it in the Big 12. I'm excited about being at Texas A&M and
looking forward to all the battles that lie ahead.  
  
Q. Is it easier or is it more difficult taking over a program that's had
success?  
MARK TURGEON: Well, right now it's been easier because we have good players.
And that was the whole reason that I took the job. So to this point it's been
easier, but now that the season is starting and the polls are coming out and
the expectations are really high in our program which is really good and what
we want, but we did lose some really good players. We have some young players
that had to step up. I think the thing about our program that we have to
understand is we have nine freshmen and sophomores this year, and a lot of
those young kids will play for us. We'll get better as the season goes on type
thing. It's been a lot easier at this point knowing that the expectations may
make it a little tougher over the next five or six months.  
  
Q. Obviously everybody knows you've got some talent there, I think the two
questions are how quickly Donald Sloan takes over that presence and how
quickly DeAndre Jordan is able to assimilate himself at this level?  
MARK TURGEON: I don't want everybody to assume that Donald Sloan is going to
be our point guard, because he played back up point for about three seconds
because Acie Law was never out of the game. Donald is going to play some point
for us. Whether he's going to be our starting point guard or not has not been
determined.  
I've been impressed with him. Donald can score the ball. I want to put --
Dominique Kirk has done a tremendous job for us in practice. He has more the
mindset to be my point guard. You also have B.J. Holmes, who is a highly
thought of young man coming out of high school.  
Sloan is going to play point, but he's also going to play some 2. And maybe as
the year goes on he'll get better. Right now it's not his natural position,
didn't play it in high school. He brought the ball up sometimes last year to
get the ball to Acie in a different position on the floor. But he's a heck of
a talent.  
DeAndre Jordan, speaking of talents, is obviously a big time talent. And he
can block shots. I spent a lot of years at the University of Kansas and we had
had a lot of good players, and obviously Danny Manning being one of them. He
has the most talent I've seen, but it's really raw talent. He's not skilled at
the level he needs to be skilled, which he will be, for him to be successful
all the time on the floor. And we've been working with him now for about six,
seven weeks. He's come a long ways. He's come a long ways quickly. He's going
to have a tremendous year for us and a great career. But people have to be
patient with him out there and understand that he's been so highly talked of,
it's the biggest recruit A&M has had in a long time. There's a lot of pressure
on him. We want him to relax and get better. The best thing about DeAndre is a
great kid, but he's a little young. He's 18 going on about 12 sometimes, so he
wears me out with the text messaging at night and different things. He always
wants to know what's going on. When he matures and starts maturing and stays
like this, and not so emotional, he's going to be a heck of a player.  
  
Q. Joe Jones has had some knee problems in the past. How is he doing right
now?  
MARK TURGEON: Joe's knees are fine. They hurt in conditioning. That's the only
time they hurt. He doesn't want to run conditioning. I think he did it to the
coach last year and he did it to me this year. We had his knees checked out,
just for the piece of mind, so all the NBA folks know that. Joe is just a big
man that runs a little different than most people. We've worked on his running
style, trying to make him run a little bit better. He's worked with some
people to try to make him run better. But right now Joe has a sprained foot.
I'll be honest with you, I haven't coached Joe up and down yet, so I don't
know much about Joe except he's a great leader and great kid. Today is
supposed to be his first practice, so I'm looking forward to that. His knees
are fine, and if we can get his foot healthy, I think Joe is going to have a
great year.  
  
Q. We all know Josh Carter is a great perimeter shooter, but what are your
first impressions of him as a player that can really help the program?  
MARK TURGEON: I think our system is perfect for him. When we were at Kansas
our 2's and 3's always did well. And Wichita State, guys that I coached are
all-time 3-point career leaders in percentage, and most shots made. So I think
it's going to be a great system for him. What we've been working with Josh on
since we took the job on April 10th is trying to improve his all around game
and handling the basketball, mid-range game.  
Josh would shoot the 3 or take it all the way to the basket, in all the films
I've watched. We're trying to use his height to get in the paint and have a
mid-range game. If he can add all that, get to the foul line more, that will
help. Then defensively we're just continuing to try to give him confidence to
get better. He's got the length to be a great defender. And then he's just a
great kid. You're going to have to ask them how they feel about me and how
they feel about our system, but I think everybody is pretty excited about it.  
  
Q. You mentioned Dominique a little bit. He's been a little bit overlooked
because of Acie last year and so forth, but he's always seemed to be a steady
hand. What do you see from him that can provide leadership, especially as a
point guard?  
MARK TURGEON: Dominique brings it every day. If I made him run 100 sprints, 17
guys would quit and Dominique would run all 100 sprints. That's just the kind
of kid he is and the way his parents raised him. What I see in him is a guy
that's going to do whatever the coach asks. And then he's very intelligent. He
can pick up multiple positions and I can explain it and show it to him and he
can do it right every time. With him having to take more of an offensive load,
leading the team, being an extension of the coach I'm hoping that he doesn't
always have to defend the best player this year, which he's done in the past.
I'm sure he will all the time. But hopefully Josh will step up.  
We have two great defenders in Derrick and Donald. They get right in there and
do a tremendous job. So hopefully that will help Dominique. He does get
overlooked because he's a quiet kid. Probably his biggest weakness is he's not
very vocal on the floor. But he leads by example. If we can get him to talk a
little bit more -- and hopefully being a former point guard, I can help him
and Donald become good point guards as the year goes on.  
  
Q. You have only had a few years with your team, but now that you've got the
whole team together, is it like what you thought it was going to be with them?
Has there been any particular surprises, either athletically or -- is it what
you thought?  
MARK TURGEON: When I first moved there, athletically was the biggest, it was,
wow, what a jump from what I had, was able to accrue at Wichita. As far as
work habits go, being a team, there really hasn't been any surprises. They're
young men that want to be coached and want to be successful. The thing I like
most, you know you have a chance to be good when the players care just as much
or more than the coach does.  
It's our livelihood so we put a lot into it, but when young men are invested
the way these young men are invested you have a great chance to be good. They
are all truly invested in our success. A guy that is really practicing well
for us is Chinemulu Elonu, a junior, trying to simplify things, he can be a
great screener. He gets every rebound. He'll knock his own players over to get
a rebound. He's been good with that. Our system is pretty simple right now,
we'll see as it gets more complex how he can handle it. But right now in
practice -- without Joe out there, too, he's really kind of stepped up and a
guy I've been pleasantly surprised in. He's just lacking confidence. When he
gets his confidence up I think he's a guy that maybe a lot of people aren't
counting on helping us this year that will maybe help us.  
PETER IRWIN: Best of luck. Have a great season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 17, 2007

  

### [Sean Sutton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13714)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by Sean Sutton from Oklahoma State. Welcome,
Coach. Make an opening comment or two and then we'll take some questions.  
SEAN SUTTON: It's good to be here. I had a chance last night to go over to the
College Basketball Experience and it was a great experience and one that -- I
visited with Tim Allen last night. I think every team when they make the trip
to Kansas City for the Big 12 Tournament ought to have an opportunity to look
at the history of the college game. It's amazing the things that were inside
that building. It's very fascinating to see so many of the great players and
great coaches that have made this sport one of the most popular sports in the
United States.  
I didn't get a chance to see everything. And I did not get a chance to stick
my head inside the Sprint Center, but from the outside it's one of the most
impressive looking arenas that I've ever seen. So I think always playing a
tournament in Kansas City is a great venue. It's always been a lot of fun. I
know that our teams and our fans have always enjoyed coming up here. So it
will be exciting to come back. I think the last time we were here I believe we
were fortunate to have won that tournament. Hopefully we will play as well
this time. But always a great venue and always special to come back to Kansas
City.  
  
Q. Talk about you personally, especially the last month and a half of the
season last year how that has -- I don't know whether it's a group process,
how that's affected you this season and how it affected you going into the
offseason?  
SEAN SUTTON: I think I'm always motivated going into any season. And that
probably hasn't changed much, the fact the way that season ended. Maybe I'm a
little extra motivated, a little more energized, especially with these early-
season practices. But this is a big year for our program. We take a lot of
pride in what we've been able to accomplish at Oklahoma State.  
We won 57 games the two previous years before these last two seasons, which
was the most in college basketball outside of Duke and Illinois. And then the
season where we won 17 games and had some things that happened in the course
of that season that were challenging and tough to overcome.  
Last year we were a little limited from the start and got off to an
unbelievable start, 15-1, 18-3. And then pretty well documented what happened
after that. We stopped improving. Obi's injury played a factor in that. But we
did not have the type of practice sessions that you had to have in January and
February to improve your team, and ultimately college basketball has come to
what happens in the postseason. Ultimately that's how you're going to be
judged. If you make the NCAA tournament you've had a good year. The deeper you
go you've had a good year. The Sweet 16, Elite 8, Final Four, those are
special seasons. So I think the non-conference portion of your schedule is
always important, because you want to build your RPI, but the end result is
what happens over here in March because that's what people are going to
remember and ultimately that's how teams are being judged. That's how coaches
are being judged. That's just kind of what college basketball has developed
into.  
But with the situations that happened over the offseason, I've spent a lot of
time talking about this, that's something that's not going to be tolerated in
our program. We've always taken great pride in our players doing the right
things, conducting themselves in a first-class manner. And we had some guys
that, quite frankly, used some really poor judgment. And it's unfortunate
because all three of those guys had worked their tails off all summer. They
had been in the gym in the morning at 6:00 shooting jump shots, in the weight
room getting stronger. But they made those decisions and as a coach you can't
be with them 24 hours a day. But ultimately you're responsible for your
players actions and I know that. And I've never shied away from that.  
My point to them is that we're not having this. This is it. This is not going
to happen again. The next time it happens that person is out the door. Just
because through the years we have spent so much time trying to educate our
players to take a strong pride in what it means to play at Oklahoma State. And
the guys here in the past have done such a great job building our program, we
win basketball games, we go to class, we graduate, we stay out of trouble off
the court and go on after we leave Oklahoma State, you either go on to the NBA
or go on to a successful type of business. So those actions, they're not going
to be tolerated at all. And to me, personally, it was very embarrassing. I'm
going to work hard to make sure none of that ever, ever happens again.  
  
Q. You were an assistant to your dad starting in '94. What was that like?
What did you experience? What do you think being the head coach?  
SEAN SUTTON: Well, I don't think I was as good as when we were 15-1 and
everyone thought this guy is pretty good. But I also don't think I was at bad
when we were going in that tail spin, just struggling there at the end. But
that's -- I should have known. That's athletics, and that's fans sometimes.
But I think you learn a lot the first time you go through something. I felt
like I had done a lot of things and probably was about as prepared to take
over a team as any assistant coach. And early it was a pretty smooth
transition. You had to get rid of a couple of players over there which put us
in a situation where we did not have the type of depth that we needed. And as
a result our practices were not as competitive as they needed to be.  
And then Obi's injury occurred, that certainly hurt us. I think the biggest
thing is you have to learn on the job. You have to learn going through it.
There were some things that I thought I was prepared for that really wasn't.
And this year will be easier. I'll be better this year than I was last year
and hopefully next year I'll be better than I was this year, just like with
anybody in their profession. You learn from the mistakes that are made. And
most importantly you learn from going through and having to make those
decisions. There's times where it was a lot of fun and there were times where
it really wasn't a lot of fun. But that's part of college basketball.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about some of the discipline concerns and I know
you're at a school that's had some coaches, including your father, that were
renowned for keeping that. At the same time chances are that they were getting
kids that were getting more of that lesson at home, from high school coaches
and earlier in life. Do you think it's more of a challenge now to get some of
those messages across to an 18-year-old that's been a high school starter,
been told his whole life how great he is, and he can do whatever he wants?  
SEAN SUTTON: Well, there are a lot of things that go into recruiting. One of
the things that we've always tried to do, and I think that will help answer
your question, for eight years we didn't have any problems off the court.
Eight years. And that's unheard of. In eight years not one situation. Our guys
were graduating. We went to eight straight NCAA tournaments during that time.
We played a Final Four. We played in an Elite 8. We played in a Sweet 16. But
we recruited kids that were not only great players, but we did a great job of
really evaluating the type of people they were, the type of character looking
at their home situation. We went through two recruiting classes because we
were losing Joey and Steven Graham, John Lucas, Ivan McFarland, guys that fit
exactly what I'm talking about, that had been raised right, good people,
responsible, very accountable in their actions. And we made some mistakes and
misjudged some character.  
And sometimes as a coach you can get fooled into thinking you can get
everybody turned around. We had a player like Tony Allen who came in, and Tony
was not sane by any means when he got to Oklahoma State. But it didn't take
long for him to realize that if I listen and do these things then I've got a
chance to be successful here. And he had been told his entire life that he was
not very smart, he wasn't a very good student, and we got him with Marilyn
Middlebrook, and Amy, her daughter, and they started working with him. He went
to class, met his tutors, and the first semester grades came in and he got
3.0. There was another semester, 3.0.  
Now everything about his mental side in terms of academics have changed. And
hey, I am smart, I can do this. And all of a sudden he gets his degree. He
goes four semesters with a 3.0, all four semesters. You see a guy like Tony,
if he can do it, we ought to take this kid and do the same thing. Not all kids
are the same.  
And so there were a couple of situations where we just missed. And I told my
staff, we can't have that anymore. We've got to do a better job evaluating
them as players. We've got to go back and be -- do just as much evaluating the
type person they are, where they hang out, what they like to do, are there any
bad habits we need to know about, because if there are, we're cutting them
loose now. Are they going to go to class? Are they going to take school
seriously? Those are the type of kids we want in our program.  
So I guess there's been a renewed commitment from my staff, from me to my
staff, that we want to get back to recruiting good players, but also guys that
have a lot of character and guys that are interested in improving their game
and doing well in school and staying for the right things, just like the guys
that we've had here in the past. I'll say this about this group, the group we
have in right now, I think reflects groups we've had in the past.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you if this fit those parameters, from what you've
seen of their talent and their ability to contribute soon? What do you know or
do you know who your players are out of this class yet?  
SEAN SUTTON: Well, we've got good guards right now. We've had some guys hurt,
so that hasn't helped. We haven't had our entire collection of players out
there yet. But I like this team's potential. I think they're a group that has
been very good about listening. They've been very good about getting out and
working hard and made a strong commitment to play defense. They've made a
strong commitment to take care of the basketball.  
Now individually we've got to get certain guys playing better. We don't have
any experience, any experience on our front court. Not one guy there that's
ever played a minute in the Big 12. And I'm a little concerned with those guys
because when we're doing a rebounding drill and I throw it up and I've got
five guys boxing out five guys, I'm trying to miss, sometimes it goes in. So
I'm just saying I make a couple a day, when we're in that segment. And that's
more than those three guys make together all day. So that's a concern of mine
(laughter). So they've been getting a lot of attention. But I think they'll do
fine in terms of defending and rebounding. And early that's what we have to
have if they're going to have that and they have to know what we're doing,
that we're not making mistakes to beat ourselves. But at some point out of the
three, Anthony Brown, Martavius Adams, Ibrahima Thomas, we've got to get
points out of them. I still don't know what's realistic yet. Hopefully in a
couple of weeks I'll be able to put a number out there what those three guys
will be able to combine and get from a point standpoint and a rebounding
standpoint, but we're not there yet.  
PETER IRWIN: Thanks very much. We appreciate it and have a great season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 17, 2007

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We'd like to now welcome Coach Bill Self from Kansas. If you'd
like to make an opening comment or two.  
BILL SELF: It's too early to be doing this.  
I'm very excited about this year. It's a great time for our school right now
with our football team doing well, and hopefully we'll have a good basketball
team this winter. We had a pretty good year last year and returned the
majority of our guys. We're optimistic, and hopefully we can play off that and
have a chance to have another good year.  
  
Q. How is Brandon doing? Is there a timetable at this point?  
BILL SELF: The timetable has always been December 1 that he would be
participating in games. That was exactly six months from the day of the
surgery. But it's too early to have a definite timetable, because he goes
through some last-round tests, so to speak, strength tests and things that I
don't understand. That will occur real soon. When that occurs he'll be
released full speed, no contact. And then how quickly he comes after that
remains to be seen. But I really think December 1 is still the date, even
though I think it could be a week or two on either side of that.  
  
Q. You touched on it a second ago, what has it been like on campus with
Mangino's team doing well?  
BILL SELF: Hopefully everyone is still looking forward to basketball. I think
it's great. We said all along nothing adds to the enthusiasm, interest,
excitement on campus early in the school year than a football team doing well,
especially in our league. I think it's great what they're doing and hopefully
they can continue to play well. Everybody asks me -- I know they ask Mark this
all the time, you're competing with basketball there or this or that, I loved
his response. I don't think that they're on our schedule this year. So it's
really good to have both programs performing fairly well.  
  
Q. You talked about Brandon a little bit. Talk about the opportunities that
some of the other kids have to play, playing time and show you what they can
do in regular season in Brandon's absence?  
BILL SELF: I think in a strange way this should make us a better team come
January, February and hopefully into March. Rod Stewart is a good player, and
he hasn't had a chance to play much. Jeremy Case is a pretty good player.
Brady Morningstar may have a chance. Tyrel Reed is a good player, and they'll
be forced to be out there more. Whereas if Brandon and the other three guards
return, you would think those would be the guys. I think it does provide
opportunities for those guys, minutes-wise probably early. Even when Brandon
comes back he's not going to be a 25-minute game guy, whether it be 10, 12,
15, who knows, because we don't know how sore he'll get and different things.
It's a great opportunity for one of those guys to emerge.  
  
Q. Eight of the 12 head coaches in the league are either in their first year
or second year. Is that a commentary on the profession or coincidence or what
do you see going on there?  
BILL SELF: I think in our profession in general you're going to have more
turnover, unfortunately, but not at the rate the Big 12 has had. We had
turnover because there are higher priced coaches, and expected to deliver and
keeping the fan base and administration and everyone happy and so obviously
there potentially is turnover. But what we've been through in our league is
unique, and I would bet that that would never happen again in the history of
the league to have -- is it 8 or 9 new coaches? I guess it is 8 new coaches in
the last two years. And then if I'm not mistaken 10 in the last four years, or
whatever. So that won't happen again.  
  
Q. What kind of role do you see for Sherron this year?  
BILL SELF: Well, I hope it's a role that's comparable to what he had last year
when he was playing very, very well in the league. Sherron got off to a bad
start last year by his standards. He was still impacting in the games and in
February for us. He was probably our best guard during the four- to six-week
stretch in the Big 12. But you could say that Mario was that or Russell was
that or Brandon was that. We've got good balance back there. One of the keys
to our team is that Darrell and Sherron elevate their game consistently the
same way that Mario and Julian did last year. We expect Sherron to be one of
the top performers in the league because he has potential to do that.  
  
Q. 10 to 12 coaches picked you again to win the Big 12 championship. Talk
about the league overall and where you see some of the big threats to the
Hawks this year?  
BILL SELF: Obviously I have no friends in the league, so if they did that --
but I think our league is -- I thought last year our league was very good. Our
leagues are cyclical, and losing a high profile guy like Durant, that did so
much for the exposure of our league last year, I think from the perception
standpoint could potentially hurt us. We have great young talent. And great
young freshman talent in our league. We hope that we have some of that.
Certainly I know some schools around the league have a lot, too. Our league
will be good.  
I think Texas has got 7 bodies inside that are all big, strong, physical that
they can throw at you, which is a little bit different look than what Rick's
had in recent memory. I think A&M is very good, very good, and I also believe
that K-State is a team that everybody's looking at them on paper and they're
going to get better because they're young in key spots. To me, Missouri is
going to be the team that is kind of a surprise team of our league. I really
believe that. You can go down the list, Tech, Oklahoma State, everyone is
going to be good. There will be no easy wins on the road, and that may be the
case this year. But I see as much parity as we had. Last year we bent from the
schedule, even though we lost A&M at home. People projected the teams to be
high ranking teams, and this year we play them on the road. This will be a --
we could have as good a team and not have as good a record because I think the
schedule kind of tips the other way this year.  
  
Q. What kind of improvement do you expect from Darrell Arthur this year?  
BILL SELF: Hopefully it will be one of the best in the league. He's very
talented, but inconsistent, still. When he has good days they're really,
really good. But I really believe he has potential to be one of the premier
players in our league. And hopefully a guy that can kind of anchor what we do
from one of our big guy positions. He's about as talented a guy as I've been
around, in large part, due to his athletic ability. He can do a lot of things
you can't coach.  
  
Q. With Brandon gone could Sherron, Russell and Mario see more time on the
floor together?  
BILL SELF: Well, yeah, that's the way we play. We just put three guys out
there that are guards, and two guys out there that are not guards, and
basically have at it. It doesn't bother me at all that we play three point
guards. The key thing is you've got to have one of them that's probably a
decent rebounder, good enough, and Russell can't do that. I see us playing
very small a lot of the times.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 17, 2007

  

### [Doc Sadler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15826)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: As we get back to basketball, we now have Doc Sadler from
Nebraska up here. Coach, make a comment or two, please.  
DOC SADLER: Thanks, first of all, for having me come in here and visit with
you a little bit about basketball. It's always good to talk about basketball
when you're from Nebraska (laughter).  
It's been a short year. A year ago in August when we took over the program we
didn't have a lot of time, and thankfully we had a group of guys that really
bought into what we tried to do. And it made last season go by pretty quick,
and at the same time I thought we got a lot of things done, probably not as
much in wins and losses as we did, maybe just trying to build a program. We
brought in a lot of new guys for this next season. We've got eight new players
that you know, anybody that's followed college basketball, especially at this
level, knows that that's going to be a challenge in itself.  
But I couldn't be more pleased with the effort and for the most part the
talent that these guys have brought into the program. The good news about
having eight new players is they haven't been messed up yet. They don't
understand that I'm trying to mess them up. So that's a plus.  
But the one thing that we have is the big guy Aleks. When you have a chance to
coach someone like this, you better enjoy it, because you won't get that
opportunity very many times in your coaching career. He's not just a great
basketball player, but as hard a worker as we've got in our program. He's put
in a tremendous amount of time this summer to be the best that he can be. When
your best player is a guy that is your hardest worker, then I think you have a
chance to have some success, and I think that's what we've got in Aleks, and
hopefully that's what we've got in our basketball team.  
  
Q. Do you think that you've got the guys now to play the way that you like
to play?  
DOC SADLER: Yeah, I think we're getting closer. Obviously athletically we're
much better on the wings, so we can defend a little bit more like we'd like to
defend. And I don't think we've sacrificed our shooting ability, because I'm
one that believes you've got to be able to shoot the basketball, I don't think
you can put anyone out there. So.  
Defensively, a little more, and offensively, also. We're going to play more 94
feet than maybe we have before. I think we've talked about it, I think we've
got to find a niche at Nebraska that may be a little different and hopefully
that will be the case.  
  
Q. Last year it was a rush, you getting hired in August and that. How much
has having the whole year to get ready for this season helped out as far as
getting the program and everything stabilized?  
DOC SADLER: Again, I think it helps a lot because even though we've got eight
new players we still have some guys that went through the program last year
that kind of now have it figured out what I want. And they're able to help
those young guys and then the new guys. So even though we've got a lot of new
guys, we do have some guys returning, and I think that helps.  
  
Q. The early part of your schedule, can you give us some inclination about
your thought process there, and also about the Big 12? You spent time at
Arizona State. Talk about that as how it stands nationally as a great
season?  
DOC SADLER: I think first of all, as far as the Pac-10 Big 12 match-up, that's
what you're seeing more of in the BCS schools. And you're getting leagues
together that understand that come March, scheduling is going to be important.
So it gives us an opportunity to have good opponents come to Lincoln. At the
same time we're going to have return games.  
Scheduling, as we all know, is probably -- next to the biggest key to
recruiting of a program's success. So you can look at different people's
schedule and say, well, they're playing this amount of teams that are so-
called named schools or this amount of teams or whatever. I think you've got
to look at your program individually, see where it's at, see what you're
trying to deal with and go from there. I can't talk about someone else's
schedule, I'm not concerned about it. But I think our schedule is one that we
have some very good teams in preseason to help us get ready for conference
play. At the same time I think we've got some teams coming in that hopefully
we'll be able to compete with and get some confidence with the young team and
get ready. I think all of those things come into factor when you're building a
schedule. But overall I'm very pleased with it.  
  
Q. What do you mean when you say you've got to find your niche, and what
could that niche be?  
DOC SADLER: I don't think we're going to be able to line up man for man and
just say we're going to play man to man defense for 40 minutes and see who's
got the best team with teams like Kansas, Texas, even A&M this year. I think
we've got to maybe do something a little bit differently. I think we've found
a couple of things last year if in some of the defenses that we tried to put
in. But I'm not confused to think that we're going to line up with 13 players
that is as good as some of the other teams. The three-point shot, the shot
clock, some things like that, and next year when that thing moves back some
more, I think it's going to help people like ourselves, maybe, do some things
different that's not the traditional way or what some people may think is the
traditional way. So we're going to press, and we're going to gamble a little
bit more, try to get some easy baskets. That's the thing I learned last year
in this league is it's so difficult to score. If I think we're just going to
come down there and pound, it's not going to happen.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you very much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 17, 2007

  

### [Greg McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15827)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined at the podium with Iowa State coach Greg
McDermott, welcome.  
GREG McDERMOTT: It's good to start year No. 2, because that means year No. 1
is over. A year ago we returned four scholarship players and we returned five
this year, so I think we're making progress. I'm really excited about the
makeup of this team. Our chemistry is 100 percent better than a year ago. Our
work ethic is better. The guys really seem to like each other. The practices
have been spirited and intense and guys are picking each other up in a way
that you'd like to see teammates do. And that wasn't always the case a year
ago.  
The fact that we do have the five guys back is really important in the sense
that the leadership that they've been able to provide for the eight newcomers
that we have in terms of what our expectations are, the level of
accountability that we expect in our program, and how we're going to operate
on a day-to-day basis has made our jobs as coaches much easier.  
Obviously we're extremely young in the guard court and inexperienced there.
But I think we have some talent there that we didn't maybe have a year ago. We
certainly have some size there that we didn't have a year ago. Probably most
importantly we have some competition for playing time. Last year the roles
were easily defined. The guys that were playing knew they were going to play
and our bench wasn't so much. There wasn't really anybody pushing anybody for
playing time. And that is not the case this year across the board in the guard
court or in the front line. Just having that competition on a daily basis is
going to make ourselves a better team and allow us to move ahead hopefully a
little better.  
  
Q. What kind of improvement do you expect from Wesley from the freshman to
sophomore season?  
GREG McDERMOTT: What I've already witnessed is just his -- the change in his
demeanor from a leadership standpoint. For a sophomore to step up in the way
that he has and assume a leadership role on our team has been very impressive.
He's added some strength, which he needed to do. His ball handling has
improved immensely. And he took a trip with Athletes in Action this summer to
Australia. And that really benefitted him. I think they were a little short on
guards with that touring team and Wesley ended up playing some point guard and
some off guard quite a bit. And that has allowed him to feel much more
comfortable playing facing the basket a little more than maybe he did a year
ago.  
We're going to be forced this year, because of our youth in the guard court to
play Wesley anywhere from a power forward to an off guard. So he's going to
have to be very versatile for us this season. I think he has the makeup and
the ability to do that.  
  
Q. What would you say may be the one or two biggest things you learned last
year in year one either at Iowa State or in the league?  
GREG McDERMOTT: I learned that Doc Sadler is the biggest sandbagger on the
golf course than anyone I've ever met (laughter). We were really slight in the
guard court, both from a height standpoint and from a strength standpoint. We
were taken advantage of in many situations in the Big 12 because we just
weren't big and strong enough. I told my staff many times, we just weren't
built to play in the Big 12 a year ago. So we tried to address that with our
recruiting. And I think that was one area.  
The other one was across the front line. Wesley Johnson was playing power
forward at 190. It's hard to make a living in the Big 12 that way. Jiri is now
stronger and Wesley is 205 and much stronger. Alex Thompson becomes eligible,
Craig Brackins brings us size and athletic ability we didn't have last year.
Cory Johnson has changed his body and then Clayton Vette, who is big and
strong. You just have to be big and strong to have a chance to compete with
the physicalness of this league, and we didn't have that a year ago, and I
think we're better in that regard this season.  
  
Q. Considering your lack of experience, does that make the non-conference
portion of the season more important getting ready for the Big 12?  
GREG McDERMOTT: Without question. We've put together a schedule that I think
will challenge us. We have some of the typical bye games at home that you hope
you can be successful, but we've also -- we also are going to take our team on
the road and play some decent teams in arenas, and we'll be able to throw our
young guards in a lot of difficult situations prior to the start of the Big
12. So as I mentioned earlier, there's a lot of competition for those
positions, and I think we'll be able to use a lot of combinations early, get a
lot of different players on the floor, to find out who is going to click best
together.  
  
Q. You moved up now to No. 5 in seniority in the league, based on hire.
There's eight first and second year coaches, just a commentary on the
profession or something about the league, what are your thoughts on that?  
GREG McDERMOTT: It is the most, without question, from when I started in
college coaching 19 years ago. I spent the majority of my career at the
Division 2 level, where it wasn't so much of a what have you done for me
lately profession, it certainly has grown into that. And I think that's
unfortunate, because I think there are quality people that are proven coaches
that are losing their jobs I think before they have an opportunity to do the
things that they're capable of doing. And that's sad for me to see. But it is
what it is. And I certainly understand it. And I realize that we're going to
have to try to turn this program around as quickly as we can. But I also think
you have to have the courage to be patient, both on a daily basis with your
team in practice and as we attempt to build a program, because we're
attempting to build a program, not a team. And there's a lot more that goes
into that than just what takes place on the basketball floor. You have to take
your time and do it the right way. When you do that there's growing pains at
times and we experienced some of those last year and I think we'll experience
a few more this year. But as long as we're moving forward and the program is
being put in place I'll feel good about it, regardless of what happens.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how Jiri was able to develop last season and what you
expect to see from him this year?  
GREG McDERMOTT: He was about five minutes from being on the plane back to the
Czech Republic right after Christmas. And he and I finally had it out. And we
didn't get along very good the first couple of months of practice. And part of
it is in Jiri's defense, part of it is how he grew up playing the game. He
grew up facing the basket and he was very skilled at facing the basket and he
feels that was his ticket to professional basketball at some level. But what
was important to me is how he can best help our team. It was my job as head
coach to get that across to him. And finally right around the first of the
year it clicked with him that he was the one guy on the team last year that
could score on the block. Besides being skilled facing the basket, Jiri is a
skilled player on the block. He uses both hands very well, he can get to the
free throw line, and that was going to give our team an opportunity to be more
successful.  
Once Jiri bought into what I asked him to do he started playing better, his
numbers got better. And then we addressed in the offseason the fact that he
just wasn't strong enough. To Jiri's credit he's put on 25 pounds of muscle in
the offseason. He's changed his diet. We had him working with a nutritionist,
just to change some of the things he was putting in his body so that he could
maybe put on some weight.  
I give Jiri a lot of credit because at times it's easier for a coach to get a
younger player that's 18 or 19 years old to buy in and help the team. Jiri is
23 years old. It's more difficult to get someone that's that age and that set
in their ways to make a change to the betterment of the team. And to his
credit he was able to do that.  
  
Q. You talked about Wesley's versatility. Does Alex Thompson have that
versatility? Maybe one of the more versatile players, how has he been
practicing so far?  
GREG McDERMOTT: Alex, as well has put on a lot of strength. He came to us
around 225, and he's now 245 now. He's versatile in the sense that he can play
I think both front line positions. He's quick enough to guard a perimeter
power forward, yet strong enough to play against somebody that's big and
strong in the block. And I think that's where he can really help us. We're
going to need him probably to score a little bit more than he thinks about
scoring right now, and that's going to be our charge in practice the next
several weeks to understand that he really needs to be a viable option for us.  
Our strength is in our front line. That's where our experience is. Alex has
played two years in the Big Ten before he transferred from Iowa to our place.
He's got as much experience playing college basketball as anyone in our
program.  
  
Q. In retrospect are you surprised or happy that you were able to win 15
games last year, everything considered?  
GREG McDERMOTT: We won the games we were supposed to win. As a coach you
always get nervous that somebody that is not supposed to beat you can sneak up
on you, when you're instituting a new system of play. And for the most part we
were able to win the games we were supposed to win, except for maybe three or
four games we were able to be competitive. And that was really our hope for
last season, let's get to the last five or six minutes of as many games as we
can, and give ourselves a chance to win in the end. We were able to win six
Big 12 games, which I was pleased with. And there were five or six more where
we had an opportunity in the end to win. Now, to do that we had to play a lot
of different ways. I'm not sure there was a system and a style in place. We
were all over the map because of the shortcomings from a size and strength
standpoint, where we had to hide some of our weaknesses to give ourselves a
chance to win. So I was really pleased with how the guys bought into the
different game plans we put together last year. But I was disappointed that we
weren't able to develop a little better chemistry and team unity a year ago
that I think that we have now.  
PETER IRWIN: Good luck this season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 17, 2007

  

### [Frank Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17664)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by Coach Frank Martin from Kansas State. Welcome
and make some opening comments.  
FRANK MARTIN: I apologize I was a couple of minutes late. They had me waiting
there. But I promise, win or lose, that won't be the case when you guys come
out to cover us. I'll be on time. And that's something that's important to me,
is punctuality. But I'll kind of leave it up to you guys.  
I've been watching our team for the past two months. I'm extremely pleased
with the progress we've made, how our guys have blended with one another,
their willingness to learn. And the most important thing to me is how
competitive they've been and the drive that they have to succeed. I'll kind of
open it up to you guys and follow your lead.  
  
Q. Walker is back at 100 percent. Has he lost a bunch of weight; is all that
true?  
FRANK MARTIN: You know, here's the thing, if you're around him for one day you
learn what an incredible drive to succeed that young man has. For a 19-year-
old to be so passionate about being good is rare these days. If I would have
asked anybody a year ago, do you know that Bill Walker has overcome an ACL
injury early in his life, 90 percent of the people that didn't know him would
say there's no way someone that athletic and that powerful could have had an
ACL injury. This is something he's experienced before. So it gave him a great
deal of confidence that he can overcome this little bump in the road for him
and that's why me as a person, somebody that knew him through the recruiting
process, that knows what he's all about, there was never an ounce of concern
on my part as to whether or not he will be ready to go full tilt this year.
He's in the best shape he's ever been in his life, as strong as ever.
Conditioning-wise he's better than he's ever been. He still has a little ways
to go to get to 100 percent as far as some of his lateral movements and all
that, but he's been great.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of talk about the recruiting class that Coach brought
in. Could you talk about a couple of the veteran players like Blake Young and
Clent Stewart and what they mean to your club and what you expect out of
them?  
FRANK MARTIN: Dave Hoskins was a second team All-Conference player last year.
You don't become that unless you have substance and a game to back that up.
And Dave is an incredible teammate. Dave, Clent, Blake, those three guys, Mike
Beasley, Bill Walker and the rest of the characters we have as first year
guys, which is a whole slew of them. I'm going to have to start doing like
football coaches do, like put names on their foreheads. We've got so many
first year guys it's hard to remember them every day.  
All our new guys would have no chance to succeed in the Big 12 if we didn't
have guys like those three to show them the way. The job that those three guys
have done -- Mike Beasley has gained 14 pounds of lean muscle since he's been
on campus. He's been extremely committed to the weight room like all our guys
are. That doesn't happen until the day he gets on campus and those guys show
him the way and how hard our guys work and will continue to work.  
  
Q. Are you concerned that your fan base will expect too much from Michael?  
FRANK MARTIN: You know, I can't speak for Michael. But I can tell you that
I've been at a university where the fan base didn't care. That's a lonely
feeling. That's hard. I want to be somewhere where everybody expects us to
win, because I expect to win. I want our players to expect to win. And we're
going to compete to win. I mean that's what we want. I want our fans -- if we
don't win, then I want our fans to be pissed off. They have that right because
I want them to take pride in the product we're going to put out on that court.  
Mike puts a great deal of pride in winning. He's about winning. If you follow
his high school career, everyone knows he played four different high schools
in four years, each one of those schools won a championship the year he was
there. There's something to be said about that. I believe in people that win,
not people that play for self-glory. He plays to win. He wants to be good. He
takes a great deal of pride in helping K-State get back to the days of
greatness. And at the end of the day he's 18 years old.  
I don't know about you guys, but when I was 18 I had bad days. He's going to
have a bad day. That's just reality and human nature, and it's our job as
coaches, teammates, to make him understand that that's okay. It's just not
good to have two bad days in a row.  
  
Q. This is obviously your first chance to coach college basketball as a head
coach. Talk about the opportunity you're getting. Did you ever think you had
an opportunity where you had such a roster stacked like Kansas State and the
Big 12 in that first opportunity?  
FRANK MARTIN: Yeah, I mean it's 22 years ago when my high school coach asked
me to help him coach his junior varsity program I didn't know what I was
getting into. And once I started doing it I realized this is what I want to do
for the rest of my life. And every day I got out of bed I wanted to be in the
situation that I'm in right now. I wanted to be at a school that had
incredible tradition, which K-State had. I wanted to be a part of a team that
has incredible talent, that has the ability to compete for championships. I
wanted to be in an arena that's full of people, passionate fans, that has a
president like President Wefald, and people like Tim Weiser, people that care,
that care about succeeding.  
I just got asked a question outside, you know there's times I've been sitting
around in my basement and I'd tell my wife, Coach Knight has been an idol of
mine since I was a young kid, and how he was able to get teams together and
compete at such a high level. And as a high school coach for so many years I
understood the challenges that young kids go through before they get to
college. And for him to be able to coach a group of guys and put them out
there and get them educated and get them college degrees, and yet compete at a
high level, not for a year, not for two years, but for so many years, I've got
to catch myself. As much as that was something that was -- getting ready to
deal with Coach Barnes and Bill Self and all those great coaches that we have
in this league.  
At the same time I can't sit around and say, wow. I have to be able to get
that thought out of my head and understand that Frank, those guys that were my
idols, those were the guys that you learned watching their teams play, now is
the time that you have to prepare a team to compete with those guys and win. I
know that's hard. I've had the opportunity to coach against teams coached by
every team in this league, I understand how hard their teams play. I
understand how well prepared they are. So that drives me to be ready to go at
a high level.  
  
Q. One of the biggest things you probably learned from Coach Huggins, what
are two or three of the ones that stand out most?  
FRANK MARTIN: Confidence. He walked into that gym at Kansas State last year
and he and I were and Dalonte Hill were there for that first workout. When we
finished I went back in the locker room and said, "Huggs, how are we going to
win?" And like he did every year I've known him he said, "Frank, we'll figure
it out." He instills incredible confidence in players, and he completely
convinces players that if they are willing to sacrifice themselves by
competing at a high level, by playing with each other, by outworking
themselves, that's what I believed in. And once I started working them that's
what I realized that college basketball is all about.  
  
Q. Obviously it's early, but how much different do you think you'll be than
Coach Huggins?  
FRANK MARTIN: We're real similar as people. That's why when he gave me the
opportunity to go work for him that's why it became such a special thing for
me, because I believed in him as much as I did, and still do. We just spoke
last night for 45 minutes, Andy Kennedy, him and myself. That created an
incredible bond in us working together at Cincinnati. But with that said, I
also have my own flavor. And that's what we've been trying to do is instill my
flavor into how we're going to play at Kansas State. There are things I've
learned through my experiences being Coach, just like I learned from Ron
Everhart and Rudy Keeling and Andy Kennedy that I'm going to use my thoughts
in how the game is going to be played, and that's my job to develop those
ideas and make sure that the players understand those ideas. We're going to be
similar in some things, but somewhat different in others.  
PETER IRWIN: We wish you the best of luck.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 17, 2007

  

### [Bob Knight](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15563)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We are now joined by Coach Bob Knight from Texas Tech University.
Welcome, Coach.  
BOB KNIGHT: Well, the Cardinals are out of it. We've got to root for the
Indians. Eric Wedge is my next best friend. So doing pretty good. Anybody got
any questions about the American League Championship series?  
  
Q. How important do you think it is for them to win Game 5 and not go back
to Fenway Park?  
BOB KNIGHT: I think it would be damn important. I mean they've got to go
against Beckett. But what kind of tickles me about sports is that -- that game
is tomorrow night, isn't it? So we will now see everything on television
geared for two days to where Beckett should have pitched last night. If
Wakefield had pitched well it would have been the greatest decision in
baseball. I always get a kick out of TV people, because a play works. A guy
runs a trap, you know, or runs a delay and it gains 12 yards, boy, what a
great call that was. Well, it was a great call because somebody blocked well.
It wasn't like it came out of divine intervention somewhere. And if they run
it and it gets thrown for a three yard loss, boy, that was a bad call. And
that always kind of intrigues me about people that work the TV angle on
sports. And I think that will be huge. If Beckett were to win tomorrow it will
all be about he can't pitch another game.  
But the decisions that are made and things like that are really made by the
people, i.e., Francona and his staff, that really put the thing together. It
isn't like they're trying to lose. And that's why watching other sports has
always been a very intriguing thing for me, just to see why or how or what.  
Last night my question, when I'm watching the game last night was I think you
get stuck, whatever the sport is, you get stuck with some things that are, for
lack of a better word, traditional or expected. So at the end of the 8th
inning, I was with two guys watching it and I said I wonder if Bettencourt
will pitch the 9th inning, which he did. Which to me was a great decision
because he had just gone through three guys like a hot knife through butter.
And when he pitched the 9th inning, I thought maybe they'd bring Borowski in,
because that's the thing to do. It was good. So I like that part of it.  
I used to tell Bill Parcells that football ought to investigate the guy that
had invented prevent defense. We may get through this whole thing and never
mention basketball.  
Anybody got anymore baseball questions?  
  
Q. Do you think the Royals have any chance to get Tony LaRussa to be their
manager next year?  
BOB KNIGHT: I think that what LaRussa does, I think it will depend on what he
thinks would be the best situation for him to have a team that can defend,
which might leave the Royals out. But who knows? And I think that -- I would
think that -- well, let me put it this way, of all the sports and the things
that I've followed over all the years I've been around this, I have never seen
two guys better than Jocketty and LaRussa were. They're the best I've ever
seen, not just in baseball, but the best administrator and the best coach or
manager that I've ever seen. I think what they did over 12 years in St. Louis
was remarkable. And to split that up it was kind of interesting.  
  
Q. Talk about your friend Lucas?  
BOB KNIGHT: Lucas doesn't have anything in the Breeders Cup, which I think is
the first time ever. I think he's probably working on recruiting a little bit
right now. He's told me that he's got -- he's got either one or two horses
that he bought at auction that he thinks are going to be pretty good.  
  
Q. Just wondering about bringing in a guy like Ricardo, and your thoughts on
whether he can have immediate impact on your club?  
BOB KNIGHT: We've practiced four times, and I think that's impossible to tell
after four practices. When you sign a kid you think he can play. Now you're
not always right. But everybody -- somebody says to me, well, you signed Billy
Jones, do you think he can play? What the hell do you think we signed him for?
We didn't sign him to be a cheerleader. We brought him in here to play. So you
always think guys can play. But you're not always right.  
  
Q. I'll go back to baseball. If you were Terry Francona, would you have gone
with Beckett last night?  
BOB KNIGHT: I don't know enough about it. But then apparently last night
Beckett had some back problems, and wasn't in the best of health to play. So
now you use him and he further hurts himself then maybe he doesn't pitch at
all. Now he may get enough rest to take this back to Boston, which I think
would be huge for them, if he can do that tomorrow night. I hope he can't,
because as I said, I'm really rooting for the Indians. But I'm sure that
putting everything together he did exactly what -- and, you know, for four
innings Wakefield was untouchable last night. It just kind of caved in on him.  
That's the problem with coaching instead of writing or analyzing, you know.
You have to make the first decision, then all you guys can make the second
decision.  
  
Q. Can the Indians beat the Rockies?  
BOB KNIGHT: If I knew whether the Indians could beat the Rockies or not George
Bush would be asking me how the hell do you get out of Iraq right now. If I
was that smart. What is intriguing about both teams is, I think, they've both
done a great job, not just with the season but with the way they've put their
teams together and how they've done it and where those players have come from.
They've gone out and apparently -- and the Yankees to a certain extent, too,
but apparently the Indians and Rockies are teams that have had great scouting
decisions, that have brought players along in their own organizations.  
  
Q. You grew up an Indians fan in Ohio, where do you stand on Chief Wahoo?  
BOB KNIGHT: I think the Indians have had a great run as the Indians. I think
that what they're doing really -- and I think people get a little bit bent out
of shape with things like that. I think there's a real long history of Indian
culture in the state of Ohio. And half a dozen different tribes, from the lake
down to the Ohio River. And I think that that's something that -- I can't
speak for anybody other than myself, but I think I would be kind of proud of
that, that here's a Major League franchise that uses the name Indians and I
think that kind of reflects on the whole heritage of the various Indian tribes
in the state. In fact one of the tribes was the Miami tribe. We have Miami
University, again, which I think is something that could be very proud of.  
PETER IRWIN: Coach, thanks very much for your comments. We appreciate it. Have
a great season.  
BOB KNIGHT: I enjoy being here. I appreciate your recognizing my exceptional
talent in analyzing baseball here this morning. I want to thank you for that.
And we'll enjoy anything that you want to discuss relative to baseball during
the coming months, just give me a call.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

## October 17, 2007

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We now have Coach Scott Drew from Baylor up here on the podium.
Coach, welcome this morning.  
SCOTT DREW: Hopefully everyone has their coffee cups filled and we're ready to
go today. Our staff is very excited from the standpoint for the first time
since we've been at Baylor, one of the first practices I looked at our staff
and I thought we actually have players out here knowing where to go and what
to do. We are excited to finally have juniors and seniors that have played a
couple of years in the Big 12.  
  
Q. Last year Bruce went into the NBA draft and stepped out. What was that
experience like for him and how will that help him this year?  
SCOTT DREW: I think it was a great experience for him from the standpoint he
was able to see what he needed to work on and also at the same time see what
kind of tryouts he will go out next year when he tries the NBA. Aaron
approached it with the right frame of mind, I'm going to go out and work out
for the NBA teams, and I'm going to get better and not stress myself out, to
see if this is something. If he was a first round pick he would have gone out,
if he wasn't he was coming back to college. I think it was a great situation
for him.  
  
Q. As much as you like the veterans, can you talk about Dunn and some of the
other guys you hoped to change the dynamics?  
SCOTT DREW: Our most highly touted newcomer is LaceDarius Dunn. He provides us
a bigger guard than we have, he's strong, physical and can rebound and really
score. He's going to leave his mark at Baylor University.  
We also have another freshman, Fred Ellis from California, he's transitioning
from the inside position to the perimeter. And we have a junior college player
in Delbert Simpson, and he should help out with the rebounding and those kind
of things.  
  
Q. It's been a long time since Baylor has had a player picked preseason
first team All-Conference like Curtis Jerrells, what has he done to get better
in the offseason?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, Curtis worked the Adidas camp this summer, that gave him a
chance to go against some of the elite college players in the nation, and also
at the same time he spent a lot of time working on his shots trying to be more
consistent from the perimeter.  
But we're very excited about the year that we think Curtis is going to have. I
know he's extremely excited about being recognized in the preseason.  
  
Q. You talk about Curtis working on his shot. It's only been a few days, but
can you see where it's more reliable from the perimeter instead of a scorer?  
SCOTT DREW: He has better rotation on the shot, better arch on his shot, seems
to be more confident on it. So hopefully that continues.  
  
Q. Kim Mulkey and some of the women's coaches talked yesterday about how it
elevated the Big 12 when she won, when Baylor won a National Championship and
how important that is for a conference. Do you think that the men have
suffered in any way because that's one thing that the Big 12 has yet to do is
win a National Championship?  
SCOTT DREW: I think the big thing that we look at as a coaching staff from the
Big 12 is you look at the Final Four appearances. In the last six years the
Big 12 has more Final Four appearances than any conference. It's a matter of
time until one of those teams gets to the Final Four that will win a National
Championship. I think the important thing is getting teams there, because that
shows that you're close, you're knocking on the door. When you get to the
Final Four, as we all know, a tipped ball, loose ball, things can influence
the game. It's going to happen, and it won't be long. As long as we get teams
there we'll have a chance to win a National Championship.  
  
Q. What do you make of the new bench decorum rules. The enforcement of those
rules?  
SCOTT DREW: I know that's been a point of emphasis and something that us
coaches have been made aware of. The more that they call it the more that
we'll obviously watch what we do. But hopefully it doesn't affect us too much.  
  
Q. You were picked for 9th in the preseason poll. Was that a disappointment
about where you see yourself going in?  
SCOTT DREW: I think preseason polls are always preseason polls. Where you
finish is the important thing. If you're picked low, it can give you
motivation, and we feel that this year we have the chance and potential to be
a very good team. We need to make sure we take care of things on the court.  
  
Q. That being said, how disappointed will you be personally if you don't
make a move this year?  
SCOTT DREW: I'll be very disappointed from the standpoint we have the
experience now, and our players -- each year our players have taken a step
forward. Last year we won five conference games, which was more than the year
before, and we had a number of close games. So hopefully we are able to win
and be more successful in some of those close games.  
  
Q. With LaceDarius Dunn and Tweety Carter you've had some terrific scoring
high school players, how do you see them projecting down the line?  
SCOTT DREW: I know they're going to shoot it. Those are two guys that provide
instant offense. I know Tweety Carter, probably more than anyone else on our
team, took a step up on the offseason. He lost a lot of weight. He's becoming
more confident and really worked hard. So I think this year he's going to have
a very good year for us.  
  
Q. When you say you'll be disappointed if you don't take a step, a couple of
steps, how do you define that?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, that's one thing that our team will talk as we get closer to
season about what our team goals are. But at the beginning of the year there's
not one team in America that doesn't want to make postseason. But at the same
time you need to focus on the game you have in front of you, if you don't take
care of that game you can't take care of the big picture. In the Big 12 we
know if you don't win a game, you're going to lose, so we need to be ready
every night.  
  
Q. When you came in you obviously had a plan and goals for where you would
be. Is this what you thought it would be and the timing and all of that,
especially with the leadership that you have now on this team?  
SCOTT DREW: I think our staff is extremely pleased with where our program has
gone in the time period that it has. From the standpoint we have the type of
players that we want representing Baylor University. A couple of things you'll
never see in the record book. In the last 4 out of 6 semesters, we've set
academic records for those that had over a 3.0 GPA. Players are doing the
right things and taking care of the right things. They're representing the
school the right way. We're pleased with the talent level, how they've
matured, adapted and how they've represented Baylor University. I know we're
excited.  
PETER IRWIN: Best of lung to you, have a great season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 17, 2007

  

### [Jeff Capel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15825)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: Good morning to everybody. We'd like to welcome you this morning
to the Big 12 media days for men's basketball. And Coach Capel is here from
Oklahoma University. Coach, welcome.  
JEFF CAPEL: First of all, I'd like to thank all of you for getting here bright
and early this morning. We hope to have an exciting media day. We know this is
going to be a big year in the Big 12. There's talented players and good
coaches. We're excited about being up in Kansas City, seeing the Sprint Center
and the College Basketball Experience. It's a great place to play basketball
here in Kansas City.  
We're excited to be here. I'm excited about my team this year. I think we have
some returning guys that are talented and got better this summer. We have some
talented new guys. We're in the process right now of mixing it all together
and trying to figure out who we can become.  
  
Q. Reflect back for us on your first tour, your first season. What you
learned, what you know you have to get better to compete at the championship
level at this conference?  
JEFF CAPEL: We have to be able to score. We have to be able to put the ball in
the basket. That's where we really struggled last year. We go through lulls,
just about every game, especially our last six or seven games, where we
couldn't score. I thought defensively we were pretty good. We were able to
stop people. In order to win games you have to put the ball in the basket and
that's what we struggle at.  
Hopefully this year with some guys last year getting some consistent minutes,
Longar Longar playing consistently for the minutes, Tony Crocker, hopefully we
can be healthy all year long. With those guys, and David Godbold being a
senior, some of our new guys, hopefully we can get consistent scoring, and
being as good or better as we were defensively.  
  
Q. You had an extra ten days of practice, got to take your team up for some
games in Canada. What was the impact of that, especially with a young player
that you have like Blake Griffin?  
JEFF CAPEL: It was a great experience for us. The practices, games, the
camaraderie. We were over in Vancouver, our cell phones didn't work, so they
had to talk to each other. So we had that. Played four games over there and
the competition was decent, but I thought we did some awfully good things. We
went on that trip without Austin Johnson and Tony Crocker, those guys were out
with injuries. We only had one returning back court player, David Godbold, so
they were able to get some experience, especially in the back court. Blake was
terrific, he's a really talented young guy. And he's one of those guys that
wants to be really good, he doesn't just talk about it, but he's arguably been
the hardest worker since the first day he stepped on campus. In a lot of ways
he's really elevated our practices, our workouts, because of how hard he goes
after it. He's going to be a good one for us. But we think some of our other
new guys will have a chance to have significant impact for us, as well.  
  
Q. Obviously you've got some established post players with Longar and Blake
coming in. Talk a little bit about your guard players?  
JEFF CAPEL: It should be key for us. We have to get good guard play. I like
our post guys, the two guys you mentioned and Taylor. Taylor Griffin will be
better, be more consistent than he was last year, and get Keith Clark back.
But we have to show improvement in the back court. We have to really defend,
the defense starts in the back court, picking guys up. We have to be able to
create some offense from our back court. So we're open with a healthy Austin
Johnson, and senior David Godbold and Tony Crocker, those guys will be the
mainstays on the perimeter. And our new guys will have a chance to work their
way in and have playing time. And Cade Davis played good in Canada, and has
done some good things recently. We've had four practices since last Friday,
Omar Leary has done a good job. We have talented guys, but they're young.  
  
Q. You mentioned Omar Leary, talk about what you've seen from him.  
JEFF CAPEL: He's done some good things. He struggled with it some, which is
typical of a lot of junior college guys, especially junior college guards.
Omar has to learn how to work hard every day -- to work at a different level.
He works hard, but when you come from a junior college and get to this level
it's a different way you work. There is a little more structure than what he's
accustomed to, playing against bigger guys, playing with bigger guys. He's not
able to get all the way to the basket. He's a small point guard, he's not able
to get all the way and finish like he did in junior college. He has to pick
spots and he can't get buried too deep. He can handle the ball. He shoots it
well and we think he's going to be a good player for us. It's like most new
guys, unless you have a special talent, it's going to take him a little bit of
time to figure things all out.  
  
Q. What do you see as your main challenge? Obviously Big 12 is a brutal
conference. What do you see as the main challenge?  
JEFF CAPEL: Well, I think, like I said earlier, the main thing is guard play.
We have to have consistent guard play on both ends of the floor. We have to be
able to score more. Last year I think our stats, I don't remember, but I think
we were up on top somewhere near the top defensively. And I anticipate us
being a good defensive team again. Hopefully we're better than we were last
year. But we have to be able to score and we have to get good, consistent
perimeter play. And I think if we can do that and our post guys can be as good
as we think they're going to be, and be consistent, I think we have a chance
to really improve from where we were last year.  
I thought last year we had a chance, we were right there and just down the
stretch we just couldn't close games out, we couldn't put two halves together,
we had lulls where we couldn't score, but we still had a chance, we were right
there. Hopefully last season helped our guys, especially our returning guys,
grow up. Longar was inconsistent at times last year. At times he was terrific.
At times he wasn't so terrific. He had never really played. He was sort of
like the junior college guy, finally playing as a junior. And then there was
some confidence issues with him. I think with playing consistently last year I
think he knows how to prepare for a season better. So I think he's better
prepared this year to play the minutes than he was last year. If you haven't
played on this level, I mean really played minutes, you really don't
understand how you have to prepare. I don't think it's any coincidence that
down the stretch is when some of our guys started to struggle. I think we got
tired. I think we got mentally fatigued also. That's where when you haven't
played, whether you're a freshman or junior college guy, you don't know how to
prepare for late February, mid-to late February when we're playing those
games, you don't know how to mentally prepare for that. Hopefully all our guys
will be better because of the experience last season. And they can help the
younger guys out. We had no one that had done that except for Michael Neal
last year. Nate Carter and David Godbold played consistently, but we need
those guys to step up and be leaders for us.  
PETER IRWIN: Have a great season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 17, 2007

  

### [Jeff Bzdelik](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13815)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: At this time we'd like to welcome Coach Jeff Bzdelik from
Colorado. Welcome, coach, if you'd like to make an opening comment.  
JEFF BZDELIK: Just that I'm excited about the challenge that awaits us, and I
understand it's a great challenge. It's a great league filled with great
coaches, great tradition, great talent, and I have both eyes open.  
  
Q. When you say you come in with both eyes open, what does that mean in
Colorado, because your predecessor always complained about a lack of support
from the administration?  
JEFF BZDELIK: Well, there is no lack of support at CU. When Chancellor
Peterson and Mike Bohn came to my house to talk to me about the job, the first
thing I said to the chancellor was, yes, you have a beautiful location, you
have a great academic institution, but you do have the worst facility in the
Big 12. And we're kidding ourselves -- you're kidding yourself if you think
you can compete on a yearly basis in this league, because let's face it, what
do 18 year olds want to see? And he understands that. He played football at
Kansas State. He's only been there 14 months.  
As we speak, they're putting $950,000 into a basketball operations center
which we'll move into around Thanksgiving. We're putting about $750,000 into a
basketball locker room that is under construction right now. It's in my
contract they have to build a practice facility within three years. We've
already been on some trips with several administrators from the school looking
at other practice facilities so we can have a state-of-the-art one.  
What I meant about both eyes open, I understand where we are. I understand
we're looking up at the league, and the winning and losing I'm not concerned
with. I'm just concerned with my team playing with a desperate effort and
playing as well as they can individually and collectively and getting better
on a daily basis. If we couple that with new facilities and couple that with
some really solid recruiting classes then eventually the winning and losing
will take care of itself in a positive way.  
  
Q. Three seniors, one junior, talk about your philosophy in rebuilding this
program from the bottom up with freshmen classes and working with that?  
JEFF BZDELIK: Again, to me it's a mix. Marcus Hall and Richard Roby are proven
Big 12 players. I think they'll fit very well into the style of play we're
going to play. We're going to have to get contributions from our freshmen. We
have a couple of freshmen in particular that are doing well right now. We're
going to be grossly under-sized, but we will have athleticism and some length
in some certain other positions. Again, we're just going to have to be really
efficient at offense to the point where we don't allow easy baskets in
transitions for our opponents and try to keep them shooting contested
perimeter shots and getting the rebound and just play that way for 40 minutes,
possession by possession, and hopefully we put ourselves in the position to be
competitive and have a chance to win. Again, that goes with the expression,
both eyes open. I understand what we're up against.  
  
Q. You kind of bounced around a little bit the last few years, do you think
Colorado is a place you can stay and build something lasting?  
JEFF BZDELIK: I haven't really bounced around, I've stayed in the same home,
just changed direction on the I-25. I've been asked that question. I love the
state of Colorado. I was the head coach of the Denver Nuggets, as you know.
They're doing pretty well until Carmelo and Kenyon and a couple of guys got
hurt and you lose a couple of games and they're gone, and therefore it opened
up. And I didn't want to move my family and this opportunity presented itself
and I'm still in the same home.  
My son's a freshman at CU, and my daughter is still in her same high school.
My wife loves where we live and I do, too. Hopefully I can stay there for a
long time. But of course in order to do that you need to win games.  
  
Q. I know Marcus Hall was out last year with academic problems, but we all
saw what kind of explosive player he was before. How is he fitting into your
system and what do you see for him this year?  
JEFF BZDELIK: Well, we expect great things from Marcus Hall. It's great to
have a player with that kind of experience and talent back. So much is made
about our system, but really it's just basketball. I just want players that --
in order for the so-called system to work players need to be able to pass,
dribble and shoot and have a high intelligence. And Marcus and Richard are
excellent players in that regard. They're versatile, they can score in a
variety of ways. They can hit perimeter shots. They can score off the dribble.
They can post up, they can do those kind of things. The system is based on
spacing and reading the defense. But all players need to be able to do that,
the passer, the screener, the cutter.  
So I'm very pleased with having those two kind of players back. They've really
shown great leadership. They've picked up what we've asked them to do in a
great way and I actually have encouraged them to teach other players, to help
their learning process, as well, when they're on the sidelines and another
group is going through learning it. It's great to have them back.  
  
Q. Regarding Roby, the fall off, relative fall off for him last year over
what was expected, is it something you have to rebuild or he has to rebuild
himself. Was this his fault or was this the system's fault?  
JEFF BZDELIK: I think there's a lot of reasons why he didn't play well last
year. First of all, Coach Patton -- let me say this, Coach Patton did a great
job, did a great job under the circumstances. I wish him well. We know each
other and respect one another. Richard, yeah, he didn't shoot the ball well. I
don't think it was a case of his skill, not being able to shoot the ball well,
it was the quality of shot that he took. When Coach Patton resigned so early
on in the season it was really -- everything was just kind of thrown into a
spiral downward. And the players kind of got caught up in that. I don't think
it's all Richard's fault. What Richard has to do is be an active participant
in his own rescue. Richard, that's over with now. Now we need to play with
desperate effort, we need to just play solid team basketball and care more
about the name on the front than the name on the back and work hard on a daily
basis to improve your overall game. And of course defensively we need to get a
heck of a lot better. I'm challenging him, both on and off the court, to be
the type of young man and player that he needs to be and should be.  
  
Q. In regards to the spiral, how much of a cultural winning mentality are
you facing, how much of that are you having to rebuild?  
JEFF BZDELIK: You need to have an environment conducive to winning, and that
comes off the court as much as on the court. You need to get up and eat
breakfast and have lunch and dinner and go to bed at a decent time so you can
be in optimum shape. The altitude is a factor. You need to make it a factor. I
bring up the term desperate effort. That only gives us an opportunity to have
a chance to be competitive in the game.  
Going to class, we're very tough on them in the classroom. If you don't care
about your future and understand the school is a four to five-year investment
in the next 40 or 50 years of your life, how are you going to be disciplined
enough to do things right on the court. If you don't care about yourself, how
are you going to care about someone else, that comes with team play.  
On the court there has to be a no-nonsense approach, defensively, running the
court and especially defensive transition is going to be a huge force.
Colorado was 300 plus whatever in defense. It comes with taking good shots and
getting your butt back defensively, so no one gets behind you. So all these
kind of things is just a cultural change that needs to take place for us to
have a chance to be competitive.  
  
Q. How much do you use or how much does your NBA experience come up in
recruiting?  
JEFF BZDELIK: It's been huge. I can't talk about recruiting, specifically, but
we have several commitments right now. I don't have the household name
collegiately like other coaches that are going to be up here, but the one
advantage I do have is I've been to the NBA playoffs nine times as an
assistant and head coach. And there's a lot of players that I've been able to
coach and have a very positive relationship with and been very fortunate to be
around Hall of Famers, like Wes Unseld and Pat Riley, that I've worked under.
And I've learned a lot. And that's something that is a little bit unique when
I go into a home. And it's been very successful this far, and hopefully that
continues to be, because as we all know recruiting is very critical.  
PETER IRWIN: We wish you the best of luck. Have a great season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 17, 2007

  

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: At this time we'd like to welcome Coach Rick Barnes from Texas.
Coach, welcome. Coach says he's not going to make any comment, he's just going
straight to questions.  
  
Q. A while ago in the other interview room A.J. Abrams was asked the biggest
difference between this year and last year and he said that's easy, we're
going back to the Rick Barnes basketball style of old, tough defense and
rebounds. Could you elaborate? I see the smile on your face, you're happy, I
can tell.  
RICK BARNES: I thought you were going to say 6-9, a guy that bench presses 189
pounds. We haven't been a very good defensive team the last couple of years.
And rebound-wise, I think the numbers say we've been okay, but we haven't been
what we needed to be. We have to put the emphasis on being a better team and
rebounding team. This is the first year going in that we had 13 scholarship
players. But some of those numbers are down right now because of injuries. But
I do expect us to be a much better defensive team than we were a year ago.  
  
Q. It seems like now they're more focused on body fat and conditioning,
would that be true?  
RICK BARNES: No, actually our goal is to get Dexter under 300 pounds with his
equipment on, that's our goal. Really Dexter has changed his body totally.
He's a different person than he was. He's worked really hard and probably has
worked harder than anybody since he's been on our campus, how he's had to
really change his body. But he's having a slight injury right now in his foot
that set him back a little bit. He hasn't practiced with us yet. We do think
when we get him back out there he can make a difference for us.  
  
Q. As special as last year was with Kevin, how much different were things,
really, offensively and defensively, because now that he's gone you are going
back to whatever you were doing before him?  
RICK BARNES: Well, again, going into last year, we only had four players on
our spring roster. And we signed seven freshmen, and we knew we couldn't throw
a lot at him. We obviously knew that we had some talented players coming in.
We did put more emphasis on the offensive end probably than we had in the
past. And we did get better as the year went on defensively. But it wasn't
good enough. We realized that. At the end of the season we talked about that.
We went back and told our guys from the time that we finished last year and to
right now, we said if you're not going to play defense, you're not going to
rebound, you're not going to play.  
Our practices up to this point have been much more competitive. We've got some
guys that are going at it pretty well. And as long as they do that we'll find
a way to get it done.  
  
Q. How much credit should D.J. get for Durant's success last year?  
RICK BARNES: Kevin was the best in college basketball and he wasn't on our
team. D.J. had a phenomenal year, in terms of what he did, and what made it
more special, if you go back further, his family lost everything during the
hurricane in New Orleans. He was really disrupted his senior year. He put on
weight. And he spent all last summer trying to lose that weight, which he did.
He got tired at the end of the year and didn't particularly have the run
through the tournament that we all wanted and he was tired. But he had a lot
to do with everybody's success, as Kevin did.  
The thing that went unnoticed with all that was A.J. Abrams. A.J. as a
sophomore averaged the most points of any sophomore since we've been in Texas.
But he was caught in the middle of everyone talking about Kevin and obviously
D.J. but A.J. put together our most consistent year last year. When you get
good guard play, it makes everybody better. I think two of those guys had a
lot to do with our success last year.  
  
Q. You had four or five days to look at the freshmen, now, what do you see
so far?  
RICK BARNES: I like them because they're very competitive, very physical.
They're going to help in the areas we've talked about. Those guys are going to
help us be better defensively. They're going to help us rebound better. I like
the fact that they -- these first couple of days here Alexis, he's going to go
at it really, really hard. And Gary Johnson has done a great job. Clint
Chapman is the typical freshman, as the year goes on and he develops
physically, those other two guys are developed physically, so the physical
doesn't affect them at all.  
Clint is doing something he's never done, as hard as we're going right now,
but those three guys are going to help us up front.  
  
Q. As you enter the post-Durant era, you're still picked No. 2 in the Big
12. Can you talk about that? Is that a fair assessment of the talent at this
point in Texas, and your overview of the Big 12 Conference this year?  
RICK BARNES: I would assume the same people that are picking us No. 2 are the
same people that picked the football poll this year, and that's not very
smart. I don't know. I know that -- I guess it's a compliment to our program.
I don't pay a whole lot of attention to it. I don't think our players do.  
Consistency is what you strive for. And I think over the last ten years we've
done a pretty good job of being consistent, but we still want to be the one
there at the end of the year. And the last one standing. We haven't done that
yet. All the preseason recognition is good, but as you know, it doesn't mean a
whole lot.  
  
Q. Eight of the 12 head coaches in the league are either first year or
second year. Is that a commentary on the profession or coincidence, what are
your thoughts on that?  
RICK BARNES: I don't know. I can't tell you exactly. I think the business
we're in, you've got to be good. I've told people all along I think you can
only be as good as your administration. I think I've got the best situation in
the country because I think I've got the best Athletic Director in DeLoss
Dodds, and I was asked earlier in the interview about the growth we made. The
growth can't be made without the administration. And I think I obviously said
that I've got one of the best jobs in the country, and it's made that way by
the commitment that's made by the University and our Athletic Director. You
look around, I can't tell you, because I'm not at those places where changes
are made, and I can't tell you exactly what goes on there unless you're living
it there every day. I don't know that you -- or you shouldn't, in my
situation, have an opinion on it.  
  
Q. You have said you'd like to move Damion James more out to the perimeter
this year, how is that coming along?  
RICK BARNES: Well, it goes back, I mentioned we've had a full allotment of
scholarships, but because of injuries there are some guys that haven't
practiced yet, we haven't been able to do that. We'd like to be able to be as
versatile as we can with our team. Damion I think can do that. Really all
we've asked Damion to do is -- the word we've used with him is consistency. A
year ago he played really well, we seemed to play our best basketball, and
Damion is a guy that if he will just bring it every night we'll be okay. I
don't think what we're doing is real complicated, so I think when we get
everybody back and we decide to go with a bigger lineup, and players will
decide that.  
To be honest with you, Justin Mason is probably the reason he won't get a
chance to do a lot. A year ago we went into the year thinking that we were
going to play Kevin at the 3 spot or the small forward. And Justin, through
his work ethic and his intensity, just wouldn't allow that. And we went into
the offseason, me saying that. We'd like to get bigger. But without question,
Justin Mason is our most improved player. It goes back to what I tell our guys
all the time, players will decide how we're going to play. And what I've seen
to this point, we'll end up playing D.J., A.J. and Justin as our guys. We'll
probably play 28 to 36 minutes a game, somewhere in there.  
  
Q. Kim Mulkey talked yesterday about how elevated the women's program in
Baylor, when one of the teams won in National Championship. I can't imagine
why the men's teams need more credibility. Do you think that's something that
has been lacking, the Big 12 needs to win a National Championship.  
RICK BARNES: It's hard to win National Championships, as we know. It's going
to happen. There's too many teams in our league that have gotten close enough
to be there. I do think it will happen. In terms of credibility, I'm sure it
does add credibility to the league. Now, does it help everybody else recruit?
I don't know. What does that exactly entail? But the fact is it's not going to
hurt. But I do think we will win a National Championship. But I think every
year we're going to put enough teams in position that eventually we will. Luck
is a little bit part of it, but we've had, again, in the ten years that I've
been here we have had teams that certainly could have done it, but for some
reason it didn't work out.  
  
Q. Obviously Gary Johnson has come back to practice and had a chance to work
out. How does he look so far and do you hope that he's got any chance or do
you think he's going to be able to help you out pretty soon this season?  
RICK BARNES: He has been cleared to play, I mean practice, he's been cleared
to practice. A date in terms of when he's going to play hasn't been
determined. He's a difference maker, there's no doubt. I think that if Gary
were -- if today he was cleared to play I think Gary would probably have as
good a chance as anybody to be on our starting team. He's a guy that can -- he
can make a difference. When you watch his practice, if you left the gym you
would say, yeah, he's a difference maker.  
  
Q. You talked about improved defense and rebounding is a must, and you've
talked about the three guards playing a lot of minutes. Does that make it more
difficult being small, trying to become a better defensive team and a better
rebounding team?  
RICK BARNES: No, because I think toughness has something to do with it there.
I think that the guards have to come down in rebounding, especially the way we
want to run the basketball. Obviously you would like to be as big and as tall
as you could be, but if you don't have it I think that you can still go about
rebounding differently. You do get concerned a little bit about small guards,
as the ball gets closer to the basket. But yet we're the kind of defensive
team we want to be, helping each other, we ought to be able to overcome that,
too. We're hoping to get probably more help than we had a year ago, we think
our interior defense could be even better, last year it wasn't very good. We
had to really, really help each other down there. But as I said, it got
better.  
But right now the one thing that we've done every day is work on post defense.
That's where I think we'll hopefully see a big improvement.  
  
Q. With the success of Kevin Durant last year, do you think there could be
unfair expectations for freshmen throughout the conference this season?  
RICK BARNES: If anybody compares people with Kevin, that's a mistake, because
I'm not big into comparing players. A year ago I remember coming to this that
I told people if you didn't look at Kevin Durant as a freshman, I thought he'd
be the best player in college basketball. Guys like that don't come along very
often. I could talk forever about him and what he did. He's the most improved
player we've ever coached in a three-month period. I think expectations are --
again, I don't know if anybody is comparing anybody to Kevin right now, but if
they are it's not fair.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the nature of college basketball and how one player or
one recruiting class can so redefine the perception of a program?  
RICK BARNES: Well, I go back to a year ago. We were down to four players in
our program. A.J. Abrams being the guy that played the most minutes, and he
had averaged I think right around 20 minutes as a game as a freshman and we
had Connor Atchley, J.D. Lewis and Craig Winder, that was our team in the
spring. We came in with seven new players, and we ended up winning 25 games
last year and it caused the impact -- because of the impact of the freshman
class. Not to underestimate what A.J. and Connor did for us, and even Craig
Winder at the end of the year got it figured out and helped us down the
stretch. But, yeah, it can happen.  
And then I think the real key is, can you sustain the consistency of it. We've
had a tough time. I feel like we finally have our program, I guess the word I
would use, stabilized, now, when you get down to four players in the spring
and your recruiting class of seven guys, really thinking that maybe two of
those guys could leave after a year, which we did lose one, but we lost three
the year before early to the NBA, but it doesn't stop you from recruiting,
because you realize what you're just saying, they can make a difference in one
year. It goes back to chasing, trying to get the big trophy, and it's because
it's so hard you do everything you can every year to give yourself the best
team you can put together, so maybe give you a chance to win it all. Kevin
certainly carried us many times. If he were there without D.J., I don't know
where we would have been. One or two guys make a huge difference.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 17, 2007

  

### [Mike Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15828)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by Coach Mike Anderson, from Missouri.  
MIKE ANDERSON: Well, it seems like it was yesterday when we were at Oklahoma
City and it was I guess my first opportunity to be before you. So now here we
are. Like I said back then, we're a work-in-progress. But I'm excited about
this year, going into year two. Why? I think having an opportunity to get a
bit more familiar with my basketball team, and they get familiar in terms of
what I'm wanting to do. I think now we get to year two and I think it gives us
footing to get started in the right direction.  
So I'm excited. We have a lot of guys returning. That's good, and bad, because
the same guys from last year, but at the same time hopefully they have become
better basketball players. When they become better basketball players we can
make our basketball team a lot better. We definitely are going to be an
improved basketball team with the schedule that we have. It's a very, very
exciting schedule. At the same time a very, very challenging schedule. But we
are excited. We're working extremely hard. We have a couple of guys that have
been bumped up and banged up a little bit. But as a whole I think our guys are
working extremely hard.  
  
Q. Do you think your transition will be a little easier the second year in
the conference than it was last year?  
MIKE ANDERSON: That's the thing, with non-conference schedule. It's a great
question, because with non-conference schedule it's going to get us a little
more ready. Last year we weren't as prepared because when you get into the --
I call it the famine -- the intensity goes to another level. We started off
0-4. I thought we had it going there, once you get that deer in the headlights
out of the eyes. But I thought as the season progressed we got a little
better. We will build on that. So hopefully this non-conference schedule will
get us prepared for Big 12 play. I think one of the things I learned coming in
that on any given night you've got to be prepared to play, no matter where you
go, whether it be at home or on the road. And I think that's the urgency our
guys have to play with from I think day one with this schedule.  
  
Q. Talk about the transition DeMarre Carroll has in the program?  
MIKE ANDERSON: I think DeMarre is a guy that transferred from Vanderbilt, he's
played at that level and I think sitting out a year has created a hunger in
him. I think he's going to be hopefully to this basketball team, I think an
aggressive nature. I thought one of the things we didn't do well, we didn't --
our initial defense was pretty good, but I didn't think the second line, I
think he gives it, he's quick on the floor. And maybe his presence can trigger
some other guys, such as Marshall Brown, Leo Lyons, Darryl Butterfield. And
not only that our guards, it can get contagious, when you talk about
aggressiveness. The way we play you've got to have aggressive players.  
  
Q. You talked about some of your starters and mentioned a few names. Talk if
you would a little bit about the depth of the team and some of the key guys
that are coming offer the bench?  
MIKE ANDERSON: I think that's going to be important to our basketball team, is
the depth. Hopefully we have much quality depth, when you talk about this
basketball team. I talked about a guy like Kalen, we had an unfortunate
incidence that took place this summer. And Kalen Grimes is no longer on our
basketball team. So now it could be a problem, but at the same time I look at
it as an opportunity for some guys to really step up and emerge. Vaidatos
Volkus has been the guy sitting in the wings waiting to get an opportunity.
What does he bring to the table? That remains to be seen. A guy like Leo
Lyons, now he goes from being a guy that was coming off the bench, sort of our
6th man, now he's in a different role, how does he respond to that. Those are
a lot of question marks about our basketball team.  
DeMarre Carroll, what kind of impact does he bring? You've got to remember
he's just coming in. I'm sure there's going to be some rust there. But what do
they bring to our basketball team. Justin Safford, a freshman, he's going to
be going into the fire. He doesn't know it, but he is. What does he bring to
the table? I think those are a lot of things that we look for in our
basketball team.  
Marshall Brown, I'm expecting more things out of Marshall Brown. This is his
senior year, and I think the sense of urgency has to come on him. He's been
playing in the Big 12 three years. So hopefully it can be a situation that he
can get consistent and have one of those years where he can break out.  
  
Q. Kim Mulkey talked yesterday about how it elevated the Big 12 when you win
a National Championship, which is something the men haven't done yet. Do you
think that the Big 12 needs to win a National Championship to gain any final
measure of respect in the eyes of anyone?  
MIKE ANDERSON: I tell you, I think you look at the teams and coaches, I think
it's going to happen. It's going to happen probably sooner than you think
sometimes. But I think nationally, I think the Big 12 is respected, it's a
very good league. I think with the influx of new coaches in the league, new
styles. You're going to have enough teams, and you get teams in the
tournament, it's going to happen. It's going to happen real soon. You look at
a team like Kansas this year. Last year they were creeping towards that
direction. They have most of those guys back. There's a team that when you get
to tournament play, and I can tell you that, you have got to have some things
fall your way. You've got to be good, No. 1, to be there. But at the same time
you have to have some luck to fall your way, as well. Things just got to fall
right. But you never will get there if you're not in it. I think that's going
to be the key, hopefully, get more teams in it, that helps your chances.  
  
Q. Bill Self said he thought you guys might be a surprise team to watch out.
Do you feel you can sneak up on a couple of people?  
MIKE ANDERSON: I don't know about sneaking, I think we're going to be a team
that hopefully improves and gets better each and every day. I thought our
guys, for the most part, in every game they were in the games. We didn't do a
good job of finishing it, but hopefully we learn from that.  
Experience, to me, is your greatest teacher. I think going through that year
with this basketball team, it taught me a lot of things, and I'm sure as well
as our basketball team. So now they have an idea in terms of when you talk
about up-tempo basketball, when you're talking about the pressing, when you're
talking about trusting one another, they have an idea about what I want to do.
And so to be honest with you, we're going faster this year. I want to take the
tempo up another level. And hopefully that's going to be a sign of our guys
picking up on the things we want to do.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what you learned from your experience last year
between this league and the prior league that you came from?  
BILL SELF: Well, I think No. 1 is, top to bottom, every night you've got to be
able to go in and you've got to perform. I think all the teams, they have very
good players. When you look at a team like Baylor, Baylor is a very, very
talented team. We played them I think two games right there going down the
stretch. And you can see from one game to the next game, they're a very good
basketball team. Any team in this league -- Oklahoma, we had to fight tooth
and nail against the Oklahoma team. It doesn't matter where you go or who you
play, you've got to bring it each and every night. In Conference-USA it was in
transition last year. The first couple of years I got there it was probably
one of the -- I think one of the up and coming -- it was the league, when you
talk about Cincinnati, Louisville, Marquette, DePaul. And of course last year
it was in transition. So it's quite a difference when you talk about my last
year in Conference-USA versus the Big 12. And also you have a guy in this
league last year named Kevin Durant. Thank goodness he's gone.  
PETER IRWIN: Best of luck to you. Have a great season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 16, 2007

  

### [Connie Yori](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13896)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're ready to start with Coach Connie Yori from Nebraska.
Welcome, Coach. If you'd like to make an opening comment or two and then we'll
take questions.  
CONNIE YORI: Well, sure. Again, just like all coaches we come up here on
October 16th and we're all excited about what we're doing and excited about
our teams. And I'm right there with the rest of them. I'm very excited about
this basketball team. I think we're really different. We're very different
than what we've been. Different doesn't mean better, necessarily, different
doesn't mean worse, we're just different. I really like our team. I like our
character. I like our work habits. I like our intensity. I like our chemistry.
The only thing we're lacking, which is pretty obvious, is that we're lacking
experience.  
We return just one player who's ever started a game. We have one senior in our
program. We have one returning junior, we're extremely inexperienced. We
haven't been through the wars of the Big 12 yet and the battles of some of the
non-conference opponents we're going to see. But at the same time I like this
team because I think we're talented and we work hard. They always say there's
no substitute for experience, but we're going to have to find a substitute.
We're going to have to work harder than other teams, we're going to have to
have chemistry.  
  
Q. You're in your 6th season now at Nebraska. Do you see this being the
toughest in the Big 12 as far as balance?  
CONNIE YORI: Every year is tough. It's incredible. This is the top league in
terms of coaching in the nation for women's basketball. It's not getting any
easier with the additions that we've had this year. I think more and more
programs are committed to our great sport and women's basketball and therefore
there's extraordinary balance. You can go through, and I think last year is a
great example of K State, K State finished near the bottom of our league. And
they almost won the WNIT. I don't think there's any league in the country who
can put forth the depth of great teams that we can. I think this year is no
different.  
  
Q. There's a lot of turmoil in the administration, what effect do you think
this might have on your performance?  
CONNIE YORI: Turmoil? You're talking about what happened yesterday? I thought
you were talking about the weather. We don't think there's going to be any
impact on the program. Our focus is to continue to move this program forward.
That's our focus, that's our staff's focus. We expect that to happen. We're
going to continue to practice. We're going to continue to work hard in the
area of recruiting. This is a tumultuous profession. We know that, but if you
get distracted by everything that's going around you, I think you're taking
the wrong course. So we're going to stay true to the course.  
  
Q. You've only got one player who started a game before. I assume there is a
point in the previous season at which you and your staff realize that's
probably going to be the case in the following season. Tell me about the
conversation about that. Do you ever discuss maybe we ought to give some of
these guys a little bit more experience, if for no other reason than for the
sake of next year?  
CONNIE YORI: Well, we do have experience. We do have some kids in our program
that have experience, they just haven't been to the starting lineup. We were
in a cycle in our program where we had a big freshman class and a big
sophomore class. Our freshmen got experience last year, but not from a
starting position.  
  
Q. Tell me a little bit about how those can be adjusted over time or is that
something you just have to learn to deal with, because we've got a similar
situation, I'm in Columbia now where they have one senior on the entire team
and they brought her off of the volleyball team. I wonder if the temptation is
there to maybe hold off a scholarship or two in one year to make sure you
don't have a year where there's just nobody at the top or no freshmen?  
CONNIE YORI: I think it depends on where you are in your program, sir.
Danielle's class, we took the program over five years ago. Really Danielle's
class was our first recruiting class and I signed some junior college kids
that year. We had played with five scholarship players the last year. We
weren't worried about scholarship numbers, we had plenty of scholarships to
give, but there weren't too many that wanted to come when we finished last in
the Big 12. Thank goodness Danielle Page was one of them.  
  
Q. From a competitive perspective how much difference is there between A &M
and OU from the rest of the conference?   
CONNIE YORI: That's a very good question. I guess we're going to find out as
we get going. Obviously A&M, the number of not only the number of starters
they returned and the amount of experience they returned but also the quality
of experience that they returned I think sets them apart because of that. But
Oklahoma and the players they returned, and they've got a pretty good player
in the program, I think you guys have heard about her, Courtney Paris, I
believe. So obviously those two teams are programs that we are all working
towards catching. But at the same time I think there's going to be great
battles in our league, night in and night out. And we think that we can
compete and we think that -- obviously Baylor has been in that mix. We got
Baylor in our home court, and we played great basketball against Oklahoma on
our home court. There's a lot of programs here that are going to put forth
great efforts to play those teams.  
  
Q. Some openings popped up in schools in the region. I expected Coach
Ethridge's name to come up on the short list. Can you talk a little bit about
her contributions to the program because that's got to be -- as far as
assistant coaches that's somebody that has one of the longest tenures?  
CONNIE YORI: Kamie has been part of that program and been with them long and
they've put some great teams on the floor. I do think her name has been
mentioned. She's been in the mix in some positions, from what I understand.
And I'm probably the last one to ask about rumors, because I never know what's
going on. But I think Kamie, from what everyone says, she's a very disciplined
coach who is a great recruiter, and who also obviously as a former player, the
level that she played at, brings something from that standpoint, as well.  
  
Q. You mentioned the strength of the coaching in the Big 12. What is it that
you think makes it such a destination?  
CONNIE YORI: I think Dru Hancock has everything to do with it. Our league is
just -- it's obviously a nationally recognized league. What this league has
done the last 10 or 11 years here, in terms of the attendance and the focus in
the communities, in the Big 12 communities, I think the fact that for the most
part our communities are smaller communities in the Big 12. I think there's --
it's a rallying point for the -- athletics is a rallying point for those
communities. I think anytime that you can go to a college type of town, I
think it's great from a coaching standpoint because you're going to get
support. You're probably going to have attendance and draw better. It's just
-- I think it's really interesting where our coaches have come from. And it's
obviously that -- I think there's a lot of coaches who like the challenge of
coming to the Big 12. We've had coaches that have left the SEC and the Big
East and the Big Ten and so on and so forth.  
  
Q. Coach Fennelly said he noticed changes in his profession, and one of them
being that money is a bigger factor now in women's basketball than it used to
be, the need to produce revenue and bring in money which of course translates
to more pressure to win. He said women's basketball used to be immune from
that, is the word he used. Have you noticed that?  
CONNIE YORI: I think all of us have noticed that, particularly in our league.
The question asked before, and as I continue really to respond to the earlier
question, obviously greater attendance, greater focus on women's basketball in
a given community, therefore there is more emphasis placed on that sport. And
with that being said, salaries are higher, and AD's are wanting to go out and
hire outstanding coaches, which across the board we have. And the combination
of --  
I think the Big 12, the communities that we are in in the Big 12 promotes
community interest and therefore we draw better. And therefore the emphasis is
greater in our programs and therefore there is more of a pressure to do well.
And therefore the AD's want to go out and hire great coaches. And I think it's
definitely a snowball effect.  
PETER IRWIN: They've let you off easy this afternoon.  
CONNIE YORI: I like it, let's go back to Lincoln.  
PETER IRWIN: Wish you luck. Thanks a lot.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 16, 2007

  

### [Cindy Stein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14283)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: Coach Cindy Stein from Missouri, is up here with us. We'll let
her make a couple of opening comments.  
CINDY STEIN: Well, I think the first comment is I am so happy to be back in
Kansas City. I love the fact that the tournament is here. Our team is really
pumped up about that. We have a lot of players from around this area. And I'll
tell you what, our team is really excited about this year, regardless of what
everybody thinks we're going to do. This is a great young team that is not
going to use youth as an excuse. They're very energetic, they want to do
things the right way. We're doing a lot of teaching. But it's something that
as a coach, that's why you coach, is working and developing with kids and
we're getting a great opportunity to kind of go back to the really sound,
basic fundamentals. We're excited about it. Our kids are really responding
well. So we're very excited.  
We do have five of our 11 young ladies that are new to college basketball. We
have one senior, and we stole her from volleyball. She's a 5th year senior,
done with her volleyball eligibility. I saw a tall young lady serving food
during a football game. And I saw it was [] Nicole Wilson. I asked her if she
had any eligibility left and that's the start of the story. And we got her to
our practice as soon as we could. Now [] Mike olden is mad at me, because he
liked having her around, because she's a great young lady. I'm excited about
her.  
Obviously the four freshmen, very talented. We have four sophomores, and then
two juniors. So it's going to be interesting. You may see a different look.
And you may want to keep your hands up when you're on press row.  
  
Q. You talked about teaching, there's a new staff in there and I wonder what
role they're going to play. Also the role in teaching the other players that
Alyssa has?  
CINDY STEIN: We do have two new staff members and Lynnette Robinson, who's our
associate head coach, who comes from the University of Michigan, also had been
at Missouri State when they went to two Final Fours. She's also a former
teammate of mine at Illinois. So it's someone that I trust extremely well and
someone that brings a lot of knowledge, a lot of experience in recruiting,
just a very good defensive-minded coach, which obviously those of you who have
been around our program enough know that we emphasize defense a bit. And we
hired Allison Guth, who brings in an amazing amount of energy. And also some
great recruiting tools in personality. That's something that complements our
staff. We know with youth you have to keep their attitude up and their energy
high, and kind of play with that exuberant style and energy and
relentlessness, and I feel like I have that in our staff. I think they have
great knowledge. They're very good recruiters, and recruiting is the name of
the game. But they also bring great basketball knowledge, and the teaching
ability, and the communication skills that you have to have with today's
teams.  
  
Q. Talk about the improvement in Amanda?  
CINDY STEIN: Amanda Hanneman, I love her to death. She has a stress fracture,
and she's out a couple more weeks. We need Amanda on the court, if we had her
on the court right now, practices would even be better, just because she
provides so much for us. She's one of those people that is always going to
have a floor burn, because she's always diving after the ball, she's a
tremendous scorer, did a lot this summer, that probably put her in a situation
where she did get that stress fracture. But she's one of those people that are
always going, going, going. I think people saw her improve last year towards
the end of the season, and the key for us is keeping her healthy, but she's
someone that for us to be the way we want to be, and very good, is the fact
that we're going to need Amanda Hanneman on the court.  
  
Q. What was your immediate reaction when you learned of the coaches
preseason pick for Missouri?  
CINDY STEIN: You know, that's a great question. I'm not sure it's one that I
can honestly answer. I would say that last year, I used to have a really bad
swearing habit. And so my players tease me now because I say like jiminy, holy
smokes, geez, and just to keep myself from saying something else. And none of
those words came out of my mouth. I probably reverted back a little bit. But I
had to gather myself, because I understand why, but I don't like it. I think
that -- I've never believed in these preseason polls. I don't think you should
ever short change any teams, because I think that every night is a tough
night. So that's my belief, and maybe people think that I'm sour grapes
because we got picked 12th this year, but those people that know me know that
I would say if I would say that if I was picked 5th on. I want to be the No. 1
pick, and that's what we're striving for.  
  
Q. How do you think the leaders will take that ranking? Do you think you're
going to use it as a chip on your shoulder for motivation or do you think it
really doesn't matter?  
CINDY STEIN: I don't think it matters at this point. I know they don't like
it. And really the only thing that ranking does, it helps other schools use it
against us in recruiting. That's what that ranking does. That's the only thing
that ranking does for us. Now our job, obviously, is we've already done an
outstanding job of recruiting, so we feel good about that. The players mind
frame is more of let's just get better day-to-day and see where we can go.
We're still going to go out and try to win every game. That hasn't changed,
because of the type of attitudes and personalities we have on our team. We
don't want to feel sorry for ourselves and we don't want to make excuses, and
we have already kind of instructed them, that's how we need to be. Once they
start being able to use an excuse that's where you accept losing and we'll
never accept losing.  
  
Q. You could take concern with the lack of experience, at the same time
you're going to come back in a year or two with a whole bunch of seniors with
a great deal of experience because they're going to get to play in a season
like this, where there's not seniors in front of us. Do you look at that as an
opportunity -- I know you're going to be focused on this season, but doesn't
that also present an opportunity that gals are really going to have a lot of
experience?  
CINDY STEIN: I think our future is extremely bright. Our last few recruiting
classes have been outstanding, and have been ranked nationally. And that's
helped with the opening of the Mizzou Arena, and something we're extremely
proud of. We feel that that's going to really ignite us into some great
things. The Mizzou Arena, we can recruit a different level athlete. Not that
we didn't have good players before, but it gets you in a lot more homes.  
  
Q. One of the issues for you guys this year might be height. How do you plan
on dealing with the fact you guys don't really have that many players over six
foot and one of your tallest players is in fact a volleyball player?  
CINDY STEIN: That's another great question. I'm glad you're doing your
homework. That's why you guys are No. 1 in journalism in the country,
University of Missouri. I would say that the key for us, because of the lack
of height is I guess we can't let them cross half court (laughter). I think
that our defense is going to have to be something special.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you very much. We wish you the best of luck. Have a great
season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 16, 2007

  

### [Deb Patterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14194)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: At this time we'd like to welcome Coach Deb Patterson to the
podium. Coach, welcome. If you'd like to make an opening comment we'll take
questions after that.  
DEB PATTERSON: We're very excited about the opening of the Big 12 season and
feel as though we have a team that has a great opportunity to move up the Big
12 standings significantly this season. I'm excited about the newcomers we
have in the program. I'm excited about the return of Marlies Gipson and feel
that with Ashley Sweat we have a young lady that finished the season playing
as well as any freshman in the Big 12, and we have Shalee Lehning, the premier
point guard in the Big 12 and one of the best in the nation.  
I think with that as a foundation we'll go into this great league with a great
deal of anticipation and optimism and understanding that the top of this
league with Texas A&M and Oklahoma, Texas in particular, is just, I think, is
as good a top portion of the league as anyone will find in the country. And if
you work your way down, 1 through 12, you'll find that we can compare and
compete with any conference in this country, from top to bottom as we head
into this season.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Marlies returning? And kind of a two-part
question, but last year without her, how much different were you when she was
with the team?  
DEB PATTERSON: Well, Marlies was released August 18th, so she's got a good two
months of working her way back into both the physical and mental aspects of
competing well on the floor again. She looks great at this point in time, at
the beginning of the practices that we've had. It's sort of something that at
this stage, as you watch her practice, you feel is truly in history, so to
speak, it's completely behind. I think it's obvious, if you just look at
record alone, 14 and 2, before Marlies went down, and the struggles we had
during the course of conference play, finding the way to get a victory, the
impact that losing her had on our basketball team. I don't think it was solely
the loss of just the production she brings to the floor, I think it was just
the change in dynamic of how we looked to play, getting the chemistry where we
wanted it on the floor, night in and night out, taking a little bit of
pressure off our perimeter players at the time, because we didn't have that
great catch-and-pass shooter on Shana Wheeler, as Ashley Sweat as a freshman
is learning to play in the post, so I think it was just sort of a ripple
effect in a lot of aspects of our game.  
But it was very exciting for us to see our team come together down the stretch
at the WNIT tournament, once we finally did figure out what our roles were and
our strengths. So I think we finished well, and I look forward to us starting
with that same kind of energy and confidence.  
  
Q. Would you be concerned or disappointed if your season ended at WNIT this
year?  
DEB PATTERSON: It's hard to say at this point. Obviously going into the
season, I think every team in this league has the goal and aspiration of
becoming an NCAA team. I don't think any of the players or coaches that
compete in this team set a standard any lower than working to qualify for the
NCAA tournament. But I think we also understand and respect the fact that this
is a great league, it is a very challenging venture to qualify for an NCAA
tournament bid in today's game. So I don't know that the word would be
disappointment if we didn't make it. It's hard to say at this point. I think
what we're more focused on is playing our very best basketball night in and
night out. Certainly we aspire to be an NCAA tournament team. With those two
games in front of us we'll go after it and see where it takes us.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Ashley, the fact that she was a freshman
and how well she developed, particularly at the end of the season and what is
she looking at right now?  
DEB PATTERSON: Ashley made incredible progress through the course of the year.
She went from a player that wasn't necessarily very mentally or physically
strong, as she began early season practices and actually began early season
competition to one that really embraced the challenges that big time
basketball brings to the floor. She was thrown into the fire, so to speak,
once we lost Marlies. She answered the challenge. She continued to get better.
She worked hard every day in practice, particularly once we hit that late
stretch of January and February. I thought that that was a real period of
discovery for her.  
Ashley figured out she could be physical, she could stand in there and take
the heat and take the beating that sometimes low block players have to endure.
Her versatility became something they grew in with respect to gaining a
comfort level. We all know she can stretch defenses. She's got the ability to
shoot the 3. Whereas she might prefer at times to play a finesse game, she was
willing to play the power game for the basketball team. I think she evolved
into someone that was very selfless, very dynamic in her versatility, and very
strong minded down the stretch in the Big 12 play in a season where we weren't
getting wins. And that's even tougher. It's tougher to go do something you're
not comfortable with when you're not getting praise for winning basketball
games, so to speak.  
I really bring a great appreciation for the progress she made over the course
of the season and I look forward to her building off of that.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about Shalee now as a junior, I know there
was pressure for her as a freshman as a point guard? How has she progressed
and how much more would you expect out of her as a junior?  
DEB PATTERSON: I think Shalee Lehning's numbers speak for themselves after two
years in the league. The numbers she's posted in Big 12 play and overall have
been nothing short of phenomenal, in my opinion, for a young player competing
on a very young team. And I look forward to having the opportunity to watch
her play on a team like the one we'll bring to the floor this year that is a
little more seasoned. Marlies, Shana, having significant basketball
experiences under their belt, Kimberly Dietz is a senior on the floor, Ashley
Sweat, who has a confidence level about herself as she competes. I think from
the get-go she established as a great leader, and performed in every
environment at home and on the road, so I see nothing but even better days
ahead for our basketball team because of what she brings to our league and for
herself personally. I just will continue to say she's not just one of the best
in the league, but I think one of the best in the country.  
  
Q. How important was it to have the post element with Stanley and what do
you look for from her this year?  
DEB PATTERSON: Well, I think last year we learned how significant that depth
in the post could be to a basketball team like ours, because of the struggles
that we faced. Interestingly enough I think when we lost Marlies Gipson really
where we felt the biggest impact was on the perimeter. It changed the game for
them. It changed a lot of our assist numbers across the board. And so having
some depth there, going into the season with Stanley who is willing to be
physical, although she's very, very young, with Ashley Sweat, with Shana
Wheeler and Marlies Gipson, I don't know that we had four post players that
could take the floor and make a significant contribution over the course of
their minutes, and so that's exciting for us to think about. I think, again,
not just because of the production posts bring, but because of how it changes
the game for your perimeters, it puts less pressure on making every open shot,
which is something we struggled a great deal with on the perimeter. So for the
way we like to play a lot of ball movement, a lot of in and out scoring, a lot
of balance, having that depth in the post, if someone does get nicked or isn't
having a particularly strong game is going to be something very special.  
  
Q. If you were to read into why the coaches placed your team in the
preseason poll, is it because of some of the questions that remain unanswered
going into the season?  
DEB PATTERSON: I think this is a great league, and when every coach sits and
is beginning to formulate that ballot it is very, very tough to make a lot of
distinctions between a lot of the programs in this league. I think certainly
we all understand that Oklahoma and Texas A&M, with the talent that they're
returning and the players that they've signed are really solid front runners,
but after that I think, as you head down the standings from 6th to 12th, it is
legitimately anybody's best guess who is going to rise up, who is going to win
games at home, who is going to sneak a few on the road. I don't know there's a
great deal of distinction until the season plays out. So I feel as though when
I look at the preseason picks, I can look at Colorado, I can look at Kansas
State, I can look at Nebraska and Iowa State and your guess is as good as
mine, where everyone will finish. And it's just that kind of a league. I think
that's part of what makes us a great league. I think it's the same situation
to Kansas, Kansas and Kansas State, tied for 11th and 12th place in the league
last year, and so to think that you're now being picked 8th, that's a
reasonable selection as far as I'm concerned and we'll toss it up and see
where we finish.  
  
Q. You mentioned about the post play, do you feel in some sense, I'm not
saying that the last two years you didn't have that, but in some sense that
could be a major difference maker for this team this season is the fact that
you have Stanley, and obviously Ashley has a year under her belt and so forth
that that in a lot of ways could maybe push you across the line a little bit
more?  
DEB PATTERSON: Well, I'm definitely thrilled about the fact that I feel we do
have some quality depth in the post. And I think it has the potential to make
a huge difference for our basketball team, for all of the reasons I previously
stated. I think, again, one of the realities that I think we have lived with
at Kansas State is the fact that because of lack of depth at times we've had
to be pretty perfect on any given possession. We might not have had the
rebounding presence we needed. We put a lot more pressure on our perimeter
players to make every three ball that they put up there in order for us to
have success. And good, solid post play makes the game significantly easier in
every respect, defensively and offensively. So I'm very much looking forward
to the impact our post will have.  
I think when you have one of the nation's best pointguards it puts you in a
position now where not just will assist numbers continue to rise beyond the
high level that they're at, but I think you'll be able to see one of the best
pointguards in the country recognized as such because we will win basketball
games. And that will always be because we compete hard and well as a team and
bring depth. But I think it's an exceptional -- just an exceptional,
optimistic attitude we're bringing to the floor this year because of the depth
we do have in the post and because of the great perimeters we think we're
bringing to compete.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach, and best of luck to you and the team this
season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 16, 2007

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: Coach Kim Mulkey from Baylor University is here. Coach, welcome
and if you'd like to make a couple of opening comments.  
KIM MULKEY: I'm glad to be back. Last time we were here we won a national
championship, so Kansas City has been good to us.  
  
Q. Can you sort of talk about at the end of last year you said, and your
kids said, it's painful a loss as you guys have been there. How much do you
think they learned from that and are carrying that a little bit in a good way
over to this year?  
KIM MULKEY: I hope they've carried a lot of it. I think when you end the
season, you have the basketball in your hands, the score is tied and you don't
win the basketball game, you feel that you let one slip away. And I said then,
and I'll say it again today, that locker room was as devastated a locker as it
was the year we lost to Tennessee on the controversial call. And hopefully the
players that were in there will never forget that and they'll have that memory
in the back of their head and fight through the tough times, because there are
going to be tough times for us. And hopefully they'll be able to say I don't
want to ever feel like that again.  
  
Q. Coach Fennelly was telling us this morning he thinks that women's
basketball used to be immune from things like the need to bring in revenue,
which increased the pressure, which increased the likelihood that coaches will
get fired. He sees that as changing, and they are no longer immune from the
pressures. Do you see the same thing?  
KIM MULKEY: No, when you you're in this profession, you're judged by wins and
losses. And regardless of your salary, the stress and pressures of trying to
win ballgames is there. I understand his comment about there's more money
being put into women's programs across the country, but I've never felt that
my salary makes me feel any more pressure or anything like that. I felt
pressure the day I was hired at Baylor. I felt pressure when I was at
Louisiana Tech. If you're a competitor, you feel that pressure. It's self-
imposed, it's not something from somebody else. The pressure to win is
enormous, but it's also rewarding. If you're not tough minded and thick
skinned you don't need to be in this profession.  
  
Q. You have four games preseason in a row against teams that won tournaments
last year. Can you talk about your philosophy in scheduling the non-conference
tournaments?  
KIM MULKEY: I fired the coach that did that. I got rid of him quickly -- no.
This is the beginning of my third year at Baylor. We took over a program that
had only won 7 games the previous year. The thing you need to change quickly
is the mindset of losing. Losing is contagious, just as winning is. We
scheduled a lot of non-conference games that would allow us to build a program
and start thinking on a positive note and those players started believing in
themselves and thinking they were better than they were. Once you started
doing that I told the fans when we're at a program where we have established
an identity, a reputation that's positive and losing won't devastate you, then
you can play tougher opponents. And that's what we've done.  
I think if you look at our non-conference schedule this year, I don't know how
many of those we'll win against those top teams, but we're now at a point
where our program is not going to be devastated by the loss should we lose.  
  
Q. There's a big rivalry, Baylor and Oklahoma, can you talk about that and
also about the impact of Courtney Paris on this league?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I think there are a lot of big rivalries. You have to
remember we're in Texas, it's a big rivalry with Texas and A&M, I don't look
at OU any different. Courtney Paris, what can I say that hasn't been said? I
can't think of another adjective that would describe her that hasn't been
written, talked about or said. And she's just -- I guess the best thing I ever
said was she literally is the Shaquille O'Neal of our league in women's
basketball in the most complimentary of ways, you can't stop them. All you can
hope for is that the rest of them around her have off nights.  
  
Q. If you look at coaches in the south, Gary, Gail, Kristy, you, Sharon, all
have been to the Final Four. You won a national championship. Just talk about
those kind of match-ups with coaches who really have reached the peak of their
profession?  
KIM MULKEY: I'm young, but I've been around the game probably as long or
longer than a lot of people. I've been doing this at the top level at
Louisiana Tech and with Pat Summitt and the Olympics, and you watch and you
learn. As you become a head coach you emulate some of the people that you
observe. I can think of two or three leagues across the country that as you do
scouting reports and you watch their teams play, you pick up coaching ideas
and little tips along the way. And so to think that I get to coach against
those types of coaches that you talked about only makes me a better coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your depth? You only have ten players this year, and
is that a concern?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, your concern is injuries. I remember Coach Barron said, "You
don't need but five, Baby." Obviously you would like to have more for
practices and drills, and if you can stay away from injury you're in great
shape. But we'll make it work. And I'll look at the quality of players that
are in those ten uniforms and we have some quality players in those uniforms
that can play. Four of those players -- well, actually six of the players were
major contributors to us last year, and they were tied for first place going
into the last part of the season. They've been in the battle and know what it
takes to compete. We have to stay away from injuries, and I have to be a
smarter coach. I have to make sure I don't wear them out in practice, shorten
the practices, and to make sure I'm also getting in good work. It will be a
challenge for us, but there won't be a problem with playing time, they'll all
get to play.  
  
Q. Will this team be a little bit more of a team that's led both
emotionally, leadership-wise, by the point guard maybe as opposed to the last
few teams where your post players maybe had to take more of a leadership
role?  
KIM MULKEY: They may be led by the fact that the perimeter players returning
are more of an emotional type of player, Jhasmine Player gets emotional and
excited. Angela Tisdale is the one with the ball in her hands and directs
traffic out there. Maybe from that perspective. But I think that Rachel
Allison inside is just really a player that people don't talk much about and
she's won a lot of big basketball games for us. I think Danielle Wilson and
Jessika Bradley are the two post players, they're now going to have the
opportunity to play. And they're going to be humbled somewhat, being
sophomores and being thrown out there every day. But it's only going to make
them better down the road.  
  
Q. What about writing a book, what was that experience like for you?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I'm glad it's over. Right after the national championship
Peter May with the Boston Globe approached me about doing it and I told him
no. Then he did like a lot of you sportswriters do, don't understand the word
no, and kept bugging me and kept going to my athletic director and different
people and telling all the reasons why I needed to do it. So we kind of
battled back and forth. And I finally gave in. It's just basically my life
story. It takes you from the time I was born up until I guess this year, this
year's team. It's boring, if you ask me, but maybe there's something that you
guys find in there amusing or interesting. But it's done. It's over. It's been
a two-year process, and the title of it is Won't Back Down. That title came
from the Tom Petty song, I love that song. It kind of describes me. I'm just
not going to back down. I'm a fighter, I'm a competitor, that's how we came up
with the title.  
PETER IRWIN: Thanks very much. Best of luck to you for the season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 16, 2007

  

### [Kathy McConnell-
Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14195)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: Kathy McConnell-Miller has joined us. Welcome, Coach, from
Colorado.  
KATHY McCONNELL-MILLER: It's great to be here. Extremely excited about the
third season at the University of Colorado. It's a joy to coach Jackie
McFarland, I think, coming into this season with her as a senior, her
leadership, her skill and her ability to help this program make great strides
over the last two years has been an experience for both of us. There's no
doubt when you take over programs there's ups and downs, but we feel like
we've been progressing consistently over the past two years, and feel like
this is another year with the addition of some recruits and the experience of
some returners, that we feel like we're going to progress even more.  
This is the first year that I've been here that they've talked about --
postseason they've talked about the past, they talk about the future, they
talk about where they've been and where they want to go.  
  
Q. A lot of folks have been talking about post seasons and moving on, and
the strength of the league. Everybody knows how tough it is. But just how
important is it that there is that -- it's a tangible, real feeling of what
you were just talking about as opposed to a team coming in here and just
saying that?  
KATHY McCONNELL-MILLER: Well, I think that the excitement about this
conference, you know, I've been in a lot of conferences, but most recently at
the University of Tulsa, and everyone would talk about how many teams can you
get in. That's a one-bid league. You get one and the rest of them just pray
Sunday night that they get a call to get in the WNIT. For a conference like
the Big 12, the strength from top to bottom is exceptional. And I have said
it, I don't care who hears it, I don't care who agrees or disagrees, from top
to bottom you cannot look at one team and circle that and say that's a W, no
matter where it is, at home or on the road. And I've played in the ACC, I've
coached in the Big East, I've coached in the Big Ten, I've coached in a lot of
conferences, and top to bottom it's strong. So the opportunity, I think,
strategical scheduling is important in the non-conference because you know
you're going to be strong in conference and you've got the potential to go on
runs. You've got the potential to beat some strong teams because of the
balance in the conference.  
I think it's exciting that Kansas thinks they can get to the tournament,
Colorado thinks they can get there. Oklahoma knows they're going to get there.
It's just a matter of the preparation that's gone in and how you prepare.  
  
Q. You mentioned Oklahoma. Courtney Paris, everybody says, is going to be
better than she has been because of her maturity and because of her experience
in international competition. Is that kind of scary to an opposing coach to
think that Courtney Paris is going to be even better than she has been?  
KATHY McCONNELL-MILLER: I don't know. I think the questions that I always get
asked, is she one of the best players to ever play in the Big 12? Where does
she rank up with players like Sheryl Swoopes or Diana Taurasi. And I think her
legacy and what she does is going to be based on the success of OU. And what
she does for that program. I think points, rebounds, there's no doubt. I mean
her numbers are good and she's strong. She's physical. She's very, very
difficult to guard. But as coaches I don't think any one player makes a team.
She makes the biggest difference in any team in any conference. There's no
doubt about that. But I don't think -- yes, there's room for improvement, I
don't know how much room because she has dominated the league since I've been
in it, since she's been at Oklahoma. But it's going to be exciting to see
where she takes that team.  
  
Q. You have four starters returning, but six newcomers coming in. Could any
of the newcomers start?  
KATHY McCONNELL-MILLER: Our strength is in our front line. I think we've got
an extremely talented front line, from Kara Richards to Jackie McFarland, the
one player that we feel like that could come in and probably make the quickest
impact is Brittany Spears. She's 6-1, maybe 6-2 and she's just a player. She
is a great basketball player. She's aggressive. She's talented. She has fun on
the floor. Of all the players I have, she goes to the floor first. She goes to
the floor the quickest. She's the quickest to get the rebound. She's athletic,
and I think she will be one that we will rely on immediately. As far as how we
go, whether we go big, and Brittany Spears at the 2, and decide on a point
guard or we put her at the 3 and go a little bit smaller, it just depends on
what happens over the next couple of weeks. But I would say Brittany Spears is
the one that's made the quickest transition.  
  
Q. You're a couple of years following Ceal Barry at Colorado. Would you have
any advice for Gail Goestenkors in that situation, and do you feel like you're
really -- it's fully your program now or are you still adjusting a couple of
years in?  
KATHY McCONNELL-MILLER: I guess my advice would be to utilize Jody Conrad as
much and as frequently as you possibly can. Ceal has been a great friend to
me, probably didn't utilize her initially as much as I should have. But to
this day we talk frequently. I would consider her a very good friend of mine
and she's helped me in so many ways at the University. But I don't think you
ever replace Ceal Barry or you replace Jody Conrad. You hopefully begin to put
your personality and your strengths into that program. And that's one thing
that I've focused on is that I'm not looking to replace Ceal or change
anything that she's done. My objective is to put my stamp on the program and
get to the point where that looks like my team as opposed to Coach's team. And
I think Gail will have an easier time than any because of her experiences
domestically and internationally.  
PETER IRWIN: Good luck to you on the season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 16, 2007

  

### [Bonnie Henrickson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13895)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by Bonnie Henrickson. Welcome, Coach, if you'd
like to make a few opening comments.  
BONNIE HENRICKSON: Good morning, it's hard to believe we're back at it
already. At Kansas we are excited about our opportunity to build and grow on
our quality finish. We had a strong finish last year, and with a trip to
Australia under our belt and those practice days and four days of competition,
we're excited about. We have some young talent from last year that's improved,
putting in the time and effort to individually improve, it will help us be a
better basketball team, and excited about some young freshman, big freshman
that are a little bit bigger. We added speed and athleticism and size, and a
young lady that can shoot the ball well and pretty deep. With us being able to
mix those young kids in, I've got a reputation of playing young kids, and
they're excited about that. We have a chance to make an immediate impact. It's
important for us to get better every day. Our kids are excited, they should
be. I have great respect for how good the league is. It always has been and
will continue to be this year.  
  
Q. How helpful will the overseas trip be, do you think?  
BONNIE HENRICKSON: It gave us, for the staff, a sneak peek at the improvement
the players had made from the summer. Obviously working with them in the
spring, we knew we made progress in the spring, and it gave us a better,
clearer picture of exactly where we were going to focus in August and
September. And just the camaraderie of the trip, the competitive advantage, we
feel we made the ten practice days and full games -- I think it's been a jump
start and will be a great motivation and energy tool for us. And the kids have
been awfully excited and make reference to practices, and even for us just the
experience in those young kids, even four more games and ten more practice
days, it makes a difference. The worst part is you can't take the freshman,
but that's just a reality.  
  
Q. Speaking of freshmen, you guys have such a young roster, how trying has
that been, you try to work with them?  
BONNIE HENRICKSON: It's been good. It's been nice, we only have three
freshmen. And they were great kids last year, but 7 freshmen is 7 freshmen, so
to only have three has been refreshing. Not that that's been -- it has been
complicated some days, the sheer amount of just having to fix the little
things, and all the little things that freshmen do that drive you crazy, we
haven't had much of that.  
But in the short-term, when we played all those young kids last year, it was
painful, to be honest with you. But for the growth of the program it was the
best thing to do, to let them play, gain experience, throw them in the fire,
ask them how hot it is and learn and grow. And for those sophomores, some of
those kids, Kelly has junior experience now, or late sophomore experience
having played so much her freshman year.  
  
Q. With such a tough non-conference schedule and still a pretty young team
how do you avoid falling into a rut right before the Big 12 play?  
BONNIE HENRICKSON: We have to grow in two areas. We have to become tougher, we
have to become more disciplined. Had we been tougher and more disciplined,
having 7 freshman might be asking a lot for last year, we have to grow to have
a better non-conference record. We needed to gain confidence. When you look
back at it, and it was difficult to be close a lot of times, not being able to
finish, but I will give the kids credit last year about their resiliency. But
we have to play the non-conference like we did how we finished last year. But
to do that we have to have somebody step up and bring what mostly did. That's
the anxiety that I have about who is going to step up and be that person to
push us and lead us and step up and be a finisher. But we've got those two
areas, toughness and discipline help us.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit Nicollette Smith, and what she's going to bring to this
program, and how quickly --  
BONNIE HENRICKSON: She shoots it quick and deep. She's going to have to play
post defense, but she can shoot it deep and quick like Emily did. And in this
case let is here for that reason. And especially as we put Danielle McCray
back at the guard position, which Danielle played the power forward, and got
as many three point attempts, but we want to be able to space someone at that
position, and Nicollette will be able to do that.  
  
Q. Two questions, one is of last year's freshmen, can you tell which one has
maybe made the biggest jump to sophomore, and what do you expect from the 6-5
kid from Canada?  
BONNIE HENRICKSON: For the sophomores, going into -- finishing our trip to
Australia, Morris and Weddington were the two most improved. And McCray is not
like she's improved, but she's playing a different position now. More
importantly being guarded by different people. She had an advantage last year,
because we ran a lot of things to keep her on the perimeter and she was
guarded by post players. Now she's on the perimeter guarded by perimeter
players. She has gotten better, but I don't see the significant growth in how
she's grown. And then Krysten Boogaard, from Saskatchewan, Canada, actually
graduated from high school in two years, she was in our basketball academy,
and with the Canadian National Team, similar to what the Australian Institute
of Sports has done. So for a 6-5 kid another year of training, working, I
think has shown significant growth in her physically, and already significant
growth when we got her on campus in August. She played internationally in
summer, she was not on campus in June and July, which would have helped us
even more. But we made the commitment to let her play, and she'll play every
summer with the national program. She's legitimately 6-5. She's long, she's
lanky, she's in the middle of the pack when we run sprints, she's not last by
any stretch of the imagination. She's a physical kid, she's going to get
stronger in our strength and physical -- she has two brothers that play NFL
and one that's a fighter, so she knows how to throw the elbows around a little
bit. She's still a little lean. She's got great -- her body composition is
great, she's a lean kid, but is she a freshman? Yeah. She looks like a
freshman, and some of those upper post players like to make her look like a
freshman. We just played little all year last year, but it will be nice to go
back to some of those things we ran last year.  
  
Q. Could you comment on Courtney Paris, as a player, in the Big 12 and for
women's college basketball?  
BONNIE HENRICKSON: Absolutely. She's been that next level, that elite player,
for a young lady that has that size and athleticism, it's skill and
competitiveness, she's made our league better, she set the standard in our
league, she changes how a lot of us recruit. She changed about the type of
player we bring in to play against her and the size we might need. Nationally
she's opened a lot of eyes about a person of that size and physicalness and
that kind of skill and finesse. She's represented our league well. She's a
great sportsman, great competitiveness, has respect for the game. From the
minute you see her until she walks out she is a great thing for the university
but the league, as well.  
  
Q. Obviously everybody knows about Marsha being gone and Jody being gone.
Can you talk about what it means for the types of coaches that are now being
brought into this thing over the last few years?  
BONNIE HENRICKSON: Our conference has become a destination league. You have
three coaches that took teams to Final Fours that left the programs to join
the Big 12. It speaks volumes about the commitment in our league, the quality
of coaches in our league, and the administrators, and certainly the talent we
have in our conference. I don't know that that's happened anywhere in our
country.  
  
Q. Why do you think that, is it here, the midwest, our part of the
country?  
BONNIE HENRICKSON: I think you've got committed athletic directors. I have the
best athletic director there is in women's basketball, and he didn't pay me to
say that. He sets the bar high. And I believe in his commitment and to be
quite honest that's why I'm at Kansas. He's not the only one. He's in great
company. The commitment is how you fund the program, about facilities, about
resources to make sure your student athletes have all the resources to
graduate. From the minute those kids get up in the morning until they go to
bed they are treated first class, and that draws great athletes to your
league. Great players want to play with great players, against great players,
they want to play in front of a thousands of people and they get to do that.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Let's start with Shalee in the middle. Shalee, you are at
6.9 rebound a game, you have got to be the returning top rebounding point
guard in the entire country. Why are you such a good rebounder from the point
guard position?  
SHALEE LEHNING: I don't know. It's an interesting question. I like to go for
the ball. That's something I've always been taught when I was younger. My dad
said go get it, and he didn't care where I was at. I do go after it. A lot of
guards, they are starting to become better rebounders, and you're going to
find that evolving in women's sports. It's going to be more difficult for me
to get the rebounds. Whenever I see the ball I try to follow the line of it
and see where it's going to bounce.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Jackie, what were you doing last night?  
ANDREA RILEY: Last night I was at the Colorado Rockies game. They swept the
Diamondbacks, and are going to the World Series. It was exciting, the entire
town, city, state, really excited about that.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: When you experience that kind of environment when there's
that kind of celebration, can you take that and carry it over to your day-to-
day basketball life?  
ANDREA RILEY: I definitely think so. The thrill of sports is something
everyone can relate to. And especially being an athlete and knowing all the
hard work and how excited the men were after the game, and hopefully we can do
that one day if we're going to the Big 12 Championship Tournament or the NCAA.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Erin, you are the youngest of six girls. No boys, no
brothers?  
ERIN MYRICK: No brothers.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: How does that help you manage being a part of the team?  
ERIN MYRICK: Well, growing up we all slept in like the same bed for a while.
So I was always the youngest, and people were always sheltering me. But coming
and having to be a leader on the team, you have to learn to shelter other
people sometimes. It's been a learning experience for me, but I think I'm
getting better at it.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Danielle, you had a fun summer. I know you had a Red Sox
game. But how about your trip to Mexico? Sometimes we forget you are kids and
that you have fun. You're not always playing basketball.  
DANIELLE PAGE: The trip to Mexico was a lot of fun. I went with my mom and my
little brother. And I basically just hung out by the pool and eight
quesadillas, and it was amazing. The best vacation I've had.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Andrea, your dad is a former Harlem Globetrotter, and he's
not the dunking guys, he's a ball handler. How did he help you become a better
basketball player?  
ANDREA RILEY: He always had me in the gym like at 6:00 in the morning. So I
was a little early bird back in the day. But he helped me develop my skills.
He helped me get better at handling the simple cross over, and dribble to the
baseline. He helped me out a lot.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Danielle, talk about the 30 3's that coach makes you run.
What is that? And after you say what it is, I want to get some reaction from
everybody else on whether they think they could do it.  
DANIELLE PAGE: 30 3's are our conditioning test that we have to run every year
before we start practice. Basically what it is, it's five and three fourths of
a court length. You stop on the other free throw line.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Why is that?  
DANIELLE PAGE: I don't know the reason.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Is that something Coach came up with?  
DANIELLE PAGE: It was our previous strength coach. He brought it in. And I
think Coach liked it. It helps determine where we are conditioning-wise. You
have to run 12 of them. You get a minute and a half between each. Guards
running at 36 seconds.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: 38 seconds to go five lengths and three-quarters, Latoya,
what do you think of that?  
LATOYA GULLEY: So you start at the baseline and you're running to the other
half court and you have five trips?  
DANIELLE PAGE: It's down, back, down, back, down and then to the other free
throw line.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: That's grueling. Can everybody make it?  
DANIELLE PAGE: It takes a couple of people a couple of tries. But everyone
made it this year.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Jackie, this story cannot be played enough for Colorado
basketball, but you're actually going to have Britney Spears and Whitney
Houston in the back court. That has got to be the all-named teams of all-named
basketball.  
ANDREA RILEY: Superstars without stepping on the court.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Are you in rhythm or is it taking time?  
ANDREA RILEY: Definitely. We come in, I remember recruiting them, coming on
the recruiting trips. I think Whitney Houston came in first, and we were
making a couple of jokes about it. The coach said don't worry we have Britney
Spears coming in. And we thought they were joking. But we've got them both. We
tease them, because with the life they've been leading in the media recently.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Latoya, how is Spanish your first language, how is that?  
LATOYA GULLEY: My father played in the NBA and he decided to stay over and
play overseas. So I lived my first eight years over there and Spanish is my
first language. And I came here, back to Houston, and started going to school
and I'm like, okay, what are these kids speaking? So I had a translator for a
while. And as you can see, I still -- it's hard. My R's, I still roll them. My
teammates make fun of me. I say "sat," and they say, "What are you saying?"
And I say, "Please, don't play with me." It's something that I've had the
experience to live over there, and it's a wonderful experience and I hope I
can go back.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Shalee, sometimes student athletes don't have time to get
involved in the community. But you pay forward by getting involved in Big
Brothers and Big Sisters, how does that work?  
SHALEE LEHNING: Just like you said, it is an opportunity to give back. I think
oftentimes we overlook the many blessings we have in our life as athletes. I
got involved with Big Brothers/Big Sisters, I would go and spend time, maybe a
couple of times this summer, and play with the kids and do pretty much
whatever they want to do. They always usually wanted to play basketball. I
tried to do out of the ordinary things they might not get to do every day.
They are not as fortunate as us. It was a humbling experience and I hope I can
continue to give back to those kids.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Besides your dad being a former Harlem Globetrotter, he is a
bodyguard for Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys, have you participated in
anything there?  
ANDREA RILEY: I actually get to stay in Jerry Jones's suite.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: What's the food like in there?  
ANDREA RILEY: It's awesome (laughter). They have everything you can dream of
that you want to eat, fruit, nachos, everything.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: On another note, there is a point guard at St. John's. Her
name is Carla Cortijo. Her father is a bodyguard for Hootie and the Blowfish,
or Darius Rucker, I should say.  
Danielle, your father is in the Air Force and his ability to listen to your
games last year, can you explain how that happened?  
DANIELLE PAGE: He's actually recently retired from the Air Force. He now works
for Montgomery Contracting, kind of. He was over in Afghanistan during part of
our season last year. And he listened to our games through our Internet,
Huskers.com. And it was really weird, because it was like weird times, like 3
a.m. he had to listen to it. It was nice that I know as far away as he was he
was still watching me and listening to me play.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Erin, you like to cook, and now you have all these new
players, are you going to put a menu together to make sure everybody is
satisfied?  
ERIN MYRICK: They've been to my house a few times because they know there's
free food. It's fun that somebody can cook so we can get together like that
and have a team male without anybody else but the team around. It's a fun
time.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: In Lubbock I imagine that you would get mobbed for
autographs. I'm sure that happens a lot of places. What's your specialty?  
ERIN MYRICK: Macaroni and cheese. They love my macaroni and cheese. My mom is
a caterer and food service manager, and she's an awesome cook.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Do all your sisters cook?  
ERIN MYRICK: Some of them not so much because it's not very good. But a few of
us are pretty good at it.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Latoya, the Jones Cup experience, I know you and Jackie were
sharing a couple of experiences already. Talk about that and your relationship
and how you've been able to make new friends in the Big 12.  
LATOYA GULLEY: We had to play with Athletes in Action, and they represent God
in Sports. And that's something that -- when I'm on the court it's
frustrating, and you're what, okay, Coach, I understand, but the teammates are
yelling at you and we played six games in seven days, I don't know how we did
it, with only a week of practice. But we lost our first two games. We came
together as a team and said we're going to go 0-6 or will we go 4-2. Once we
came together as a team, Coach Schaefer said it was the best transition team
he'd ever seen. It was crazy how the ball would shoot to the wing, and I saw
Jackie going, and I was following. I said can we bring this to Texas A&M,
please? But it was a great experience. I got to be with Jackie and Leah Rush,
who is at Oklahoma. Jhasmine Player and Rachel Allison. And normally you're
like we're laughing at each other, how we did bios of each other. I saw Jackie
and it was hi, and I know who she is. Now we have a little friendship. When we
play against here it's going to be tough.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Jackie, expand on that.  
ANDREA RILEY: It's playing against the competition, not knowing these girls
without their jersey on, and without -- this is like what we need to do to
stop them, and being our enemy. And putting a friendly face and personality
was a lot of fun. It was a humbling experience to go to Taiwan. The people
over there were so hospitable, they loved the Americans that came over. You'd
be walking on the street and people want your autograph and asking to take
your picture without really knowing who you are. The culture was amazing. To
play at a different level of basketball even higher than what you are now, the
Big 12 in the league, and Division 1 basketball is amazing. It was an amazing
experience.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Erin, you already have your undergrad degree. Talk about
your degrees and what you're pursuing now.  
ERIN MYRICK: I graduated in May with a degree in broadcast journalism, because
basketball summer school has allowed me to do that. I had a minor in English
and Spanish. And then I'm going -- I'm already doing it now -- a second degree
in public relations and a minor in business.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Where does basketball fit in?  
ERIN MYRICK: It fits in there. It hasn't really -- I won't say it's been hard,
it's what you do. They all can speak to this, it's what you do. You go to
school, you go to class, you go to practice, you do what you have to do to get
it done.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: What are your aspirations after you're done playing?  
ERIN MYRICK: Anybody who is needing somebody to work for them, I'm available.
I would like to be an account coordinator or media relations specialist.
Broadcast journalism is what I really want to do. But I've got to save up some
money until I take the vow of poverty for that first.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Jackie, academically you've got a bunch of things going on,
too, what's your story?  
ANDREA RILEY: As of now I'm in the five-year program at the University of
Colorado. They have a great business school there where in four years this
coming May I'll be able to graduate with my masters in accounting taxation and
my bachelor's as well in accounting. I think that was an amazing opportunity.
I came in with a few hours out of high school. Kind of a sophomore starting my
freshman year. Colorado gave me a chance to graduate in four years with a
masters, as opposed to graduating last year with my bachelors, and taking a
few more hours for my secondary degree without actually completing it.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: How about you, Shalee? You're a broadcast journalism major.
Put it out there.  
SHALEE LEHNING: I think as an athlete obviously we've been interviewed many
times and we know what we go through, and stuff like this. It's a great
opportunity to get experience and be exposed to different situations. I hope
definitely some day to be working in television to be doing something
broadcast-wise.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Your leadership class you took, how does that carry over to
being a point guard? How does that work?  
SHALEE LEHNING: Definitely this past summer I had an opportunity to take a
leadership class, and it was great. It showed different aspects of the values
and beliefs and the things that you need to focus on to expound what you have
as a leader. There's a lot of things that go into it. It's not only just
natural ability, just being able to read different people and put a lot of
different personalities on the team and get them to go, and be understanding
that this person can handle this and they can't handle that. The leadership
class exposed me to that. And made me realize that there's a lot of great
things that each individual can bring to the table. I have to know the
character of each person and be sensitive to that.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Danielle, you took an interviewing class. We've got four
post players and two guards up here. You're going to see Erin and Latoya and
Jackie in the post. Ask them any question you want to know about the way they
workout, the way they post. Anything you want to take away, ask away.  
DANIELLE PAGE: What's your guys's favorite move?  
ERIN MYRICK: Whichever one scores the best.  
LATOYA GULLEY: I must say it has to be fade to the right and go low up the
middle.  
ANDREA RILEY: Up and under always gets them.  
DANIELLE PAGE: I'll put that in my memory banks, thanks.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Andrea, you have a big family, five brothers and four
sisters, so there's ten of you at some point because of the age, and then
there's 12 on a team. What do you learn from coming from a big family that
helps you manage as a point guard all the personalities you have to manage on
a team?  
ANDREA RILEY: Well, it's kind of different comparing it to a team, because I
was one of the oldest in my family, and I'm one of the youngest on my team.
It's like I have to -- I'm bringing myself to a different environment. And for
it to pass over to the team thing it's like I have to grow faster, and not
always be the grown up person in the group, you have to grow to everybody.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: I'm sure you're dying to ask some of the players. Go ahead
and hit them.  
SHALEE LEHNING: What do you like to do in your free time with your teammates?
What's something funny you do? What do you like to do that maybe these people
would like to know about?  
LATOYA GULLEY: I can speak on behalf of Texas A&M. Me and A'Quonesia and
Patrice, we do have a dance group. And YouTube is probably our favorite. We do
the Soulja Boy. We had him down for Maroon Madness, the Sponge Bob, whatever
the latest dance is, we feel we have to do it. We have this quote, unquote,
sorority thing we do. But it's funny because we actually make our teammates
pledge in order to be on it. And in order to pledge we're going out, for
instance --  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Not hazing them, are you?  
LATOYA GULLEY: No, it's really funny. Two of our freshmen wanted to be a part.
And we're like, okay, when Maroon Madness, and Soulja Boy came to perform, we
said you have to go out there and dance with them and do it in front of
everybody. And it was -- it filled the whole arena. We just had fun and be a
part of the dance group or you can be a part of our little sorority.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Anybody else?  
ANDREA RILEY: My team, well, we've got a lot of jokers on our team. I like
making everybody laugh. We all just sit around and joke in the locker room, we
turn on music and we'll make fun of how we act in practice or how we look when
we're tired or stuff like that.  
ERIN MYRICK: We have like movie nights where we watch old DVD's of old
television shows, and of course they come to my house to eat. And that is just
basically what we do. We have a lot of fun together.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Danielle, you guys have a good group, too.  
DANIELLE PAGE: We do a lot of dancing on our team, too. Soulja Boy has made an
appearance once or twice, just having fun, throwing the Nerf football around.  
ANDREA RILEY: Also, we have the movie route, but we have the largest selection
of Disney movies in the Big 12.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Probably because your coach has three young children.  
ANDREA RILEY: But we know most every song Disney has come up with. We have
them not only on the DVD's, but our iPods, as well. We like to sing them:
Under the Sea. I think the Magic Carpet Ride, the Aladdin one, back to
childhood.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: One other question for you, Jackie, your numbers are
unbelievable. A double-double in the league, you know how difficult that is to
accomplish. When you look at the numbers in the Big 12 you're always right
underneath Courtney Paris. You could say that she's casting a shadow on your
numbers in some ways, she's a dominant national player. Make a play for
yourself, why you should be considered for all those awards, because you shoot
60 percent from the floor.  
ANDREA RILEY: I think it's just the work ethic and the great team I have
around me, we kind of get passed under the radar, because Courtney Paris is
such a great player. But I think averaging as many minutes and having such a
young team I've tried to lead the team as well as I can, and go out and do
what I can every night.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Ladies, thank you very much for your time and for your
effort. Hope you all found some things that will be helpful in your writing
and your work through the season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 16, 2007

  

### [Gail Goestenkors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14259)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We'd like to welcome in the new coach at the University of Texas,
Coach Goestenkors. Welcome to the Big 12 and the Big 12 media day.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: It's a great pleasure to be here. I'm so used to the ACC
media days, so it feels strange, everything is really a new experience for me.
And one that I relish. Coming to Texas from Duke was really one of the most
difficult decisions of my life, but I felt like I was ready for a new
challenge and new adventure. And I think that's exactly what I'm getting.
Every day is a new experience for me. And I love it. So I'm very much looking
forward to being in the Big 12 and all of the challenges that we will get
along the way.  
This conference is just incredible, really from top to bottom. And clearly the
fan support is the best in the nation. So I'm looking forward to going into
all these -- and I've already heard stories about some of the environments I'm
going to go into and the crazy fans. But I love that. That excites me. I've
always loved challenges and I feel I have a great challenge and great
opportunity here at the University of Texas.  
  
Q. Why did you leave the comfort and security at Duke for a big challenge
like coming to Texas?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Probably because it was comfortable and secure, and I love
challenges. I've always been one to kind of push the envelope a little bit,
push myself. And I never want to be comfortable. I guess a fear of becoming
complacent, I would never want that for myself or my team. When that
opportunity came I really had to think do I want to stay at Duke for the rest
of my career, which would have been fine, or do I want one more big challenge
on this journey? My life is a journey and that's the way I see it. And I just
thought it would be so exciting to really try something entirely new and see
if I could help bring Texas back to the greatness that it once had.  
  
Q. Last time you coached another team would have been the 94-95 team. Can
you talk about what's that like? It's a different mentality as opposed to
starting the season at Duke where you're thinking we're heading for a national
championship to, hey, we need to get back in the tournament?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Yeah, I think it's really about changing the mindset. All
the players on this current team, we have one true senior, but not one of
those players has ever played in the postseason. So we really need to change
almost the culture now. You never want to go too many years without -- well, I
always thought getting to the Final Four or winning a championship, because
the older kids teach the younger kids what it takes and what it's all about.
Right now I'm the teacher, because those kids haven't been there during their
careers in Texas. That's the real challenge of our coaching staff is to help
them understand very quickly what it takes. And that's why you may have heard
some of my players, our motto is walk, talk and act like a champion. In every
way every day. Because they have to start thinking about it and acting that
way in order for it to happen. So that's really what this year is all about,
helping them to learn what it takes for them to be champions.  
  
Q. Up to this point what has been your most rewarding experience in your
journey?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: You mean here or in my life?  
  
Q. In your journey. You said your life is a journey.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Gosh, I've had so many, it's hard to say. I think on the
basketball court probably in 1999 when we went to our first Final Four, and
that year we beat Texas in the regional. And that was a state in the game of
our program, that was the game that really legitimized our program at Duke.
That was the year they had Shamika, Tamika, all the "Meeks," and they won
three years in a row, and that was supposed to be their best team. That was
one of those David versus Goliath games, and probably one of the best moments
of my career. And so I'm hoping to have more of those moments. I had more
along the way, but that's the one that stands out to me. I was talking
earlier, last year when we beat Tennessee at Tennessee, it was a great crowd,
and we won. And I'm just, okay, I felt good after the game, but I didn't have
that total sense of just -- total excited and the thrill. And I think that's
part of the reason I came, as well, I want to help build, again, I want to
feel those moments again, where it's the first time that our players beat
Tennessee or the first time that we go to the Final Four and those feelings
that accompany that.  
  
Q. Will you talk about if you took over for one of the icons of the game,
talk about taking over for Coach Conrad?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: It's an incredible experience to follow Jody. And it was one
I was a little leery of. And when I came down for my visit when I was trying
to make my decision, I went to lunch with Jody because I just -- it was a
concern of mine. And she really -- she made me feel so much better. And she
told me that she wanted me to have this job. And she wanted to pass the baton
on. I know I'm never going to be Jody Conrad. We have different styles and
different personalities and I would be a fool to try. But she wanted me to
develop my own legacy here at the University of Texas. So she's been an
incredible supporter. She still works at UT. She does a lot of speaking and
fundraising, which she loves and she's perfect for. Hopefully that can keep me
from having to do quite as much. She's always there if I need her. It's a real
sense of comfort for me.  
  
Q. If you are in the NCAA tournament this year, and you were facing Duke,
how would you feel?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I wouldn't feel good at all. We were actually scheduled to
play Duke this year and I took it off the schedule because it would just -- I
felt it would just be too hard for everybody involved. There are a lot of
emotions there. I still feel very close and always will with the team at Duke.
So I didn't want to put any of us through that. I'm hoping that, A, we do make
the NCAA tournament and, B, that we do not have to play Duke.  
  
Q. What's the biggest culture shock about moving to Austin after living on
the East Coast as long as you have?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I haven't felt culture shock in Austin. I think probably the
first football game I went to was a bit of a shock for us, because at Duke I
don't know what we averaged. I'd say probably about 6,000, maybe, 8,000 people
at our football games, which was about the same we averaged at our basketball
games. So it was quite an experience.  
  
Q. You talked earlier about your role as a teacher to this team. Since
you're inheriting a team basically recruited by somebody else in many ways,
are you learning about this team?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Most definitely. It's been a process and it will continue to
be a process. I spent most of the summer, when I was here with the team,
individually and in individual meetings, just really trying to get to know
them as people and what was important to them. And I've always been --
relationships are always the most important thing to me with my team. And so I
feel like I'm a better motivator when I know what's important and how each
player is best motivated. They're all different and unique. Now that we
started practice I'm learning who they are on the court. It's a process and I
think it's going to take some time as we go through -- you always learn so
much when you go through tough times. As we're going through our schedule and
we'll have some wins and some losses, I'm quite sure, and I'll learn more
every day about how they respond to some adversity, as well.  
  
Q. You mentioned football. You're coming from an institution where I'm sure
everyone would agree basketball is the No. 1 sport. And now you're at a place
where I think probably everyone would agree that historically football is the
No. 1 sport. Is that going to be an adjustment for you?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I don't think so. I think what you sell is the success of
the programs. And I think what's good at Duke and is great at Texas is all the
programs are really very successful. I'm smart enough to know that you sell
what you can. And here at Texas, football is really exciting and there's so
many kids that grow up watching Texas football. So if that helps them to want
to come to Texas I'm all for it and I'm going to sell our program. Soccer is
ranked No. 1. Volleyball is ranked very high. We're selling sports and
academics as a whole. That's a really good feeling.  
  
Q. The experience of coaching Courtney Paris, your comment in working with
her and her impact as a basketball player in the women's game?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I love Courtney and I could not say enough great things
about her, both as a player and a person. When I coached her in the Under-19s,
she's a joy to coach. I'm very envious of Sherri having her for four years
because she works hard, but she also makes it fun. She was somebody that all
the other players -- she's like a magnet. People just want to be around her
because she's very witty. She's funny. She's easy going. She's easy to be
around. I enjoyed coaching her.  
Having her this summer, it was interesting to see her with an older group. She
was the same age on that Under 19 team as most of the other players, but now
she's the baby in that national team. There's some dominant personalities. And
I was with her when we were in Italy earlier and she didn't say probably two
words. And then to have her again when we went to Chile later, I can see her
growing, and becoming more comfortable and confident on that national scene,
as well, which is really important. It's all about the experiences you have.
So she's obviously been a dominant factor in the women's game at the college
level, but I think as she continues to gain confidence I think we can see her
in a couple of Olympics.  
  
Q. You've looked at where the program is right now, I wonder if you can talk
about your initial perceptions, how much work you think will be necessary to
bring Texas back to the level it's been in previous years?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I think we've got some work to do. Like I said, I think
changing the mentality is the first task at hand. And that's easier said than
done. So -- and then we've got to bring in some more recruits. I think Tiffany
Jackson was such a star and a dominant figure in that program for years, she
was surrounded then by role players. Now that she's gone we have a lot of role
players, but we have no star. And so it's trying to help those players step
out of their comfort zone and step into the light a little bit more. So it's
something -- I've told them, I would be excited about the opportunity to
really have a new role, but at the same time it's a process. Some people just
don't feel comfortable in those starring roles and being the go-to player. I
think it's going to take some time to help the players step out of their
roles, and also I think we're a little thin, we need to bring in some more
talent, some more size. We have one point guard, Carla, so we don't have the
depth we'd like at this level.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach. Best of luck this season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 16, 2007

  

### [Bill Fennelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13850)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We have Coach Bill Fennelly from Iowa State. Coach, if you'd like
to make some opening comments and then we'll take questions.  
BILL FENNELLY: It's great to be back in Kansas City. I have great memories
here. We're excited about coming back and hopefully we'll be a part of it for
a long time in the spring. But we're like everyone else, excited to get the
season started and looking forward to it. We appreciate everyone showing up
today and covering all of our athletes and schools. It means a lot to all
coaches that you would take the time to cover us. It means a lot and we
sincerely appreciate it. We're looking forward to giving you something fun to
write about, hopefully.  
  
Q. You've got the longest tenure of anybody in the conference. Are we in an
era where we won't see these coaches ten years plus at institutions? And tell
us how the nature of it will change with all the new coaches coming in the Big
12 this year?  
BILL FENNELLY: Well, I've been very lucky, obviously, to have a lot of good
players and coaches and administration who appreciate what we're doing. It has
been odd to see the turnover. I think the culture of college sports is you win
or they're going to change coaches. There's a lot of money involved, there's a
lot of pressure involved. And it used to be women's coaches were immune to
that, and we're not anymore. And I think we live in a "what have you done for
me lately" world, and you win, you're successful or they're going to find
somebody else who they feel can do it. You see a lot of administrators change
and when AD's change, the coaches change a lot of times after that.  
I've been lucky to work where I'm working. Hopefully I can be there a little
bit longer. You talk about our league. Coach Conrad, a Hall of Fame coach,
leaves and we bring in a future Hall of Fame coach in Gail. And you go down
the list on a lot of coaches on our league. Coach Washington, Coach Baird,
Hall of Fame coaches, and Coach Sharp, and now you have a whole another list,
the Sherri Coales and Kim Mulkeys. I think it says a lot of our league that
Gail Goestenkors left Duke to come to the Big 12.  
  
Q. To expand on that a little bit more, there's a fairly new athletic
director at Iowa State and the changes, talk about the commitment at the
school there to advance in the sport and how you guys fit in within the
conference?  
BILL FENNELLY: I can honestly tell you, and this is my 13th year at Iowa
State, and the commitment has been unbelievable, through two presidents, my
third athletic director, Jamie Pollard has a great vision for what we want to
do. He's a forward thinking guy, he wants to be a player in the league. If you
don't get in the game you're going to get run over in this league. You better
do some things, and you better spend money, you better build facilities, you
better do things to allow your athletic programs and student athletes to be
successful. So I can't complain one bit about the support that we've gotten in
my time. And I think everyone understands how hard it is. We're in kind of a
unique situation as far as our recruiting base. We don't have maybe the
weather that some of the other schools have sometimes, but you have to have
other things, commitment from the top, and our president has been unbelievable
to me, and Jamie Pollard has followed suit. I don't have any complaints about
that. Now it's time to get out and do your job.  
The support of the administrators in this league is really, really good. And I
think they see women's basketball can be important to their schools and
important to our league.  
  
Q. How much has Toccara been able to practice, and how is she doing?  
BILL FENNELLY: Toccara actually practiced a little bit. We practiced three
times. We didn't practice Friday, we gave them Friday off. We got off to a
good start, we took the day off. Saturday and Sunday a little bit -- she
practiced almost full go. Toccara Ross is our lone senior, she's been fighting
a bad back, and hasn't done anything all fall. But she's a tough kid. She
wants to play. She wants to be a part of this. We need her. I mentioned to my
staff yesterday after practice that our practices were better because No. 41
was out there. I think she'll be fine. When you're fighting a bad back,
there's no easy solution. But she's very tough minded. She wants to play. She
wants to practice. And I was stunned how well she looked yesterday to be
honest with you, for having not done as much as so many in the others in the
fall. But we just have to be smart and keep her healthy and do the right
things. It's a lot of work for her because she has to spend a lot of time in
the training room to get ready for practice. If she can do that and we can be
smart about using her in practice I think she'll be fine. Thanks for asking.  
  
Q. Talk about being picked 6th in the preseason poll. Through the three
days, anybody -- any surprises in your practices so far?  
BILL FENNELLY: As far as being picked 6th, to be honest with you, I was
surprised it was that high, to be quite honest with you, but I think you look
at how teams are picked, I don't think there's any question that A&M and
Oklahoma are dynamic teams and should be picked. After that, who knows what
could happen. In our league, who do you get at home, who do you get on the
road, who gets hurt. But the people that are bunched in the middle -- as far
as surprises go, I think overall -- our three new kids have done pretty well,
Kelsey Bolte, Genesis Lightbourne and Denae Stuckey have shown they can play
at this level and compete. But probably the most pleasant surprise was Toccara
practicing yesterday. That was probably the biggest surprise and the nicest
one. I didn't expect it.  
  
Q. As the Dean of the Big 12 women's coaches, you've seen a lot of talent
come and go in this league. Talk about the impact of Oklahoma's Courtney
Paris.  
BILL FENNELLY: In my time coaching -- and you're right, I've seen a lot of
great players in this league. I don't know that there's been a player that's
changed this league and the dynamics of this country like Courtney Paris. And
I mean that as a player and as a person. The way she conducts herself, the way
she carries herself, the way she plays the game. I don't think she gets enough
credit for how good she is. She's a hard guard. She's a big, strong kid and
people think she's big and strong -- she's very talented. She passes, she
catches. She's very well coached. I think she's brought a tremendous amount of
attention not just to Oklahoma but to our league. And I don't know that
there's a kid that we've ever played against in our league that's harder to
prepare for. We have tried everything. We played them two years ago and triple
teamed her and that was a great coaching decision, we got pummeled. And then
we played them in the Big 12 Tournament and decided that another great
coaching idea was we were going to let her score 35 -- I don't know how many
she scored. We said let her keep shooting until her arm falls off and try not
to give them any 3-point shots. That didn't work. So I don't know. She is --
she's a special talent. And unfortunately in the women's game she can't go pro
early, so we're all stuck with her for two more years (laughter). But, again,
I think the biggest thing is she's a quality kid. And I think she's humble.
She cares about her teammates. She cares about the game. She represents our
country in the USA Basketball. So it's not fun to coach against her but it's
fun to say she's in our league, because she brings a lot of great attention to
the Big 12. And I must have ticked somebody off the first Big 12 game Courtney
Paris gets to come to Ames, so it's a great way to start the season.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what kind of improvement you're expecting from
Nicky?  
BILL FENNELLY: Nicky is a third year start. She's a junior. I think the
challenge for Nicky is like any player that's played and understands, she's
got to find another level and not be satisfied with playing and scoring 12 or
13 points. We need her to be a better player. We need her to help with our
players. Our top 8 players, top 7 players, three were probably new. She's been
through it, she understands what it takes to be successful. Next year she'll
be a senior. So she's someone that we need. Everyone talks about leadership.
And it's a relative term. But for Nicky it's someone that's been through it,
and that's the thing. Unlike most players on our team, she's the only one that
is a third-year starter. So she completely understands what it means to be
successful in this league. For Nicky it's do you want to be a really good
player, do you want to be an All-Conference player or do you want to settle
for being a good college player? We didn't have anyone -- I told this to our
kids. We didn't have anyone that was on the preseason Big 12 team. Obviously
the coaches in our league don't think the players are very good. Nicky needs
to prove to the coaches in our league that she deserves to be an all
conference player. Either you do that or you don't. And that's the level. You
go from sophomore to junior year. She's capable of making it and I hope she
wants to do it.  
  
Q. Obviously the faces have changed among the coaches and this is always
regarded as a quality coaches league, but looking back, how much impact does a
team from a league winning a national championship have on that conference's
overall perception?  
BILL FENNELLY: I don't think you can put it -- you can't put too much emphasis
on it. I think what Baylor did changed our league forever. Because it's always
one of those, you know, Peyton Manning is great, but he's never won a Super
Bowl. We've had All-American players. We have coaches -- a litany of Hall of
Fame coaches, some of the best players that have ever played in the game. The
best fans. Some of the best universities. There's nothing we don't have,
except for that. When Baylor did it, it's like, okay, we can get that out of
the way and move on and let other schools go on. And I know Texas Tech did it.
But I don't think there's any question about Oklahoma getting to the
championship game in years past, and I think A&M and Oklahoma both have teams
that could go to the Final Four again. When Baylor did that, it totally
changed our league forever. And now there isn't anything that I can think of,
obviously I'm not very bright, but I don't think there's anything I can think
of that people can say that our league has not done or will not do, as soon as
that happened. That was big for all of us.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 16, 2007

  

### [Kristy Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14069)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: Coach Kristy Curry from Texas Tech University. Coach, welcome.
How about a comment or two.  
KRISTY CURRY: We're just really excited. I think obviously there's not another
team in America where there's more curiosity surrounding us. We have a lot of
new faces and with that comes a lot of curiosity about what the future holds.
I'm kind of curious myself. So we'll see where it takes us.  
  
Q. With nine new faces, most of them from junior college or transfers from
other colleges, are you wearing name tags? How long does it take to blend
in?  
KRISTY CURRY: I certainly don't have to have them wear any name tags, since I
recruited them and spent a lot of time chasing them all over this country. I
think our fans will probably need some name tags. But they'll become
acclimated with who they are and how they play. I think the biggest challenge
we have, obviously, is can we as a staff mold them together and make them play
together. We rebuilt and reestablished and found that we needed to get
experience. We are putting the pieces of the puzzle back slowly but surely.  
  
Q. Of all the transfers do you think it's possible that you might have four
or five of them in the starting lineup at some point?  
KRISTY CURRY: There's no question we can have a lineup. But there could be
five new ones. But I think with Erin returning and her experience factor she
certainly has a leg up on the system. So at least we have four new starters,
because we have to, possibly five. You don't know, by January it might be
total.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what are the things you learned the most your first
year at Texas Tech?  
KRISTY CURRY: I think the first thing -- there are two things. I think first
and foremost what a special place Lubbock and Texas Tech is when it comes to
women's basketball. I've been blessed in West Lafayette, Louisiana, where
women's basketball is big. But nothing like the fan support. It's a great
place. Everyone talks about Lubbock. When you look at it it's the second
largest town in the Big 12. It's a great place to raise a family. It's a great
place to live and go to work every day. That's been -- you hear about it. I
understood it when I was assistant at A&M, we played at Louisiana Tech and got
the right to go to the Final Four at the Municipal Coliseum, but it's an
amazing place to work and live and coach women's basketball. There are very
few places in the country that could be better.  
  
Q. One of your recruits is from Kansas City, Keisha walker?  
KRISTY CURRY: She is from Hickman Mills High School, and I know she's excited
that the Big 12 tournament will be in Kansas City for her family to have a
chance to watch us. Keisha has a chance to come in and play a lot of minutes
this year and certainly will be a name you become familiar with. She's a
talented young lady and probably even a better person. We're excited that
she's part of basketball now, she has a chance to be a difference maker.  
  
Q. You obviously have historically good support with Bob Knight there?  
KRISTY CURRY: We've got to give it to Coach Knight. I'm not going to say
anything -- I'm smart enough to know the right answer to that question.  
  
Q. The Texas Tech/Texas rivalry, there's so much tradition with that. But
for the first time in a long time, you have one this year, Gail, it's her
first year, talk about that and you guys growing into that rivalry.  
KRISTY CURRY: She walked into a very similar situation. She left a very
successful program. I left a successful program. And we tried to replace two
legends. I know that Gail is going to be good enough. She needs to be her and
that will be plenty good. I know that she is very proud, as I am, to follow in
the footsteps of a legend. She and I both want to continue to have the game
grow the way Coach Sharp and Coach Conrad has. I want to get Texas Tech back
to where we both expect it to be. I don't think there's any question that
Texas and Texas Tech is what the conference and the Big 12 as far as women's
basketball, those legends put this program on the map. We both want to get
back in the upper echelon and help the game grow at the same time.  
  
Q. With all these new faces, in some ways is that good in a lot of ways,
because a new coach needs a few years to cycle in a lot of new players, and
this case it's really a lot your team already?  
KRISTY CURRY: Well, it's not exactly -- I don't want to have to assemble eight
faces in one recruiting class. We had a transfer in with Maddy Brown that I
think will be a good player, one is a walk-on, I'll say 7 or 8 including Maddy
and the 9th is a walk-on. It's not something I'd prefer. I'd prefer to come in
and sign three, four or five. But it is what it is. We went out and got some
experience and we're not -- I think Texas Tech has had a lot of success in
past years of junior college players being very successful. So I think that
it's a very easy transition for our players.  
But again, we signed three freshmen in November, high school-wise, and we're
just going to do what we have to do to put the pieces of the puzzle together.
But it will be nice. The simple fact that it is just about my team now. But I
don't have a problem saying that it's Coach Sharp's team, still. But we're
going to try to take care of things for her.  
  
Q. What about Seals? There is a long history with Dominic Seals and players
that have been successful playing two years, Sheryl Swoopes?  
KRISTY CURRY: There's tons of them, exactly.  
  
Q. Can you see her fitting into that role of things where you can take a lot
of responsibility very quickly?  
KRISTY CURRY: I do, but I think that she's going to have a lot of help around
her. I think Dominic has been on very successful teams at Lincoln High School,
at South Plains, and she's not just been the only player on the team. She's
had a lot of help. What we've tried to do is not just put it all on her
shoulders. I think it's going to have to come back, but she has a chance to be
a special player on the league. And she's a really special kid. She's had to
earn everything that she's ever gotten. And she has a work ethic and passion
for winning and being successful. That's the thing I've been most surprised
with about her, is that just because she's talented and athletically talented,
she just works so hard. And so that will set her apart. She has a chance to be
a special player because of her work ethic.  
PETER IRWIN: Coach, best of luck, have a great season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 16, 2007

  

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: Coach Coale is from the University of Oklahoma.  
SHERRI COALE: Thank you. Great to be back in Kansas City. I have fond memories
of the last time we were here. We love the way that they raise college
basketball, and look forward to competing here in spring.  
  
Q. Expectations always high in Oklahoma, your concentrations for 07 and
08?  
SHERRI COALE: My expectations are for us to be in the top three in the country
in field goal defense and in assist ratio. You know we were 436th in assist
ratio, but we're going to be better this career.  
  
Q. In the past couple of years we've seen Jody Conrad, Marsha Sharp. How do
you think that's going to change the nature of the league, with the new
coaches coming in and out, what the league is going to be like now?  
SHERRI COALE: I think it does change the landscape of our league. I think that
we have been very fortunate, those of us who remain, to have worked under the
mentorship and competed against such greats as Jody and Ceal and Marsha, and
before that Marion. I think that with every coaching change there is a complex
adjustment. When the Big 12 goes out and competes at the SEC or Big Ten and
that style is created by the philosophies and the mindset and the
personalities of the coaches in that league. I think there are a lot of
adjustments, much like the lighting that's happening in this room (laughter).
There will be changes. I think Texas will look different and play differently,
because Gail is different from Jody. Just as I think Colorado has changed with
Kathy McConnell. We all have a responsibility to make sure that we have the
integrity and the class that the Big 12 Conference is known for. That's what
Jody and Marsha and Ceal taught us to be.  
  
Q. When you say Texas will look different, play different, how do you mean
that, the difference between the coaches?  
SHERRI COALE: I think their personalities are different, their styles of play
are different. A similarity will be their aggressive defense. I think that
Duke was as aggressive as anybody in the country defensively and that's always
what Texas was known for. But I think you'll just see a little bit of a change
in the schematics. It's not only Gail and Jody being different personalities,
but Gail coaching in a different part of the country and being exposed to
different things. I think it will be a change, I think it always is.  
  
Q. Would you talk about the one or two ingredients that have to fall into
the mix right for this team to reach its potential and what that might be?  
SHERRI COALE: We have to take better care of the basketball. I look back at
last season and we beat Ole Miss by 15 if we controlled the basketball. They
try to make you make mistakes with the ball, that's the way they play and the
way they're successful, their defense generates offense. But clearly when we
can get a shot at the basket we're going to have a chance to win games. I can
remember a timeout in that game, where, if you just throw it towards the
basket, because we're going to get the rebound, that would be a good thing.
That's the deal. Really, we've got to take back the basketball. We were good
defensively last year, I think we were third in the country in field goal
defense. We guarded people. We didn't finish as much offense off the defense
as we would like to, but we made people take tough shots.  
  
Q. Talk about replacing six seniors.  
SHERRI COALE: That's a tough one. I don't think that you do replace kids, any
seniors when they graduate, but when you have a class the size of ours last
year, the six kids, not only who they were and the statistics that they left
behind, but what they meant to our program. Some of them 5th years, both
redshirt in their career. I don't know if you replace people. We'll get the
three point shots, and yeah, but we have a freshman that we can get the shots
that Erin did. We will take those charges, those attacks at the basket that
Chelsi had. We will find a way to get that statistical output that we got from
those guys on the floor.  
What's difficult is the experience. What's difficult is the basketball IQ.
That group of kids was as sharp on the basketball floor as anybody I've ever
coached. That's a tough team to replace. Part of that is their ability to
think and feel the game. And part of that is being in the program for four or
five years. You just don't replace those two things immediately. We're working
hard with the young people. I've been very, very impressed with our sophomore
class with the growth they've shown from the freshman year to the early season
thus far.  
  
Q. It's probably because of the numbers, but do you envision that this is
the year where Courtney and Ashley are playing together, almost all the time
or do you still want to rotate them in and out?  
SHERRI COALE: It's a little bit of a lot of different scenarios. Here's the
deal, Courtney and Ashley together are fantastic. Ashley can find a way to get
the ball to Courtney. She has a sixth sense about it and they have that
communicative thing going between the two of them. The other thing is
sometimes Ashley needs to play the low block, and sometimes Courtney needs to
rest, and vice-versa. They'll be on the floor together a lot, but there will
be occasions where one will be in and one won't, because we need each of them
at full strength when they're on the floor. We have the freedom to do a lot of
different things. But more so than last year, because Leah Rush is no longer
with us, and she needed to be on the floor a lot.  
  
Q. What do you expect of her this year?  
SHERRI COALE: On a daily basis I ask her to do a little bit more, and
sometimes a little differently. Courtney's talents run the gamut, and yet I
can't tell you what an improved player she is right now, from who she was in
the final game of the season last year against Ole Miss. I can't even quantify
it. Maybe it's the USA Basketball experience all summer. Maybe it's being with
that national team this fall, and being on the floor with Diane Taurasi and
Cappie Poindexter and on and on down the list. Maybe it's that exposure,
traveling across the country, maybe it's growing up and finally being 20 years
old. It could be a lot of things. But she's been a different kid. She's been
more focused in practice, she's been a leader, and all of those things, in
addition to tangible things, such as stepping out and shooting better from 10
or 12. She's worked on expanding her game. And I think that can go directly
back to the USA experience, where she didn't get to be at the block quite as
much. She's much more comfortable away from the basket. There are tangible and
intangible ways she's grown. The bar keeps getting raised for her.  
  
Q. It looks like you're having a difficult scheduling test.  
SHERRI COALE: When you do your schedule you try to accomplish a couple of
things, and for me, personally, the number one thing that I've always tried to
accomplish with my schedule is to put my program at another level. Years ago
we played Connecticut, we wanted to try to fill up our arena. We didn't think
we could beat them at the time, we didn't have the personnel to be able to
beat them. We weren't really worried about our RBI. And 10,700 people came to
the game. And it started a love affair with our community with our team. When
I put the schedule together, I'll be quite honest, I looked around the country
and said every year Tennessee or Connecticut are playing in the Final Four.
Every year those two teams have the toughest schedules in the country, one and
two. So if I want to be one of them, I want there, too. Find the best teams in
America and put them on the preconference schedule. Once we get to conference
play it's terrific. But I have some control over what happens in November and
December, and I want that to be just as terrific as well. We went after it.
And whether or not this year's team is ready for that, I don't know. We'll
know in about 23 more practices. But I like our chances.  
  
Q. Sherri, can you tell us about the travels this summer and how it has
improved her as a player?  
SHERRI COALE: Her ability to step outside and be more comfortable away from
the basket. She understands the pace. I think she understood sitting on the
bench. She didn't like it very much. And I think there was really a fire lit
in the deepest part of her belly. She thought, hey, I really have a chance to
be an Olympian, not just a part of USA Basketball. I'm not saying that that's
something that's not important or not significant, because it is very
difficult to make any of the teams, World Junior, Under 21, doesn't matter,
what piece of the feeder system you've been involved in and she's been
involved for years. But this is the Olympic team and I think she felt that
when she went and trained with them. She thought I have within me the ability
to make this squad and to participate in the 2008 Olympics. And it's a new
hunger for her. Her work ethic, attention to detail, her mindset has been
absolutely fantastic. All summer when she would come back and talk, and in the
preseason when she returned from the Olympics, it's just been fabulous.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the type of system that she's been
playing, is it going to be a little bit different from what you run, and are
there differences. Also talk a little bit about you getting into the Big 12,
is the team either mentally or physically going to be discovered with
Courtney?  
SHERRI COALE: That's going to be the world's longest answer. No. A, does she
get confused going back and forth from coach to coach, I think she's already
got us confused because we look so much alike. She made a crack in practice
the other day about -- now, what do we do when this happens, because with
Coach Donovan we did this when something happens, and it was something bad
that happens. And she looked at me and said, "I'm just teasing, I know exactly
where I am." She will play that card a lot of times, "I was confused, I
thought we were at USA -- no, I don't."  
We were doing a scheme a little bit different than last year, and she said
what am I going to do? I said take a deep breath and think about it, what do I
want you to do? Score. Yes. Your role has not changed go right down there,
there's a little block with your name on it, I want you to make a basket. It's
not complex with Courtney. I think the exposure to different types of coaches,
different types of environments, different types of teammates, different types
of competition, do a lot of things for any kid that goes overseas, but
particularly a kid as sharp and intuitive as Courtney is, she comes back and
says I like this place I'm in. I have a good thing going here, and her
appreciation level and the way she excels that are magnified.  
  
Q. Quick question about Amanda. Did we not get how much pain she was in at
the end of last year?  
SHERRI COALE: No, nobody did. Nobody did. One of the toughest kids I've ever
been around in my life. When Don McGinnis got into her shoulder, a couple of
tears he assumed had probably been there for maybe even three years. She had
torn that up in high school, early high school, and had figured out how to
compensate and play through it. And it's just when she got to the University
of Oklahoma and people start checking her out and you start figuring out those
things, and she did tear it again in the season. But the great thing about
this -- it's interesting, sports injuries tend to sometimes go in cycles.
There have been so many athletes who have the labral tear in the shoulder, and
the great news about it is it's a very, very high -- the surgery is a very
high success rate surgery, almost always when you go in and you fix that
you're fixed for good. You don't have any problems as a result of it. There is
no chronic pain or immobility as a result of it. She's fortunate. I think back
in the day, Keirsten Walters from Connecticut had it and it was one of those
where nobody had heard much about it, it really never happened in women's
basketball. There are several players, I think Tina Charles, that might be one
of them that had it. But it's sort of the vogue injury, I guess right now,
maybe due to more physical play. Amanda is a tough, tough kid. I watched on
film this past weekend, I watched our Big 12 tournament in Oklahoma City and
watched her play and watched her particularly, and the pain she was in was
obvious and I think we maybe chose not to see it to get her through as long as
she could. She's fit, she's probably lost 20 pounds, running well, and just
looks like an elite level athlete.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you very much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 16, 2007

  

### [Kurt Budke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14197)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: It's now time for Oklahoma State, Coach Kurt Budke. Welcome,
Coach.  
KURT BUDKE: Thank you. It's great to be here in Kansas City. This is
definitely one of my old homes. This is one of the places I started my
coaching career, two years when I was at Kansas City Community College. My
daughter was born here. I think this is where I learned how to eat barbecue
right here. I think I counted one time, there was 93 barbecue places in Kansas
City, and I think I ate at 60 of them.  
I missed Kansas City. It's a great place. We're definitely excited to be here,
since this year we are higher, not being picked 12th, being picked 5th. I
heard someone say that we went from being the hunter to the hunted. And that's
probably true. But when you look at our conference, I think after the top two
people in the division who were picked one and two, I think three through 12,
you could mix that up any way you want to mix it, because I think our
conference is the strongest, 1 through 12 in the country.  
  
Q. You've had some time to let that sink in, what you guys did, going from,
when you thought about that three or four months later, what came to your mind
and how gratifying and satisfying was that?  
KURT BUDKE: Honestly, I've had my share of great wins in my career. What we
did last year with that team, unless you've lived through an 0-16 conference
record, it's tough. There's just no way to even understand what we went
through, when you've won your whole life, and then to go from that to the NCAA
tournament, obviously it says a lot about my assistant coaches. It says a lot
about the great job that they did to go out -- try to go out and recruit to an
0-16 program in the Big 12 and see how easy that is. But my assistant coaches
did an unbelievable job and we upgraded the talent. We were 5-8 last year, and
we had to win at Texas, home against No. 25 Nebraska and at Kansas State, all
three not very easy places to play. And the kids kept believing and felt good
about what they were doing and we pulled it off and we got in. Even as coaches
-- it was the very last second when we realized that we did have a chance for
the NCAA tournament. We had a big party last year on selection day, and we had
a couple hundred people come. And we didn't know if we were going to be in the
tournament or not. We knew it was quite a gamble to do that, but we still
wanted to celebrate the turnaround of what the girls did. When they put
Oklahoma State up on the board, I promise you there was no bigger reaction in
America than there was in that room that night.  
  
Q. The last months afterwards, what do you sense it meant to Oklahoma State
as a school? A very basketball tradition-rich program, and it's in your state
where Sherri's team gets all the publicity?  
KURT BUDKE: Sherri who? No, I mean obviously it got us on the map a little
bit. We were able to go in kids' homes now -- the year before we went in the
homes and said we're going to turn this around. Now we can show that we're in
the NCAA tournament, we turned it quicker than we thought. And it meant a lot
for us in recruiting this year across the nation, when you win as an NCAA
tournament team. It obviously opens doors.  
Have we got the top ten recruits in America to come to Oklahoma State? No. But
at least part of them watched us on the NCAA tournament. Oklahoma State is a
very proud basketball school. And women's basketball is something that has
just lagged behind here the last couple of years. Those crowds that you see
for men's basketball are slowly starting to come and help us a little bit,
too. I think that's the next step we have to take as a program is really start
filling those seats to be a legitimate top-20 contender.  
  
Q. For a long time Texas A &M and Oklahoma State were the two stragglers in
the Big 12 South. Gary was able to come in and with a lot of hard work turn
that around but a similar coaching style as you. Maybe you don't necessarily
have a lot of stars, but have a lot of hard working players that he develops.
Can you talk about watching him and what he did in the Big 12 and coming in
and trying to do the same thing?   
KURT BUDKE: We had the influence of Leon Barmore, and I think if you look at
A&M and Baylor, and we're trying to play that way now, a little more
aggressive, a little physical, a little more up and down. You'll see the same
thing at Texas Tech as they continue to turn that. We use that as motivation
for our kids. We talked about Baylor's turnaround and Texas A&M's turnaround,
it's not easy but it is possible. And I think it gives you players and your
coaches some hope that it can be done.  
Gary has done an unbelievable job. And he's very deserving to be picked No. 1
in the conference. With all that talent he has back, he should probably win
the national championship. Did he leave yet?  
PETER IRWIN: He's going to love that pressure.  
  
Q. Andrea said she didn't get comfortable until about the last three games
of last season. Can you talk about how she progressed during the course of her
freshman season and what it means -- what you expect from her this season?  
KURT BUDKE: I think you go back to this last question of when you look at our
teams in the past I've never had anybody jump out and average 20 points a
game. And that was hard for her to understand right away that we had to have
more people involved if we were going to be good. And she did struggle at
times and it was a roller coaster. We knew when we handed the reins over to a
freshman point guard, there was no question there was going to be some tough
times. But she just kept maturing, kept listening, kept a great attitude the
whole way through, and she's never going to doubt herself, that's never going
to happen. She's a very confident young lady. What she has to be concerned
about this year is everybody talks about sophomore slumps. Well, sophomore
slumps happen because freshmen who were kind of under the radar just a little
bit as freshmen aren't under the radar anymore. Game plans will be to try to
be more aware of her and what she's doing. But she's worked so hard in the
offseason. She puts her time in the gym. She wants to be a great player. I
think for us to be better I think we are starting 1, 2 and 3 back, I think all
three of them have to be better players this year, and I'm sure they will.  
  
Q. Talk about Courtney Paris. What are your thoughts about that, what kind
of player she is and the impact she has?  
KURT BUDKE: You can ask every coach in here that question and there's no
answer to it. I'm a huge fan of Courtney and she knows that. If she's not the
best player in the country then -- she's got great hands. What people don't
realize about Courtney, she might be the best passer on the team, too. If you
go double or triple or whatever you want to do, she'll find the open person
for an easy shot. She is very hard to guard. I'm sure their question mark this
year is they did surround her with four great shooters last year, so who is
going to step up? Because that's going to change how everybody guards Courtney
this year. I don't care what you do to her, you're going to look up at the end
of the night she's going to have 20 points, 15 rebound, and get your two posts
in foul trouble. She's that good a player. She's very, very special.  
PETER IRWIN: We wish you the best of luck for the season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 16, 2007

  

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: Coach Gary Blair from Texas A&M University. Coach, welcome.  
GARY BLAIR: Welcome. Good to be here. I would really like to invite all the
media to Joni James's reception that she's going to have for everybody when
she gets married. It's going to be an open bar, Joni James, we accept full
accommodations, don't go cheap, we want the full bar, and congratulations,
Joni.  
It's good to be in Kansas City. As we were coming in the airport, I was
telling my kids, probably the biggest highlight of my coaching career is when
we made the Final Four in '98. And we left the West Coast, got there Tuesday,
back home to Fayetteville and you had to come up here on Wednesday, got in
here about 4 o'clock, and we flew into that airport there and as soon as we
came in we saw the big billboard, welcome to the Final Four. So Kansas City
has always been fond memories for me. It's a great city. My wife got her
doctorate up here when we were at Fayetteville, coming for the medicine center
here. Kansas City is a great town. We're glad to be here. Hopefully next
spring we can stay a little bit longer than we did against Tennessee when we
played them in the Final Four. That didn't last long. I'm glad to be here.
I've never seen a green Kansas City hat, but that's good.  
  
Q. Gary, what factors have to come together for this team to get you to
another Final Four?  
GARY BLAIR: Wow, health. We've got the kids. We're not very healthy right now.
We've got a lot of kids that are banged up right now for the first time that I
can remember in 10 or 15 years. We've got to get healthy and we've got to stay
hungry. We will not be the sleeper that's coming up. People would look at us
last year, some of our opponents and say, yeah, they play good hard-nosed
defense, but who's going to get 20 and 10 from them each night. We didn't know
who was going to get 20 and 10 because we pass that torch around. That's what
our team is made up of. Our leading scorer averaged 14, and it's probably
going to be the same this year. We've got our top six back, almost our top ten
back. We've got three very good recruits coming in, two guards, one from the
Kansas City area, Tyra White, who we're expecting a lot out of this year. And
it's nice to be the hunted for once. Oklahoma had that for the last couple of
years. And in one way they're still the hunted. When you have Courtney Paris,
I think all roads lead to Norman. But you've got to come through College
Station first. I think that's going to be fun.  
Can we live up to all the hype and expectations? Can we put bodies in the seat
now without having to do gimmicks? Can they stand up and pay their money at
the window and say we want to see quality, we want to see a top ten basketball
team, are they for real? Hopefully we can live up to it. This is what we're in
coaching for. I'm tired of being Cinderella. I'm the oldest Cinderella there
is, and so we'll relish it at the top. Now what we've got to do is try to live
up to it. But you're living up to it in the hardest conference, top to bottom,
in the country. 1 through 12, no one can compete with what we have.  
  
Q. Talk about having a bull's eye on his back, but what was it like in the
offseason, through the offseasons you've had in the past, to where this
offseason, being Big 12 champs and being able to say that and tell kids that,
how much of a difference does that make?  
GARY BLAIR: It was huge, particularly in the national scene. We were able to
get in certain homes or threes when we would say who we were on the phone,
they automatically said, hey, I saw you play Oklahoma. I saw you play George
Washington or Baylor or Texas or somebody, and so television helps out a lot,
but this conference helps out a lot. Because in the midwest and the southern
part of the country, we lead the nation in attendance. And we lead the nation
probably in media exposure, and that's a tribute to you guys, and I think it's
a tribute to what you're producing out there. We all have good marketing
departments and I think our head coaches around this league, we sell ourselves
pretty well. But it's a constant battle, because women's athletics, not just
women's basketball will always be in the grass roots stage. We're growing and
growing and growing and that's our job to keep it growing.  
And what's so nice is when I look around here -- when I first started in this
game and the college game at LA Tech, we were having fashion editors come
cover us in New York. People that got stuck would draw the assignment of
covering women's basketball. You are here because you want to be here, you
didn't draw the short end of the stick, you drew the right end of the stick.
And that's what's so good about our game. And of all the stories that you can
write about our players, I encourage all of you to write more human interest
stories about our young ladies in the conference, besides the negative stories
of the won and loss. There's so many stories out there that need to be told.
And you're the media that can do it.  
Wearing this ring instead of my Arkansas Final Four ring for years, I just put
it on yesterday. It's nice to come up here with a Big 12 championship ring.
But I always told my kids I would always wear that Final Four ring at Arkansas
until we won our own ring, here. I did the same thing when I left Stephen F.,
went to Arkansas, until we got our Final Four ring. I word my Steven F same
way from Louisiana Tech, I wore a national championship ring until we got a
Sweet 16 ring from Stephen F.  
During the summer when I got to the golf course, there wasn't a damn friend of
mine that recognized anything, I still had to give up scores on almost every
match I played. We're opening up in his hometown, and my hometown November the
9th. Folks, our first three games we're playing the No. 5 team in the world,
the Chinese National Team, that has a number of WNBA players and then we're
playing SMU in Dallas on November the 9th, and it's their best team since
2000, and Rhonda has really worked hard to get that team up. Then we come back
on Sunday and play the U.S. National Team. We'll get our lunch handed to us,
but at the same time we're one of the 8 schools along with Baylor in our
conference that's getting a chance to play the U.S. National Team. And that's
tremendous for our conference. We're playing the best of the best.  
And if any of you all could get down to the game, I encourage you to do that.
People don't realize that team is coming in will be the best team either in
men or women's ball to ever play in either one of our two facilities, when you
start playing the Olympic team. It's going to be great for us. We're going to
enjoy that moment. I don't know what the score will be, but we're going to
have fun playing.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how your team is -- you don't have what I guess you'd
say are superstar type players, you do have a lot of complimentary players,
players with maybe superstar ability, but that's not necessarily how you play.
How has that style worked for you over the course of your career?  
GARY BLAIR: I think it works first with your assistant coaches on who you
hire. Can they teach the game and coach the game, not just recruit the game?
And I think that's where too many staffs fall short on. We develop kids. And I
think that's the strength of our program. That's why we're getting a lot of
the kids that we're getting because you go back and you look at what we start
with, they might not be a top ten player in the country, but all of a sudden
we're doing a good job of developing what we have. Kids don't leave our
program, they stay. They graduate. And I think that's important.  
Now like when you look at a Tennessee and a Connecticut for the 08 recruiting
class, if you keep up with the website, they committed 8 out of the top 15 in
the country between those two programs. That sort of gets old, but at the same
time my little band that I've got and we're going to play super hard, and if
you think a Mulkey is going to back down to a Tennessee or a Sherri Coale is
going to back down to a Connecticut or something, it isn't going to happen.
This league plays hard. And we'll stand up to anybody. Of course Oklahoma has
got the premier player in the nation this year, probably in Courtney Paris.
Probably it will be her, Candace Parker or Sylvia Fowles, but each of those
three can be defended. That's what you have to do. You have to build your team
around defense first, and that's what we did. Even though every player on our
team was recruited for their offensive ability, we teach them how to play
defense early. And that's how you get playing time for us, defense, and we
could become a better rebounding team and get a little more inside scoring
this year, I think will improve. You've got to, your same kids are back.  
Let me ask the media a question. I got my journalism thing at Texas Tech, so I
get the right to ask a question. Where do you see the growth in women's
basketball? What is it going to take for us to go to that next level? Is it
separate weekends for our Final Four? Is it separate weekends for our
conference tournament? Where do you see the growth of this game going? How
much better can it get? I'd love to hear that answer so I can say it on TV in
the next room. Anybody got the answer?  
  
Q. I don't know. We went from 8 sites to 16 sites?  
GARY BLAIR: The 8 sites was horrible.  
We played in front of I think 250 family and friends at the first game against
our sister, Texas Arlington, and then we played in front of George Washington
in front of about 550, no matter what they announced on attendance. But
everything else about the tournament was well run. You felt like you were
making a movie and you had to get to the theaters to see it or to the
television, because nobody was there.  
  
Q. More money is being pumped into the sport than ever before.  
GARY BLAIR: It's being pumped into the sport, but we're growing as far as
attendance. We've got a better chance of growth, just think of where soccer
was years ago, look at soccer today, we're hosting the national championship
there this year, we had 5,500 there Friday night and then we had 12,800 for
Maroon Madness and Soulja Boy. I'm a Soulja coach. To see a 16-year-old pied
piper just holding the crowd. As coaches we'd love to do that, but he could
hold the crowd.  
  
Q. I think until the West Coast sites prove they can draw, the NCAA tries to
do the egalitarian thing, how about spreading it to the places that are proven
draws? Until other places -- they might pony up the money, but they don't
deliver the crowd.  
GARY BLAIR: I think you've only got three places in the west that could ever
draw, that has ever shown they can draw and that's Stanford, Washington and
New Mexico and possibly we could get Arizona State on that map, to me that's
it. And it wouldn't be fair to the rest of us, if we're always at those same
four sites all the time. Hopefully we'll keep growing.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Courtney, you and I just went through this in New York, when
you were in the National Team. We did something similar. Your experiences
playing with the National Team and what you gained from that that will help
you this season?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I gained a lot. I got an opportunity to be around some great
people who have played at the highest level. So that was great. And to go up
against them. So I was challenged every day. I felt like I got better. I
played with some great coaches. It was just a real experience for me,
something I never thought I'd get to do.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: What was Russia like and Chile like?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I don't know what Chile was like, because we had five games in
a row. So we stayed in our hotel a lot, hung out there talking with people.
But Russia, it was a little different. It was a little cloudier, but I had a
good time there. There were great kids with me and it was fun.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Taylor, you have played in every game but two in your career
at Kansas. Talk about how important it is to be durable, to balance all the
things for a student athlete and player, and taking care of your body.  
TAYLOR MCINTOSH: First of all, I guess, I didn't start the first game in the
career. The freshman year you want to do whatever you can do to get on the
court. But I think we do so much in the season, so you have to stay hydrated
and eat right and all the things your coaches already are telling you about.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Toccara, could you take a little bit from what Taylor said
and follow-up with how important it is to make sure that you maintain the
balance that it takes to be a student athlete at this level?  
TOCCARA ROSS: It's definitely big steps, especially coming from junior
college. It's a little bit different. Just overall the balance of staying
together, knowing what commitment you have to take at this level. It's an
everyday step. And without your teammates it's important. So overall the
balance, you learn to adjust.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: With that adjustment, Jhasmine, comes a lot of attention and
a lot of notoriety. And of course Baylor is -- the program has grown leaps and
bounds since Kim took over. How do you manage all the publicity and attention
that you receive as a student athlete, because you're really under the
microscope all the time.  
JHASMINE PLAYER: Our coaches are responsible. And we kind of mirror that
image. The coach teaches us things on the floor as well as off the floor,
because Waco is a small community. We're going to see someone we know, so we
watch things we do. It's a blessing to have that many people support the
basketball team there.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: You mentor every week at a juvenile detention center. Why do
you do that and what do you gain from that?  
ERNEISHA BAILEY: I like giving back to our community. Austin is a very large
city and there are kids that are going under the radar, and I want to take
some time in my busy schedule to let them know that there are people that care
about them. And I'm going to give them an hour of my time to just show them
and I'll shoot baskets, I'll talk to you, do whatever you want to do to have
fun and let you know that this life you're living, you need some positiveness
in your life, and I can be that light.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Is there any particular relationship that you've been able
to develop with a youngster that you look forward to seeing every Friday or
you know they're looking forward to seeing you?  
ERNEISHA BAILEY: I see them all. They always talk about my shoes, because they
don't get to see them, I guess, but they're talking about things like clothes
and stuff, because they don't get much. There's not one that stands out more
than the others.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Alyssa, things that you like to do in your spare time, when
you have some? Life of a student athlete is very time consuming, balancing
everything. You said you like to write poetry, why, and where did that start?  
ALYSSA HOLLINS: I don't know. I remember when I was 13 I read something in one
of my classes and I was inspired by it. I thought it was neat that you could
-- the way you could say something and rhyme words and make it have an impact.
I always liked it. I was just really into it. I started writing a little bit.
I don't know how good it is, but I enjoy it. It's relaxing.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Courtney, you are working on your communications degree. I
read where you're interested in maybe being a novelist one day. For all the
writers in the room today, do you have any idea of what you may like to write
or are you in the process of writing something now?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I don't know. Just anything. I love to write, just fiction,
makeup stories. I think that's the dream job. I love to play basketball, but
writing is my passion and story telling. That's something I'd really like to,
in my career and life to do.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: No idea, no outline going, no --  
COURTNEY PARIS: Those are my secrets.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: You don't want to give out any of your secrets? We'll wait.  
Toccara, you are from the same town as Coach Fennelly, Davenport. He is quite
a legend in many parts of Iowa, many parts of the Big 12. What is it like
being the only senior on the team this year and having to feel like you're
going to be responsible for a lot that goes on with practice and with being a
leader?  
TOCCARA ROSS: It's a big job, especially -- I was a junior college kid, so I
came in, obviously as a junior, it was kind of like I was a freshman right
away. To be put in that position of being senior, it's a tough task, but I
think my teammates have helped me a lot. We understand there's not going to be
one set leader on the team.  
There's 13 of us, there's going to be 13 leaders, and we also have to follow
each other as well. Knowing that I have people surrounding me, helping me
every day, adjusting, that's going to help a lot. And down the road we'll see
the benefits of that definitely.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Taylor, your parents are both college basketball players,
and your mom played at Wichita State. What have you been able to learn from
your mother that has helped you with your own game?  
TAYLOR MCINTOSH: She played a different position, she was a point guard. And
I'm more an inside player. But she always encouraged me to play at an early
age, because I was so tall. But I didn't come around until about middle
school, but she said if you're going to play, play, give it all your effort
and energy, and if you're not, you're not. So that's the biggest message I got
from her.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Jhas, the Jones Cup experience this summer, talk about that
a little bit, because you got a chance to meet a lot of players in the Big 12
and play with them.  
JHASMINE PLAYER: Yeah, my teammate Rachel Allison and I were I guess blessed
with the opportunity to go to Taiwan and play under Vic Schaefer, and we
played alongside a lot of people out of the Big 12. Those are people we never
get a chance to meet. So the best example would be Rush, we thought she was
the devil. Because we were always playing against Leah, and then we got there
and were playing with Leah, and we found Leah is probably one of the most
inspirational players I played with.  
It was great to know those people on a personal level. It was a good
opportunity for myself and my teammates. And we thank Vic and everyone who
helped support us.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Coach Goestenkors makes you guys read, outside of what's
required in your academic work. Why and what have you read and what do you do
after you read it?  
ERNEISHA BAILEY: This summer when we were done with summer school, Coach
Goestenkors assigned us books to read. And mine was The Right to Lead. And it
was inspirational quotes from leaders. Someone read The Secret. And when we
came back we had to do a book report and explain what happened in the book and
you couldn't just get like Spark Notes, because Coach Goestenkors read all the
books. She knew exactly what was going on. And we had to write a book report
and go back to our team. And we were in the process of going through all the
book reports.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Your team was picked 12th. It's not a place you're familiar
being picked. Talk about a little chip on your shoulder and what you can prove
and what you've been doing in the offseason to get ready for the conference
play?  
ALYSSA HOLLINS: Being picked 12th, I think it's a blessing in disguise. We
didn't before, but now we do. We were picked last, but everyone knows we have
to put in work. In practice coach has been focusing on details and being
detail oriented. We know the little things are going to be what push us over.
We have a lot of girls, everybody is a brand-new, fresh face, and working hard
and to prove that we're talented. And we're better than the 12th pick.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Jhasmine, Coach Mulkey has what has been termed Mulkeyisms,
some of it is from her southern upbringing. She said if you wallow with pigs
you'll smell like them. What does she share with guys in practice, and what
other Mulkeyisms are out there?  
JHASMINE PLAYER: Coach Mulkey shares with us life in practice. Whatever she
goes through, she shares it with us the next day in practice. She makes us
make sure we know -- when we're outside the gym, whoever you hang around or
associate yourself with is what you're going to be like. She tells us -- she
asked us about 24 times in practice how good do we want to be, and that's just
-- we've lost a lot of players in the last couple of years. So someone now has
to step up. She tells us the difference between doing something part way right
and all the way right is the difference between winning and losing.  
When we get in the game if we do those little things wrong, it could be the
difference in the game. She tells us a lot of things. She's a really good
coach. And when you sit back and think about it, I guess when you grow up you
learn a lot.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Toccara, you worked Connecticut's basketball camp this
summer, and what did you gain from that?  
TOCCARA ROSS: I would say coaching experience. I've always been in the
uniform. And this was a chance for me to step outside of it and experience
that. I developed a passion, a love, over one or two summers, seeing the type
of kids that come in from that program, being able to help these kids was
probably the most important thing I've ever had to do in my life, to see a
smile on a kid's face, when they've never touched a basketball, let alone
played with other people, and it was motivating to me. And something I brought
back to my teammates.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Taylor, with you and Toccara both being in the north and
having only Oklahoma on your schedule once, unless you meet them in a
tournament, you both are undersized post players, you have to guard Courtney,
and you get one more shot at it, is there anything you want to ask Courtney,
you might like to know about her game right now? Ask her.  
TAYLOR MCINTOSH: I was thinking about this. The only thing I was going to ask
you about is how is it playing with your sister? Do you guys ever argue or
anything in practice?  
COURTNEY PARIS: Every once in a while we'll start doing our at-home bickering,
like the team will say, Ashley, you be quiet. No, you be quiet. The coach
says, what are you doing? It's fun, though. It's cool, being able to
experience something as big as college and playing Division 1 basketball,
since you guys are doing it you know how big it is, but to do it with your
family, and let alone with your twin sister, it's awesome.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: What about sharing the car?  
COURTNEY PARIS: She doesn't drive. I'm her driver. She has a personal driver.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: She says, Pick me up outside of class, I'll be ready, take
me over here?  
COURTNEY PARIS: Exactly. I don't mind it. I love driving.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Can I get your cellphone number?  
What about Toccara, what do you want to ask Courtney?  
TOCCARA ROSS: Do you plan on missing any games during the Big 12, Courtney?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I hope not.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Courtney, in Norman and all around the Big 12, you get so
much attention. Whenever you go somewhere people know who you and Ashley are.
And it's got to have changed your life. How do you maintain your own privacy,
and how do you balance all that when you're in the grocery store and someone
wants your autograph, or you go to the movies and everybody is whispering?  
COURTNEY PARIS: Sometimes it is frustrating, because you want to be -- you are
running late, but then you realize there was a time when women weren't allowed
to play, and have people, grown men coming to you, and saying hey, can I get a
picture, it's pretty humbling. I have to remember that I'm representing a good
cause and it's worth it.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: The last two years at Texas you guys have won a combined 31
games. Coach Goestenkors comes and she's had 7 straight years where she's won
30 plus. What is the most physically challenging thing that she has asked you
all to do so far, since she got to the job in April? Please don't say it was
reading a book.  
ERNEISHA BAILEY: No, she wants us to be mentally tough. I know I struggled
with this, this was probably the worst thing I struggled with my whole college
year. She wanted us to be mentally tough. She wanted us to run a mile. And
guards had to get in at a certain time. My time was 6:45. I hadn't ran a mile
since eighth grade. So it took me probably 7 weeks to get it in 6:43, finally.
But she wants us to be mentally tough. And a lot of things that we do, like
she makes it we'll do drill for ten minutes and you'll be fatigued and tired
and want to quit and that's when you have to get tough mentally, and she's
training us, because being mentally tough is what's going to win games.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Alyssa, you have that big pancake breakfast coming up. What
is that all about? And share what the team does at that?  
ALYSSA HOLLINS: Homecoming weekend, it's part of the festivities. In the rec
center, there's a big pancake breakfast, anybody that can walk through and
watch us scrimmage. It's a lot of fun. For a lot of people it's part of the
homecoming day. We enjoy it. The best part might be all the pancakes and
sausage afterwards, but it's a good time.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Courtney, there's a lot of comparison, people make the
comparison between you and the other CP3, Candace Parker at Tennessee. You
split a lot of the National Player of the Year awards last year, and now you
have a chance to play with her and get to know her a little bit. Assess your
relationship with her a little bit and how you guys have become friends and
how you're really two different players and there's no comparison?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think it was cool that we got to spend this last September
together. We played together before high school, before she came to college,
and we were cool and friends and we were roommates. And then we got to college
and it was the rivalry thing; who's better. It's more people saying it instead
of you. I never got a chance to talk to her and be around her. But that stuff
sits there. It was cool to be around her and it's just like -- obviously she's
a totally different player, I'm a totally different player. None of it
matters. We're normal kids trying to do what we love. And she's a sweetheart,
a great person and just fun to be around. But I think that rivalry is good for
women's basketball, but it's nothing personal.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: E-Bai, you're from Kansas City, you told me your high school
was down a few blocks. What would it mean in your senior year to have a chance
to win that?  
ERNEISHA BAILEY: This would mean a lot. We haven't really been a force, and I
think this year we have all the keys to being successful, and coming back to
Kansas City my senior year, and not being on the bench will make this
experience a good one. I want to do well in the tournament and play well in
front of my parents and people from church, my hometown, my coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2007

  

### [Darnell Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13718)

### [Brandon Rush](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17071)

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We are ready to begin with the Kansas Jayhawks. Student athletes
will be here shortly. Let's start with Coach Self.  
  
Q. What's your reaction with getting a 1 seed?  
COACH BILL SELF: To be honest with you, I'm pretty worn out right now, so it
wasn't a -- I wasn't ecstatic. I thought we would get 1 seed if we won today.  
Of course, I'm sure we made it -- if they made the selection before the game
was over, then I'm sure that had a chance to hurt our seed being down 22.  
But, I really am not that fired up right now. I will be, but I'm worn out. I'm
tired. I think our players are, too.  
  
Q. Bill, after what you guys have been through with Durant before, were you
ever intimidated in this one?  
COACH BILL SELF: The first time we played them at least we could score. It's
32-10 with nine minutes left in the first half and, you know, we missed some
good looks and we were too tight in pressing and everything.  
I don't want to play him again. He was better today than he was the last time
we played him. I had a NBA GM call me and ask me, you know, if it was -- asked
me how the game was. I said we didn't guard anybody. We didn't play any
defense after the first game. He said, Bill, that's not a defensive problem,
that's a recruiting problem. I mean, this guy is a joke. He is a joke. You can
plug him into any team in the country at any level and he can score, NBA,
whatever, just plug him in and he can go get baskets.  
It's unbelievable how good he is. We did a bad job on him early. He scored
eight points before the first T.V. time out. We tried to make some adjustments
and none of them worked.  
But then, I thought, Brandon, you know, we held him to 15 in the second half
and I feel great about that. We did do a better job in the second half. Took
away his three-point shot better.  
  
Q. A lot of times in the tournament, you have trouble preparing for teams or
not enough time. Is your situation going to be any more difficult, do you
think?  
COACH BILL SELF: Because we play the play-in game? I don't think so. I don't
think so. If anything -- the one thing we will not do is look ahead, so this
gives us two days and our players know we can focus in on Illinois and
Villanova, two days, but we don't know who we are playing yet.  
The second that game is over, we will know who we are playing and we can spend
Wednesday and Thursday totally focused on that team. So we'll watch tape on
both those teams beforehand but still, though -- I think sometimes you can
have too much time to spend on an opponent. I think this may break it up and
be a good thing for us.  
  
Q. Talking about Durant again, when you get into the NCAA tournament, how
much confidence does it give your guys to say nobody will throw any more at
them than he can?  
COACH BILL SELF: There is some opponents we could play in the early rounds
that have guys that can go for big numbers because they have all done that.
The guys on the teams have done that.  
But we are not going to see another one like this. But, still yet, he goes
fourteen for thirty. Our whole deal was to make him work to score. If he would
have told me he missed 16 shots, I would say we played unbelievable defense.
He is just different.  
He is the best I have ever seen. If you ask me about comparisons today, I
probably have a few better analogies because I have had a chance to think
about it a lot.  
  
Q. Coach, after the last two years' NCAA tournament, what have you taken
away from those and maybe what your team has as you approach this year?  
COACH BILL SELF: Well, you know, we are going to get hit with that question a
lot. Up until two years ago, we had never lost in the first round and had only
lost in the second round twice, if I am not mistaken.  
We've experienced success in the tournament at our stops. The last two years
have been miserable from an NCAA tournament standpoint, from an off-season
standpoint and from exiting early.  
I will tell you this, this team had nothing to do with the Bucknell loss.
Nothing. They didn't score one point in the game, nothing.  
I do think this, that this team -- last year's team was not as prepared as
this year's team and we were very young. Three freshmen and two sophomores
starting and it was a different type of feel when we got into the tournament
and we played a team that was obviously very good. If they are good enough to
beat Kansas and Pittsburgh in the same weekend.  
I don't know if we will do a lot different, but I think our focus will be
better. I think hopefully we have learned how to focus better than we did last
year. I think when you have never been in it, in the game, so to speak, the
big game, and you get into it basically for one week and now distractions
start coming your way and being able to focus and eliminate those, I don't
think we did as good a job last year as I hope we do this year.  
  
Q. Coach, kind of a two-part question. If somebody is from Oklahoma, what
does it mean to you to win the Big 12 tournament in Oklahoma City and also
your opinion on the way Oklahoma City, their job of hosting the tournament. Do
you think it will come back here?  
COACH BILL SELF: It will come back here. From my perspective, I moved out of
here after Bricktown was all made up and done. I haven't spent any time down
there. From my perspective, I would think this is a good place to have it from
the fans' standpoint.  
To think the crowd was this good today and you didn't have an Oklahoma school
playing, I think, bodes well not only for our fans but fans in the area. I'm
sure they will get it back.  
It needs to come to Kansas City. I'm selfish from that standpoint. We like it
in Kansas City the most. But I think Oklahoma City did a fabulous job,
fabulous job.  
Today, I was able to call my high school coach and my best friends in high
school and some things like that to come up with extra tickets today and I
thought it was cool they could have come to the game because they wouldn't
have had a chance other than that.  
It meant a lot to have my family and a lot of close friends here also.  
  
Q. Considering the last -- the two games against Texas the way they played
out, can this team take anybody's best shot in the tournament and still stand
up?  
COACH BILL SELF: Trust me, we don't try to get down 22 again. The one thing
about Texas -- when we play them, the game is a lot faster than it was against
K-State or Oklahoma. 22 isn't quite as many because there is so many more
possessions in the game.  
And so even though we were down 22 at 32 to 10, it looked like we could get
blown out. I still sense there was time.  
Being down -- some people, 13 is like being down 20. Being down, some people
20 is like being down 13. That's the way Texas and us both play.  
We were up 4, 5 coming out of time out and the next time you know they score 7
straight points in 35 seconds. There were a lot of points scored in short
spurts.  
  
Q. Bill, often the Big 12 title game can be anti-climactic for a lot of
people because it is right before the selection show and everybody is fired up
about that. Is it that way for the players and the coaches? Was this game any
different because it was such a fantastic game?  
COACH BILL SELF: I think the question -- I think the best way to put that is
this is one of the most fun games to play in and coach in because when the
game is over, it is over. Most times after a game or after a loss, you go --
can't sleep for days and all that stuff. Your excitement level immediately
gets picked right back up by the selection show.  
So I can't speak for Rick, but I would say Rick probably said, you know
something, that was a great game to be a part of. And during the regular
season or whatever you don't feel that way because you got to win.  
I thought this was a fun game to play from the players' perspective, certainly
a fun game to coach in because to me there wasn't that much pressure in the
game today. The pressure was getting to today but there wasn't as much
pressure actually playing or coaching in the game today.  
  
Q. Coach, this whole week there was a lot of talk about who and who would
not get in from this conference, K-State ends up not getting in. You were
pretty adamant that they should have early on. Just your thoughts on only four
getting in and K-State -- or I guess five got in.  
COACH BILL SELF: Every coach in our league would say we don't like it. It also
happened two years ago when Colorado was 10-6 in the league and didn't get in.  
If I'm not mistaken, was that three years in a row we have only gotten four? I
may be -- is that right?  
We don't like that. We need to look at ourselves to see what we can do
differently from a marketing, from a RPI standpoint, from a scheduling
standpoint, so hopefully if you go 10-6 in your league this never happens
again.  
The committee has got a tough job and you can skew anything to make it look
your way. Without studying some of the teams that got in as at-larges, I would
say Texas -- K-State's resume was every bit as impressive and deserved to get
in.  
A lot of upsets in the tournaments and last year there wasn't very many but
there was certainly upsets that stole some bids and that may have been one of
theirs.  
  
Q. Bill, along the same lines, this game being quite a showcase for the Big
12 and the Big 12 still not getting maybe all the respect it deserves, don't
you or Texas or Texas A &M -- this league needs to win a national championship
to get the respect?   
COACH BILL SELF: You know something, Jason, I would say yes. We just need to
go play well, too.  
We need to have teams have success in the tournament. Of course we have been
on the forefront of being the school that didn't deliver the last two years.
But we need to go play extended games in the tournament. I agree with that
100%.  
But I will say this about our league, best player in the country plays in it.
Most fun guy to watch play. The most clutch player in the country plays in it.
The coach that just won his 808th game coaches in it. And you had about four
epic games that were as good as any game played all year long in any league.
If you are an outsider watching those, how can you not be impressed with the
league? That's what blows my mind.  
If you are watching that today, you're watching A&M at Texas or Texas at
Oklahoma State or if you're watching -- what was the other -- Texas-KU, yeah
(smiling), yeah, if you were watching that game, you would think, God, are
there that many good games, good players in this league? Because there was
some stand-outs.  
  
Q. Bill, one more question about the scheduling aspect of it. Everybody
wants to be a good partner for the league. But how do you balance, you know,
doing what could help the league versus what you had to do to help yourself?  
COACH BILL SELF: See, this was a terrible year from an RPI standpoint to have
a coaching change of six because when you look at it, the coaches are higher
and they have to win confidence. And you win confidence by playing a schedule.
You look at our nonconference record, it is the second or third best in 11
years of the league.  
So you win games to get confidence. But you didn't play enough good people so
that your conference RPI is six. Our conference RPI should not be six. It
should be in the top four every year.  
Now, how do we get it there? Better play obviously. Maybe schedule a little
smarter. But the appearance was, it's because of the way that our league
scheduled, and rightfully so, because coaches' jobs are to win games and
starting to build confidence in their transitional phase, the appearance of
the RPI is that, hey, we were seventh in the overall RPI until conference play
started.  
I mean, it isn't the seventh best team, but we scheduled the 15th toughest
schedule of all the leagues. You can't do that if you are one of the four best
leagues. We just have to be a little smarter scheduling.  
CHARLIE FISS: We are joined by our student-athletes from Kansas, Darnell
Jackson and Brandon Rush. Any questions for them?  
  
Q. Brandon, why were you able to slow down Kevin Durant?  
BRANDON RUSH: I tried to pressure him, make him use his right hand a lot more.
My team helped me out a lot by helping out other players.  
  
Q. Darnell, take me through your big block at the end of the game, how were
you able to get so cleanly and what do you think it meant for the team?  
DARNELL JACKSON: I just told myself to make sure I have strong helping
Augustin drives. I just went over there and put my arms straight up and jumped
and came down with the ball and got fouled. Brandon told me to make these free
throws so I made them and they helped us out and helped the team out.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your level of confidence right now, taking the shots
that you've taken over the last couple weeks and coming back and finishing
11-0? What's your confidence level like?  
BRANDON RUSH: Our confidence level is pretty high right now. Just making big
plays at the right time. That's all I can say.  
DARNELL JACKSON: Just like Brandon, the same. When we're out there, we just
always have to think next play because we are always going to make a mistake.
Everybody knows we have a lot of players that can come off the bench and made
good plays for us. Everybody right now is real confident.  
  
Q. Brandon, you will probably get this question a lot. Coming off of last
year's first-round loss, what do you think you and the team learned from that
and how maybe you will approach the game differently, if at all, this
season?  
BRANDON RUSH: We got to come in the game with a different mind-set than what
we did last year. Stay focused on what we are trying to do and that's try to
get past the first round and lead on to whatever, whatever leads up after
that.  
  
Q. Darnell, talk about that block you made right there in the closing
seconds of overtime that pretty much sealed the deal?  
DARNELL JACKSON: It was a big block. I came down with it, and I made it. I got
a chance to make two free throws to help the team to get a good lead.  
I feel good about the block.  
CHARLIE FISS: Guys thank you for coming. Again, congratulations. Good luck
next week.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2007

  

### [A.J. Abrams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15572)

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

### [Kevin Durant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17055)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We will get started with the Texas student-athletes. As you can
see, Kevin and A.J. are here for questions.  
  
Q. A.J., can you talk about their -- they seem to really tighten up on the
perimeter there in OT and just seems like you all were having a tough time
getting good looks there.  
A.J. ABRAMS: They're a good defensive team. They kind of cracked down when it
came to clutch time, so we got to give them credit. They made plays in
overtime.  
  
Q. For both Kevin and A.J., you talk about swagger a lot, even in the loss.
You take that swagger into the NCAA?  
KEVIN DURANT: Oh, yeah. It is the bigger picture. It is a bigger week next
week. We just got to bounce back off this loss and get ready for the
tournament.  
A.J. ABRAMS: We are always going to carry a swagger about us. That's what we
do. We are going -- we are disappointed we lost, but we did a lot of good
things out there and we can build from that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Oklahoma City as a host venue for the Big 12?  
A.J. ABRAMS: It was a great setup. They had the girls across the street from
us and we were in here.  
I think it was a great place for basketball for the fans and for the players.  
  
Q. Kevin, you had such a hot first half. Can you talk about the defensive
effort, I guess Rush and some of their other guys did on you in the second
half?  
KEVIN DURANT: They didn't do anything different. I missed easy shots. They did
a great job pushing me out of the lane and helped the defense. I credit them.  
I just was missing shots and they did a great job.  
CHARLIE FISS: Good game today. Good luck in the NCAA tournament.  
Joined now by Coach Barnes of Texas. Coach, your thoughts on today's game.  
COACH RICK BARNES: Great game. I really -- I told our team before the game, we
just wanted to be in a position in the last four minutes to win it. Obviously
we got off to a great start.  
You know, whether it was us getting off to a great start or them getting off
to a great start, I felt it would be one of those games where both teams would
go at each other and come down to the kind of game it was.  
We had our chances, and they made obviously a big three and even in overtime
we had some chances. And the free throws hurt us a little bit.  
Nonetheless, I'm proud of our guys. I thought a lot of good things happened
here this week. We're disappointed but it is over and done with and we will
move on to next week.  
  
Q. Coach, you kind of talked about all the positives. Can you expand on
that? Because it seems like you guys were able to come back in one game. You
did a lot of things in this tournament. Can you just talk about those
things?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Again, I think we've got a team, I think we're a confident
team. I think we're a tough team. I think for a group of guys that started
from ground zero and to be where we are right now, I'm proud of the way
they've grown throughout the season.  
I am proud of the way they've gone into different situations and competed
every night. Regular season, post-season, we came up a few plays short here,
but nonetheless, I'm happy for these guys because they've continued to get
better and we're playing -- if they're a No. 1 seed, we're not far behind and
we are playing pretty good basketball right now.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the decision with 22 seconds left about to have D.J.
go for the quick two instead of a three to tie the game?  
COACH RICK BARNES: That's what we thought. He had a couple different options.
He could go to a two or to a dribble hand-off. We know they would defend the
three-point line very well. They obviously defended the basket well, too. It
worked out for them, it didn't for us.  
Again, we will put it in his hand and let him make the play. We felt like he
could get by and we wanted him to and he had some other ways he could go with
it.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thanks, Coach. We will let you go watch the show.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2007

  

### [Lance Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16325)

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

### [Cartier Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15565)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We are joined now by Coach Bob Huggins from Kansas State. His
student athletes will be along shortly.  
  
Q. Bob, I think yesterday most of us, at least, had you guys in the
tournament. I think you all along felt you were going to get there. Any change
in the barometer today?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: Correct me if I'm wrong, don't they say play the best
competition you can play? I mean, everybody has Kansas a 1 seed. Does losing
to a 1 seed knock you out? I wouldn't think so.  
  
Q. Bob, I'm not trying to be difficult, but the selection committee will,
perhaps, have a question about should Kansas State go or should Texas Tech or
Drexel or Purdue or one of these other bubble teams. What would you say to the
selection committee if they were asking you why should you get in ahead of one
of other bubble teams, Texas Tech, Drexel, Old Dominion, Purdue, whomever?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: I think the truth to tell them is look how far -- this is a
good basketball team now. And they have proven they are a good basketball
team. They have proven that throughout a very difficult conference.  
We started out 0-2 in the league. And since then we're -- counting today, we
are 11-5, I believe. How do you go if, indeed, they do place emphasis on the
last 10 or 15 games and three of the five losses are to, I think, probably a
consensus No. 1 seed. I don't understand what the issue would be.  
You know, Jason, the reality is, we inherited a schedule and we had contracts
on the schedule. I just don't believe that you don't honor contracts. I think
that's what's supposed to happen.  
We played some people in, whatever, preseason deal that we are not going to
play anymore but we were contracted to play them.  
Now, I could have went in and said, let's buy them out but I don't think
that's very honorable. So we went and played. And we played more road games
than -- if you look at how many games we played on the road, and the honest to
God truth, we weren't ready to. We are like what five other guys in this
league were trying to teach a whole team.  
I think to their credit, they've learned pretty good. Let's be honest, man,
everybody wants to talk about bad losses. Come on, look at some of the people
they're talking about that are on the bubble. Look at their losses. It is a
joke.  
CHARLIE FISS: We are joined by our two student athletes from Kansas State,
Lance Harris and Cartier Martin.  
  
Q. You two had a really good tournament. Did you guys feel like as seniors
you put this team on your back to try to make a NCAA push for the
tournament?  
CARTIER MARTIN: Well, we just, you know -- this being our last year, we
definitely felt like we wanted to accomplish something. I think this time of
the year is when players step up and make plays and be players.  
I think Lance made some good shots. I made some good shots. I think we've done
what it takes to get into the tournament.  
LANCE HARRIS: Yeah. We just wanted to step up. You know, as seniors like
Cartier said, we want to put the team on our back and play hard. We just
didn't do it enough today, so maybe next time.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about -- everybody knows how good Kansas is and
how many players they throw at you. When you are playing, what makes them so
tough in a grind-it-out game like this?  
LANCE HARRIS: I think it is their talent. They got a lot of talent. They can
make errors and still make up for it with their talent.  
CARTIER MARTIN: Definitely they are an athletic team. They rebound the ball
well. They have some young guys that can do -- they are very versatile team.  
In order for us to beat those guys, I think we have a small margin of error.
We have to do the little things to win the games.  
  
Q. This is another tough one.  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: You have a lot of questions today (laughter).  
  
Q. The clearest case to me, the easiest case, Texas Tech, you guys were
transitioning away from Walker when they got you early. If you would look at
how you finished the season and then how you beat up on them, maybe both of
you should go in the tournament. But couldn't you make a real strong argument
you should go in ahead of them? It seems like all the bracketologists have
them in and you guys on the bubble.  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: Jason, you know and I know that the people they're relying
on do nothing but crunch numbers. You know, they're sports accountants, is
what they are.  
I mean, anybody who follows us knows we took guys and tried to really change a
culture and change the way they played. And to their credit, they readily
accepted it and they tried.  
You guys saw us early. We weren't very good because they were thinking so
much. They weren't reacting. They were thinking.  
And then we had another transformation when we got Bill. To do what Bill did
was absolutely phenomenal. To come in out of shape and overweight and to play
the way he played was phenomenal.  
Well, then all of a sudden, he starts getting in shape and we start counting
on him and then he goes down. If you remember, he went down the game before
the Texas Tech game. And that's not an excuse, Tech played well. But to just
kind of show you what our guys have kind of come to be made of, Bill goes down
early at A&M.  
If we don't kick the ball off our foot, we're down by two with the ball, with
a chance to tie it or go ahead. And then we came back and didn't play very
well against Tech and they could have laid it down.  
And then we go to Missouri and Mike has done a great job. It is hard. We go in
there and win. We've had -- they say have road victories. We have those.  
You know, it is hard to understand how far these guys have come and really how
good they are today by just crunching numbers. You look up there and they say
New Mexico is a bad loss. Well, then why isn't it a good win when we turn
around and whack them about a month later?  
It ought to be a good win, if it is a bad loss. Particularly the turnaround.
Anybody who was there knows we could have won by 30 or more.  
So I think you look at -- to look and say, well, you know, like they're saying
we lost to New Mexico and we lost to Colorado State. There isn't anybody in
their right mind that thinks we would lose to those people now. We have gotten
so much better.  
  
Q. Bob, I know you said yesterday that you don't -- you're not in that room
and you don't know what the committee does or how they go about their
business. But do you think the human factor can weigh into it for them?
Because that's what you are talking about it seems like.  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: I have been told that these people watch a lot of games and
they tape games and they look at games, and I would think they probably would
have seen our Texas game. It is a great game.  
It is a fun game to watch, I thought. It was fun from where I was sitting.
Most of them aren't from where I'm sitting. I mean, they've -- I'm sure
they've seen us play. You can't watch us play and think that we're not pretty
good.  
We guard pretty good now. Cartier has come so far. I think he struggled early
because he was thinking too much. He's more comfortable now. He can play. And
I think -- I think of all the guys that way.  
  
Q. Do you have anything established tomorrow during the selection show? Are
you going to get the team together, anything like that?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: I think they did -- I don't know. I'm worse than a player.
They say get on the bus at 11:15. I said all right. I don't know. I don't pay
attention. I'm kind of -- I didn't pay attention when I was a player much
either. They said be on the bus at 11:00, I got on the bus at 11:00. I
honestly don't know. I think we're going somewhere -- I think Brad did say we
are going to go somewhere, but I don't know.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2007

  

### [Mario Chalmers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13724)

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [Julian Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13723)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: Now joined by the Kansas Jayhawks. Coach Bill Self and his two
student athletes, Mario Chalmers and Julian Wright.  
Coach, your thoughts on today's victory.  
COACH BILL SELF: Well, I thought it was a hard-fought, grind-it-out game. I
thought K-State was great early. I thought we were great late in the first
half. In the second half we struggled finding some rhythm offensively but they
did a good job of attacking the glass and coming back on us.  
It was the type of game that you need to play and it was good for us to play
another game like this and win it because it was a grind-it-out, possession-
type game late.  
  
Q. To both players, do you feel you deserve a No. 1 seed in the NCAA
tournament no matter what happens tomorrow?  
JULIAN WRIGHT: I don't know. We are just trying to take it a game at a time.
We are focused on tomorrow's game and we let the seeding take care of itself.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about what it is like to play in this kind of a
grind-it-out game? You guys would rather be out there running and pressing and
doing all those sorts of things. Talk about what it is like to play in a game
like this.  
MARIO CHALMERS: I think it is good for us right now because this type of game,
you are going to have in the NCAA tournament. It is good for us to get one
underneath our belt right now and fight it out and finish with a victory.  
JULIAN WRIGHT: Same thing really. We always have a style tempo we want to
play. But whatever the mode of the game is, we have to be able to make
adjustments in tournament games. You got to feel out the situation and just
try to, you know, execute, especially down the stretch.  
  
Q. Julian, does Kansas State have the look of a NCAA tournament team to
you?  
JULIAN WRIGHT: I believe so. They are a squad that's really, you know, tough.
They have three guys that are really capable of scoring, getting 20 every
night. They are good coaching. We know every time we are going to play them it
will be a tough game. Hopefully they do make the tournament. I know playing in
the Big 12, they'll be ready.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about -- you played this rivalry game in Manhattan
and Lawrence. Did it feel different today? Did it feel like a rivalry still?  
MARIO CHALMERS: It felt kind of different just because you weren't in front of
your home crowd. But I think both teams had equal support, and it was just a
good game.  
  
Q. Bill, I wonder if you think Kansas State looks like a NCAA team to you.  
COACH BILL SELF: Absolutely. I think -- you know, I'm not an expert and I'm
not Joe Lunardi. But after studying it pretty hard, I feel like that you got
three teams in our league that are going to be a top 4 seed, maybe a couple of
them a top 2 seed. Texas may sneak in there and be a 2, 3 seed.  
And then to have the team that finishes fourth in your league, to be
considered a bubble team I think is ridiculous. Because you look across
America, there's -- the other leagues aren't considered that way at all. I
think they're in.  
I think they deserve to be in. I believe the win at Texas and USC has proven
to be a great win. I think those will hold a lot of water with the committee.  
  
Q. Bill, not to be a smart-aleck, but for K-State to get in according to
Lunardi or whoever, someone has to come out. So can you tell us why K-State is
better than Texas Tech or Drexel or Old Dominion or whoever?  
COACH BILL SELF: No, I can't tell you specifics, specifics.  
But I can tell you without going -- the teams that you're reading about on the
bubble, Purdue, Illinois, A.C.C. schools, whether they be Florida State -- I'm
thinking off the top of my head and not prepared, S.E.C., whether it is
Alabama or Arkansas can play its way in.  
I don't even include Texas Tech. I think they're in, too. They got three wins
against the Top 10. So I just feel like when you add those up, to me the win
at Texas is different than what those other teams have done.  
Who else who is considered a bubble team has gone and beat a top 4, top 3 seed
on the road that you are considering a bubble team? You also take into
consideration they are prepared to play with Walker and then prepared without
Walker and I'm sure that took time, too. And the committee needs to be
understanding to the point it should be the best teams in the country of their
body of work.  
If anything -- if it is close, it should be the best teams playing the best at
the end of the season. They made some great adjustments to get where they are.
They started 0-2 in the league and go 10-4 in the next games because Walker
wasn't playing. I think that right there bodies pretty well with them. If I am
not mistaken, didn't they start 0-2?  
  
Q. You pretty much killed them on the boards in the first half and they got
you in the second.  
COACH BILL SELF: They killed us.  
  
Q. What was the difference?  
COACH BILL SELF: Well, I don't know. We were 21-8 at half time. I told our
guys we are doing a decent job on the glass, thinking if we rebound the ball
like this, we will be in great shape.  
Second half, I really don't know. I don't know if -- it seemed like to me they
were getting every loose ball for a five- or seven-minute stretch. So much
rebounding is not blocking out, it's chasing down loose balls and just being
active.  
I just thought they were more active the second half. We got to rebound
better. We were tied with Oklahoma yesterday, and we were only plus three
today and we should be a better rebounding team than that.  
  
Q. Bill, again, not being a smart aleck, but playing the best at the end of
the season, having to adjust without Walker, I think that contributed maybe to
their poor performance against Texas Tech early on. Shouldn't K-State go in
ahead of Texas Tech? Maybe they should both go in. But if one got in first,
shouldn't K-State go in ahead of Texas Tech?  
COACH BILL SELF: I don't know. Tech beat them at K-State. K-State has one more
win in conference. I think Tech's resume is more impressive with the three
wins they have. I'm not going to get into that on who deserves it more than
the other because I think they both do.  
  
Q. With the athletes you have and the depth you have, do you think this team
is ready to play this kind of grind-it-out in the tournament? How much would
you like the tempo to be up a little bit?  
COACH BILL SELF: I thought the game was really only really well played for
stretches in the first half.  
There were a lot of stoppages in play today. Not saying good. Not saying bad.
There were just stoppages in play that neither team got rhythm offensively.  
But I do think this, we know we can play when we're able to do this. For us to
not get a lot of easy baskets and have to grind it out, even though it wasn't
artistic, it was good for us to play in this game.  
I think we're becoming a team that can play whatever the game is. Now, they
may play a funky zone or they may do something that hurts us, but I don't
think it will be because we don't have guys that can grind it out or have guys
that can get up and down.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about what it means for your team to be back
defending Big 12 tournament title and what it is going to mean to play
tomorrow?  
COACH BILL SELF: You know, today had a different feel to it to me. Today was
-- it wasn't as much as a rivalry game as it was a game where two teams had
goals and they are trying to reach them.  
I mean it wasn't a hatred-type game today. And like Mario said, large part, it
is at a neutral site. There is not as much energy in the building.  
But I think our guys, they weren't ecstatic after the game. They were very
businesslike. We came down here with the idea that we have a chance to win
another championship. And I think their focus is that.  
I don't think we are too hung up or too excited about what took place. I think
we are excited about what hopefully can take place tomorrow if we really play
well.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2007

  

### [Mario Boggan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17008)

### [JamesOn Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13902)

### [Sean Sutton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13714)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: Ready to begin with Oklahoma State with Sean Sutton and his
student athletes, Mario Boggan and JamesOn Curry.  
Coach, your thoughts?  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: I am sorry for our players. I thought they really competed
their tails off all three games here. Got within 40 seconds of having a chance
to make a play to play for the championship tomorrow.  
Texas came up with a huge play there late and then Durant, he just made a big-
time shot. I thought the difference in the second half, we did not do as good
a job on the defensive glass. And they hurt us on the boards during that half.
We outrebounded for the game, but it seemed like they came up with a bunch of
missed shots early that allowed them to keep the lead throughout the second
half and then ultimately Kevin hits that shot at the end.  
It was a tough loss. I am really proud of our players and how hard they played
down here. Like to say thanks to our fans for the passion they brought to this
arena and wish it would have turned out different, but just didn't happen
today.  
  
Q. JamesOn, you guys tied up at 61 and then the scramble after the miss and
Durant ends up with it. Just talk about that sequence and the three he hits
there.  
JAMESON CURRY: It was a great shot. But before that, the emphasis in the
huddle was play tough defense, box out and rebound. And if we could would have
complemented our defense with a defensive rebound, we may not have been in
this situation.  
  
Q. Do you think despite the 6-10 conference record that your play this
weekend proved that you should get a NCAA tourney?  
JAMESON CURRY: Definitely hope so. I think with 13-1 in our complete team, I
know we are 0-8 on the road, but I don't think we played any road game with
our complete team. Our R.P.I. is 40 something, I believe.  
But that's up to the committee. Hopefully we -- we do know we have more
basketball to play, but hopefully we will be in the tournament. Just going to
stay positive.  
MARIO BOGGAN: Same as JamesOn said.  
  
Q. JamesOn, with all the games you all played, did you feel like you had
your legs all the way through today? And did you feel like they were trying to
push the tempo to get you all tired?  
JAMESON CURRY: I think five games in seven days for any team is kind of tough.
I think we still played hard. The only thing is it took too late in the season
for us to play this hard.  
If we was playing this hard defensively and collectively as a whole early on
in the conference, we wouldn't be in this situation. But for Mario and Davis,
it is a sad situation. But for the young guys, it is something we can learn
from and make it better next year.  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: I want to say something. I thought the Big 12 made a
mistake when they rescheduled that game for Monday this week. I didn't agree
with it at the time and don't agree with it now. I am not making any excuses.
But I thought that put two teams at a competitive disadvantage this week
knowing that we were going to have to win four games in four days and then you
add an extra game on top of it.  
  
Q. If you don't get the NCAA bid, especially you, Mario, how do you feel
about your career coming to an end in the N.I.T.? Do you feel like you can
still accomplish things there? Are there still things for you to play for, you
personally?  
MARIO BOGGAN: If that's what it is, we got to go out there and, I mean, play
and try to win. I won't feel as satisfied going to the tournament.  
Like you say, for us, it is sad. But it is just an experience for the younger
guys. You know what I am saying? I'll live. But it hurts, though, not being
able to go to the tournament.  
  
Q. Sean, you guys -- I think the last 13 minutes, Durant only made one shot
and that was that three. I mean, just talk about the defense on him. You have
already said it was a big shot. Just that sequence.  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: I thought Marcus did a great job on him. Especially the
second half.  
I think Kevin would say this, that Marcus has probably guarded him as well as
anybody he has played against all year long.  
He certainly was very valuable to our team this week, the way he defended
Kavaliauskas and Acie Law last night and the way he defended Durant down the
stretch tonight.  
I thought the second half, Augustin, even though he didn't shoot the ball
well, he really controlled the game for their team. I have said this a lot
this year, he is one of the best young point guards I have seen in a long
time, the way he can manage a game.  
He has six assists. He has no turnovers and he just seems like he always makes
the right play. And then Abrams, Abrams had a good day shooting the basketball
in terms of making threes, 4-9 and made his free throws.  
I thought those two guys were big keys for them that kept them kind of on top
when Durant wasn't scoring during that stretch.  
  
Q. Sean, when you expressed your concerns about that make-up game to the
league office, what kind of response did you get?  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: That's when Nebraska wanted to play the game. I don't think
it is the student athletes fault that the weather was so bad that we couldn't
get there to play the initial game. That's all I am going to say about it. I
didn't agree with it at the time and still don't.  
I don't think it is fair -- I don't think it is fair to my players.  
  
Q. Sean, do you think you guys did enough this week to convince the
committee to get in?  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: If you are asking me do I think we're one of the best 34
at-large teams right now? I would say yes. I think we've proven that this week
when we've got our team -- the only game we have lost all season long where we
have had all our players and this is a game that really came down to one
possession. Best player in the country made a great shot and he won the game
for their team. Now, does that mean we will get in? I don't know. That's up to
the committee.  
I feel like we're certainly one of the 34 best teams out there right now. A
month ago, probably not. But you look at 7-2 in neutral sites. Didn't play
well on the road. Last time I checked, NCAA tournament wasn't a road game, it
was a neutral site game.  
  
Q. The decision on whether to accept an N.I.T. berth, is that entirely up to
you, are you going to ask your players?  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: I think they want to go play. That's what it comes down to,
that's what we will do, NCAA runs the N.I.T. now. It is not the goal that we
had when we started the season, but if that's what it comes to, we'll go
compete and try to win five games and try to win a championship.  
I will say this. Regardless of how it turns out, I do want to wish the teams
in our league the very best in the NCAA tournament. I feel like we got three
teams in Kansas, Texas A&M and Texas all capable of making a run to go to the
Final 4. Best of luck to those teams and best of luck to Texas and Kansas
tomorrow.

### [Kevin Durant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17055)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We are joined now by the Texas Longhorns. Coach Rick Barnes, his
student athletes, A.J. Abrams, D.J. Augustin and Kevin Durant.  
Congratulations on today's victory and your thoughts on the game.  
COACH RICK BARNES: One, I think you got to congratulate or respect what
Oklahoma State had to go through this week. The fact they had to play
Saturday, Monday, come back and play and for them to fight and work as hard as
they did, again, just great admiration for them. It is hard. It is really hard
to do that.  
Obviously, I'm proud of our guys. We found a way to work through a hard-fought
game against a team that doesn't give you very much on the offensive end. We
took care of the ball, the big thing today. Our second-chance points were
really big and what we were able to get off those turnovers were very
important.  
Again, great win for us and we have got to get ready to come back tomorrow,
obviously, and play against an outstanding basketball team.  
  
Q. For Kevin and D.J., can you take us through that sequence where, D.J.,
you put up the shot and then, Kevin, somehow the ball got out to you for
basically the game winner?  
KEVIN DURANT: Coach told me he wanted to go 2-1. So Damion did a great job at
tipping the ball out to me for an offensive rebound and I just -- I just
pulled up. I mean, if I would have missed it, it would have been a bad shot
but I am glad I made it.  
  
Q. Why would it have been a bad shot? You were open, weren't you?  
KEVIN DURANT: Yeah, I was looking at the time. It was 35 seconds left. We
would usually go for one shot, but I'm glad I hit it.  
  
Q. Kevin, can you talk about how hard it was for you to score in the last 13
minutes in the defense, they were doing all the double-teaming on you and
everything.  
KEVIN DURANT: I was getting the same wide-open looks I was the first half but
I just wasn't putting them down. My teammates did a great job at scoring and
picking up the load and I am glad we got the win.  
  
Q. A.J., how fun is it for you to contribute the way you did today, knocking
down your shot?  
A.J. ABRAMS: It was a great win for us. Any time you can get a chance to go
out there and help your team win, it is a great thing. I'm happy we got the
win and looking forward for tomorrow.  
  
Q. You seem to be getting some open shots lately. Are you running off
screens higher, are they running stuff for you that's better? What's going
on?  
A.J. ABRAMS: I think teams are like they have always been concentrating on
Kevin. At this time of year you have to concentrate on a little bit more
because he does so much for your time.  
At the same time, Coach did a good job of letting me run off screens and get
open looks.  
  
Q. Kevin, after losing to Kansas for a chance to share the Big 12 regular
season title, how much does tomorrow mean to you and a chance to win a
title?  
KEVIN DURANT: It is a big time if we get this win, it will be a big-time win
for our program. We just want to go in the game, we know Kansas is a great
team. We have to execute our game plan. Hopefully we will win the game.  
  
Q. D.J., you seem to really get your confidence going in the second half.
Did you your confidence ever wane yesterday when you got off to a slow start
and how are you feeling now?  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: No. I never lost my confidence. That's the one thing I learned
to keep, keep playing hard. My teammates pick me up. I mean, we just played
hard tonight.  
  
Q. D.J., I'm assuming you guys wanted to push it as much as you can in the
second half. Would you talk about how you tried to direct the offense,
especially what they were doing to Kevin.  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: Yeah, it was tough. They are playing good defense. They are a
great defensive team. I just tried to get things going, trying to get A.J.
coming off screens and tried to attack the lane, get guys involved, you know.  
  
Q. Did they defend you differently in the first half than they had been when
you scored on them in the first two games as far as helping out or anything?  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: They were kind of packed in the lane waiting on me to drive.
But second half, I picked that up and I started dribbling, hand-off to A.J. He
was coming off and attacking the lane like I was doing. We got counterattacks
for anything.  
  
Q. D.J., it looks like JamesOn was doing a lot of talking to you in the
second half. Can you tell us what he was saying?  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: Oh, no. He was asking me some crazy questions. Something that
has nothing to do with basketball. (Smiling).  
It wasn't personal or nothing. He was cool about it.  
COACH RICK BARNES: He actually asked me, does the Dallas Morning News have
anybody who knows how to write. He answered it correctly, which he can't tell
you (smiling).  
  
Q. D.J., with all the games Oklahoma State has had to play recently, were
you all trying to push the tempo and wear them down a little?  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: Yeah. We tried to tag them from the beginning of the game, keep
pushing the ball. Coach told us to keep going, keep going.  
That's one thing we did. We tried to get Boggan tired and a lot of the guys
tired. We knew they played a lot of games. And we tried to attack them like we
always do.  
  
Q. Kevin, you talked about sort of not being able to knock down some shots
there in the second half. But it when it came down to it and you hit it, talk
about where that confidence comes from and what it is like to hit another
game-winning shot like that.  
KEVIN DURANT: My whole team gives me confidence. I was kind of down, I wasn't
hitting no shots. My teammates is like, it is time for a big-time shot. Once I
got the ball, I just wanted to shoot it and I made it.  
  
Q. Rick, I watched after Kevin made that shot at the end and some of your
coaches were just, like, he did it again. I mean, just talk from your
perspective about seeing him after having the struggles hitting that shot.  
COACH RICK BARNES: The fact of the matter is I'm not sure we would have gotten
a better look if we would have held the ball.  
But that's what great players do. I mean, he -- we've talked enough about
situations but, again, he did it as if -- the way it is supposed to be done.
The play really was Damion keeping that ball alive. That was the play of the
game, to give us another possession. That was really a big play there.  
He got it and then I think sometimes players get -- I told my guys, this time
of year is a player's game. You got to go and you got to play. You got to get
lost in it. There's games like that with a guy like that, he does, he does get
lost in it.  
Instinctively, he was open. He shot it.  
  
Q. Rick, is Justin okay? It looks like you're having to sub for him a lot
with Craig and can you talk about Craig --  
COACH RICK BARNES: Craig is doing really well. Justin is a little nipped up.
But Craig is really bringing us a lot of energy right now. I think the fact of
what he is doing is going to help Justin in the long run because I do think,
again, Justin has had a little problem, just banged up a little bit.  
Craig has been terrific. His offensive rebounds -- actually, during that one
point in time, we actually said we were really doing things for A.J. and told
him he can get the offensive boards for us. You got to go get them for us and
he did a great job.  
Obviously his three was a big shot. We probably came off the throttle a little
bit too soon. We wanted to run, and I think around the 7 1/2 minute mark, we
got into a grind with it. That happens obviously.  
But I would have liked to have seen us push maybe a little bit more. Probably
my fault because we were trying to maybe get too involved with them. I do
think D.J. had a real good feel for the game and I think he was in rhythm.
Connor set some really good screens for him.  
Again, Oklahoma State doesn't give you much. You got to earn what you get.
They did a really good job on Kevin. He was a little tired. He hasn't traveled
and lost a ball like that. That's fatigue.  
When it counted, he made the big one.  
  
Q. Coach Barnes, no one has Oklahoma State in any NCAA tournament bracket
coming into this tournament. Do you think they give the selection committee
anything to think about this week or is their 6-10 league record too much to
overcome?  
COACH RICK BARNES: First of all, I have always believed this. I don't think
anything I can say is going to politic to get them in. But I do think this, I
would like to think that what you do all year matters as much as what you do
at the end. I think a committee will look at the fact. They played their
hearts out all year. The fact they had to make some adjustments there, and the
storm hurt them. Having to turn that around, play on Monday, then come back
and do this. I said this yesterday. They're the one team that I thought if
they could have gotten a 7-8 in the season, they belonged in the tournament
before they ever got here because they went out and played some people.  
I don't know. If the R.P.I. and all of that matters, they had to be talked
about. You guys saw this game today. It could have gone either way. I think
you got to give Sean and his staff credit for really keeping these guys afloat
and even giving them a chance to be in this position to have a chance to where
maybe people have to talk about it. But I don't know. I don't know how they
think. You like to think they will look at the whole thing from start to
finish.  
  
Q. Rick, Durant and Abrams had 29 of your 31 first-half points. I am sure
you are well aware of that. I am just wondering, did you tell Augustin to be
more aggressive like he was during the season to start the second half or was
that just in the flow of the game? How did you approach that?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Actually we told A.J. to be aggressive. We felt that it was
really important to try to get Terrel Harris in foul trouble. Our plan was to
play a little bit more zone.  
We felt if we could get he or either JamesOn in foul trouble our zone might be
more effective. A.J. probably overpenetrated a few times. Took a couple shots.
I told him a couple times to slow down a little bit.  
I told him one time to drive, he was so wide open he should have shot it.  
But we haven't ran -- I told the team when I went back last night and ran the
tape, we haven't ran like we were earlier in the year. One of our post guys
was running, we are not getting to the corner, spacing the floor. I told them
at half time, if they would space the floor D.J. could go to work and make
some things happen.  
He got into the flow. I thought the rhythm started playing to what he wanted.  
  
Q. Rick, probably from a conference standpoint, tomorrow's championship game
is what everybody wanted to see. Would you just kind of set the stage for that
thing and what it means to have you guys in the finals.  
COACH RICK BARNES: These tournaments are really, really hard to play. We are
going to have to get some play today. We are able to get Craig's minutes, Matt
Hill, Dexter, those guys will have to help us. Now we are going on three days
where Kevin took himself out of the game tonight. He played 37 minutes. So
that's what? 77 minutes in two days.  
We need him, obviously. But a day of rest is huge which we don't get right
now. And you think about it. They have been able to play the first game
yesterday and had a longer break than we had really. But, hey, players want to
play. I told our team yesterday, one thing I did tell them at half time, we
either come back and win in game or we go back and practice. You decide what
you want to do. It proves they rather play than practice. I would expect some
way to come out.  
It is going to be hard. Kansas has -- I have said before, I think their depth,
when they go to their bench, I think they get probably more athletic. They
have got -- they shot the ball really well against us in Lawrence. They're a
team that is very worthy of where they are right now in their ranking. They
won the Big 12 outright.  
It is going to take a great effort on our part from a lot of people, not just
Kevin, D.J., A.J. It will take a lot from a lot of other guys doing a lot of
the little things for us.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2007

  

### [Bob Knight](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15563)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
COACH BOB KNIGHT: We played pretty well for about 12 or 13 minutes. Kansas
State really dominated the play with its defense, I thought. Even when the
score was going pretty even or pretty tight through the first 12 or 13
minutes, their defense was going to wear us out.  
We are not a team -- this really bothered me yesterday. We had to play
Colorado yesterday in such a way that we could substitute a lot and rest a lot
of people and we couldn't. The game could have easily been lost, and we just
had -- we're not a team that can play back-to-back games one day after
another. We need a day's rest and Kansas State is just too tough for us to
play like that.  
I felt that -- you know, you see all of this stuff about when the NCAA
tournament comes around and everybody is an expert, but it was very difficult
for me to imagine a tournament that could put 65 teams together that were
better than Kansas State. Prior to this game -- I mean, this league is really,
really good and the coaching is good.  
If you finish in the upper division, in the first division in this league or
certainly in the upper five spots and you have a winning record, then you --
unless you have just screwed up unbelievably in your preconference season,
you're a team that should be in the NCAA tournament.  
And I don't think that Kansas State winning this game or our losing this game
or our winning yesterday really has any bearing on that.  
Kansas State is a very tough team. They're the perfect team, at least from my
perspective, because they have got guys that can play in the post but they can
go outside. They're a tough team. He's done a very good job with that team.  
And it was just not a team that we were going to be able to play today with a
game yesterday. That just was it. So here I am. So I'm not as pissed off as I
might have been, as I told you yesterday. I'm a realist. This was just not
something that we were going to do once we got into it.  
  
Q. Why weren't you guys able to get anybody going other than Jackson
offensively?  
COACH BOB KNIGHT: Well, it could have had something to do with what we had for
breakfast. I don't know. We may have eaten the wrong cereal. We may not have
had the proper lighting in the locker room or maybe Kansas State was pretty
damn good defensively and maybe we were a little bit tired. I would like to
think that I already covered that sufficiently.  
  
Q. Does the quick turnaround of the conference tournament provide the
biggest reason why you feel these games should have more bearing on what
happens with the selection committee?  
COACH BOB KNIGHT: I think the season is a season. I think if somebody wins a
tournament that may not have done well in the season, fine. But beyond that, I
just don't think -- I never thought they served a purpose. I don't think they
serve a purpose today and I won't tomorrow.  
  
Q. If you make the NCAA, are you concerned about being able to turn around
from round 1 to round 2? If you win round 1, are you worried about turning
around for round 2?  
COACH BOB KNIGHT: You have a day off.  
  
Q. One day makes a difference?  
COACH BOB KNIGHT: Goddamn, you don't think one day makes a difference? I mean,
if you had to run five miles today, could you run five miles tomorrow? Would
you rather wait until the next day? Damn, you need to get some exercise, boy.  
See ya.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2007

  

### [Lance Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16325)

### [Erin Higgins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13855)

### [Cartier Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15565)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We are joined now by the Wildcats from Kansas State University.
Let's go straight to questions for our student athletes and then we will come
back for Coach Huggins at the end.  
Questions for Lance Harris or Cartier Martin?  
  
Q. You guys came out biggest game obviously of the season and played like
seniors. Talk about that and how much impact did you guys have on what was
said before this game?  
CARTIER MARTIN: Well, I mean, it was important, you know, to come out and try
to impose our work early in the game. Texas is a tough team and we know they
like to get at the basket and be aggressive. So our main thing was to keep
them out of the middle and keep our side of the floor spaced and try to get
easy baskets.  
LANCE HARRIS: Yeah. We just knew that we had our backs against the wall and we
needed another win, you know, to help us get into the NCAA tournament. We came
out and also just played like that, like our backs was up against the wall.  
  
Q. If I could get both of your thoughts on just getting a third shot to take
on Kansas tomorrow after the first two games. Are you excited to play the
Jayhawks again?  
LANCE HARRIS: Yeah, I mean, we want to play them again. We want a chance to
play them again so we can try to get a win over them. It is always big to play
against Kansas but it is also playing for Big 12, trying to get that Big 12
championship also.  
  
Q. For both of you, do you think this definitely puts you in the NCAA
tournament? Is that the way you guys felt in the locker room after the game,
that you are definitely in?  
CARTIER MARTIN: We feel pretty confident. We think we are a good team and we
are supposed to be in it.  
But, you know, it is not our decision. We are pretty confident right now. The
next step is not up to us. We are going to try to continue to win. We got
Kansas tomorrow so we are looking to play against those guys.  
LANCE HARRIS: I think we do. You know, they say it hasn't been a team that got
in with ten wins. So we got 11 now, so hopefully it will be enough.  
  
Q. Did you feel any added pressure with the importance of this game or was
that something you were able to block out?  
LANCE HARRIS: Yeah. We knew that we had to win this game and how important it
was to us as a team and for us to get into the tournament, like I said. So we
came out with our backs against the wall, like I said before, and we just knew
we had to come out and play like Cartier said earlier.  
  
Q. Bob, same question, do you feel like you guys are definitely in the
tournament or would you like to see your players come out tomorrow feeling
like the tournament is still on the line?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: As crazy as it may sound, we came down here to win this. I
said to them -- you know, we are not going to do things to play for second or
third. We won -- we had the plan to come down and play on Sunday and win on
Sunday.  
But, you know, the whole deal about whether we are in or not, it's ludicrous.
I mean, when you think about it, we've got two teams in our league that are
both playing for a one seed. And Texas has got to be, what, a three or a four?
So then you are going to tell me from one through three and then the next best
team in the league, which has been us, that we're not in the best 65 in the
country, as good as this league is?  
I haven't really honestly paid all that much attention to it. I felt like we
were in before we played this game.  
  
Q. Bob, talk about the effectiveness or efficiency of the offense
throughout, I mean, after the first five minutes of the game.  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: You know, Mark, we tried to run this a little bit early and
then we kind of went away from it and ran that three-man motion.  
We can't beat good people, I don't think, running sets. I think we have to run
motion where our guys can read screens and be a little more creative.  
We don't have great size but we have pretty good overall size. Lance has good
size. Akeem has good size. So we tried to use that in the motion. And then
with -- when Lance shoots the ball, and Cartier has really shot it
consistently, actually since the last Tech game, was the last game he didn't
shoot it very well.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Blake Young off the bench, the lift he gave you and
Akeem Wright's defense?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: Blake has been playing better in practice. Stew has been
sick. We got more from Stew than what I thought we would get from him. You
know, that's Stew. He is a great kid and a very courageous kid. He has been
really, really sick.  
You know, we started him more just because I thought he deserved to start, but
I didn't think we would get as many minutes. Blake has been really good in
practice and stew hasn't been able to practice a bunch. So Blake got a lot of
reps. And he has really worked hard at shooting the ball.  
  
Q. Bob, at this point in the season, to come down here and have the goal of
winning this thing, how gratifying is it to see your team playing this well at
this point in the season?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: Well, the reality is we've played pretty well for a while.
We're now 12-4 since the last time we played Tech. 12-4 in this league is
pretty good.  
We had one nonconference game in there. But we're 11-4 in this league since
the last time we played Tech at home. We've played pretty well. We've been
pretty consistent defensively. We've started to take a little bit better care
of the ball.  
Cartier started making shots. Cartier started playing like I think -- how
everybody thought Cartier would play. You go back and look at the last time we
played Tech, he shot terrible. And starting with the Missouri game, really
started making shots. He's pretty much made shots ever since.  
  
Q. Bob, you started Cartier. Are you settled into this lineup right now
going forward? I mean, is this where you are pretty much going to go with and
can you talk about the rotation a little bit?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: We are just trying to win games. We thought probably coming
in that Darren Kent was better for us this game than what Jason and Luis was
going to be. It is not anything that Jason and Luis did. It is just the way
Tech plays and with the lineup that I thought Coach would play, we were going
to be better off with D.K. So we are just trying to win games.  
I told -- I told the seniors after the Oklahoma State game, you know, nobody
laying it down here. We are going to keep on playing.  
  
Q. Coach, what was the biggest difference this time around as opposed to the
last time you guys played Texas Tech?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: We made some shots. The last time was -- you know, it was
kind of like this game when they play great defense and he makes great
adjustments and he's pretty much world renowned for his motion offense and he
does a great job. They do a great job executing it.  
Honestly, I thought we had a little bit of an advantage because we had four
days to get ready for them. I think that helped us. Any time you have four
days to get ready, you ought to be a little bit better prepared.  
  
Q. Coach, with all that in mind, do you think Tech is a tournament team as
well?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: I don't think there is any question. Honestly, I don't know
how anybody could say that there's not at least five teams in this league
deserving to get in -- deserving to get in. I have been in a whole bunch of
leagues. I have been through a whole bunch of leagues. This is a heck of a
league. It has got great coaches. It has got great players. I don't see the --
I don't see what, I guess, everybody else is trying to say they see.  
You know, they say play better at the end of the year. I just said, we're 11-4
now I think it is or maybe 12-4 now. We are 12-4 in our last 16 games. Texas
is playing great. I mean, A&M is playing really, really well.  
I'm not on the committee, so I let -- and I honestly think the people have
done a wonderful job over the years. It is a hard job. It is a hard job. It is
a job you don't get a whole lot of credit for, you know. When it is all over
with, nobody comes on T.V. and says, God, they did a wonderful job. They come
on T.V. and start ripping on them about why didn't this team get in, why
didn't that team get in.  
It is a hard job. It is a thankless job.  
I told our guys, all we can do is do what we do and that's go win games. You
drive yourself crazy sitting there -- I'm not Joe Lunardi. I just try to
control the things that we can control. The only thing we can control is how
well we can play.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2007

  

### [Billy Gillispie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13712)

### [Acie Law IV](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15070)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We're ready for Texas A&M. We have Coach Gillispie and his two
student athletes, Acie Law and Joseph Jones.  
Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game against OSU?  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: It was a tough loss for us. They played really hard and
I thought both teams played fairly hard and we couldn't execute the way we
needed to. We didn't finish plays in the basket.  
They were pretty tough in there and they made their free throws and we missed
ours. It is just a matter of executing, finishing plays in the paint.  
  
Q. Acie, Coach Sutton in here a little ago just said the one thing they
talked about all day today, they didn't want to let you beat them on that last
possession especially. Did it look to you like they would let anybody else but
you take that shot?  
ACIE LAW: When we came out of the time out, they said if they would score that
we wasn't going to call a time out, we were going to try to push it back and
try to get a quick basket. But they did a good job of getting back in
transition defense. And not letting me get to the basket. Forced me to kick it
out. We weren't able to make a play to win the game.  
  
Q. Acie, what was the difference in this game versus that 20-point win in
Stillwater when you basically manhandled them and had their fans booing them
off the court? What was the difference in that game and tonight?  
ACIE LAW: Their intensity level. I mean, credit to them. They came out and
played hard. I thought we played hard. But like Coach said, we didn't finish
plays, missed too many easy baskets, and didn't convert our free throws.
Little simple things and simple mistakes down the stretch.  
Credit to them, they came out and back was against the wall, and they answered
the call when they needed to.  
  
Q. Did their physical play -- I mean, did it seem to bother you guys a
little bit? Especially, you know, trying to get the ball inside tonight, it
seemed like that was really difficult at times.  
ACIE LAW: They played hard. It was a physical game. We knew that coming in,
that they were going to try to just play real physical and make it tough for
us as they could. Like I said, we was in position to make a few plays and a
few easy baskets and we weren't able to finish them.  
I mean, they played hard. As simple as that. We just got to do a better job of
finishing plays out there.  
  
Q. Coach, on the last play Oklahoma State had, why didn't you double-down on
Boggan there?  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: Did you want us to leave this guy open at the basket?
Did you want us to leave this guy open at the basket? He was at the elbow. We
normally don't double at that position. I don't think anybody else would
either, but maybe they do.  
  
Q. Billy, can you talk about maybe what they were able to do against Acie
that kind of took him out of the game at times, especially down the stretch?  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: We got what we needed to, just didn't finish plays.  
I thought after we first got -- after we finally got started, I thought we
were paceless at the start and we normally have a better pace for our offense.
We were not getting the ball reversed at all and we were being very tentative
about driving to the basket.  
Once we got started, we got the ball where we needed to for the most part,
except the last turnover by Kirk when he threw it out, when he didn't drive
instead of trying to force it into Joe.  
We got the ball in the paint plenty of times. Sometimes Acie is not going to
be able to score every single time but if your other guys perform like they
need to, you should be able to be okay and we have really good players. They
just didn't finish enough plays in the paint.  
  
Q. Billy, you guys obviously had great overall record, great run through the
league. So do you expect this team to respond really well heading into the
NCAA tournament after a loss?  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: What do you think? (Smiling).  
  
Q. I'm asking.  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: I think we'll be all right.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2007

  

### [Jeff Capel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15825)

### [Nate Carter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16981)

### [Michael Neal](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17029)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: Joined by the Oklahoma Sooners Coach Capel and his two student
athletes, Michael Neal and Nate Carter.  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: I want to congratulate Kansas. They are awfully good, very
talented. They were just too much for us. We played a very good first half,
had the lead throughout the first half and squandered it there towards the
end.  
We felt like we were in good position, didn't get off to a great start.
Obviously we struggled scoring the ball in the second half. We have one field
goal for the first 12 minutes or so and when you are playing against a team as
talented as Kansas, you have to score.  
I thought defensively we did a decent job and the team average was 80 and they
scored 64.  
But we didn't score the ball enough to win. So congratulate them. They are
awfully good. Good luck to them the rest of the season. We're seal what
happens with us.  
  
Q. For both you guys, do you think you have played your final game this year
and in your career at Oklahoma? If so, what are your thoughts right now
starting with you, Michael?  
MICHAEL NEAL: Hopefully not. I don't know how the -- how it works with the
tournament selection. Just going to wait until Sunday to figure out if we are
still playing or not.  
NATE CARTER: You know, we already know what's going to happen. We still want
to play, so we will have to wait until Sunday and see what happens.  
  
Q. Nate and Mike, Kansas did a good job of trapping tonight, forcing you
guys to back up your offense a little bit. Maybe, Mike, I need you to comment
on this, too. Talk about how that bothered the offense. It just seemed like it
took you a few more seconds to try to get into an offense.  
MICHAEL NEAL: I didn't hear the question. I didn't understand it.  
  
Q. Kansas was trapping you in the corner. Talk about how difficult it was to
get into your offense.  
MICHAEL NEAL: It kind of throws off the rhythm. The things we do -- like we
got things to counter that and we just didn't put it together today. In the
second half -- I mean, the first half, we did some good things. The second
half, they just kind of ran away with it and took the momentum.  
  
Q. Michael and Nate, if you guys can, if you can talk about the zone that
you guys were in early, you seem to give Kansas a little bit of trouble,
forced them to take some outside shots. As the game wore on, they kind of
broke that down. Was there a change in the philosophy or the effort? I mean,
what happened down the stretch there?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: We just made some mistakes and they scored off of them, but
they are a good team and they played real hard.  
  
Q. Guys in the second half when you just couldn't put the ball in the
basket, it seemed as though Kansas -- I don't know if intimidated is the right
word, but they altered a lot of your shots, it seemed. Do you think that's
fair?  
NATE CARTER: They definitely didn't intimidate us, we just missed shots. We
was attacking them. We was going at them. We just missed shots that we
normally make.  
  
Q. Michael, just talk about this season in general, then, how has it been
this season for not just you individually but as a team? First year under
Coach Capel, have things gone the way you thought they would, not necessarily
in wins and losses but just describe how the season has been.  
MICHAEL NEAL: It has been, I think, a blessing. We're blessed to get a coach
like Coach Capel who believed in it us. It could have been anybody, and
brought a system that fit us and work with our personnel. And I think despite
the wins and losses, we were a good team and we hit some shots, we get some
stops, we can easily be looking at being in the tournament and stuff like
that. But at the same time, I learned a lot and I just -- I really appreciate
having a coaching staff like we had because it could have been anybody, you
know. The seniors, me, Nate, our careers could have been over, you know, not
playing as much as and stuff like that.  
They believed in us and we did the best we could.  
  
Q. Jeff, do you believe this team has done enough to warrant to keep playing
next week?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: I would like to think so. I mean, obviously my biased
opinion is yeah. You know, I think we are playing in one, if not the best
conference in college basketball. If you look at what our teams have done this
year in our league, I think so. We have been competitive. We haven't maybe had
a signature win.  
We did beat a top 25 team. They are not a top 25 team now.  
So I think we have, but unfortunately it is not in my hands. We hope so.  
  
Q. Jeff, is it just going to be about recruiting to resurrect the program
and get it back in the NCAA tournament?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: Well, any program -- the lifeblood of your program is
recruiting. You have to have players. That's the bottom line. You have to have
players and the players that you have, they have to believe in you. They have
to want to play for you.  
And recruiting is a big part of getting better in any program, certainly in
ours. So we look forward to recruiting. I enjoy it. I have a staff that enjoys
it. We have signed four guys we think are really good, and we look forward to
continuing to do it.  
  
Q. Jeff, in the first half, did things go just about as good as you could
hope for going in the first half with your game plan how you laid it out? When
you went into the half time locker room, were you thinking, okay, we are right
there?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: I thought so except for the last 30 seconds. We wanted to
try -- 44 seconds on the clock, we called time out. We wanted to hold for one
shot. We didn't execute that play but we got it back on the out of bounds. I
thought we shot quickly there.  
But overall I thought in the first half we played very well. I thought our
defense was good. We did some different things on ball screens. We mixed our
defenses up some. But the bottom line is scoring.  
To beat Kansas, you have to score. They average 80. They had 28 at half time.
So our defense was very good. Offensively, we did some decent things but
that's been the story of our team all year. You know, we have played pretty
good defense for the most part.  
I thought the difference in the second half defensively they got transition
baskets. In the first half, I don't remember them getting one transition
basket. In the second half, they probably got about 12 points -- about 8 to 12
points in transition.  
I thought that was a big difference. Obviously, I felt we were a little bit
deflated once we got down. They were getting straight-line drives on us, which
not many teams have done that this year. Brandon Rush got one on the left wing
when drove it right down the middle. Looked like Moses had a staff and the sea
parted right there. That's disappointing. All year long these guys have fought
hard.  
We have tried to get better. We just unfortunately have been inconsistent with
scoring.  
  
Q. Coach, along the same lines, how would you describe your first year? I
would imagine any time first year at BCU, here, whatever would be special in
some ways or however. How has it been emotionally for you as a coach in the
first year?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: It has been an honor to be here honestly, and to coach these
guys, I appreciate these guys accepting us.  
Our players have been through a lot. Any time you have a coaching change and
you go -- and you are playing for someone that didn't recruit you, that's
tough. I went through it as a player kind of like half a year. It wasn't
anything like that. My coach was out my second year in school, and it is
tough.  
But these guys you know, you know, we appreciate the fact that they embraced
us. We worked.  
There were a lot of areas where we have to get better, we have to improve. I
knew that coming in. I knew that once I took the job and we started individual
workouts, I knew that.  
But these guys have displayed great heart and we fought all year long. There
have been some teams we have played that are more talented than us. Kansas is
better than us. Kansas is better than a lot of teams. But these guys have
fought. I said at the beginning of the year, I thought this team would be a
team that our fans would really get behind and embrace because I thought it
was a team that would fight. We knew we were an underdog. We knew there wasn't
a lot of expectations outside of our locker room and we talked about that. We
talked about fighting and giving great effort every day, and for the most
part, I think we did that.  
  
Q. Jeff, along those same lines, you talked about before the season started
that you wanted this team to be the best that it could be, basically, I think
in those terms. Do you feel like this team reached its potential, even though,
like you said, you had limitations?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: Yeah, I do. That may sound crazy, I do. Listen, I didn't
come here to be close, to give great effort, to just do that.  
I came here to win. That's what I know is to win. But I think you have to run
your own race. We can't compare ourself to someone else right now. We want to
-- we think what we have at the University of Oklahoma is very good.  
And I think our team hit its ceiling. When you are playing with guys that
really haven't played and with the inconsistency that we had, I mean, if you
would have told me last night that Longar was going to come out and have a
double-double and almost have a double-double in the first half, I wanted it
to happen but I would have thought you were probably crazy to say that with
the way he was playing.  
We have a guy that -- our two leading scorers didn't score yesterday.
Obviously, Mike didn't play. And then we have a guy like Nate Carter who had 6
points today. He had 22 or 24 yesterday. David Godbold didn't score. I mean,
that's kind of been how our season has been. I knew who we were at the
beginning of the year. We've tried to work. I think we have gotten better. I
think we've improved.  
But we just -- we have to improve in some talent. We do. I understand that.
Our staff understands that. And that's something that we look forward to
doing.

## March 9, 2007

  

### [Aaron Bruce](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13911)

### [Mamadou Diene](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17054)

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

### [Curtis Jerrells](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16448)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We are ready to begin with the Baylor Bears. Coach, we will come
to you first. Your thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH SCOTT DREW: We started out well, very pleased with how we came out and
the intensity we had and then give Texas a lot of credit. I thought their
press changed things around. We didn't handle it very well.  
That's disappointing since we were pressed for 40 minutes the night before and
handled it very well. We all saw what Durant did in the second half. We tried
three different guys, four different guys on him -- three different guys on
him. And Texas deserved the game. Give them all the credit.  
Very proud of our guys. Proud of the fact that we competed like this. I hope
this leaves a taste in our mouth that we don't want this to happen in the
future. Everyone that played tonight is back next year. We're a year older and
hopefully this experience will pay off next year so we don't have this feeling
like we do right now.  
  
Q. Curtis, what was the difference between the first and second half as far
as the way you guys played?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: I think we played well throughout the game. But in the second
half, we stopped making some shots which may have let us let up on the
defensive end. They had a good run, they are a good team. They made some shots
and made a run. We didn't do a good job of stopping them.  
  
Q. Aaron, Coach just said you guys are a year older and a year wiser now and
that maybe this will help you not have the feeling you're having in your heart
right now. What is that feeling you're having in your heart right now? What
was the roller coaster ride you were on all night?  
AARON BRUCE: Expectation, I think, from going -- outside perspective didn't
have much of an expectation for us in the tournament. Inside out we knew we
were very good and knew what we could do, I think we showed two sides of us
tonight. We showed what we can do in the first half and you have just have to
credit Texas with having heart and Kevin Durant for making plays for them in
the second half.  
He really did step up and led their team to a win.  
  
Q. Mamadou, talk about the defense on Kevin in the first half and what
happened in the second half?  
MAMADOU DIENE: Like Coach said, we started to get him pretty good. We gave
everything we got in the first half. But he is a good player. He just step up
in the second half and make shots.  
  
Q. Aaron, did your offense change at all in the second half or the way you
attacked the basket or what happened?  
AARON BRUCE: It wasn't necessarily our offense that changed or our defense
that changed, it was just that Texas made a run. Momentum changed more than
anything. Them being the aggressor both on the offensive and defensive end. We
struggled with dealing with that. They did an excellent job on putting us on
our back foot in the second half and keeping us there.  
  
Q. Aaron, can you expound on what Coach said about being a year older next
year and leaving this bad taste in your mouth.  
AARON BRUCE: We have a long time to sit and watch and we are going to recover
immediately. I think a lot of us are feeling pretty drained right now,
emotionally more than anything.  
Just back to the drawing board, another year, another chance, same crew. The
off-season is where you put in work and where you really improve. We're all
very, very driven people. But I think being in these situations in the past
few days for us will spear us on a little bit more and leave a bit of taste in
our mouth.  
I think we have seen where we can go with things. It is just a matter of
working hard and making it happen.  
  
Q. Coach, normally we would talk to you and you are chipper under all
circumstances. You look like you are feeling a lot of pain with what happened
out there tonight.  
COACH SCOTT DREW: From the standpoint we really prepared for this, really
wanted this. To basically have the lead we did and have it slip away, I mean,
that hurts a lot worse than not being in the game.  
Again, you look at the shooting percentage, first half we held them to 22%
which when you get stops, you get fast-break opportunities. Second half, they
shoot 53%, you don't get stops, you don't get fast-break opportunities.  
We obviously didn't shoot well in the second half. So to answer your question,
we were running the same offense.  
  
Q. Scott, what's going through your mind when Durant comes out and pretty
early in the second half got in a groove?  
COACH SCOTT DREW: Change defense. Try something new. We throw a zone out
there. He hits in the zone. We go man. He still scores. Switch a different man
on him, and he still scores. At that point you say he is definitely the first
pick in the draft but you can't do anything else.  
  
Q. You touched on it earlier, Coach, talk a little bit about the press. Do
you feel like that got them into a rhythm and took you guys out of it in the
second half, despite, like you said, you handled the press very well last
night.  
COACH SCOTT DREW: That's what's so frustrating from a coaching standpoint.
Last night the whole game was about pressing and attacking. Tonight we are in
the same situation. Again, they had all the momentum. We missed some finishing
opportunities, we didn't miss last night.  
They just led to more momentum for them. Again, Kevin Durant made the plays.
That's a special player. Those guys don't come around a long time -- once in a
long time.

### [JamesOn Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13902)

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We are joined now by the Oklahoma State Cowboys. Head coach Sean
Sutton and his student athletes, JamesOn Curry, David Monds and Mario Boggan.
Coach, we will call on you first for your assessment of tonight's victory over
Texas A&M.  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: I am really happy for our players and really happy for our
fans because this has been a tough, tough stretch of the last three weeks the
way that we've played. Just really proud of how hard our players have competed
so far through this tournament.  
Certainly are not satisfied. We did not come here to win two games. We came
here to win four and happy to still be playing tomorrow.  
We beat an outstanding team tonight. That team, I have said it before that I
have got great admiration for the way they play the game. They are certainly a
legitimate team to go to the Final 4. They have all the parts. But tonight, it
was a great team effort on our part and just really proud of my players.  
  
Q. Mario, this is for you. You guys really seem to contain their big players
in Joseph Jones and Acie Law. They did not score basically in the second half
of that second half. Did you guys make any special adjustments on them or was
it just you guys buckled down or a little bit of both?  
MARIO BOGGAN: We just basically played D -- we just played intense D on them.
First half we let them get off a little bit and they found some ways to score
down low.  
We went in half time and Coach told us we need to suck it up and leave it out
on the floor. We went back out there and tried our best to lock them up and
tried not to let them score.  
  
Q. JamesOn, are the Cowboys back? Explain how your team can play like you
did in Lincoln and have a game like you did tonight? Are you back?  
JAMESON CURRY: I don't know if we are back. We are playing hard. We still got
to go. We are trying to accomplish. I think the intensity and the Cowboy
defense, I think all that is back. We have to keep to continue to do that all
weekend long. It was a short-term goal.  
And long-term goal still at hand, continue to play hard.  
  
Q. Mario, just describe the last offensive play for you guys. What was your
mind-set and just describe the play.  
MARIO BOGGAN: Coach, he drew up a good play. He just wanted me to get the ball
and go to the hole hard. I mean, that's what I put in my head, go to the
basket. Don't settle for no jump shot. Rip through and get to the basket and
try to finish.  
  
Q. If any of you guys could comment, talk about how important it is for you
guys not only to get back but to be a team that you really didn't play that
well against in the regular season. Now you get -- is this sort of redemption
for you?  
JAMESON CURRY: I believe so. As a basketball player growing up, I was taught
it is hard to beat a good team three times. I definitely believe we were a
good team. I knew it was going to be tough coming in. We needed to compete.
Our coach did a great job preparing us for the game.  
  
Q. David, can you explain how you guys have suddenly turned it on to play as
poorly as you did over the weekend and Monday night and then you come here and
you have had two excellent games? What's your explanation for the way you have
turned it on?  
DAVID MONDS: Like Coach Sutton said, the great thing about basketball, you can
always redeem yourself when you have conference tournaments. I feel like we
were a wounded animal. We came out fighting. We got two wins to get to our
goal. All you got to do is go out and play hard and leave everything on the
floor and you will take care of everything. Simple as that, go out and play
hard.  
  
Q. JamesOn, it's not too often, if ever, that you are on the bench in crunch
time. Could you describe watching it as basically a fan at that point, the
final 15 seconds, Mario's last shot and then Texas A &M's three shots at the
end, can you describe the last 15 for us?   
JAMESON CURRY: I actually went to Cooper in the huddle and we said a little
prayer and then me and Obi got on the ground and locked arms. I believed in my
teammates. You've got to have trust in your teammates. You drive the ball and
see a man open, you can't pass because he's not ready for a shot, you got to
believe he is going to hit the shot.  
Even though I was on the bench, I still trusted my teammate and I knew we
could pull it out. Each one of our players are great players. We play hard and
practice hard and good things are bound to happen tonight. You saw the results
of that.  
  
Q. JamesOn, I know -- if you average 40 a game or so in high school, you
have to have been in the zone a lot. Tonight you only made four shots, put up
eight. Were you feeling in the zone, though? At one point as you scored and
you ran down the court and kind of gestured to the crowd?  
JAMESON CURRY: Yeah. You know, just heat of the moment thing. My goal coming
in tonight, I know I had to guard Acie Law. Everybody in the nation knows I am
a scorer. It is known. But tonight that wasn't really needed. We needed a
collective, I guess, collective --  
MARIO BOGGAN: Team.  
JAMESON CURRY: Yeah, collective effort from everybody else. My role tonight
was to go out and play defense and play the hardest defense I could and don't
worry about scoring. Now buckets will come for me.  
  
Q. Guys, they led by as many as nine in the game. In the last few weeks
teams have got a big lead and it has only gotten bigger. What was different
tonight with that nine-point lead that you wouldn't let the lead get bigger?  
JAMESON CURRY: We fought, NCAA tournament.  
MARIO BOGGAN: We fought. We left it all on the court. Usually when they get a
lead like that, we might put our head down. We might not make a stop but
tonight we made plays on the defensive end. That was the most important.  
JAMESON CURRY: And I would add to that, too. Like, earlier, you know, you play
a game, you know you got another game. Like, you got a game Friday. We played
Monday. But now it is crunch time. Your back against the wall. We lose this
game, there is no more games. It is back to Stillwater on the bus.  
  
Q. Coach, I am going to ask you what I asked Mario. You guys basically
stopped Acie Law for the final nine minutes of the second half. You stopped
Joseph Jones, did not score a point after the seven-minute mark at the second
half. Did you guys just make some adjustments on that or did your guys lock
down and say we are not going to let them score?  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: One of the things that we felt like we had to do and we
talked about it today at shoot-around, we talked about it at the pregame meal
and then again before the game is we did not want Acie Law to beat us.  
We wanted to force somebody else on their team that came down to the last
three or four minutes. And I thought Marcus and JamesOn both did a great job
on him the majority of the game.  
I thought Mario and David, both those guys, moved their feet and got around
Jones the last seven or eight minutes where he was trying to get deep post-up
position. They fought around and tipped the ball away.  
But not anything special, just tough, tough, hard-nosed play.  
  
Q. Sean, there in the second half it looked like you made -- about three
times you made a timely, gutsy decision to go to a zone defense. Could you
comment on your thinking there?  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: You know, one of the things that's difficult about playing
Texas A&M is they've got one of the best one-on-one players in the country.
And when they get in that spread, when Law is on the point, the guy guarding
them, you are out there almost like on an island by yourself.  
And he has hurt us in the past as well as a lot of teams. Our game plan was
when they went in their spread, which they call a wave, was to drop back into
a three-two zone.  
So I think it happened four or five times in the second half where they called
that and we dropped back into a zone and forced somebody else to take a shot.  
  
Q. Coach, if you can, talk about the defensive job that JamesOn and Marcus
did, especially when they got four fouls apiece and also if you can comment on
what your mind-set was when JamesOn did foul out.  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: I think they both stepped up to the challenge. Our guys are
smart enough to realize that in order for us to win tonight, we had to do a
great job on Acie Law.  
JamesOn started out on him, and I thought was really active and aggressive,
much like he was last night except that he was guarding one of the best point
guards in the country. Then Marcus, I thought, when he was on him, his size
bothers him at times. We did a good job of not letting him get to his right
hand.  
Just made it difficult for him to get a lot of clean looks. But he's a
tremendous player.  
And then in terms of their foul situation, JamesOn got his fourth one, I think
was about 15 minutes to go in the second half. I was going to leave him over
there as long as the game was in striking range.  
But at some point, I made the decision that we came here to win the game. We
were going to roll the dice if we got down eight or nine points.  
I put him back in for a couple minutes and then took him back out once we got
the lead back down to four and then put him back in and then he fouled out.  
But at that point, I still thought we had enough good players that could make
plays.  
  
Q. Sean, this question of effort that the guys are saying just play hard and
try hard, how did you turn that switch on this week and why couldn't it be
switched on earlier before the snide?  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: I think one of the things that happened to this team is
when we lost Obi, we lost a big part of our team. And for a long time, we
tried to get by and we were able to early against Pittsburgh and some of those
teams.  
And at some point, I thought our guys got a little wore down. And I think the
fact they were still looking over there at him knowing at some point we were
going to get him back, we certainly missed some opportunities by not playing.
But I think once we got him back, I felt like we got our team back in place.
We got the same team that started 11-0.  
When we have had our entire team together, we are 13-0. Obi is a big part of
our team. I think the other thing is pride. This last week, I have done a lot
of talking to them about what it means to play at Oklahoma State, how much it
means to people, the amount of people in this state that care for these guys.  
All they ask is for you to go out and play your butts off and leave it out
there on the court. So far the first two nights we have been able to do that.  
I thought Mario made a great play late. We set up an isolation play for him
against Kavaliauskas. It was a play we used in the past when Tony Allen was
here. That's what good players do. Made a great play and we were able to beat
a great team tonight.

### [D.J. Augustin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17057)

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

### [Kevin Durant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17055)

### [Craig Winder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17056)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: Joined by the Texas Longhorns. Coach Rick Barnes and his three
student athletes, D.J. Augustin, Kevin Durant and Craig Winder.  
Coach, your thought on tonight's victory.  
COACH RICK BARNES: Craig Winder was the guy that turned the game around for
us. We were definitely lacking the energy or whatever you want to put on it in
the first half and we came out the second half and got going a little bit but
then I thought when Craig came in, the whole complexion changed and I think
our players really appreciate what he does for us every day and they obviously
felt what he was doing.  
What he did, he came in and said, hey, let's do this. He played really with
reckless abandon and really got us going.  
  
Q. Kevin, at half time, did you ever have the thought in your head that this
might not be your shooting night?  
KEVIN DURANT: I really didn't think that. Coach just told me to keep being
aggressive and chip away at the lead. My guys did a great job of encouraging
me after the half time and keep shooting it.  
Once we came out we had a lot of energy and kept chipping away at the lead.  
  
Q. There will be two big schools of thought tomorrow. One is going to be
Baylor blew a 18-point half-time lead. The other one will be Texas stormed
back to take this game. From your feeling out there, when did you kind of know
it may have been the latter?  
KEVIN DURANT: Myself, I just wanted to get in with ten minutes left in the
game. We did that, and I think we were down nine. We was playing harder than
they were. We were getting stomped and we were making baskets. We were moving
the ball and we came back and hit some great shots.  
Craig did a great job at picking us up. Craig won the game for us by far, man.  
  
Q. Craig, if you can, talk about normally it is your guys to the left are
the ones making the plays down the stretch. You made a couple big buckets.
What were your emotions late in the game?  
CRAIG WINDER: Just trying to help them out and playing with a lot of energy.
The buckets came from energy points, hitting the glass and things like that.
My biggest thing was trying to get them going in that part.  
  
Q. D.J., can you talk about just the start you had and how you are kind of
being forced to do some other things, create some things with your shot not
going down and then coming alive in the last couple of minutes to put in six
key points?  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: You will have nights when you are not shooting well. I try to
do other things. I try to get other guys involved. I was trying to get the
ball to Kevin as much as I could.  
Like Kevin said, Craig really sparked us. We praise Craig tonight, and like I
say, I just tried to do some other things.  
  
Q. What was the attitude like at half time in the locker room?  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: We knew we wanted to win this game. We know why we are here. We
are trying to win the Big 12 championship, man. We just came out in the first
half sluggish. We just turned up our intensity in the second half.  
  
Q. It is not the way you would script it, to fall behind early, but wins
like this, coming back, showing mettle, how do you feel about your ability to
come back?  
KEVIN DURANT: Baylor is a great team. They played us well every time we play
them. Coach talks about swag. When we came out, we didn't want to look like we
were going to lose the game. We wanted to look like we was up. We did that and
we got a little confidence.  
We came back and won the game.  
  
Q. Rick, I wonder if you can talk about the toughness that Kevin showed
today bouncing back from that 0-12 start, how he played in the second half.  
COACH RICK BARNES: I thought early -- again, first of all, Baylor is good.
Their guards are as tough to guard. Their guards are talented. Those guys have
been playing now for two years, and they were really in a rhythm. They were in
a rhythm last night. They were in a rhythm to start the game.  
We didn't do anything to get them out of it. We settled. They were being much
more aggressive than we are. We were just settled. We missed some shots around
the rim we needed to make but we didn't.  
We just didn't have any energy. At half time, it is probably the longest I
have talked to them all year. What I said to them, I said, hey, right now, if
our season ended right now, how would you feel? And I said, understand, this
is what a NCAA tournament game is like. You are going to play against a team
that you are probably supposed to beat. If you don't have more energy than
what we have, this is what you get. I want to see if we will come back and
play 20 minutes like we don't have any left.  
I told Kevin, you got to quit settling. And he came out first time all year I
have seen him a little -- I don't want to say uptight. Again, I don't know
what it was. But that's the first time I have seen him where he looked like he
wasn't real sure of himself. When he got it going, it just ran through the
whole team. You could tell when he got it going.  
We didn't extend the defense and tried to pick up the pace a little bit and
tried to get the game going a little quicker and took some chances and tried
to get them doing things maybe a little bit quicker than they wanted to play.  
When started making those shots, you could almost feel it from our point of
view. Craig came in and really gave us a huge lift. And D.J. was better. D.J.
wasn't very good in the first half. Nobody was good in the first half. That's
why he is the Player of the Year in the league, because he responded to as bad
a half of basketball we played this year and as bad as he's played.  
  
Q. Coach, Baylor got off to a good start, running and trying to push the
tempo. Were you surprised, though, they didn't try to slow it down, try to
extend the shot clock. It seemed like they settled for a lot of quick shots?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I thought early they were doing that. They made shots. They
can shoot the ball. They're talented. And they can shoot the ball. But they
run their false motion delay game, whatever it is. Again, even in the first
half, they were doing it. They were just making plays at the end of the shot
clock.  
We were going down one pass in the shot and not doing anything. They were
comfortable. I thought they came out relaxed. I thought they played relaxed in
the first half. That's what I told the guys in the half time. We just got to
get it down to ten. I actually told them at our place, I think we were down
nine or ten with seven minutes to go.  
I said, hey, we have been here before. Let's just keep working it and see what
happens, put the pressure back on them. I felt if we could get the game close
again, put a little bit of pressure back on them, we were able to make some
plays. D.J. made some plays at the end. Damion made some plays. They weren't
waiting on Kevin to do it. A.J.'s shot at the foul line was a big play.  
  
Q. What kind of carryover benefits do you think there are for your young
guys in a setting like this to be able to climb out of that hole tonight?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I tell you, our team -- we've been down. We were down --
first half of this game reminded me of the Gonzaga game where we were just
awful. Even in that game, I think we were down 28. Even though we cut it back
to ten, this team, I have said before, we don't always do the smartest things
but the one thing they do, they keep playing. They keep playing and they
haven't flinched all year.  
Now, I did tell them at half time, I didn't particularly like their body
language. One time when they went up 17 or 18 in the first half, I made up my
mind I wasn't going to call a time out because I think I would have killed
them if I would have. And I didn't want to do that, and I just said, hey, let
them figure it out themselves, because I don't think I can help them then. And
I told them that at half time. I told them we have been down before, you have
found a way to work back in it, go one possession at a time, play some four-
minute games and get it close and see what happens.  
Then I looked to a couple of assistant coaches. I said, can we win this game,
in front of the team. All at once I heard a couple of them, yeah, we can win
this game. I said go win the game.  
They came out and won the game.  
  
Q. Coach, after you come off this game, beating a Baylor team that came in
kind of on a roll, how similar does tomorrow's challenge against Oklahoma
State look to you?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Again, I said a week ago, I thought that Oklahoma State,
even with adversity they have had to go through, they could have closed out
the season with three wins. I thought they were the one team that came in
here, they could finish the record with a season 8-8, I thought they deserved
to be in the NCAA tournament because of their resume start to finish.  
Today when I watched a little bit of them, to me it seemed like they were back
to the team we saw in December, January. Obviously they will have the crowd
here. They will have the house with them.  
It is going to be a quick turnaround, a very quick turnaround. The fact --
that's what I was looking at right here, the minutes. 40 and 25 and 36, 38,
30. That's going to be a quick turnaround. Hope that we've got enough to give
them a game.  
  
Q. Kevin didn't look like he was limping in the first half, but did he seem
tentative to you at all, like he was thinking about --  
COACH RICK BARNES: I don't know what word you want to use. My words were you
weren't very good. I said, you are not very good. I look down and I said, you
are 0-11. Half of them were not very good shots. He just wasn't very good. I
don't know if it was tentative or whatever.  
He was pretty good in the second half. And I told him that after the game.
That's what I said to him, you weren't very good. The second half, you were
pretty good.  
He got it going. Again, we went up and started doing a little zone pressing
and he got up on the ball and he finally said to me, if we are going to keep
doing this, I won't be able to finish this game. I said let's stop doing it
then, because we need you out there. He backed it off. At that point in time I
thought we got the momentum and the rhythm shifted to where we needed it.  
But he had a lot going. When he gets going like that, we have been around him
long enough to know that he can score. Whatever he got in the second half, but
we've seen him do it and you could tell the confidence swing shifted to us.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2007

  

### [Darrell Arthur](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17031)

### [Sherron Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17030)

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We're joined now by Coach Bill Self of the Kansas Jayhawks. His
student athletes will be along shortly. We will call on you for your thoughts
on today's victory over Oklahoma.  
COACH BILL SELF: Well, I thought it was a grind-it-out game. Neither team was
great offensively the entire game, but defense was pretty good. We were pretty
still the first half.  
I thought the second half at least we rebounded the ball better and our
defense led to easy baskets which kind of gave us a little cushion.  
  
Q. Bill, we've heard you talk many times about how you wish at times Brandon
Rush would be more aggressive. That little spurt in the second half I assume
is the way you like to see him play and if the answer is yes, what does that
add to the big picture for you guys when plays like that?  
COACH BILL SELF: Well, we're not going to be a real good team unless we have
our best offensive players stepping up and making plays or taking shots.  
He shied away from action the first half, I thought. We talked about that at
half time. The second half, he was more aggressive. We still didn't shoot the
ball, worked the flip. When he is aggressive, he gives us a whole different
dimension because he can get an easy basket getting to the rack or he can make
three or four threes in a ten-minute stretch. He just wasn't looking to do
that at all the first half.  
  
Q. Bill, it seems your players do a wonderful job on the sideline with their
demeanor, not ever talking back to an official. It appears that you have
stressed that. Would you address that?  
COACH BILL SELF: Well, you know, we don't stress probably anything different
than anybody else does, but that's just something you don't do. If you are
focused you are always thinking next play. And I probably talk too much, but
if players are focused, they can't let what just happened affect what's
getting ready to happen.  
Shady can tell you the same thing, I thought our body language wasn't good at
all the first half. Body language, and if you look at our team, you should
never be able to tell what the score is by looking at us. And so we don't do a
great job at that, but we do a pretty good job with it, I think.  
  
Q. Bill, are you concerned -- how concerned are you of your free throw
shooting?  
COACH BILL SELF: We talked about as a staff on the bench that we weren't going
to talk about free throw shooting. But to answer your question, yes.  
So, you know, 11-22, we got better shooters than what we shot. But I don't --
you know, we're not going to talk -- sometimes the more you talk about missing
short putts or free throw shooting the more it gets in your head. I still
don't believe it is in our head yet to the point where it's -- you know, we
got a phobia about it or anything.  
But, you got to make free throws in the post-season. Unfortunately today we
didn't have to.  
CHARLIE FISS: We are now joined by our two student athletes, Darrell Arthur
and Sherron Collins.  
  
Q. Sherron, had you a couple scoreless games heading into this game. Did
that weigh on you at all? How nice was it to get the ball in the bucket a few
times?  
SHERRON COLLINS: It was nice to get going, to get started. It had no affect on
us trying to come in and do -- as I normally do.  
  
Q. For both players, could you both talk a little bit about what it means to
you guys, when Brandon plays really aggressively like he did in the second
half?  
DARRELL ARTHUR: It means a lot because he is like our number one scorer and we
look for him to score a lot. When he is doing good, the whole team just follow
him and do good along with him.  
I think he is like a good motivator on the court. When he gets going, the
whole team gets going.  
SHERRON COLLINS: Like I said, when he gets going, we got to look for him and
get him the ball early, get him in the game, give him extra shots. He is a
good shooter and a good scorer.  
From him scoring to get going, generally it just goes to the whole team and
gets us started.  
  
Q. Can either of you talk about this wasn't a home court game for them at
all with how the fans turned out? What do you think about that?  
DARRELL ARTHUR: Our fans have been supporting us the whole year, they come
during pre-season. They came to a lot of away games and they have been
supporting us real well. That's what motivates us, too, on the court. Hearing
them out there makes us play harder.  
  
Q. Darrell, can you just talk about whether each team, I guess, Texas Tech
or Kansas State, you know, give us your thoughts on both.  
DARRELL ARTHUR: Both of them are good defensive teams. We play Kansas State,
they beat us up pretty good. We got out with some wins. And Texas Tech is a
great team. Probably one of the best teams in our league right now.  
Them going against each other will probably be a real good game.  
(Loud noise.)  
COACH BILL SELF: Coach Knight have been here, he would have walked out right
now. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Coach, was the half-time speech that you gave to your team today similar
to the one you gave against Texas in the regular season? Because your team
came out in the second half with a fire lit under them.  
COACH BILL SELF: No. Well, I mean, I just told them we could play better. And,
you know, against Texas, it wasn't from lack of effort. It was they just
whipped us.  
Today, I didn't think we played with as much bounce and energy as we did in
the Texas game, per se. So, you know, we were talking about more -- more about
you know, playing with bouts of energy and that kind of stuff.  
But, you know, first game, 11:30 game, we hadn't shot in the building yet. I
think that it didn't surprise me how we played the first half, to be honest. I
shouldn't say we played poorly because I thought OU really defended us well.  
  
Q. Bill, is this the first time you have seen since Oral Roberts that's
entirely your team, guys you signed and brought in?  
COACH BILL SELF: If you say entirely, I haven't been at very many places very
long. At Illinois we had Cook. My last year that was it. Last year we just had
Hawk and Christian. I felt like this is -- I felt like this has been my team
since the first day I got on campus.  
People make too big a deal out of that. I thought it was my team at Illinois
right off the bat. But certainly, you know, we've had time to recruit to our
needs and recruit to a way we want to play, and our coaches have done a good
job of going out and getting guys.  
  
Q. Do you remember ten years ago this week you get an N.I.T. bid, you were
overjoyed to get it at Oral Roberts? Kind of compare what it was like to be a
young coach then, ecstatic to get an N.I.T. compared to the pressure that's on
you now.  
COACH BILL SELF: Well, you know, if we didn't want pressure we probably should
have never moved to Lawrence. We like that. You want -- I love being at a
place where there's expectations because that means you can usually get good
players. But going to N.I.T. at Tulsa was a big deal -- I mean at ORU, that
was a big, big deal.  
I hadn't even thought about that until you mentioned it. But, you know, I
think, relative speaking, at that time, that was every bit as big a deal as
what we are going through now. The stakes are so many higher. There is just so
much talk about it. It really is what coaches dream of, I think, and what they
live for to be in positions like this.  
  
Q. You guys were able to beat Kansas State twice this year. You lost when
you went into Lubbock to take on Tech. Do you find yourself pulling one way or
the other either for your team's matchups or what might be better for the
conference as these two teams both sit there on the bubble?  
COACH BILL SELF: If I told you what I really, really wanted, that would be
bulletin board material for everybody else.  
I will tell you this, we know we will play a good opponent tomorrow. And the
K-State game in Manhattan, we were fortunate to win and Tech has already
beaten us.  
It will be a very hotly contested game either way.  
  
Q. How important is it for Sherron to get his three-point shot back and can
you live without it?  
COACH BILL SELF: The way we are, it is usually a different guy or different
guy's night tonight. We need to get all of our best players playing well. Of
course shooting the ball is a big part of that. We have been so inconsistent
doing that.  
I think it will come back. He's not scared to miss. So he has got confidence
to make them. I think he will make them. Certainly it was good to see him make
a couple of layups today because the lid has been on the basket for about a
week.  
  
Q. Bill, I saw you out there and I asked this, but I would like to get your
complete answer here. You're not unlike other coaches around the country in
that you play players late in the game of a win. You left -- I guess your
primary players came out at 3:40 and 1:30 in the game. What is the thinking of
playing them that long?  
COACH BILL SELF: Well, the only reason -- the only primary player that was in
the game late was Julian and Julian hadn't played the whole game. I wanted him
to at least see something good happen. That's all that was.  
But I don't -- I thought we got our guys out pretty early and then I put
everybody else in to sub and we didn't get a stoppage, that's why I called the
time out. There is no rhyme or reason. We didn't try to score the last four
minutes of the game either. There was no rhyme or reason. We weren't doing
anything to try to embarrass anybody.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [Aleks Maric](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13719)

### [Charles Richardson,
Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17007)

### [Doc Sadler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15826)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We are joined by the Cornhuskers from the University of
Nebraska. Coach Doc Sadler and his two student athletes, Aleks Maric and
Charles Richardson Jr.  
Coach, your assessment of tonight's game?  
COACH DOC SADLER: I thought both teams played really good defense. I couldn't
be prouder of a team. You know, to hold a team that is as talented as Oklahoma
State to 53 points, I think that says a lot about our guys. That's the way it
has been all year. They have just given everything that they've got.  
That's why they had chances to win. We just couldn't score tonight. You got to
give Oklahoma State credit. They're so big and physical. You know, they jumped
that first five or six minutes and came after us like we knew they would do.
And we weren't able to withstand that kind of pressure to stay with what we
needed to do and that was to get the ball to Aleks.  
I thought we rushed some things and made their defense look better than it
would have if we would have been just a little more patient.  
Overall, 24 turnovers, you can't win in the tournament with 24 turnovers.
Again, that's a credit to them. But overall, I couldn't be any prouder. I told
our team, there is not a team in this league that I would have rather coached
because I promise you there is not a coach that can say what I can say, and
that is we've had one bad practice all year. And when you have only had one
bad practice and you're a coach, you know that they are giving you everything
that they've got.  
That's a credit to our players.  
  
Q. Charles, can you just address Oklahoma State's defense? How much did that
catch you off guard the way they came out in comparison to how they came out
on Monday night?  
CHARLES RICHARDSON JR.: They came out with a lot of energy. You know, they
pressured the ball. They just came out and played pressured defense. I don't
think -- they didn't do anything different than they did on Monday. We just
wasn't ready the first couple minutes for their defensive pressure.  
You know, credit to them. They came out ready to play tonight. You know, both
teams played hard and they just -- they just came out on top.  
  
Q. Guys, both of you, Coach was talking about how tired this team was on
Monday. Do you think that had anything to do with the performance tonight?  
CHARLES RICHARDSON JR.: No, I don't think so. It is just one of those nights.
We didn't shoot the ball well and we wasn't patient at times to get Aleks some
touches down low. Their defense took us out of our game plan a little bit.  
Once we got going, we was back into the game. But by that time, it was almost
over. But I don't think -- I don't think we had any fatigue problems out there
tonight.  
  
Q. Aleks, getting behind as early as you guys did, does it start wearing on
you after a while being down ten consistently throughout the game?  
ALEKS MARIC: No, not at all. I think we are a very tough team. We have shown
during the year we can come from behind and win games. That's no excuse.  
I think both teams played hard, and like Coach said, with 24 turnovers, it is
hard to win.  
  
Q. What about your defense, Charles, as Nebraska's defense as a team?  
CHARLES RICHARDSON JR.: Both teams played great defense. We held them to
50-some points. I don't think defense was a problem tonight. We just didn't
make shots and take care of the ball. Looking at the stats, only two people in
both teams had double-digit points. So defense was real good by both parts.  
We just got to be able to control the ball, take care of it and make open
shots.  
  
Q. Charles, can you kind of comment on the play of Sek and Chris Balham,
what do they bring when they come out onto the court?  
CHARLES RICHARDSON JR.: As a substitute player, you can't come in trying to
get ready. They came in tonight with a lot of energy. They was ready to play
and they tried their best out there and they gave it all they had. Sek made
some shots. Chris played his butt off on the boards and tried to box out, and
defensive holding the big men. Like any other night, we needed somebody to
step up and they both played real well tonight.  
  
Q. Doc, can you just talk a little bit more about Oklahoma State's defense?
Did they do anything differently from Monday night or was it all energy?  
COACH DOC SADLER: I thought their intensity was much better. No, Oklahoma
State is a team that is one of the most talented teams in this tournament. I
mean, they're -- you know, for whatever reason, I don't know because I don't
coach them, but they were a Top 10 team. They are very talented. They are very
big. They are very athletic. And their bodies got against our bodies and we
weren't strong enough to get open.  
That's what the 24 turnovers were. It was just -- it was strictly an intensity
thing, in my opinion. I have made this statement, I think you've got to play
so much harder offensively when you play against good defense teams. I think
that was an example of that tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, do you think post-season play N.I.T., is that still a
possibility?  
COACH DOC SADLER: I don't think so. I would like to sit up here and blame it
on the conference if we don't. But I don't think we're going to be a
tournament team. So I will blame it on the media. It is the media's fault
(smiling).

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [Bob Knight](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15563)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
Q. Coach, what did you think of Zeno's play early on versus late in the
first half and then the second half?  
COACH BOB KNIGHT: I thought that the last five or six minutes Zeno played very
well. He had missed a couple block-outs. We had a little discussion on the
sideline, and I was really pleased that the way he reacted over the period
where we had to play to win the game. Wasn't really a discussion. It was kind
of a one-way conversation. "Discussion" is being very liberal with what took
place.  
  
Q. Can you shed some light on what exactly that one-way conversation was?  
COACH BOB KNIGHT: No. If I wanted you to know about, I would have called time
and invited you to come down and listen. So when you're sitting up there, I'm
on somebody or talking to somebody, you know, you can turn to whoever is
beside you and say, well, the son of a bitch didn't invite me down, I guess he
didn't want me to know.  
  
Q. What do you think of your team's defensive play today?  
COACH BOB KNIGHT: We gave up a lot of stuff. They did a good job driving to
the basket. We had people that seemed to be tentative on offense -- or on
defense, rather, in terms of moving to help.  
I really think our defense in the last four or five games has been pretty
good, and I don't think it has been as good today as it has been. They had
something to do with that. They were aggressive and going to the bucket with
the ball.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the matchup with Kansas State tomorrow?  
COACH BOB KNIGHT: Well, Kansas State is a very, very tough team with a really
good coach, a tough-minded coach and a tough-minded team.  
I think they have shown all year long that they are very tough for anybody to
play against and that certainly will be the case for us tomorrow. They're a
team that I think in view of the record that they have in this league should
-- if there wasn't any game played tomorrow should be in the NCAA tournament.  
I think that's a pretty good tribute to Bob Huggins and his players.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you feel like Decensae White has played the last few
games?  
COACH BOB KNIGHT: I think White is still too careless. He is casual. He is a
casual player. He jive asses around out there. I'm not sure he knows he has
missed a blockout or taken a bad shot. That's what we are trying to teach him.  
I think he has really made good contributions to our team and in and out, he's
made good plays. He made two really good plays at the end of the half that
made a big difference in where we were starting the second half and where we
would have been without the five points that he scored.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you handle preparation in tournament play with the quick
turnaround?  
COACH BOB KNIGHT: We just prepare. We just go tonight and go over our last
game with Kansas State and what they have done since and just say here's what
we got to do. You know, it isn't like we're going to, you know, attack Tokyo.  
  
Q. Coach, if you can, talk about your ability to get to the free throw line
and how that helps you in tournament situations, especially as now you're
going into the NCAA as it looks like?  
COACH BOB KNIGHT: I think that we've always been -- let me rephrase that. I
have always wanted us to be a team that can score from the free throw line,
that we try to maneuver and get people in position where they have got a half
a step or a step and they can go to the bucket.  
We've always been that kind of a team. I think that -- I remember as a player
we're playing St. John's in Madison Square Garden in the Holiday Festival.
This was a great lesson for me. I had the ball at the foul line and I drove
and I scored. I didn't score a hell of a lot of buckets but I scored this one
against Tony Jackson who was an All-American at that time.  
And Jackson fouled me, and the bucket didn't count. I went to the free throw
line and I made two free throws. And I remember sitting after the game in the
locker room. I wanted to tell Havlicek so bad that I scored against Tony
Jackson and the referee had screwed me out of that, see.  
But, anyhow, he came over and he thought what I was thinking. He sat down
beside me and he said, that was a big play when you drove and got to the free
throw line and made both free throws.  
You know, that got me thinking. I thought back to that when I started
coaching, that one of the things I wanted kids to understand was that two
points from the free throw line is many times more valuable than two points
from the floor. You are not as excited about it. The fans don't see it that
way.  
But you get fouled, you make two points, it is the third foul on this kid in
the first half. You are now in the one and one. You are now shooting a two-
shot foul.  
I really think back to that play that I made or didn't make in that game and
that was December of 1960. And that was one of the things that I really
thought about when I started coaching, the value of the free throw.  
  
Q. There seems to be an impression that the Big 12 is not as good as some of
the other conferences around the country. How good is this conference?  
COACH BOB KNIGHT: I think the conference is really good. There are a hell of a
lot of teams that will get beat by Kansas and Texas and Texas A&M. That's
three really good teams. I'm not sure who else has three really good teams.  
I don't know anybody who has three that are really good. And then there's
another three or four that are pretty good. You know, in most conferences,
they are just pretty good. Now, we played those three and they are damn good,
all three of them.  
So I think the conference is very good. I mean, that's why -- you know, I
don't pay much attention to that stuff. But Pat tells me or one of the other
coaches tells me that, well, this conference will get four teams. I just don't
think that's realistic at all. I mean, you have got a team that finished --
Kansas State finished 10-6 in a tough conference. And I think that, to me, I
mean, they're a lock.  
In this conference if you go 10-6 to get into it and they won a couple of
games like -- a game I'm sure they would overlook we damn near get beat by
North Dakota State at home and they beat North Dakota State but they beat them
up there. That's a hell of a win.  
I don't know. Sometimes, you know, I am always a little bit -- just like this
deal with Dick Vitale that I have been kind of crusading for. Somebody has got
to tell people how important the guy has been to college basketball. You just
can't look at a resume and say, oh, here's Dick Vitale, he coached for --
broadcast for 27 years, Dick Enberg was his partner, what does that tell you?
Nothing.  
I think that is a screwy way to handle things because let's say we got a coach
that coached 30 years ago. Hell, the only guy in America that will remember
the guy is me. And if they don't listen to me, how the hell is he going to get
in the Hall of Fame? How was that for a tirade? (Smiling.)  
We are not going to take any more questions? Are you hungry?  
Has anybody else got a question? The hell with him. Does anybody else got a
question? You guys better catch me in this mood; it ain't going to happen very
often.  
  
Q. Since you seem like you are in a good mood, I will ask one that you have
shot down before. Can you reflect on what Jarrius Jackson has meant to this
program and his development over the last few years?  
COACH BOB KNIGHT: I think he has been a kid that has been about as consistent
a scorer as you can find. If you go over the games that we've won, he scored.  
When we've played somebody tough and maybe gotten beat, he's scored. I mean,
when we've been in a game where we've done a good job against a good team,
almost invariably he has scored.  
Actually, I think tonight was one of the lighter games he's had or this
afternoon. He didn't get a bucket in the second half, I don't think. But, you
know, he winds up with 13 points. This would be -- was that Kevin Weiberg? Is
he not happy with our press conference? (Smiling.)  
Charlie, you want to check on this and see what we are up against here?  
So if you checked it over, you would find it, if we have played somebody
that's good, well, win or lose, he has been a really consistent scorer against
good teams for us.  
  
Q. Since you got started on this topic a second ago, I wonder how you would
respond to those who refer to tomorrow's game between you and K-State as a
play-in game for the tournament?  
COACH BOB KNIGHT: To me before the tournament ever started, both teams should
be in the NCAA tournament. I think that their record season long -- the
problem I have with the tournaments, because of the problems I have -- my
teams have never done very well in post-season tournaments.  
A couple of years ago, Oklahoma State beat us in the championship game. That's
the only time we have ever been in a championship game.  
I don't think with the exception of a team that -- if a team is in the NCAA
tournament at the end of a season, then the only way a tournament should
matter is that somebody wins a tournament championship that wasn't figured on
getting into the NCAA.  
I don't think you can put one game against an entire season or two games
against an entire season. Kansas State finishes fourth in this league, a
really tough league. I think they should be in it.  
You know, I think we should be in it. Hell, I think Kansas ought to even be in
it (smiling).  
  
Q. Coach, you are having such a good time here, is it fair to say that
Oklahoma City is working fine for you? You are enjoying it? The site is
fine?  
COACH BOB KNIGHT: My wife is from Oklahoma. My dad was born and grew up in
Oklahoma. When I was 12 years old, my mother took me on the train to
Pittsburgh to see OU play Pittsburgh. It was a 7-7 tie. They lost all those
backs from the year before. Vessels, Crowder, McPhail were all gone and Buddy
Leake was the only guy back. That was even before your time. That's how long I
have liked Oklahoma. I want to stop right there. There are some things about
Oklahoma that have displeased me from time to time.  
Just remember, if I'm all pissed off tomorrow and don't feel like talking,
just remember we had a nice time today.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [Jarrius Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15060)

### [Martin Zeno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14273)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
Q. Either one of you guys, can you talk about what was going on defensively
in the second half and if you think you can get away with that kind of effort
again for the rest of the season?  
JARRIUS JACKSON: We just went through some mental lapses on defense. Missed a
couple switches and missed a couple of blockouts and it hurt us.  
We capitalized on our mistakes on defense, and we just have to watch film and
just correct our mistakes.  
  
Q. Martin, I wonder if you can talk about taking the game over down the
stretch. I think I had you at 13 in a row. Talk about the run you had to kind
of close them out.  
MARTIN ZENO: I had got taken out, he told me what I am going to do is sit down
on the bench or I am going to go out there and play. I felt like playing so I
went out there and did what he asked me to do.  
  
Q. Martin, you have been getting in the free throw line a lot. Is there an
art to that?  
MARTIN ZENO: Draw the ball and get fouled. That's all I can say.  
  
Q. Martin, if you can talk about -- you guys being able to penetrate and get
to the free throw line earlier, how did that make it easier down the
stretch?  
MARTIN ZENO: When we get to the foul line early, it makes the game easier for
us because the team being fouled, get in foul trouble, it is easy to cut and
screen and get open layups.  
  
Q. Martin, what were you doing or not doing that caused him to tell you that
you are either going to sit or play?  
MARTIN ZENO: I guess I wasn't as aggressive, just letting things go and not
playing defense really like he wanted me to. Stuff like that.  
  
Q. Jarrius, yesterday you said you didn't think that you guys -- or you
couldn't lose to Colorado. Did you think you are in the NCAA tournament now?  
JARRIUS JACKSON: I think our chances are much greater getting into the
tournament. We still have some work to do tomorrow against K-State. We can't
sleep on them because we know they are trying to get in the tournament as
well. We have to come out ready to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jarrius, you didn't quite score like you usually do. How nice was it to
have Martin to pick up the slack today?  
JARRIUS JACKSON: In the second half, it was a big help. He took the pressure
basically off all of us. He take the game over getting to the line. Got to
give credit to Martin on that.  
  
Q. Can you both talk about what the difference will be against Kansas State
tomorrow than when you played them in Manhattan?  
MARTIN ZENO: I think they are all gelling at the end of the season. People
know their roles, they know how the coaches coach, where the coaches roll
from. It will be a very tough game.  
JARRIUS JACKSON: We know they are trying to get into the tournament and people
just been telling us we wasn't in so we will come ready to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the way Decensae and Charlie played in their first Big
12 tournament?  
JARRIUS JACKSON: Decensae and Charlie took the pressure off today. Charlie got
to the line, knocked down some big shots. And Decensae with his open threes
and his rebounding.  
  
Q. Martin, did you tweak your ankle again, same thing you did against
Oklahoma State?  
MARTIN ZENO: Yeah, I came down on Jackson-Wilson's foot and tweaked it again.
I hurt it a little bit but it is all right now.  
  
Q. For either one of you guys, how hard is it with a quick turnaround to get
a good preparation for the next team?  
MARTIN ZENO: We played them before early in the season, so we know exactly
what they want. We might make a little bit of changes on our defensive play.  
You know, being in high school, we played in tournaments that did this. It is
the same thing. We just got to be prepared.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [Dominique Coleman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16990)

### [Ricardo Patton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13705)

### [Richard Roby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13912)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
COACH RICARDO PATTON: I was really proud of our young men. Came out and did
battle. We got down early in the game but stayed the course and had our
chances. The free throw shooting certainly hurt us, of course them attempting
44 and us attempting 22, even the ones we got didn't do a good job of
capitalizing and making those free throws.  
Give Tech credit, they played extremely well and just kept us on our heels
most of the day. But, again, our guys, I thought for their first tournament
experience, eight of those guys did a terrific job.  
  
Q. Rich, is there a sense of relief or a sense of a weight being lifted off
your shoulders now that the season is done and you guys can look to the
future?  
RICHARD ROBY: I wouldn't say that. The weight it going to be there next year.
Just have to go out in this off season and work really hard and get back to
playing great basketball and get ready for a great season next year.  
  
Q. What did you guys think of how Zeno played today, the Red Raiders?  
RICHARD ROBY: He did pretty good. He got to the free throw line a lot, 28
points. Always a good night.  
  
Q. Dominique, can you talk about your emotions playing your last game and
what's next for you?  
DOMINIQUE COLEMAN: Class on Friday.  
COACH RICARDO PATTON: Good answer, good answer.  
  
Q. Can both you guys talk about playing for Coach and what he has meant to
you guys going through today?  
DOMINIQUE COLEMAN: He's hard on us but he's hard on us to try to bring out the
best of us. I think he has a good job with us. He knows what our strengths and
what our weakness is and he coaches us to be in this game. If we convert on
free throws, the game is tied. If we limit turnovers, we win the game. That's
what he preaches all season, free throws and turnover. If we capitalized
there, we'd be sitting on the other side talking about a win.  
RICHARD ROBY: It has been great playing for Coach. Gave me an opportunity to
come here and play in the Big 12. I thank him for that and everything he has
done for me and my family, and I just hope he gets a great job soon. I know he
is going to do a great job wherever he is at.  
  
Q. Richard, have you decided -- is this your last game at Colorado? And if
not, how will the next coach -- will that persuade your decision?  
RICHARD ROBY: I don't think it is my last game at Colorado. I think our
athletic director will do a great job of bringing in another great coach. You
know, I want to -- when I came here, my main goal was to go to a NCAA
tournament. I haven't had a chance to do that yet, and I still have one more
opportunity to do that next year. So I'm looking forward to whoever they bring
in because I feel like I can play for any coach. So that's how I feel for
that.  
  
Q. Coach, how did Sean's number get entered incorrectly into the score
book?  
COACH RICARDO PATTON: You know, our score book had it in correctly. The game
score book did not. We don't have a 42 and so I'm not quite sure how that
number was printed on the program.  
The problem was we signed off on it. One of my assistant coaches had signed
off on the score book. But Andrew Green had it correct in his book. So I don't
know how it actually happened.  
  
Q. Coach, you have known for a while that the end was coming. How does it
feel now that you finally reached the end at Colorado? What are your emotions
now that you have reached the end of your tenure at Colorado?  
COACH RICARDO PATTON: Right now, again, I have said all season long, I'm at
peace with who I am. I am at peace with the job we've done. And I am at peace
with moving on. It becomes another chapter in my life and I feel very
fortunate to have coached in ultimately the best conference in America and to
have walked the sidelines with some of the best coaches in the game.  
So I feel nothing but admiration toward the University of Colorado and for the
opportunity that it has afforded me. I look forward to the next chapter of my
life, and that involves working at something.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Knight had some words for you after the ball game. Could you
share what he told you afterwards?  
COACH RICARDO PATTON: You know, he just talked about enjoying our relationship
and if there was anything he could ever do for me, he would do that and has a
great deal of respect for what we've done here.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys were able to limit what Jarrius Jackson did offensively
pretty well. But then Martin Zeno came up and picked up the slack. How tough
is it to stop both those guys or limit them?  
COACH RICARDO PATTON: It is very difficult. Particularly when guys, you know,
are really able to attack the middle of your defense and get to the foul line.
That's where we weren't able to play defense, is at the free throw line. But I
thought our guys did a pretty decent job when we were changing defenses, going
from different zones and some man-to-man. I thought our kids battled nicely.  
  
Q. Ricardo, the matchup tomorrow between Tech and K-State. You have seen
both of them. You have also been in a position of having a record of 10-6 --
winning record in the conference and not going to the tournament. Your
thoughts and if you think Kansas State is in?  
COACH RICARDO PATTON: I think it will be an excellent ball game. Two teams
that know how to play. Two teams that have marquee guys that they can count on
night in and night out. I will be curious to see the final free throw tally
for both teams and see what that outcome is about.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you say you want to work at something. Do you have any
plans for immediate future? Or what you might look into doing? Do you want to
relax or work more?  
COACH RICARDO PATTON: No, I'm a working stiff. I got to work. (Smiling) if you
go down to Wendy's and you hear a familiar voice saying "can I take your
order", it may just be me (smiling). I got to work. That's the only thing I
know how to do.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [Rahshon Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16319)

### [Greg McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15827)

### [Mike Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16983)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
CHARLIE FISK: We're joined by Coach Greg McDermott and his two student
athletes, Rahshon Clark and Mike Taylor.  
COACH GREG MCDERMOTT: As has been the case many times this year, these guys
didn't quit and that's -- that's been a theme with this group all season long.  
We didn't play very good basketball the first half, Oklahoma had a lot to do
with that, their ability to get Nate Carter started was the difference between
the difference in Ames and the game here today. While they did that, we got in
foul trouble and weren't able to keep the game close in the first half because
of that. They competed the second half. We got back in the game, actually took
the lead and put ourselves in a position to win and in the end Oklahoma just
made a few more plays than we did.  
  
Q. Rahshon, can you talk about what it was like this year. A new coach, new
system and what it has been like for you this year?  
RAHSHON CLARK: It has been a good season for me. You know, I wasn't as much as
a scorer as I was last year. It is no big deal about that. But I have been
doing things that I really haven't been doing last year as far as me playing
good defense or rebounding the ball that much. But the season has been great.
I'm surrounded by good players. Mike Taylor, he is a good player. You know, I
felt bad for the seniors that we couldn't pull this win off so we could
continue our season but they're great. The seniors that are leaving are great.
We are going to miss them and I wish them the best for whatever they do.  
  
Q. Mike, I wonder if you can talk about you guys rallied back to take the
lead. You had boisterous fans behind you. Would you talk about what happened
then afterwards? It seems like you had the momentum going pretty good at that
point.  
MIKE TAYLOR: It was a story of our season, this game that we played today.
There was a lot of ups and downs in the first half but we put ourself in a
position to win. We had a couple of good looks at the basket. It just didn't
fall and came down on the defense end and it was a contested shot but the shot
went in and I felt like everybody that stepped on the floor tonight gave it
their all. We left it all out on the floor for the last 20 minutes in the
second half.  
  
Q. How tough is it when you have to come back from a hole that you guys have
dug at different times in the ball game? You guys had that first hole that you
dug out of, then Oklahoma extends the lead again and you have to come back and
take the lead. How tough is it to finish a game when you have to do that
multiple times?  
MIKE TAYLOR: It is real tough but we never gave up. We never thought that we
was out of the game. I was telling the guys that it is not over until the horn
sounds, until that last horn sounds. We just gave it -- we just gave it our
all and put everything out there on the floor.  
I still think that we had a terrific chance to take the lead up four, maybe
five points, some great shots. Some wide-open looks at the basket. It just
rattled out a couple times and one was short. It was great looks at the
basket, so, I mean, if them shots had of falled, then the game probably would
have been our way.  
  
Q. Mike, can you look back at this year and what you guys have done and what
do you see for the future?  
MIKE TAYLOR: This season, I think it was a great season for us, great first
year for the Cyclones. At the beginning of the year, before the preseason even
started, critics were saying, the media was saying that we was the bottom of
the Big 12, finish the bottom of the Big 12, 11th and 12th in the Big 12. And
we finished off the conference at the 8th seed.  
We had a chance to be 6th, so, I mean -- I felt it was a great season for us
in our first year here. Next year we just got to learn from the mistakes and
learn from the hard times that we went through this year and just get better.
We had a nice freshmen class coming in that we can build on.  
That's about it.  
  
Q. Coach, Jiri and Wesley both struggled in the first half. How did they
overcome that? And they came out and had a much better second half. What did
you do to adjust?  
COACH GREG MCDERMOTT: Part of their struggles was their foul trouble and not
being able to get into the flow of the game because of the foul trouble. Wes
got a couple quick ones and we made the decision to leave him on the bench. I
felt if we could keep it within ten we could keep Mike and Wes on the bench.
We were able to sneak Mike in there for a couple minutes. Had he a big three
and cut it to nine. And then we got him out of there again.  
We got Jiri some touches and he didn't finish the plays down low and Oklahoma
did some good things to keep it out of his hands with some switching and some
helping that they provided when caught the ball.  
But we just -- we played much better the second half than we did the first
half. We were more inspired. Offensively, we moved the ball a little bit
better and we shot it better, obviously.  
  
Q. Greg, I know it is kind of early to ask for some year-end perspective on
a season. Do you think this team -- how well do you think this team maximized
its ability this year?  
COACH GREG MCDERMOTT: The important thing is that we've made strides in really
all areas. Our offense has improved. Our defense gave us an opportunity to be
in games in the Big 12 because if you look at our offensive numbers, field-
goal percentage, three-point field-goal percentage and our assist-to-turnover
ratio, it is pitiful. We have probably grown as a team more than anything. We
started 6-0 and lost five of our next six.  
Any time there is a new coaching staff and we had only four or five returning
players and then you bring in five or six new players and there is all these
new coaches, when that happens, when you lose five out of six, you find out a
lot about guys' character. That's when they are going to turn on each other,
start pointing fingers and come up with every reason under the sun as to
what's wrong besides taking a look in the mirror.  
To our guys' credit, they did not do that. They stayed on the same page. We
kept moving forward. And, you know, there's guys that have plenty of room to
grow. As a unit, what we were dealing with, I'm pretty proud of where they
finished and most proud they never quit. They didn't quit early in the season,
they had that bad stretch. They didn't quit in a game like today when the
chips were really against on when we were down 14.  
CHARLIE FISK: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [Jeff Capel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15825)

### [Nate Carter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16981)

### [David Godbold](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16982)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
CHARLIE FISK: We're joined by the Oklahoma Sooners. Coach Jeff Capel and his
student athletes David Godbold and Nate Carter. Congratulations on the victory
today. Your assessment of the Sooners' play.  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: I'm proud of our guys. It was a good win. We feel very
fortunate to be able to move on and to play against an incredibly talented
Kansas team. We felt we get off to a good start today. I'm sorry, this
morning. And we had a very good first half which ended in a three-pointer by
Bobby Maze and a good decision by Tony Crocker.  
In the second half we came out and we knew they were going to make a run,
which they did. Mike Taylor and Hubalek were in foul trouble most of the first
half, and they came back and Taylor got going. They took a lead.  
But I was proud of our guys. We came back. We executed. Some guys made some
big plays. David hit a big three for us off of a set that we ran and our guys
made a great decision off of different options off of that play.  
And then we were able to make some free throws down the stretch. We feel
fortunate to win and we look forward to moving on.  
  
Q. Nate, how did it feel early in the game, you guys got off to a great
start and actually got a big lead. How did it feel to have success at this
particular point in the game, something you have been striving to get, the
last three, four games haven't been able to. In this game you got up by double
digits early and played well early. How did it feel to get off to a great
start?  
NATE CARTER: We felt great. We came out there as one and we left it all out
there on the floor and that's what helped us win the game.  
  
Q. Did you guys get tired at all playing all the minutes?  
NATE CARTER: No, can't be tired now.  
DAVID GODBOLD: No. You know, we did a lot of running and a lot of conditioning
that's kicking in right now. And it is helping us for the last push through.
Coach said if we get tired, we're not going to win so we push through and all
the guys came out and gave us sparks. It was a pretty good game for us.  
  
Q. With 4 1/2 minutes to go they took the first lead of the game and then
you guys were able to keep them scoreless for the next four minutes. They
didn't score a free throw until 33 seconds to go in the game. Talk about your
mind-set when they took the lead?  
NATE CARTER: We knew they were going to make a run. We just had to clamp down
on defense. It was just how we were going to respond, and we responded well.  
  
Q. David, with a couple minutes to go, I think it was, you were encouraging
the crowd to get involved or possibly more involved. Your thoughts on that?  
DAVID GODBOLD: Yeah, I saw the fans were getting behind us. I just wanted to
make a little bit more noise.  
I felt that we kind of needed that extra push to finish the game off correct,
so I tried to get the fans involved. We are going to need that as the
tournament goes on because we feed off our fans. The more they are backing us,
the better we play.  
  
Q. David, it looked like -- and Nate for that matter, neither one of you
guys wanted to wrap up this season which very well could have happened had you
lost the game. Talk about your plays, David, down the stretch, not just the
three, but when you dove in there and got the steal and called time out and
you got the big offensive rebound on the free throw. Talk about not wanting to
quit playing. And, Nate, I wish you would respond as well.  
DAVID GODBOLD: Just like Coach has been stressing to us, if we don't get the
50/50 balls we won't have a chance to win. Coach told us if there's something
on the ground, just go get it. If we knew they beat us to the ball, they would
get the win.  
So I just had in my mind -- let me go ahead and get my ball for the team. We
didn't have Mike Neal out there. I didn't want the season to end when he's not
out there playing with me. Any close ball that was close, I was going to go
get it for the team.  
NATE CARTER: That's right. I mean, we just -- we don't want to go home right
now. We just want to keep playing, keep playing hard.  
We believe that if we play together, we can beat anybody.  
  
Q. Last time you guys played Hubalek, he had a career night against you
guys. Coming in what did Coach Capel tell you to look for? You did a good job
in slowing him down.  
NATE CARTER: Coach was just saying he will go over his left shoulder.
Everything he did was over his left shoulder. We were trying to take away the
left shoulder together as a team, not just one person. We did that. So ...  
  
Q. Any general thoughts about playing Kansas again? Do you take a lot of
confidence because you played them so well last time? How much confidence will
that give you?  
DAVID GODBOLD: Even though we played them really well, we didn't get the stops
we should have. We know they are coming in with a lot of confidence. They are
the No. 1 seed in the tournament. They are coming in with a lot of confidence.
They are ready to play. They will watch this tape. They will see how to break
us down or whatever.  
What we have to do tonight is prepare for them. They have a lot of great
players. We have to prepare one by one, one step at a time to hopefully stay
close in the game and hopefully we can come out on top.  
  
Q. Jeff, two questions really. First, do you think you sewed up an N.I.T.
bid with this victory? And secondly, if you can talk about what happened to
Mike Neal and why he didn't play?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: I don't know, to answer the first question. That's something
in the hands of someone else.  
We want to do everything we can to try to continue our season right now. When
we get to that point, our conference tournament is over with or if we lose,
then we will start thinking about that. But right now I'm not sure.  
As far as Michael Neal, Mike was sick. Last night about 1:30 -- there is a
stomach virus going around here and Mike caught it. He wasn't able to keep any
food down, any liquids down. We put an I.V. in him before the game, tried to
get some fluids in him and some food this morning. Because of how early the
game was, just wasn't able to go.  
And so that's a decision that we made and hopefully he will be ready tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jeff, you have been playing pretty good defense most of the year. Another
great defensive effort today. Talk about the strategy of Hubalek and holding
Iowa State to 42% shooting?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: I thought first half we did a very good job defensively.
Holding 23 points. They shot 31% in the first half. A big part of that is that
we had their guys in some foul trouble, some of their main guys.  
In the second half, they were able to get going a little bit. With Hubalek one
of the things we wanted to do, when we played them in Ames, we didn't do a
good job of guarding them, not just one or two guys. We didn't do a good job.
What I mean by that, when their guard set screens, we didn't check cuts. We
didn't do any of those things. Our guys did a better job of that.  
The other thing we wanted to do in watching tape, and watching film on
Hubalek, we felt he was more effective when went over his left shoulder. We
wanted to take that away. In saying that, I think two of the three field goals
he hit were little left-hand jump hooks. We told our guys we will live with
him making those. At their place they were 11-16. If they goes 11-16 shooting
left-handed jump hooks, then we don't have a chance anyway.  
The other thing with Michael Taylor, we knew he would get some points but we
didn't want him to be efficient getting points. He got going in the second
half. But to get, what, 10 points -- or 18 points, took 16 shots. That was
pretty good for us. I thought we did a pretty good job on him.  
  
Q. Jeff, I was wanting you to comment on David Godbold's play down the
stretch. It seems like when you win these type of games, you need somebody to
step up. It seems like you got that out of David Godbold in the last four,
five minutes of the game?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: David is one of our most experienced guys as far as playing.
He is our most experienced guy as far as playing. He is the guy that has been
off and on, three-year starter in this program. He is a guy that has played a
lot, played in big games and played well in big games.  
I think you saw a guy that's been in this environment before and he played
well. He had a huge three for us. Getting on the floor and getting stops,
getting 50/50 balls, playing pretty good defense, harassing their guys,
getting key rebounds and also David is the guy -- if you watched toward the
end of close games, he is the guy that we usually always have taking the ball
out because he is a pretty good decision maker. He is a guy who understands
what we want to do. He understands when to call a time out and when to look
for certain things.  
He is a guy that doesn't get panicked a lot. He is very important to our team
and has been a good player all year.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about what impresses you most about Kansas and also
about your second half two weeks ago and the pressure you are able to use and
to hurt Kansas in the second half?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: Everything impresses me about them. They are very, very
good. They are very talented at each position. They have depth. Great
athleticism, very good size. Had some guys that can shoot it. Good defensively
because of their athleticism, well-coached. They are very good.  
And it is the reason why they are ranked as high and they won our league. So
it is going to be a tough challenge for us. I thought we did a very good job
against them in the second half. We just haven't figured out how to guard the
free throw line yet. Maybe if we can guard the free throw line and they don't
get 32 free throws in the second half, maybe we will have a better chance.  
  
Q. Jeff, along those lines, what has Nate Carter's ability to make his free
throws meant to your team this season?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: It means a lot. It is a big weapons for us. I think the
thing that's probably even more important is his ability to draw fouls. He is
a guy that you can put him on the perimeter. He can drive it and hit a 17-foot
shot with consistency. But he is also a guy that is very crafty when he gets
the ball down low and is able to draw fouls.  
Most of his big games this year where he scored well, you look at it, the one
common thing is he usually gets to the free throw line a lot. I think tonight
he was there 13 times. It is a big weapon when you can have a guy that's kind
of become your go-to guy and can make free throws down the stretch.  
  
Q. Jeff, how important was it to win today? No matter what happens tomorrow,
if your season ends -- if you lose today, your season ends. But in front of
the home crowd, you are in the losing streak, how important is that?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: It is important. It is important to win every time you step
on the floor for me. I don't ever know when it is not important, but it was --
it was important for us because we wanted to continue our season.  
We have confidence in our ability. Even though we had lost those games in a
row, I think our guys did a good job of really embracing the fact that we're
0-0. This is a neutral floor. This is no one's home court. So we feel like we
have as good a shot as anyone. No one else probably believes that. That's
okay.  
We're excited about the challenge of playing Kansas. We know it will be
awfully tough because of how talented they are. But we're excited about it.
And we will get some rest and hopefully we will be rested up enough where we
can make it competitive tomorrow and have a chance down the stretch.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We are joined now by the Baylor Bears. Congratulations on your
victory tonight. Coach Scott Drew and his three student athletes, Aaron Bruce,
Henry Dugat and Curtis Jerrells.  
Coach, your thought on tonight's game?  
COACH SCOTT DREW: I want to thank everyone for staying up for us. I know it is
getting late. Anyway, we are very happy right now from the standpoint we felt
like we really executed well, did what we wanted to do offensively, attacking
the press and trying to get easy buckets.  
Now we just got to get focused and ready for tomorrow.  
  
Q. C.J., can you talk about how you got through your press? It didn't seem
like you had very much trouble with it at all.  
CURTIS JERRELLS: Like I told you before, our team is just -- like I said, we
guard. When we got both going, we are really hard to beat. You know, they
played into our hands really because we got four good guards on the team plus
a couple guards off the bench who can really play.  
There was three of us in there breaking it down and we had another freshman
coming in. We did a good job of handling the ball, getting open and attacking.  
  
Q. Curtis, what is it about Missouri that brings out the best in you? Last
year you had a 28 against them, a career high and you have another one
tonight?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: Basically it is a love for the game. I love to play. We
played them and they beat us up there. Our whole team had a little bit of that
on our mind. We wanted to come out and give it our all and win it here.  
  
Q. Do you guys feel like this is the way you maybe could have played all
year had you all been healthy?  
AARON BRUCE: We knew what we were capable of. Obviously we would like to play
like that and shoot like that in every game. Basketball, you have to deal with
different things, different defenses and you are going to have off nights.  
As far as tonight is concerned for us, it is a great feeling right now. It is
also over right now. We have to start the preparation for Texas. They are a
great team. We have go out and stretch out and get ourselves ready for that.  
  
Q. Curtis, can you talk about the mind-set of the team when they closed it
to within three points early in the second half?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: I didn't know they closed within three (smiling). Coach did a
good job of keeping us focused. That's been kind of a downpoint for us all
season. We get a lead and then in between a certain frame time like in the
second half, we would lose our leads.  
We just didn't want to go down like that again. We wanted to change the way we
played. We did a good job with the intensity level. They press a lot and run
around a lot. They were going to get some steals and get some scores. It was
just a matter of us keeping our composure.  
  
Q. Curtis, you guys played Texas tough twice. Can you talk about the
confidence you have now going into that game.  
CURTIS JERRELLS: We played them pretty tough but not good enough. I think
everybody on the coaching staff and our team knows that. We will have to give
a better effort than we did tonight in those other two games if we want to be
able to beat them.  
  
Q. Curtis, being from the Austin area, and I'm sure you have been asked this
before, did Texas look at you very hard? Did you ever want to go to UT?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: Oh, yeah, early on. But in that time frame they had Daniel
Gibson -- or they had T.J. Ford and Daniel Gibson going. They were pretty
stacked. But they looked at me early on, but took one visit to Baylor
University and I found my home.  
  
Q. This is for Henry. You all came in playing well, coming off a win and
then played well tonight. Can you maybe just talk about the confidence of the
team right now.  
HENRY DUGAT: I think it goes toward my teammates for getting me open shots and
everybody keying in on them. And also just everybody on the team being put in
the hard way, pushing each other to get better and better every day.  
  
Q. Curtis, I know you're not on the selection committee, but do you think
you might have just cost Missouri an N.I.T. slot?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: I don't know. I don't know what they deal with or where they
are going. The only thing I am focused on right now is Baylor.  
  
Q. If you were on the selection committee, would you invite Missouri?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: I don't know. That's not up to me, man.  
  
Q. For anyone, first tournament win since 2001. Can you just talk about what
this means for the program?  
AARON BRUCE: I think it means a lot to the program. We went through some
hardships that we personally didn't go through but the University has been
through hardships. I think this proves you put a pretty good system in place,
recruit the right people, have the right coaches and you can really turn
something around. That's been our goal all along. I think we are starting to
see some fruits of our labor. We have worked extremely hard. We deserve a
tournament win. We have worked very hard. I am happy for our guys and happy
for our staff.  
  
Q. C.J., I don't know if you have gone over this, can you tell me the tale
of the tooth, please?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: Just a little sore, got a little puffy, took a little
medicine and I'm fine.  
  
Q. Coach Drew says you are going back to the dentist every game day from
here on out. What do you make of that?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: I see him pretty often, just checkups. It happened to act up
and swell up on me. I took a little medicine and I was okay.  
  
Q. Scott, was this the biggest victory you've had since you have been at
Baylor?  
COACH SCOTT DREW: Is this the biggest win? I don't think it is the biggest
win, but it is big for a couple reasons. One, we haven't won a tournament game
since 2001. Two, it is the most wins Baylor University has had since 2001. And
shows we are on the right path.  
  
Q. Coach, after the two close games with Texas, how much confidence does it
give you as a head coach going into round three?  
COACH SCOTT DREW: I think that's a rivalry game. Whenever you have rivalry
games, I think you are excited to play. We have a lot of guys on our team that
know their guys, D.J. and Tweety grew up playing each other. I know we will be
excited and ready to go.  
  
Q. Coach, after having a big lead at half time and they made their run to
make it a five-point game, what did you do to step on the throats?  
COACH SCOTT DREW: We knew going in it was going to be a game of runs. You
could be up 20 or down 20. With their style of play, you need to weather the
storm. Our guys knew that. We needed to make sure we could handle that, not
panic and let an 8-0 run or whatever run it was lead to bigger run.  
Again, credit the maturity of our guys to be able to do that.  
  
Q. Scott, do you feel like your guys have clicked in to some new gear here
or what is your thought process?  
COACH SCOTT DREW: I like the way we shot tonight. I won't say anything about
that, but as far as a new gear, I think we have been playing well.  
I mean, if you come to our practices, you probably wouldn't see that because
the last two days we haven't had Kevin practicing or A.B. practicing. C.J.
missed because of his abscessed tooth. Maybe we practice too much. So we will
keep people out for a while, I guess.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [Mario Boggan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17008)

### [Marcus Dove](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14262)

### [Sean Sutton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13714)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We're joined now by the Cowboys from Oklahoma State. Coach Sean
Sutton and his student athletes, Mario Boggan and Marcus Dove.  
Coach, we will call on you for your thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: I thought our players really responded to the challenge
tonight. Monday night in Lincoln, I don't think anybody that was there felt
very good about that performance at all. It really challenged our players the
last couple days, not only about being able to win this tournament but to have
a really solid performance to start out with.  
I thought defensively for 40 minutes is about as well as we have played all
year long. Very active early, got our hands on a lot of balls. I think we had
26 deflections at half time. Our goal every game is to get somewhere between
40 and 45, and then we really clamped down on their three-point shooters.  
The second half, we didn't shoot the ball well. We had to play without Mario
for a long stretch there, but I really liked the effort and the energy that
our guys played with. If they will play that way the rest of the way, then I
think we have got a chance to win this tournament. That was our goal when we
came here.  
  
Q. Same question, it seemed to be a game there was a special intensity, it
seemed. It seemed like it was at another level. Did you sense that?  
MARCUS DOVE: Yeah, we didn't play our best when we first played on Monday
night, so we kind of had a chip on our shoulder. We wanted to come out and
show the fans we still know how to play Oklahoma State basketball. And I think
that's what we did tonight.  
MARIO BOGGAN: The same. I feel like Monday we didn't play as intense as, you
know, we thought we should have. We just wanted to come out tonight and play
real intense because the coaches have been stressing it the last couple days
in practice.  
We wanted to come out as a team collectively, be real intense and play hard on
the defensive end.  
  
Q. Aside from the intensity, at the end of the game it seemed like the first
time there were big bright smiles on your guys' faces. I noticed, Coach,
Marcus, you guys hugged, had a few words, had a big smile on your faces. Is
that a smile of relief? A smile of we got something accomplished? A smile of
the season continues? How would you describe those final moments after you two
had the favorable words?  
MARCUS DOVE: I would say a combination of all. We did accomplish something. We
got our first win of four. Now we just got to go three more.  
We played Oklahoma State basketball defense. Like we said earlier, that's the
best we played defensively all year. Even though we didn't play that well
offensively, but any time you play that well defensively, it makes up for it.  
  
Q. Marcus, you guys seemed a lot more aggressive. All five starters had a
foul in the first three minutes. Was that a sign you guys were out there
trying to get all up in there?  
MARCUS DOVE: Yeah, we really wanted to get in the passing lane and try to get
alive, get a lot of steals early and keep our intensity up. We got a couple of
fouls early, but we didn't let that lose our intensity.  
  
Q. Mario, is it possible for you guys to keep up this kind of defensive
intensity for four days straight?  
MARIO BOGGAN: I think it is very possible. I mean, just within yourself, you
know, knowing your assignments and Coach giving us a great scout report,
following our direction from the coach, I feel like we can keep up the
intensity.  
  
Q. For both players. Given the way you are feeling about yourselves now, can
you all talk about getting another crack at Texas A &M?   
MARCUS DOVE: Our first two times we played against A&M we didn't really play
our best. Not to take away anything from them. They played really well. I
mean, they are the Top 3 team in the Big 12 and the Top 10 in the country.
They are a great team. Acie Law, Joseph Jones, they got a lot of good players.  
We are looking forward to get another chance and play them and try to beat
them this time.  
MARIO BOGGAN: I feel the same. First two times we didn't really get -- we
weren't playing defense that good, and our offense wasn't clicking also. So I
feel like this time -- I mean, we are going to go out there and just play
harder. I feel like it is going to be a better game than last two games we had
played.  
  
Q. Marcus, you mentioned earlier that you hadn't been playing Oklahoma State
basketball. You wanted to show people that. Can you describe your emotions,
how you feel you have been playing? Is it frustration? Is it embarrassment?
What kind of emotion describes the way you guys have played the last two
months?  
MARCUS DOVE: I think most of it is frustration knowing we could play a lot
better than we have. Knowing that we're not only letting ourselves down and
the coaching staff down, but the fans for Oklahoma. I think this is a good
platform to get that back, a little of what we lost, back.  
  
Q. Coach, same question for you as I asked Marcus about the smiles at the
end of the game and your interaction with the players, in particular Marcus.
For you, was it a sense of relief or a sense of accomplishment? Or, hey, we're
back in it kind of a thing?  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: I was just so mad Monday night after that game. I was
probably as intense in that locker room before the game as I have been in a
long time. Wanted them to embrace the challenge of this game and to play
defense like our program has been known for.  
That's the one thing that this year -- we haven't played very good defense.
That's why we're in the position that we are.  
And I told them -- I really challenged them. I think it was a reward for how
hard they played, that I wanted them to feel great about their effort. And
when they play that way, the fans appreciate it and they ought to feel good
about themselves.  
  
Q. Sean, on Monday night when you guys got down 29, I know you had to kind
of start pressing. Did you maybe learn something about Nebraska and the way
they handled the ball that came in handy?  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: I think you have to try to learn something out of every
loss. I think that's one of the advantages that we had. As poorly as we
played, I thought we exposed an area of weakness with them that we were able
to speed their guards up and pressure their guards.  
That was the game plan from the start tonight, was to pick them up on every
made basket, on every made free throw and make them play the game 94 feet
against our defense.  
I thought we really got into them. We wanted to challenge every passing lane
and put heavy pressure on the ball.  
I didn't mind those five fouls to start the first half at all. I would take it
again tomorrow night if they will play with the same mind-set and just as
aggressive.  
  
Q. Sean, was it a concern about Obi, playing him too much or knowing when to
put him in or not? And just secondly, your thoughts on Obi because he has such
an athletic ability, he is probably what you want out there.  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: Our team lost a lot when we lost him early because he is
such a play maker. He plays fearless out there on the court and he makes plays
for other people.  
I think he will be rested tomorrow night. He only played 19 minutes tonight. I
thought one of the things that came out of our loss on Monday is that he got
to play 29 minutes and played very well at the offensive end which I thought
helped his confidence tonight.  
Working him back into the rotation of the team, it is not something that I'm
concerned about because I think our players understand we're a better team
when he is on the court. Tonight, as hard as we played at the defensive end,
we still have a lot of guys that are fresh. Kenny Cooper didn't have to play a
lot, David Monds didn't have to play a lot, Mario got in foul trouble and sat
on the bench quite a bit in the second half.  
Tomorrow night's game will be just as intense and Texas A&M is a lot better
team. I don't think energy or intensity is going to be a problem. I met with
them all last night, and I said, this is it. There is no tomorrow. This is it.
You guys want to keep playing, you have to win. You are going to regret this
later in life if you don't leave it all out there on the court.  
I said, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Obi, you're the only
freshman on this team. There is no guarantee by the time -- in three years
that the tournament will be back in Oklahoma City. At some point, it should
come back here. I think Oklahoma City will do a great job at proving that. But
it may not happen during his career at Oklahoma State.  
I said, you guys have a chance to separate yourself among the teams, not only
at Oklahoma State but all the teams in the Big 12. Nobody has won four
straight games in this tournament. We have one down. We still have three to
go. If we can play as well tomorrow night as defensively and played a little
bit better at the offensive end, then I think we will be right there with a
chance to win.  
  
Q. Sean, the last time you played Texas A &M in Stillwater, is tomorrow
night also as much about pride as maybe tonight was?   
COACH SEAN SUTTON: That's sort of been discussed in the locker room and the
fact that what happened and still the last time that we played was -- Texas
A&M played very well but it was embarrassing to get beat like that on our home
court. I think it is fresh in our mind that our fans weren't very pleased with
that game. Personally, I didn't blame them because we should never play that
way on our home court. But they are well aware of what took place that night.  
The biggest motivation is winning it and having a chance to go to the NCAA
tournament. I think they know that we are going to have to play well tomorrow
night because Texas A&M is a team that has got all the ingredients to make a
Final 4 team. I have said this before. They remind me a lot of the really good
teams we had at Oklahoma State. They don't beat themselves. They are very well
coached.  
As Barry says, they play rattlesnake-type defense and they're tough. They have
got two great players in Acie Law and Joseph Jones. I think our guys know what
we are up against.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [Mike Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15828)

### [Marshall Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17020)

### [Matt Lawrence](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17019)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We are ready to begin with the Missouri Tigers. Our head coach,
Mike Anderson, and his two student athletes, Marshall Brown and Matt Lawrence.  
Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: First of all, I always say when you get to this part of
the year, it was about surviving and advancing. We did survive tonight. A lot
of credit goes to a Baylor team that is steadily improving. They shot the ball
extremely well. At the same time, I didn't think we came out with the energy
that you got to have in order to guard players of that magnitude.  
They had some quickness. They made some shots. You got to give them credit. I
just didn't think -- we came out a little tight, and you can tell when you
look at the stats, the starters shot 63%. I think that's a record this year,
maybe in this tournament. They scored 97 points. That tells you getting into
this setting I think maybe a little nerves were going. But at the same time, I
didn't think we played the type of defense that has been typical of our
basketball team all year long.  
Let's give Baylor some credit. I think they are the team that's steadily
improving. They shot the ball extremely well.  
  
Q. Both players, just talk about what's going through your mind at the end
of the first half, I think it was 18-5 run to close things out.  
MATT LAWRENCE: Well, we knew that their guards were playing real well and we
need to stay in front of the ball. Going into half time, we need to have
adjustment and keep the ball in front of us.  
With that kind of lead, I think we need to play with some reckless abandonment
and scramble. We tried to but our guys, you know, they fought all the way to
the end. You got to credit our guys.  
They hit some shots today and their guards were pretty incredible.  
  
Q. Both players, do you look at this game as kind of a missed opportunity
for you with how everything went down tonight?  
MARSHALL BROWN: It was definitely disappointing any time you get to a
conference tournament. I felt like we were playing good basketball coming into
it. I am disappointed the way we came out. I thought we came out of the second
half and gave ourself a chance. We just couldn't finish it.  
  
Q. After Jerrells' three-pointer at the end of the first half, how
demoralizing was that after you cut it back to ten for him to hit that?  
MARSHALL BROWN: He was in a groove. He was hot. He was hitting pretty much
everything he threw up. That was kind of the way the game went. Going into the
second half, I think we turned our defense up, turned pressure up and started
playing the style of basketball we wanted. We just couldn't finish it.  
  
Q. How much different was this Baylor team than the one you faced back in
Columbia? What were the differences?  
MARSHALL BROWN: I think it is pretty much the same team. They didn't have
Aaron Bruce when we played them in Missouri. But I think their movement was
great. Their space was great.  
It also helps when you are knocking down shots.  
  
Q. Mike, since you didn't have any guards up here, can you talk about your
guard play and kind of their inability to kind of settle down Jerrells and
Dugat?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: It was kind of shocking to me in terms of how we did
defend. It is something we work on and something we talked about. I think that
was the strength of Baylor's team, their perimeter guys.  
We just played these guys three weeks ago. But as Marshall alluded to, they
made shots. I just don't think our guys played one of their better games. I
don't think they played well at all defensively.  
Who knows why you know. I take the blame on that. I didn't get them ready
enough in this particular setting. But I will do better, I promise you that.  
But, again, it was kind of interesting just to see the expression on our guys'
face even as we talked about the first and second time out. I just didn't
think we were defending like we have all year long.  
We have defended -- especially guys on the perimeter. But tonight for some
reason, it seemed like we were a half step slow. We didn't have that energy.  
  
Q. Mike, in conference play you guys have relied a lot on that matchup zone
you like to use and kind of went away from that tonight. Was there something
about Baylor's make-up that concerned you with playing the matchup zone?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: It didn't seem like we were playing anything else. We
played the matchup, trying to mix it up. We didn't have the energy. We tried
to scramble when we came back in the second half.  
One thing about us, 13-point lead at half time, that's no big deal. We have
been behind before. But it was one of those deals -- hills we had to climb. I
thought we climbed back pretty good. We cut it to four. We even cut it to
three.  
So now you really got to dig in and make stops. We just weren't able to. And
they made some tough shots. Even the shot he made -- Jerrells made at half
time. As a player you have to understand they have that kind of range.  
But we tried to play a lot of different defenses. It just didn't work tonight.  
  
Q. Mike, do you have a sense of maybe your chances to keep on playing in the
N.I.T.? Have you looked into that at all? Could you make a case for you guys
to keep on playing?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: Absolutely. I think we've had a pretty good year. When
you talk about day one with this basketball team to see where they are right
now -- even as we start out in the Big 12, we started off 0-4, 2-6, there has
been steady improvement.  
From a coach's standpoint, you want your team to get better. You want players
to get better. And I think as a whole, our team has gotten better.  
If there is an opportunity for us to play in post-season play, which hopefully
there is, we will continue because I think it would be great for this
basketball team.  
  
Q. Mike, you talked about day one. Can you assess your first season as coach
and what your goals are for your second season? What you need to improve on?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: I think coming in and trying to assess what we have, it
is one thing to assess it when you are talking about working out and
practicing and all that. Now that the season is going on, this team -- these
guys have bought into what we're doing. They are trying their hardest.  
They got better as the season went on, but you also get a chance to assess and
evaluate them when you start playing nonconference, conference play. You find
out a little bit more about your guys. One of the things I know we got to get,
we got to get a little bit more tougher. Toughness is defined even from a
defensive standpoint.  
Overall, there was steady improvement. I think from a coach's standpoint, you
could -- you don't mind that. I think we just got to -- hopefully, we can get
some additions that will help our basketball team and some of these guys will
be a whole lot better next year.  
  
Q. With so many juniors returning for next year, what did you -- compared to
what you thought at the beginning of the year, do you think this year was a
success?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: Absolutely. I think when you talk about where this team
came from to where it is now, these are some of the same guys that played last
year. You got to remember that.  
We added some guys. It is a brand-new basketball team. For these guys to amass
18 wins, and of course winning seven games in the Big 12, I think that's
improvement.  
I think if you want to call it being successful, I think these guys have. Who
knows, they may still have some more basketball to play.  
  
Q. Coach, going back to what you said about possibly having more basketball
to play, how much tougher does it make this loss knowing that your team could
have all but sealed up an N.I.T. bid with a win tonight?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: I think, first of all, we are playing to the Big Dance.
Everyone who comes in with an opportunity -- I always say the most important
game is the first game. For some reason, I think the nerves got us caught up.
That's what happens to a lot of teams, the nerves catching them in this
particular setting.  
But at the same time I think it was a good opportunity. This is a Baylor team
that's steadily improving.  
I got a feeling, I said it before, we are heading for something, I don't know
what. Maybe that means going to the N.I.T. We'll see.  
  
Q. Coach, having said that, with every team's goal being reaching the NCAA,
how would you look at an N.I.T. bid concerning where this program has been and
hasn't been in the N.I.T. in the past few years but not reaching that goal of
the NCAA tournament?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: I think, again, any post-season play with this basketball
team is going to benefit. You got to remember this team here is a brand new --
if you look at my basketball team, they are all like freshman. When you talk
about playing the up-tempo basketball and true to form, we looked like
freshmen tonight. At the same time if they can continue to play in post-season
play, they played in the conference tournament and maybe can play -- I think
it will benefit us I think in the long run.  
I think our -- my goal is to win a national championship.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2007

  

### [Jeff Green](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15561)

### [Roy Hibbert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13731)

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
JOHN THOMPSON III: Oh, boy. That's another thing off my to do list I can
scratch off. Questions?  
  
Q. About a minute left, you were waving at your dad saying something, what
were you saying?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: He was yelling something at me for the prior two minutes
and I couldn't hear what he said. I finally turned around and said, "For the
first time in your life, you can't talk loud enough that I can hear you what
the hell are you saying." He was screaming something. I was just asking what
he was saying, just sit down and be quiet.  
  
Q. Did he tell what you he was saying?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: No, not yet.  
  
Q. You guys were able to frustrate Aaron Gray to the point of 1 of 13
shooting and he looked very frustrated even on open looks; how were you able
to contain him and control the game from there?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: Well, it's a couple of things. One, Aaron just had a bad
day. He's one of the best players in the country, he's extremely talented.
They do a good job of getting him the ball in different situations and it was
just one of those days where the stars were not aligned for him; the stars
were not aligned for them. They are a significantly better team than they
looked tonight, and everybody knows that.  
That said, Roy did a very good job on them, just knowing and understanding
Aaron's tendencies and staying attentive to that.  
ROY HIBBERT: We just focused on making sure we do what we have to do, playing
help side defense, my teammates really had my help, so I just took it from
there. Pat played a real good job on him when he was in there, so we just had
each other's back when we were up there.  
  
Q. Roy, I noticed after the game in the handshake line, you and Aaron had a
nice hug, very sportsman like; what is it like when you dominate a man so much
in a matchup like that, and do you feel bad for him?  
ROY HIBBERT: We're both competing out there, so, you know, we're going
extremely hard. We have respect for each other and off the court, we're two
human beings. So I just told him, you know, "good work out there, you're a
really good player," and we'll see him again, hopefully, if we keep working.  
But he's an extremely good player.  
  
Q. Not every basketball program has the kind of history that Georgetown does
and you got to play this great game with all of these people who are part of
the past --  
JOHN THOMPSON III: I'm sorry, does anyone have stats? I haven't seen stats.
Sorry.  
  
Q. All of these people from Georgetown's illustrious past are in the arena
and watching including your coach's dad, including Patrick Ewing; can you
describe whether or not you enjoy having those kind of guys around when
something like this happens?  
ROY HIBBERT: I got an e-mail from Mike Sweetney before the game and said,
"going to play hard, going to play Georgetown basketball and going to
communicate on defense and help each other out." It's nice, it's a family
atmosphere. We had a couple former players come in the locker room and talk to
us and shake our hands. So I feel grateful that I get to be a part of that and
that I get to wear Georgetown across my chest.  
We won this tournament together and the regular season together and we did
this for all of the former Hoyas and ourselves and especially Coach Thompson.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Jeff played well all year but really elevated his
game here this week in the brightest lights; can you talk about how well he
played in the moment this week?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: Well, I said this after the last game, you know, this is
the time of year where good players, good teams play well, and there's no
doubt that Jeff Green is special with what he can do on the basketball court.
He can do so many things at such a high level, and he played extremely well
this weekend, there's no doubt about that.  
  
Q. You said you would address seeding tonight. Now that you have this behind
you, do you guys think you made a case for a No. 1?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: I may be the only coach in the country -- I haven't thought
about it. You know, once we go back to the hotel tonight and I'll start to
think about it. I don't know. I have not looked at any other team. I have not
looked at what other people around the country are doing, and maybe that's a
bad thing. I've just focused on Georgetown and this Conference tournament.  
So now I can sit and look and see where we stand. Where we're seeded, I have
confidence in the selection committee where they put us, and we'll see what
happens.  
  
Q. You have to feel good about the way you're going, I think you've won 16
of 17 now, one loss since January; do you feel good?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: Oh, there's no doubt, I think we're playing well right now.
You come out of the gate, and one thing I learned from Pops and from coach,
Coach Carril, is that NCAA bids, it doesn't matter how you play in the
beginning of the year. So we come out of the gate, we lose a couple of games.
I think people forgot about us, which is fine with me; which is fine with me,
forget about us. We had a chance to improve and our guys worked extremely
hard.  
And we're playing well right now. Hopefully we can continue and hopefully
enjoy this, this is special. The opportunity to win the BIG EAST regular
season and then win the BIG EAST tournament is something that's extremely
special and we're going to enjoy it.  
But then we have to turn that off and focus and get ready for the NCAAs.  
  
Q. After you accepted the trophy, you went to the floor and off by yourself
for a few minutes; just wondering what was going through your mind and what
emotions at that time?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: You know, as I said, this being here, playing in this
tournament, is something that is extremely special to me, you know, in year
three, to have won the regular season and the tournament is something that's
extremely special.  
Actually, it wasn't like I was walking off in deep contemplation. I was just
kind of letting the guys enjoy themselves and kind of sitting back and
watching, because they worked hard. I mean, these guys worked extremely hard.
We have an extremely unselfish group and I'm just happy for them. I'm happy
for the sacrifices that everyone made individually for the collective unit to
give us the opportunity to be here right now.  
  
Q. You gave up 24 offensive rebounds last night, 17 tonight; you win both
games --  
JOHN THOMPSON III: We got to box out --  
  
Q. Do those numbers concern you going into the tournament?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: Oh, come on, I don't want to start to break down -- I'm not
going to look at the tape of tonight's game tonight.  
We have to do a better job. Pitt -- both Notre Dame and Pitt are very good
offensive rebounding teams and we cannot give up that many -- that many second
shots to teams. You know, but yes, it's a concern, we'll start to address it,
at least think about it, in a couple of days.  
  
Q. During the cutting down of the nets, after your coach cut down the last
one, he led the whole group in the end zone of, "We are Georgetown"; what do
you think when you see your coach doing stuff like is that?   
JOHN THOMPSON III: He doesn't see me doing stuff like that.  
JEFF GREEN: It's funny to see him out there doing stuff like that. I was just
enjoying the moment seeing our fans cheer along with us.  
  
Q. How badly did you want to win this tournament; you played this week like
you were possessed?  
JEFF GREEN: I wanted to win it bad. It's something we wanted, to work hard
from day one and we wanted to be No. 1 and to win the BIG EAST championship to
go along with that. From the first game of the season, I've felt that I wanted
to be on top of the BIG EAST after it's all said and done. I wanted it very
bad from the start.  
  
Q. You just brought it up, you wanted to be on top of the BIG EAST, winning
the regular season, winning the tournament. I mean, do you feel that right
now, you're on top of the world and when you get to the NCAA Tournament, how
are you going to prepare yourself for that?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: I'm taking care of that for him. (Laughter).  
JEFF GREEN: Yes, he will. We still have some more work to do. We're not on top
yet. By the end of April we can see we're on top. We have to keep our
composure and stay focused and take it one game at a time and start looking at
what we have to do tomorrow during Selection Sunday.  
  
Q. You told us yesterday that you would rather win by 20 to 25 points; so,
was this more fun and at what point did you say, I'm about to be champion --  
JEFF GREEN: I didn't say until the clock hit zero because you never know what
can happen in the game of basketball. When the clock hit zero that's when it
finally hit me that we just won the BIG EAST title.  
But you know, it is fun to win by 20 but Pitt is an extremely good team. They
just had one of those nights where they could not make shots. We got lucky and
now we can say we're on top of the BIG EAST.  
  
Q. Your mom said that they initially tried to get you interested in tennis
and golf then in piano.  
JOHN THOMPSON III: When did you talk to his mom? (Laughter).  
  
Q. Right after the game. (Laughter) And basketball was like a struggle for
you early; did you ever think about --  
JOHN THOMPSON III: Early? (Laughter) Oh, I'm sorry, I'll sit back.  
ROY HIBBERT: I started growing real tall at a young age so I tried to use my
height. I wasn't too good at the other stuff. So I tried to be good at what I
was, being tall. (Laughter) If you want to ask me questions about tonight, I
can answer that, but any other time ask me questions about my past.
(Laughter).  
  
Q. When a school has a legacy, sometimes it can be a lot of pressure on
players, how are you guys able to thrive on the legacy and not let it wear you
down?  
JEFF GREEN: Because we're a different team from the legacy from when his dad
was coaching. You know, they were known as a defensive team and with us our
offense is pretty much our offense, we run it through our offense and on the
flipside of that --  
JOHN THOMPSON III: Our defense is pretty good, too. (Laughter).  
JEFF GREEN: Our defense is pretty good.  
JOHN THOMPSON III: Most nights. When you keep in front of your man.
(Laughter).  
JEFF GREEN: We just can't think about that. That's the past. We have to worry
about what we have to take care of now. We don't go into the past that much.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2007

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [Antonio Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13770)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
JAMIE DIXON: First of all I'd like to congratulate Georgetown, obviously they
are well-deserved and played well and deserved to be champions. We're
obviously disappointed. I thought we would play better and I know our guys
feel they could have played -- had hoped to play better. So they really beat
us in every aspect of the game, and you know, I can't say enough about how
well they played. I wish we could have played better but it just didn't seem
to be our night. Nothing seemed to go right offensively and we didn't seem to
be making shots. I thought we got good shots early and didn't knock them down
and then we got just -- just really got -- never got in a rhythm offensively.
Not a good team to get down against. Obviously they're patient offensively,
they are rebounding, and once we got down, it became even more difficult to
execute offensively.  
  
Q. When Aaron struggled from the field in the postseason last year, he said
a lot of it had to do with conditioning; has that maybe become a problem again
with him, conditioning late in the season again this year?  
JAMIE DIXON: No, I just think it was a big game where the shots didn't fall
and rushed a few of them. I don't think -- he only played 25 minutes, so I
don't think that was a big part of it.  
I think it's just one of those days where things didn't go well. It happens,
it happens to all teams. This is the same team -- Georgetown just lost up at
Syracuse by a large margin and then they looked this good tonight. Some teams
you just can't explain and I think that's a good comparison right there. We
looked so got last two days, and obviously didn't look very good tonight.  
  
Q. You trailed by 15 at the half tonight, 11 at the half yesterday; what was
so different between the second half tonight and the second half that you put
up against Louisville?  
JAMIE DIXON: Well, I think the second half, you know, we came out and hit a
couple of shots in the second half yesterday and that can change a lot of
things. It can make you feel a whole lot different and we didn't do that
coming out in the first half. I think we had a couple open looks that we
didn't knock down that could have changed things very quickly two, wide open
3s to get it to 10 that we just didn't knock down whereas the other night we
hit it. We can analyze it, talk about it, but the shot goes down, it's a whole
different feeling, whole different mood.  
  
Q. You mentioned shots not falling; is Aaron getting the shots you wanted on
the plays you wanted?  
JAMIE DIXON: I thought for the most part, yes. I thought we had -- high-low
action, we ran the way we wanted to, and it wasn't just that -- our defense
wasn't as good as it needed to be as well. We gave up too much penetration,
gave up too many open shots and we're down on the boards, too, as well in the
first half.  
So, you know, you get beat like this, it's not just one thing.  
  
Q. Could you see Georgetown as a No. 1 seed? They obviously looked very good
this week here.  
JAMIE DIXON: Well, anybody I think that wins the BIG EAST Conference and BIG
EAST tournament should definitely be considered a No. 1 seed. Yeah, I think
there's no question, I don't think games -- I think anybody, that's always the
case and I think this team has proven it.  
You know, I mean, I think we're in the toughest Conference. They won the
league and they won the tournament and I think that's usually a good
indicator.  
  
Q. How are you feeling about this team going into the tournament versus the
other teams you've been a part of that got The Finals coming out of New
York?  
JAMIE DIXON: Well, I felt very good. I think we had two quality wins against
two very good teams and played well in a lot of areas and didn't carry it over
to tonight. I'm a guy that looks at the 27 wins and not the performance we had
tonight. I mean, you can't -- that's more of an indicator of your team.  
This, we got down, it just got bigger and it just seemed like we got away from
doing the things that we tried and wanted to do.  
  
Q. Just about your defense, are there nights when a team is just playing so
well and doing so many different things well that there's just not something
you're going to be able to do to stop it all?  
JAMIE DIXON: Well, I never want to have that attitude, so I don't think any
coach has that attitude, hopefully. I won't. There's always a way, you try to
find a way, and we couldn't find it tonight. I mean, again, it wasn't just the
defense. If we make some shots, it's a different game. It was a combination of
things, rebounding.  
Again, they are very good and they played very well. It's the third time we've
played together. We beat them the first time, they beat us the second time,
best of my knowledge good games. We thought we should have won that second
one, we were up with six minutes left, six points. So they got us tonight and
they beat us soundly.  
  
Q. Can you address your seeding? You beefed up your own Conference a little
bit this year.  
JAMIE DIXON: Yeah, I saw the RPI this morning across the ticker, they had us
four on the RPI. That's usually an indicator of where you're going to be. It
seems that's usually a pretty good indicator. I mean, there's all these
different things, but that seems to be the only objective tool to use. You can
say what you want, you can figure out what you want to use, but I think when
your RPI speaks to what you did over the 27 wins, best Conference in the
country and our schedule's amongst the toughest in the country, plus we played
more road games than other teams that had high strengths of schedules.  
So I think we are going to have a very high seed. I thought we could get a 2
if we won this one. I would say we are probably a 3 now.  
  
Q. You've done a pretty good job when you've been behind, was it harder --
inaudible?  
ANTONIO GRAVES: Not at all. We are going to definitely have to put this behind
us and look ahead. We have another tournament coming up which is the most
important tournament. It's what all the teams in the summer prepare for and in
the off-season prepare for. So we definitely have to look ahead. We have a
couple -- some games coming up that we have to take seriously, and you know,
use practice to get this out of our heads and look forward for the future.  
  
Q. Talk about your experiences in the BIG EAST tournament, this one, a tough
loss to take, but just what do you take to your senior season; talk about your
experiences in New York and how it's helped you through your career?  
ANTONIO GRAVES: It's helped me a lot to play in the BIG EAST, period. Madison
Square Garden is a great place to play the BIG EAST tournament. But I think
it's the game in the regular season that prepares us for Madison Square Garden
and the tournament ahead. It's basically been a good experience and we have to
just use our experience. A lot of our guys, even our sophomores and juniors
have experience. So we have to use that as a plus for us and an advantage.  
  
Q. Where are you feeling the most confident about this team going into March
Madness and what areas do you think need the most work going into the
tournament?  
ANTONIO GRAVES: I think we just need to stay focused on our principles as far
as like our defense and rebounding. If we can get that done, you know, a lot
of things will just come along with that.  
Basically we can't start the games off like we have been in the past. So we
have to you know, look for it again, a good start in the rest of the games.  
  
Q. Can you talk about being named to the all-tournament team?  
ANTONIO GRAVES: It's not -- I'm sorry, but it's not really that big of a deal
for me because I just want to win, I want our team to win. If we all got the
win, then, you know that, would be most important. But unfortunately we didn't
come up with the win, and individual award right now is not going to help the
team.  
You know, it's all about the team and we've got to look forward to the future.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2007

  

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
RICK PITINO: We sort of ran out of gas in the second half, and Pittsburgh made
big shots and it's a credit to their victory. It was a good tournament. We're
playing good basketball but we just ran out of a little gas. I don't know if
it was the double overtime last night or not but we executed really well the
first half. Our defense just wasn't crisp. We wanted to take away the 3-point
shot by them and try to get Gray in foul trouble and we did our job in the
first half, just did not do the job in the second half.  
  
Q. You just mentioned it, you shut down Pitt in the first half in terms of
3-point shooting. Four 3-pointers by Antonio, two consecutive to start off the
second half, you called a quick time-out, what are you telling your team in
that time-out?  
RICK PITINO: We certainly have to get over the high screens. The toughest job
with our basketball team is adhering to scouting. It's the toughest thing.
It's not the skill level. We have a very difficult time paying attention to
scouting because we've never had it before. When you say a young basketball
team, that's what it really is. They are physically talented enough to play,
even a guy like Derrick, bringing the ball down, this is a slap-down team and
all of the little things that scouting brings about, our players have a
difficult time with. That's where young teams fail is in little things and we
didn't do our job in the second half of getting over the screens and adhering
that, but hopefully we learned a lesson going into the tournament.  
  
Q. Seemed like turnovers -- not as good as they have been?  
RICK PITINO: Yeah, in the second half especially, when they went zone, we
didn't attack the zone as ferociously. You have to attack a zone. You can't
just passively throw it around the perimeter and play beat the clock.  
We did it to get back in the game, but we didn't do it when they went to it
when Gray went out of the game.  
  
Q. Speaking of the zone, is it unusual, I know Pitt did it a little last
game, but is it unusual to see them playing a zone defense and does it make
them tougher when they are switching defense because they usually don't do
that.  
RICK PITINO: I think it makes any team tougher because you have something else
you can go to. They did it a little last night so we expected it.  
Every zone has its weaknesses where you stay in it too long. The key to
playing zone defense is mixing it up, unless you have guys like Hakim Warrick
and guys like that who are extremely long on the wings, playing zone all the
time is difficult.  
Playing man all the time, if you get in foul trouble, you have to have
something else that you can go to defensively and they have something else
that they can go to right now.  
  
Q. Talking about not making it to the free throw line in the second half.  
RICK PITINO: They did a good job of shutting down the interior. They know
we're strong. You have to give credit to the defense. That's good scouting. We
had to go inside to outside. They took away the inside. You've got to give
them credit. With the exception of a few rushed shots -- you know, one of the
confusing things that happened the whole tournament, too many guys, they are
always used to that white line. Too many of the guys are playing the white
line rather than the blue line, and I think it's confusing, you see it with
all of the teams changing shots from the NBA 3 because they look at the line
rather than stepping to the blue line and we did that a few times as well.  
  
Q. You talked about you're a young team; now that you're heading into the
NCAA, are you concerned maybe about a little emotional hangover from losing
here?  
RICK PITINO: Well, we didn't think we were God's gift, so I don't know what
you're talking about. We are very happy with the season we're having. Without
Palacios, we're playing four freshman, we won six road games, we are very
happy. We were hoping to win a championship here but we didn't think it was an
obvious sweep. Maybe you know something about my team that I don't know. I
don't know what you're alluding to.  
  
Q. They haven't been through this whole process before --  
RICK PITINO: That remains to be seen. Why did we win six road games -- what we
have to do is adhere to the scouting report and adhere to the all of the
little things and when we do that -- that's a sign of youth. I think we're
going to be excited on Selection Sunday about being in the NCAA. A month ago,
nobody was making plans to go to the NCAA, so we are very excited.  
  
Q. What seed --  
RICK PITINO: Next question.  
If I knew that, I wouldn't be coaching, I really wouldn't be here. If I knew
-- ask Joel Lanardi. How would I know? Really, in all honestly, how would I
know what seed we are? I asked to be part of this committee and they refused
and would not allow me to be part of it. Being that, I'll wait until Selection
Sunday. Where do you think we'll be?  
  
Q. 6, 7.  
RICK PITINO: We're going to be 6, 7, guys. So write that down.  
  
Q. Sosa out, talk about the way he played?  
RICK PITINO: I didn't think he was playing too well. That's why I kept him
out.  
  
Q. What was he not doing?  
RICK PITINO: He was not making other people better.  
  
Q. I know that your focus is on your team, but when the opposing coach has a
situation where his big guy gets a quick third foul and then a quick fourth
foul and he leaves him in, how does that impact, if at all, any decisions you
make?  
RICK PITINO: Well, they did the smart thing, they put Kendall on our five-man
and put Gray on our four-man. We still want to go strong to the glass and take
it in.  
He's been getting in foul trouble a lot and has to be careful on offensive
rebounding to get inside position. I think they are getting used to playing
without him because they have been, and tonight, if you say you shut out
Fields and Gray and you lose, that's just our inability to execute. We didn't
do a lot of things defensively, we didn't force turnovers, we didn't get
deflections and create steals. When I see that, I see a tired basketball team
a little bit and I don't know if it's tired physically but more emotionally.
David wasn't on top of his game, Sosa was not on top of his game and sometimes
double overtime games do that to you.  
But that's no excuse. You have to give Pitt the credit for winning.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2007

  

### [Patrick Ewing](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17044)

### [Jeff Green](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15561)

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
JOHN THOMPSON III: Whew. That's my opening statement again. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Talk about Jeff's game, just an amazing game.  
JOHN THOMPSON III: There's no doubt about that. You know, much like the rest
of our guys, didn't want to lose, and the performance he put on was special
today. The performance Jeff Green put on today was special and just our team
in general hanging in there, everyone. Everyone sticking together when we
could have caved on several occasions from the beginning of the game midway
through the second half, and just we fought, we hung in there together. We
tried to figure a few things out together. And then at the end of the day,
great players make plays, and Jeff did that.  
  
Q. Can you just talk a little about what you guys did to their perimeter
game after the first half, because obviously they were getting a lot of looks
the first half, what do you do?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: They are terrific shooters. And if you give -- in this
league, if you give guys that can make shots an open look, it's going to go
in. In the first half, the whole first half, you know, we gave guys open
looks. Now they do a good job of getting in, they work hard, we moved the ball
but it's no surprise guys who can shoot collectively as well as their team
can, shots are going to go in. I think we just were a lot more tentative in
the second half to not letting them get shots or at least not open shots and
they still beat us going to the basket, which Tory almost did beat us going to
the basket. They got too many open looks in the first half and once we clamped
down on that, we were able to methodically claw our way back in the game.  
  
Q. Tory Jackson single handedly brought Notre Dame back down from 7. Is a
lead really safe against a team like Notre Dame and how are you able to bounce
back from giving up the lead?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: You're laughing because we talked about that? Before the
game, we said that, if we get up, no matter how big or how small, it's never
safe against them because of their offensive ability, because they have so
many -- and they are a veteran team. Obviously Tory, but they are a veteran
team and they have guys that can play and want to win. They are so good
offensively, and they can score 3s in bunches that they are never out of the
game.  
  
Q. Is it hard to keep your team sort of patient when a team is scoring in
bunches and a lot of 3s; you were so methodical and never seemed to panic and
you just chipped away?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: That's what we wanted to do. We talked a lot during the
course of the year, when we get down or when -- even when we're not down, when
the flow of the game changes, that, you know, we can't come down and make a
10-point play.  
And so we've talked about it and our guys understand that no matter what the
situation; whether we're up or whether we're down, we have to methodically get
a stop, methodically get a good shot, methodically get a good stop and
methodically get a good shop.  
I thought our guys were composed, we were at halftime down 2, 3, 4, 2, and so
we know we have to do it.  
  
Q. You used Patrick Ewing for a lot of minutes and you got a lot of
production. What did you see in the matchup and the strategy that told you to
use him the way you did?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: (Laughing) I'm not sure, it just felt right. I mean, that's
the truth. It just felt right. He was effective out there I thought at both
ends of the floor.  
I don't want to make it -- I can make up an answer to make me sound really
cerebral up here, but we were playing well when he was in there, so we kept
him in there.  
  
Q. Along the same lines, maybe just -- they kind of forced you, didn't they,
to do that, given the tempo of the game, and Roy's not going to be in a
90-point game?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: What was the final score? It was close.  
Roy can -- I disagree that in that Roy can be in a 90-point game. I just
didn't think he was as effective tonight with the lineups as when Patrick was
out there. I think Patrick was really focused and playing well. It wasn't
necessarily Roy can be in this type of game and not be in that type of game
and Pat can be in this type of game and not in that type of game and right on
down the line. It's just the group we had out there was extremely he
effective.  
  
Q. But guys haven't played like that --  
JOHN THOMPSON III: I've said all year that we can play any style. I think that
we -- I think that we have the understanding as well as the personnel so that
we can adjust what we're doing. We can adjust what we're doing.  
  
Q. Patrick, playing with your dad sitting in the front row in an arena he's
had so much success in, how did it feel out there, the big smile on your face,
how did you feel out there?  
PATRICK EWING: It was a good feeling. You know, it's a better feeling now that
we won, but it was just like another game. You know, he's been to a lot of
games this year, so it really wasn't much different than any other game.  
  
Q. How rewarding is it for you and for this ballclub getting to the BIG EAST
Finals? You guys haven't been there in a long time.  
JOHN THOMPSON III: In many ways, I mean, it's extremely rewarding. I mean,
that's what everyone in the league wants to be playing -- is the game tomorrow
night or tomorrow afternoon? Tomorrow night, that's the goal. And we are one
of the two teams that will be.  
You know, it is extremely rewarding to have the opportunity to play for the
tournament championship. That's something that's special, something that so
few people, so few people get the opportunity to do is to walk out on that
floor tomorrow night and get a chance to play for the tournament championship.
It's extremely special.  
  
Q. Jeff, talk about the game-winning shot.  
JEFF GREEN: Well, my team just found me down low, they wasn't making it hard
to throw it down. Pat just threw it down and I went into my move and they
fouled me and I got the lucky roll. I just put it up there and tried to get it
on the rim and it went in, it was a lucky shot.  
  
Q. Do you plan on watching this second game and what do you think about both
teams?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: No, I'm not going to watch, show up tomorrow -- (laughter).  
Of course we're going to watch the game, you know, watch it live and then
break it down probably two or three times before sunrise.  
You know, both teams are very, very good teams, there's no doubt about that.
Louisville is playing at an extremely high level right now, and Pittsburgh, I
said all along, is one of the better teams in the country and have been all
year. They both have answers. They both have answers for things that you can
throw at them. They both have answers and they can give you different looks.  
And so you know, they are experienced, and they have terrific coaches. In many
ways, on any given night, I can say that about every team in this league, but
those two teams are very good and they are playing very well right now.  
  
Q. Your Princeton teams and your Georgetown teams are all teams that have
improved on an upswing from October 1 to March; is there anything in
particular that you attribute that to?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: I think it just takes time for teams -- and every team is
different. You know, every team is different, just as a coach, as a team, it
takes the preseason, it takes time for us to figure out the best way for us to
skin the cat and the best way for us to play and the best way for us to win.  
And so I've been fortunate that my teams have improved as this year and most
other years, our team gets better as the year goes on. It's just us
collectively figuring out what's going to work out for us in that particular
year.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
JAMIE DIXON: Well, I was very excited about the win and happy for our guys and
happy for the way we responded especially in the second half. Obviously being
in an 11-point deficit, shows the character of our guys, especially the two
guys here, impressed. I'm proud of Antonio and Mike, especially Antonio for
knocking down and playing so well the last two days. Proud of him, he's
practiced hard and worked hard and is going to the gym late at night the last
couple of weeks. And hard work pays off. And Mark is rebounding like we've
been bugging him all year, so I'm proud of them for really stepping up. Thank
you.  
  
Q. Did you guys do anything different offensively in the first half to the
second half?  
JAMIE DIXON: You know, I think -- it was a close game. Obviously it looked a
little worse than it was because they got the 8 points at the end there. It
was a three-point game and we were actually ahead most of the first half and
it turned so quickly in that last minute, minute and a half.  
I thought our patience, we ran more set plays against the zone in the second
half which may have had something to do with it. But you know, I think we're a
little bit more patient. We had Aaron in there, as well. But you know I think
we just ran into a little stretch late in the first half where things didn't
go well -- actually Aaron was in there at that point, too, where they got
those two 3s at the end. So patience was good. And the passing, as always was
good. We had 17 assists and 16 turnovers, so you know, you can't fault that.  
  
Q. Antonio, did you feel like you were ready to break out of your slump when
you came here to New York, and what was the difference tonight?  
ANTONIO GRAVES: First of all, I'd just like to thank God, my coach definitely,
and my teammates for believing in me. They have been a big help for me during
the six or seven games where I wasn't shooting as well.  
But it was just basically, you know, like I said, my teammates just believing
in me, my coach believing in me, and I was getting in extra shots before and
after practice. You know, I was just waiting for my opportunity, trying to
stay patient.  
Our offense is great. We've got a lot of guys that can help me get open looks
which we are seeing now until the tournament. You know, all of our guys are
stepping up big right now, and I still feel I could do better things just
besides scoring. I feel I can get more rebounds and help out on the boards
more and get in and take more charges like Coach wants us to do and make other
plays that make a difference in the game.  
I'd definitely like to give a lot of credit to God, my coach and my teammates.  
  
Q. Games are often won and lost at the free throw line, you guys got to the
lane 31 times, Louisville only got there four times; how key was that to
winning this ballgame?  
JAMIE DIXON: Well, I mean, obviously that's a goal of ours always. I did look
at theirs and I was interested in their stats. I looked before the game and
saw that they were pretty much even as far as free throw attempts compared to
their opponents so that was an interesting stat. Usually teams with us, we
like to get to the free throw line a lot more than our opponents and usually a
lot of teams do. That's a goal of ours. We went inside, a lot of it probably
had to do with the zone, as well that we played and we were fortunate that the
second half, they didn't really hit some shots. I think they had some good
looks at times that they probably feel that normally they can make. Obviously
that was a big part of it.  
Again, we're going inside and I thought we were really attacking the basket
throughout the game and I think that often time -- we got a lot of good
penetration out of it. We thought at times that our zone, going into the game,
may give them -- may keep them from getting to the free throw line, not a lot
of penetration, not getting a lot of touches and getting fouls on Aaron early,
that had something to do with it.  
  
Q. When you get a prominent player like Aaron in foul trouble, how much of
it is gut and figuring whether to put him in or take him out?  
JAMIE DIXON: We've always gone with a rule of two fouls and staying out. But
I've kind of gone away from that a little bit more from that lately with Aaron
being a veteran and just going with it.  
But as the game was going on, we kept him out in the first half and then it
was close and put him in there the last couple of minutes and that's kind of
when the lead went a little bit, got away from us.  
You know, it's interesting how it works out, how we -- but I thought if we
stayed close, we would be in good shape with it, and so, you know, it's a
feel. I guess it worked out the way we did it even though you probably don't
want to be down 11 at halftime.  
  
Q. You got hammered -- inaudible -- the bench. How important is that
tomorrow and for the tournament to keep him out of foul trouble?  
JAMIE DIXON: We are usually a good rebounding team and that's pretty much what
we talked about at halftime, most enthusiastically at halftime.  
But you know, I mean, obviously Aaron's a big part -- if you told me he was
going to get zero rebounds and we were going to win, I think a lot of people
might have been surprised. We'll probably do some rebounding drills with him
tonight and get him out there.  
You know, it's just one of those days. The foul trouble obviously affected him
and that's just how you have to play. But second half was even off the boards.
We were down 13 at half so I guess we out-rebounded by one in the second half,
so that was a big part of it, big key.  
  
Q. Antonio, with the big man in foul trouble, did you feel pressure to step
it up and maybe do a little bit more, and how did you feel about it?  
ANTONIO GRAVES: Absolutely not. I don't think I felt pressure. I think we got
a lot of guys that are willing to, you know, step up at any given moment.  
We just knew, the halftime speech, we knew we had to be more assertive and
definitely had to get the rebounds and our defense is what helped us change
the game around. You know, the two-three zone helped us cause a lot of
turnovers and we got a lot of fast break points and our set plays opened up
their two-three so that helped a lot.  
It was open and I was fortunate to knock down shots?  
  
Q. For both players, this makes six trips to the title game in seven years,
is there a feeling for the people in the Pitt program that playing Saturday
night for the title is like a right of yours now?  
ANTONIO GRAVES: Yeah, I've been here for I think three of them. I've been here
for three of them. You know, this is like a second home for us. We treat it
that way. The crowd is behind us. I think we've got more fans here than we
ever have lately. I definitely believe that, you know, Madison Square Garden,
the BIG EAST tournament, is destined for us and we've been able to take
advantage of treating it as our home court?  
  
Q. What do you think, Mike?  
MIKE COOK: You know, this is my first one, so you know, I'm just real excited
about coming out here and competing in the BIG EAST championship.  
I mean, we've got the home crowd behind us. Like you said, we've been here six
out of seven years. We always expect to win and expecting to forward in this
tournament. I guess this is the feeling that we have and the feeling our
program has. It's a great feeling to be here and be here for the first time
for me.  
  
Q. In the past your guys have almost not wanted to play zone because they
take so much pride in their man-to-man defense, why in this tournament you're
switching a lot and it seems to be working well?  
JAMIE DIXON: You know what, we've worked on it, we've talked all year long
about how we were going to play zone and we've worked on it every single day
and it's not a surprise to our guys. I think it's something that as coaches we
kind of expect it. I thought it was going to happen. So it's something that
we've kind of -- I think our players have been waiting for us to use it more
to be honest. I think there's been that feeling, we've continued to talk about
it and at times they are probably saying, yeah, yeah, you're just talking
about, we're going to be using the zone.  
Foul trouble had something to do with it, too, that had a big part of it, too,
as well. You know, we play a lot of man, too, as well, and at the end of the
game, it was the man-to-man defense that got the stops, the key stops when it
was a one-point game.  
So again, that was a big part of it.  
  
Q. You seemed to handle the full-court pressure pretty well tonight, that's
something that they troubled you a lot with in the regular season matchup; how
did you improve upon that?  
JAMIE DIXON: Levance, looking at the stats here, had six rebounds, seven
assists, no turnovers. He was as good as you can be as far as running the
team, and three steals as well.  
You know we went back and watched the film a lot, as bad as we played in that
game, we were surprised -- not surprised but we didn't turn it over that much
against the press. It was not the turnovers against the press, it was just the
halfcourt. We threw balls through the legs, we made plays you could not
imagine in that game. That game was far back in our memory, a long time ago,
similar to the Marquette. It was about today, not yesterday, and our practices
the last three days before coming in, that was what we were focused on. I
think we did a little bit of adjustment as far as having our three man and a
different guy take it out, but again, it wasn't quite the -- our bad play
wasn't as much by that press that they did the first time. Again, that's what
they do every day, every game. That was nothing unexpected at all by that. I
think there was maybe a bit of overplay to that by some. If you went back and
looked at it, and really examined it, you probably would have seen that, or as
coaches as we went back and watched it.  
  
Q. For both players, I think Aaron picked up his third foul within two
minutes of the second half and you guys just started getting it going; did you
think for that one second, what's he going to do? Is he going to pull him, is
he not going to pull him, and when he didn't pull him, what was your
reaction?  
MIKE COOK: I mean, we have a great team. We have nine players that can play
basketball. So whether Coach pulled him or not, that was the coach's decision.
If he did pull him, we had to pick up the slack and grab rebounds and get some
points in the lane. Since he didn't pull him, we had a 7-footer out there,
great 7-footer out there that can contribute to our team. We just look to give
him the ball while he was out there. Didn't know how long he was going to be
out there, didn't know how long it would be until he got his 4th foul.  
Aaron is a great passer and great scorer.  
ANTONIO GRAVES: I honestly think that one of the game-changing performances
because I think the other team expected him to go out, you know, expecting to
get more rebounds. He's a great presence for our team in the post and down
making rebounds. He was very effective, and I think that him staying out there
just showed how much we wanted it.  
  
Q. In the past two games you avenged losses to teams that had beaten you
earlier and you lost to Georgetown and that cost you the BIG EAST regular
season crown. How important has it been to build off those losses and going
into tomorrow facing Georgetown, what chance to avenging that one, too?  
JAMIE DIXON: We've had a great year, and I don't think it was too much of a
focus of ours. Nobody goes undefeated and again it was about the three
practices this week and what we focused on and where we were.  
During those, Aaron had not played, he had not practiced all week going into
the Georgetown game, same with the Marquette game, he didn't practice the
whole week and we had guys out. It's just different times.  
But I thought we had three great practices, we had a great practice on the
Monday after, and you just knew we were coming and we had everybody out there
and again, when you've got everybody out there, I think we got back into a
rhythm and I think we're seeing that with our passing and our shooting here in
these games here. 17 assists, six turnovers against a team that's pressing for
40 minutes kind of speaks volumes.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the, matchup with Georgetown?  
JAMIE DIXON: Yeah, familiar with them and we've played them twice. We had two
great games. We beat them at our place and they beat us at their place.
Haven't really thought about it. We go one game at a time here. I'll have film
to watch as soon as I get back to the thing. I know our guys are excited but
we'll be ready to go.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2007

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Colin Falls](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13735)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
MIKE BREY: Everybody get their money's worth? That was a great college
basketball game, and I'm very proud of my team. I am so excited about going
into next week with this group. We're very disappointed now because we had a
chance, and I thought we gave ourselves every chance to win the basketball
game.  
But our heads will be up by tomorrow morning and we'll be excited about
playing again, because we're getting better and I think playing really well at
the right time. Because Georgetown is really, really good. Really, they are
really good.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Tory's play?  
MIKE BREY: You know, we were riding him there and he's a fearless young man.
There's a toughness factor that he's brought to our basketball team.  
But you know, I think it says a lot about our group because I think we were
down seven at that point against maybe a 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament and
came out and gave ourselves a chance again. And certainly we rode Tory and our
guys understood to open the floor up and let him go. He made some great plays.  
But I don't think we're surprised. I mean, that's who he's been.  
  
Q. Did you learn a little something about your team being down 7 in this
atmosphere and all of the sudden lightning strikes?  
MIKE BREY: I told our guys, we've gotten better because we haven't played this
well in two games at a neutral site and that's what we played in Thursday and
Friday. So we are taking some good stuff from here, playing fearlessly and
being poised. First yesterday, punched down 9 and then tonight down 7, I think
that's all stuff we can build on going into the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Last two games you played terrific, did you -- on the eve of your BIG
EAST season, you lose your point guard, did you have any expectation that
things would come together as quickly as they have?  
MIKE BREY: I'll say this: I was probably worried, but the team wasn't, and
that's what really counts.  
I think this group felt -- and they kind of pulled me along and got me
confident with our win with Louisville and how we got started.  
You know, watching us through January and the confidence growth of Tory and
how these two seniors helped him get confident, you know, I thought we had a
chance to be very, very good.  
  
Q. You talked about Georgetown and their seed and how good they are. Do you
hope that the committee looks at you guys and say, hey, look what we just did,
look how we competed?  
MIKE BREY: That's a great question. I would think, you know, this is -- it's
not a win, but it's a pretty good -- you know, this is a pretty good display
of who we are. And I think our profile is very strong for Sunday evening.  
  
Q. Tory's outburst in the second half, was that an adjustment by you or
Tory; was it just you feeling it out there?  
MIKE BREY: Well, we had some sets where we just wanted to open the floor and
let him go a little bit, and once he got the first one and it was looking
pretty good, you know, we rode it.  
And that's who we've been. Our basketball IQ is pretty high where we get it to
guys who are on a roll and we are able to take advantage of it. We rode it
until they made some changes and switched some match-ups.  
  
Q. Talk about the game tonight.  
COLIN FALLS: They got up into us and they have length and we did a lot better
than the first time. I think we came out and competed and didn't let that
bother us that much.  
  
Q. The work on the boards tonight when the whole offense and defense was
great, how important is that going into the tournament?  
MIKE BREY: I was very concerned about that against these guys and to look at
the final numbers, that's for us to really build on and I don't know if
there's anybody out there that climbs the glass like these guys. So that's
certainly something to build on.  
As far as his shot, I told the team in there, we would take that shot in every
NCAA Tournament game we play to win the rest of the way. I mean, he got a shot
fake, Tory did a great job of exchanging, we got a clean look for a guy who is
shooting a good percentage. If that comes up Thursday or Friday, I will --
we'll take it and I'll live with the results. I have a feeling it's going to
go in.  
  
Q. Talk a little about the tenacity of Carter, Jackson out there, no fear
against a big man like Hibbert and just crashing the boards like that?  
MIKE BREY: Both of them really got on the back board for us and that helps us.
They are fearless guys. They are tough, they have got great hands, they are
hard-nosed guys. And they were playing -- I thought they were playing like
champions tonight. Just they were going for it.  
I told them, I said, "I don't know what seed we are, I don't know where we're
going to go, I just want us to play the same way, just come out and really go
for it on Thursday or Friday."

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [Will Sheridan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13761)

### [Curtis Sumpter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16947)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
JAY WRIGHT: Well, your season's got to end sometime, and you hate for it to --
you hate for it to happen anyway. But I think we just ran into an outstanding
team. I think Georgetown is playing as well as any team in the country, and
when we played them last time at home, they were just starting, we could see
it and they have just continued to get better.  
I'm proud of our seniors, especially these two and Mike Nardi have carried a
great group of young guys and hope we can keep playing.  
  
Q. What do you tell a team when you're down, and as a coach what do you hope
to see for the rest of that game?  
JAY WRIGHT: Well, we've all been in it long enough that you know anything can
happen. You just try to tell them, it's a long game, there's a lot of time
left. They went on a big run. We can go on a big run and we've got to just
keep -- keep playing our game. You know, you try to, you don't try to make it
any big deal. You just try to make it like there's a lot of possessions left
and we've got to have a lot of good possessions in this game.  
You know, I thought our guys did a good job of that. We didn't lose our
composure. Maybe we were a little too composed to start. We didn't lose our
composure to start. We kept battling and I thought we did it in a pretty
organized way with some good basketball. But they were just too good to get a
lead like that.  
  
Q. Did you see what you hoped to see considering the circumstance, at least
in the way the final 26 minutes played out? Did you at least see what you
wanted to see?  
JAY WRIGHT: I saw what I expected to see. I expect our teams to play for 40
minutes, whether we are up 20 or down 20, and to play together and with some
pride. That's why I'm proud of them. I'm proud of these guys.  
  
Q. Have you seen another D with the kind of length and athleticism in close
to the basket; how difficult do they make it?  
JAY WRIGHT: I think that is their greatest strength when you talk about their
physical makeup is their length and athleticism. And then around the basket,
they make it very difficult, but as you see, Scottie Reynolds shot 4 for 14.
They were switching Roy and switching Green on to him and those guys are well
coached enough and disciplined enough that they keep enough space from smaller
players that they can use their length. Sometimes if you play longer athletic
guards that are not as disciplined they will jump in and you can go by them
and we couldn't. I think that's a credit to John and his coaching.  
  
Q. When you get in a stretch like you were in at the beginning of the game
where it's almost like a bad dream and you can't wake up from it, what's going
through your mind in terms of what button can I push, what can I try, how is
this going to end?  
JAY WRIGHT: Well, when you have guys like Curtis and Scottie who are great
scorers, just find something to get them going because you know once they get
going, they are the leaders and something good will happen. So just trying to
push a button, run a play, do something and get one of those guys going, you
know they are the guys that have the confidence to get you out of it.  
Sometimes when you have younger guys, you need a guy like Curtis to step up
and Curtis actually scored the first couple baskets but we still struggled.
But you described it pretty much like it is, how is this going to end; we've
got to end it.  
  
Q. Did the two blocks set the tone that in the back of your mind said, we
have a game on our hands?  
JAY WRIGHT: I think if I had a big guy like that or a couple big guys like
that, that's what I would want them to do in the beginning of the game, set
the tone, you're not coming to the basket.  
We tried to keep coming and that's what we wanted to do. They did a good job,
they blocked a couple and we wanted to keep coming at them. Dante got some
great looks inside early, shots he normally makes. Sometimes you have to shoot
them up and sleep in the streets. Some nights you've got to keep shooting and
sleep in the streets. That's what we have to do tonight is we're going to
sleep in the streets.  
  
Q. What do you take in this game looking forward to next week, good and bad
I guess?  
CURTIS SUMPTER: I would say just setting the tone at the beginning of the
game, try not to get down so early. Just basically those things. Just keep
being aggressive. I don't think we did anything wrong at the start of the game
or throughout the game really. We just had a couple of bad possessions and
Georgetown just took advantage of them.  
  
Q. Talk about the young leadership you had out there and the senior
leadership you had out there, and then the second question, tale of two years,
you and UCONN were on top of the BIG EAST last year and both teams this year,
UCONN out first round and then you guys out this round here. Talk about the
depth of the BIG EAST and how great of a conference it is.  
JAY WRIGHT: Reynolds for a freshman plays with a lot of poise and composure
and he's done a great job for his first two games in the BIG EAST tournament,
very proud of him.  
But you need to have upperclassmen to advance in it tournament. And we're very
fortunate to have these two in bump and Curt. I've never experienced before
what it's like to have ten freshman and sophomores and three seniors, to try
to control all of them and teach them. It was an amazing job by these guys. I
told them at the beginning of the year, you have every excuse to say, hey,
it's my senior year, I'm stuck with ten freshmen and sophomores that have not
played; or you can really step up as leaders, almost like parents and say, I
brought this group along, I am proud of what they did this year and probably
what they do in the future is going to be based on what these two and Mike
have taught them.  
The conference, hey, it's just never a surprise to me. We've gotten beat by
West Virginia in here playing great basketball, Pittsburgh was playing great,
Georgetown. The thing about it is when teams beat us in this tournament, they
are great teams. It wasn't like we didn't come to play or the other team got
by in a sloppy game. If you get beat here, usually you get beat by a great
team and we have the last three years.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you've eliminated any chance -- inaudible?  
JAY WRIGHT: I hope so. I hope so. I really didn't -- I honestly didn't think
about that and I haven't thought about it; you made me --  
  
Q. Sorry.  
JAY WRIGHT: Again we're going to sit back now and look at all of this stuff.
I'm not great at knowing where everybody is in this. I hear what everybody
says. So I'm going to start to learn about it now. I've got a couple of days
to do that, where we stand.  
  
Q. Did you feel a momentum killer in the second half, did you feel a point
when the momentum was changing, that something stalled that; did you feel a
stall at any point?  
JAY WRIGHT: No, I really didn't feel a stall, but I did feel that we had that
one chance, we had that big chance where we got the steal in the press and
Scottie got the open three. That one would have blown the roof off this place
and would energized our guys.  
I think that one would have got it to three maybe, I think it was. That was
the play. Not that we quit, but that was our chance right there. He got an
open one, great defensive play. We could have had a one-possession game.  
But, you know, when you put yourself in that position, you only have a few
chances, and that was our shot.  
  
Q. Knowing that you've got another game to play, how important was it to let
the young guys know that we can't just get rolled by Georgetown, we have to
come and play the rest of this game to carry into the next game you're going
to play?  
WILL SHERIDAN: I think that we as leaders, myself and Curt and Mike try to
instill in them it's a great tradition to play hard and never quit and never
give up. I think they understand that and they definitely bought in. We came
out and played as hard as we could in the second half. We had our pride at
stake.  
  
Q. You obviously hope to be an NCAA bid, but would it excite you to come
back here in three weeks for NIT?  
JAY WRIGHT: I would definitely be excited to come back here and I would be
excited to practice more with this team. I said this before, we are going to
go back and practice. I think this group can start getting better. Curtis is
just starting to come around and Reynolds and Redding, we want to keep
practicing and playing as long as we can with this group. Nothing against the
NIT or Madison Square Garden, we'll be happy as hell as long as we're playing.
I would like to go to the NCAA Tournament, I think the team deserves it but I
understand that there are other teams that do and we'll have to wait and see
what the committee says.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [David Padgett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17012)

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

### [Terrence Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17013)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
RICK PITINO: For some reason we always have great games with West Virginia. I
don't know what it is. Overtime to go to the Final Four, and last year at West
Virginia came down to a real close ballgame. They are very difficult to play
against, and our guys did a great job of concentrating tonight defensively. We
hit a drought offensively. We were just missing shots that would normally go
in for some of our people and they didn't and that's a credit to their
defense.  
What I told the guys in the first overtime and second overtime, this is a
dream, guys, you get to play overtime in Madison Square Garden and we all
heard the speech that David Padgett gave the other night to play in Madison
Square Garden. Listen, have fun, you'll always remember a double overtime game
in Madison Square Garden and if you win, you'll really remember it. So they
dug down and we had to play a lot of guys minutes tonight that we would have
liked to have substituted before. Their system is so difficult to defend, we
had to go with some key players.  
  
Q. What did you draw off the end of regulation, did you expect them to go
all the way?  
RICK PITINO: Well, normally we want to make one pass but there wasn't enough
time. You know, everybody's afraid to foul, and Sosa did a great job of
getting us to the rim. I had to beg him to pass the ball a hundred times. He
wants the ball. He's a very confident young man and made a great play, just a
fabulous play.  
  
Q. You brought up the scoring drought you went through, they go on an 18-0
run to go up by one point and then you go up by one, what are you telling your
team right there?  
RICK PITINO: Well, I think the road made us a tough basketball team. We won
six games in the BIG EAST on the road this year, so we don't get down.  
We have droughts from time to time, but we don't get down about it. We just
hang in there. We told them, they have had runs against everybody to come back
in a game, be it Providence, be it Pittsburgh, be it UCLA. They have runs
against everyone. So we just don't get down about it. We respect our opponent.
Just hang in there and the guys did. They had a lot down the stretch.  
  
Q. What were your thoughts on the second overtime?  
RICK PITINO: I just think that our guys are risk-takers, not that they
weren't. We weren't afraid to fail. We took big shots, Padgett took a big one.
Guys were very much at ease and had no fear of failure.  
  
Q. Dave, when they made their run to take that one-point lead, how big was
your hoop to get the lead back?  
DAVID PADGETT: Yeah, we've been in a lot of games kind of like this,
especially with West Virginia. Like coach said, I think playing on the road
was really good for us this year because we've played in tough situations
before. We just knew, we kept trading baskets, we knew we had to get a couple
of stops. As long as we kept being aggressive on offense and being as active
as we could on defense, we knew we would be right in the game. It was back and
forth but we made some big shots down the stretch?  
  
Q. David, talk about the atmosphere that's been around Louisville
basketball, you come into this tournament as the two seed, talk about all of
the excitement that's been going around.  
DAVID PADGETT: Yeah, feels kind of like how it did two years ago when we went
to the Final 4. Knock-on-wood, we're playing really well right now. Everybody
is giving us tremendous support and the fans -- we had a lot of fans there
tonight and it's great to see that. You know, we're just playing well right
now and it's just a great time of year. It's the best time of year, tournament
time. So we're just going to try to keep it going as long as we can.  
  
Q. How much confidence is it playing in these close games the last few weeks
did that give you tonight and did it help you relax out there?  
TERRENCE WILLIAMS: It was kind of easy because we've been in this situation
before, going on the road to market and UCONN and south Florida. Every
situation you face, you're going to be in that situation already.  
It was just Coach telling us to be calm, we've been in this situation before
and be confident in your shots. Playing those six games that we won on the
road, it helped us tonight because it got to the time where you can't be
nervous out there. You have to play basketball.  
  
Q. Can you comment on how your game has developed, you had that big
deflection late in overtime, just doing the little things and not getting
frustrated?  
TERRENCE WILLIAMS: I give credit to Coach P. The main thing; you don't want to
not do the little thing and then when you watch film, you get yelled at. So
the big thing is to do all the little things. So I knew on reversal if I drive
to the middle, center has to help so D.P. would be right open which he was.
And then the ref sees the ball so I just try to hit the ball. It's just little
things and I don't want it get yelled at in the film room --  
RICK PITINO: I don't yell anymore. If you want me to yell, go back to my
Providence days, that was yelling.  
TERRENCE WILLIAMS: Main thing is you want to win the game, so the main thing
is you do any little thing you can do to win the game.  
  
Q. Can you comment on Clark's performance?  
RICK PITINO: Yeah, I didn't think I could play Earl and Derrick together. Very
tough to play freshmen against West Virginia because you have to stop the 3,
you have to stop their back doors and you have to change your defenses.  
We kept just changing on makes and misses. If you let West Virginia get
comfortable on anything they will pick you apart. Earl had to be the link
right now that we would go in. We don't have Palacios, so we go with him. He's
improved dramatically as the season has gone along.  
These two young men are iron men. They play a lot of minutes. David, I didn't
want to play him that many minutes, but I needed somebody who really has a
doctorate in basketball, and he does, with the exception of that underneath-
the-knee bounce play.  
DAVID PADGETT: A couple more than that. (Laughing).  
RICK PITINO: So I needed his mind out there and they are very smart. Both of
these guys really understand the game of basketball, and they coach Earl
throughout the course of a game but this was very difficult for Earl and he
came through with shining colors.  
  
Q. The toughness to want to take that shot at the end of regulation, was
that something that Edgar has, you either have it or you don't?  
RICK PITINO: He epitomizes what you've heard for the last 30 years with about
a New York City point guard. People say he's a New York City point guard.
Well, what does that mean? A New York city point guard means he has no fear of
anything, he's going to play with a lot of emotion and a lot of passion and
more than anything else what I think it means is he's faced the best
competition, whether it's on the playground or AAU or at his high school. He
played at Rice High School under the worst conditions sometimes and they had
to go in and he played for a great high school coach. He's been through it
all. He's very big at those moments and wants those moments.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [Jeff Green](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15561)

### [Roy Hibbert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13731)

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
JOHN THOMPSON: Whew. That's my opening statement.  
  
Q. It seems like the ninth-rated seed -- you have a big bulls-eye on your
back; is this part of the deal -- inaudible.  
JOHN THOMPSON: To describe the opportunity to play in the BIG EAST tournament,
and even to utter it as a needless obligation, someone needs to reach over and
smack you. (Laughter) I mean, this is a --  
  
Q. The upside versus the downside.  
JOHN THOMPSON: First things first. You know, you talk about, what seed were
they, ninth seed? It doesn't matter. This league is so good, the players, the
coaches, the programs, and that's going to be applicable going over to the
following tournament. You're playing against a very good team that's very well
coached. I think a lot of people in the media and a lot of fans start looking
at rankings and determine -- or ratings and seedings is the word I'm looking
for -- and say, well, this team should win. It doesn't matter.  
We have had three really good games against them this year. Our teams are
evenly-matched. We ended up as a 1 and they ended up as a 9. That's going to
be true all day today and tomorrow. The teams are going to be very good.  
We had to get rid of -- we came out early and scored so easily. You know, we
scored so easily and then we settled in and then they picked it up. I think it
got to a point where we got too tentative. We got too tentative and started
looking at the clock and trying to get the game over instead of playing. And
all of the sudden, they are too good, they are too good to do that and we need
to stay more in attack mode.  
  
Q. Did the Syracuse game last year here flash back in your mind?  
JOHN THOMPSON: I wish I could lie to you and say no, but, yes, it did. Yes, it
did. I'm glad our guys held on. Glad we held on. Glad that didn't happen.  
  
Q. How hard is it to shut it down emotionally when you get up so big?  
JOHN THOMPSON: I don't know whether I would say "shut it down" but it was
coming to easily. It was coming too easily. We just had to refocus.  
I think this group knows and understands and enjoys playing on this stage. And
so you know, we just refocused.  
And that's a good team. It's not like you're playing against a team where you
can just show up and win. We jumped up. We had a very good run to start. You
know, they make a run, they come back and at the start of the second half, we
got a couple of good looks and the ball didn't go in and we bang some shots
and they get some momentum. You're not going to just run away from anyone.
Teams are just too good, too well coached.  
  
Q. How stressful did it get in the last several minute and are you surprised
it got to that point after the start?  
JOHN THOMPSON: I wasn't thinking about the finish. We were just thinking about
the next possession. Every game is stressful and every minute of every game is
stressful for me.  
You know, but at the end of the day, our guys made plays. Our guys made plays
and we held on. That's what good players do and what good teams do.  
  
Q. What were you telling your team at the beginning of the second half when
things started to slow a little bit, what were you telling your team?  
JOHN THOMPSON: Just keep doing what we're doing, keep moving hard, keep
cutting hard, keep talking to each other.  
I didn't feel like tactically, you know, maybe with the exception of a few
things in the press offs, but tactically it wasn't there but I thought we
started to get stagnant. It was almost more so, they were not playing well at
the beginning and then they started to play normal basketball, if that makes
sense. I don't know whether that came out right. So they started to do the
things and have success at the things that they have all year.  
  
Q. Defensively did you guys do something different this first half, as
opposed to games past?  
JOHN THOMPSON: I think we -- no. Did we?  
JEFF GREEN: No, I don't think so.  
JOHN THOMPSON: I think we were fortunate, they missed a few shots. I think our
energy level was pretty good. What we did differently, we did a very good job
of rebounding early in the game and when they did give misses, limiting them
to one shot. But it wasn't a huge, you know, adjustment change tactically. I
think we were just a little better at it and they were a little off to start.  
  
Q. Roy, you had difficulty getting touches in the first two meetings against
Villanova, what was the difference today?  
ROY HIBBERT: Just posting up strong and making sure we run our offense. If you
can get the ball down to me down low, we've got other things and other shots.  
  
Q. Roy, you really felt comfortable down there, two big free throws towards
the end when they cut it to about 10 points and then also the emphatic slam at
the end; talk about the emotions of this game and how important it was to be
the No. 1 seed?  
ROY HIBBERT: Before the Game 1 of our season we said we owe them one, they
beat us on our home court. We had to come out strong and aggressive and all of
our shots were falling in the first half and we had to make sure we kept
rebounding and running our offense and keep communicating on defense.  
  
Q. With all the damage that Sumpter and Sheridan have done, how important
was it to control them?  
JOHN THOMPSON: You can't control them. They put them in too many -- well,
Scottie only had 11 points. They are too good, they are too aggressive, they
are too talented and their teammates understand that and do a good job of
helping them. And so you know, we don't go into it saying, "hey, we're going
to control these two." I think they are too good. In many ways you want to
hope that the other guys don't go off or step outside the box they are used to
being in because those two are two talented offensive players, and you can't
really stop them.  
  
Q. For Jeff, in the second half, could you tell that maybe you were getting
tentative and how do you snap off that as players?  
JEFF GREEN: We just have to keep running our offense, keep being precise with
what we had to do on offense and not allow them to get second shots. We did a
pretty good job of that, not letting them get second-chance points and just
keep giving Roy touches down low, we just had to keep doing that.  
  
Q. How much better are you guys offensively and defensively doing the things
you set out to do this season than you were a month ago?  
JOHN THOMPSON: A month ago, I'm not sure. We're light years better than we
were at the beginning of the season, light years, and you can probably say the
same thing about Villanova; you can probably say the same thing about most
teams that are here in this tournament.  
But you know, we started off the year, and we had a long way to go. As the
year has progressed, I said to these guys and to you guys that wanted to
listen, we wanted to be the most improved team by the end of the year and
everything else should take care of itself. That's how we've gone about our
business; let's get better, let's improve, let's see what areas -- I've said
that from week one and tomorrow I'm going to say that.  
We've just focused on trying to get better. We have a group that needed to
learn how to play with each other at both ends of the floor, and we have
improved in that area, and they are extremely -- these two guys and the rest
of the guys back in the locker room are willing, willing and supportive of
each other.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

### [Dominic James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13757)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
TOM CREAN: First off, it's the most unbelievable venue you could ever possibly
be in to play basketball during the season. The BIG EAST Conference does such
an incredible job of putting together such a first-class operation. We're
proud to be a part of the league. We're proud to be in games like this. We
fell a little bit short. I don't think there's any question that our short
bench caught up with us a little bit.  
We didn't have the same buzz defensively in the second half that we needed,
and we'll give great credit to Pittsburgh because they played outstanding the
entire night and made a lot of big shots. When Fields made a 27-footer off the
backboard, it started to feel like it just wasn't our night, even though, to
me, even though we continued to play very hard.  
But now we regroup and we go home and get ready for Selection Sunday, and we
anxiously anticipate the return of Jerel McNeal back to our team on the floor,
get him out of that assistant coaching role, and we'll go home and get better
and look forward to next week.  
  
Q. Gray had 16 and 18 in the first two games when you played them and beat
them; he had 22 tonight. Do you think his contribution was more significant in
their producing a win this time?  
TOM CREAN: He's been great every night we've played them, tonight and this
year. The thing about him that separates him from so many players in the
country is the way he makes everybody better. There cannot be a better passing
big man -- I haven't seen him, maybe there is somewhere, but I haven't seen
it. And he's so strong, if he gets any position inside, it's so hard to guard
him. And he was catching the ball so deep, we could not get the ball down or
out of his hands or put some pressure on him.  
What we said last year, what he does better than anybody is pass the ball
around and follow his own shot and he did that tonight. He's been a
contributing factor in all of their games with Pittsburgh and tonight he got
the win; they got the win.  
  
Q. What do you think as a player you can learn the most from this game
tonight heading into the tournament in?  
DOMINIC JAMES: You know, we had the right energy coming out in the ballgame
and things like that. But our second half -- in the second half we didn't come
out with the right mentality. We didn't have enough energy coming out and we
wasn't sharp, and that's the way that you have to be. You know, we came in
after the half down three and we came back out, and our energy just wasn't
there. That's one thing that we've got to be aware of and focus on as the
tournament comes is when that first half is over, you've got to come back with
the same energy level.  
With this type of team, you have to have a high energy level for this team to
be successful. That's the way that we play. We have high intensity on defense
and play well together on offense.  
  
Q. They made more free throws than your whole team attempted; do you feel
the game was won or lost at the free throw line?  
TOM CREAN: Most games usually are. At halftime the foul shots were 16-3, and
in a physical aggressive game, that's a tough pill to swallow. That's the way
it was and that's the way the game was called and just deal with it.  
There's no way we got a little shorthanded, and when you take a player like
Jerel McNeal out of our lineup that can get to the rim and create so much for
himself and for others, that hurts your belly a little bit to get to the line.
But that's why we want to go home, regroup, hope to have him back next week,
and let's see what happens.  
But they stepped up. We missed two free throws the entire night; that's what
it was?  
  
Q. 17 for 19.  
TOM CREAN: And they shot 41. It's a tough number, it's a tough number this
time of year. But they earned them and that's the way it is.  
  
Q. Talk about the play of Fitzgerald.  
TOM CREAN: Sure, nobody on our team was shocked. We love Danny. He had some
big games for us last year. He continues to get better all the time. He can
make shots and he can make others better. He's driving the ball well, and he
usually draws a very tough assignment defensively.  
Of course, there's not many players in the BIG EAST that are not a tough
assignment when you're divvying up responsibilities. But we're proud of the
way he's getting better. He's been a serious contributor, significant
contributor for us all year.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [Mike Cook](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17022)

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [Aaron Gray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13745)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
JAMIE DIXON: Well, I thought we got a lot of great efforts from a number of
guys, and I think our balance scoring speaks to that. It was a great win
against a very good team and I'm very proud of how our guys played throughout.
I was not at all surprised. We had a very good week of practice and we were
definitely looking forward to this game and guys handled it and now we'll get
ready for tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Because they had played last night, did you want to push them a little
bit and play more up-tempo?  
JAMIE DIXON: We always want to. We are always looking ahead and we seemed to
get some steals, some turnovers that got us going in transition, but I think
we made good decisions in that area. But again you don't want to do that just
to do that. You have to make good decisions. You have to take the right
opportunity and I think with our seven turnovers, it obviously reflects that
we did a very good job making decisions throughout the game in transition as
well as in the halfcourt.  
So again, I thought our guys battled all the way through.  
  
Q. Mike, they beat you twice during the regular season, close margins, how
did those defeats serve you tonight?  
MIKE COOK: It motivated us. All week like Coach said we had great practices.
In the back of our minds we knew we would have a chance to play them in the
first round of the tournament and we just wanted to come out and prove that we
are still the best team in the BIG EAST. A lot of people were down on us but
we knew if we could get over this mar game we could build our confidence.  
  
Q. (Inaudible -- about shots in the second half. )  
JAMIE DIXON: I don't know if it was anything I did, these guys guarded pretty
well. We really did a good job containing against penetration over the last
two games and now to this game, and even as the game went on. I think that was
the main thing, containing his penetration.  
He's such a good player, he's so explosive, it's not an easy job and he pretty
much can create a shot on his own at any time. It takes -- it's a team effort
keeping him in front.  
  
Q. Talk about your first BIG EAST tournament experience, you transferred
from BCU, talk about the excitement and the big victory tonight?  
MIKE COOK: It was great. I remember just growing up and watching the
tournament, watching Brandon play, and it was just a great feeling. I was kind
of nervous in the first half, not really being aggressive.  
Once I got comfortable, I wanted to come here and just show everybody what I
can do on the big stage and just be more aggressive in the second half and
just put on a good show in front of a big crowd, one of the biggest stages in
the world.  
  
Q. For Aaron, the two defeats during the regular season you had 16 and 18,
but those contributions didn't quite get you guys over the top. In what ways
were your 22 points tonight a contribution that was able to get you over the
top?  
AARON GRAY: You know, I don't really know. I just go out there and try to play
as hard as I can.  
You know, I think I had some big baskets tonight, you know, sometimes to
stretch the lead out a little farther, sometimes to stop a run that Marquette
had. But my teammates did a great job of getting me the ball in position where
I could score and I was able to finish. A lot of credit has to go to my
teammates.  
  
Q. Could you talk about how your foul shooting seemed to click on there
right before the half? Did you think that was going to be a big issue?  
JAMIE DIXON: As far as us shooting the ball, I thought we shot well from the
free throw until maybe the end. It's something we've talked about and worked
on. It's something that's held us back in a couple of games.  
You know, that happens to everybody, but you just hope you're hitting your
stride at the right time and hopefully we are now.  
But Aaron is shooting the ball better from the free throw line and I think a
lot of our guys are, I think Levon is, as well as Antonio. Those are important
points.  
  
Q. You fell behind in the two losses; how important was it tonight to stay
ahead?  
JAMIE DIXON: You know, I think actually it wasn't so much that we fell behind,
but we had substantial margins we had to come back from and both of them we
did come back but it was just too big of a hole.  
The previous two games, we talked about getting into a new season once we get
to the BIG EAST tournament games. We've played 31 games, I don't know how much
those shifts in those two games are going to have an impact on this game.  
It's great to talk about and those games will be compared, but we played 31
games and learned a lot in those 31 games rather than those two games and I
think we handled that and showed that to fight.  
  
Q. Talk about Louisville?  
JAMIE DIXON: It's a new season in our mind, that's how we look at it, we go
one at a time in the BIG EAST tournament. Everybody talks about winning it but
we talk about winning the first game and now we did that tonight and now we
can talk about playing Friday and playing that second game and being the best
prepared that we can be.  
We have not given much thought to them as of right now but these guys will be
well informed and well prepared for Louisville by 9 o'clock tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Aaron, what happened in that first Louisville game, they kind of landed
the first punch and got a big lead.  
AARON GRAY: We just kind of lost our composure. We got down a little bit and
then, you know, it seemed like every possession, we were trying to, you know,
get the whole lead back.  
You know, we learned a lot from it. You know, it was one of our only five
losses or six losses, and, you know, it's just going to add to our experience.
It's going to add to us knowing what we need to do down the stretch. You know,
there's going to be times now when, you know, it's possible for you to be down
14, you know, 20, 25 points as you've seen already in the BIG EAST tournament.
It's still possible to come back.  
I think it's going to help us out and also it's going to bring a little fire
to our team, you know, them coming in and, you know, be doing some more than
the score actually showed. It's going to add to a little bit of motivation for
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. That combination, was that problematic for you?  
AARON GRAY: I'm just going to be more worried about staying out of foul
trouble. If I can do that and stay on the floor, I think I'll be able to give
my team a lift at certain points.  
You know, as the whole season has gone on, you want to put two or three guys
on me, I'm more than confident in the guards I have and the forwards that I
have in Levon and Sam. It's going to be kind of pick your poison. If you want
to take me away, we have other threats. As our scoring shows, we're a well-
balanced team, not just a one-man show.  
  
Q. I know you said that you will be prepared for tomorrow night, but do you
have any thoughts on the matchup?  
JAMIE DIXON: Obviously a very good team and I know our guys are looking
forward to the opportunity to play tomorrow night. We'll prepare for the zone.
We spent a lot of time the last three days preparing for the zone, working on
it. We figured we would face it at some point, so I thought we handled it very
well tonight. That was big for us. Biggest difference probably was how we
attacked the zone today and that will come in handy tomorrow as well, because
Louisville does play two, three zone, so I think that will be an important
part of it.  
  
Q. Aaron may be not so good at patting himself on the back; how significant
were his 22 and 10 tonight?  
MIKE COOK: Very significant. He's an amazing presence down there. He has a
great job of finishing, he does a great job of drawing fouls. It wasn't like a
pointless 22 and 10. He made some big shots and big free throws and got some
key rebounds for us. Same things we're doing all season.  
We're not really surprised by him. He's put up numbers like this before and
it's another great game for him, he's a great player and he had a great game.  
  
Q. Mike, you said you were not maybe real comfortable at the start of the
game; how much did the matchup with Fitzgerald cause that and how do you think
you did on that?  
MIKE COOK: I'm going to say it was the defense. It was just, you know, a big
environment for me on a big stage and I came out kind of nervous a little bit.  
But you know, Coach kept me in the game, let me get myself into the game and
let me get into the flow and it really helped me out a lot and I was able to
get a bucket. The second half I wanted to come out and get rebounds, get
steals and if the shot was there, just take it.  
  
Q. Did you feel that you fed off the energy of the crowd? It seemed almost
like a home game.  
AARON GRAY: Definitely. They were announcing the starting lineups and
Marquette had a little cheer and our cheer was definitely louder. We were over
on the bench saying, all right, Pittsburgh just won round one. It was
definitely huge, we got a lot of fan support. We traveled real well. I know I
had a ton of people coming up from home to see my last BIG EAST tournament.
It's huge for me, all of the support that I'm getting and all of the support
the University of Pittsburgh is getting.  
  
Q. You've all been to the championship game of this tournament; is this the
toughness that you teach?  
JAMIE DIXON: We have tough kids. I mean, that's part of it. Maybe it's how we
prepare for it and how we think and how we really look at the one game at a
time and don't focus on the whole tournament. You know, I don't know, I wish
if -- but we've been pretty good, so that's probably had something to do with
it over the years.  
But again, we're completely focused on Marquette or St. John's and now we're
going to completely focus on Louisville, and I think that's how we look at it.
It's about that next game and maybe that's why we've had such success here. I
know it's not easy, I know it's unprecedented what we've done, five out of the
last six years. We've just got to get this win tomorrow, we have a very tough
opponent and we're looking forward to the challenge.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Russell Carter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16985)

### [Colin Falls](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13735)

### [Luke Harangody](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16984)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
MIKE BREY: Well, certainly a heck of a win for us. Our poise was pretty good
when we were down in the first half, and I thought we hung in there. And our
offense eventually got in gear. It took a 57-point half for us to escape with
a win. We needed every point.  
Thought we made big buckets and I thought we made big free throws to win the
game against a very good team. Syracuse is a heck of a basketball team.  
  
Q. When you're down three to start the second half and you get on that 13-3
run, what really got you guys settled down?  
MIKE BREY: I think it's these guys now, you know, we've got these two seniors
that have certainly been very poised. One of the things we talked about that
we didn't do a very good job of the last time we played in this building
against St. John's is we got a little rattled and we were not very poised and
a lot of that was St. John's playing very well quite frankly. I thought we did
a better job of just handling tough stuff and just hanging in there and that's
what we have done all year. We have gotten a lot better in that area and
that's why we have been pretty consistent all year.  
  
Q. In the first half you got back in the game --  
MIKE BREY: It was our offense kicking in, baby. We can offense you now. You've
been watching us all year, haven't you? We put numbers on that board.  
As it's going, my assistants are yelling about changing defenses and I just
said, fellas, let's make sure we score the ball, because they can score it and
we can score it. We're going to have to score this thing and we got into a
heck of a rhythm.  
Certainly zone helped. It changed the tempo. It changed the rhythm of the game
a little bit for them.  
  
Q. With 34 three-point shot attempts --  
MIKE BREY: Absolutely in the game plan. I said, "Just let it fly."  
The one thing, they didn't zone us in the Carrier Dome; they manned us. When
you play them, they can really push you out. You have to take a couple good
ones and let your guys shoot and have a free mind. You can't react to a bad
shot or a quick shot. They have to be able to play, and to beat that system,
you know, you can talk about, you hear commentators talk about, you've got to
get it to the high post and you've got to screen the back of the zone. Yeah,
you've got to do all that but you've got to make some shots. That's the first
thing that sets the table or all that other stuff. I don't want our guys
worried or looking at the bench when they shoot it, our good shooters stepping
up and taking it.  
  
Q. Colin, all your shots came from the outside; were you just feeling it out
there or did you not want to go inside and take a jumper?  
COLIN FALLS: I just think spacing-wise I got a bunch of clean looks. I missed
a lot of shots but I guess I have to mix it up a little more.  
  
Q. You guys were up 76-70 and struggling against the press a little bit and
you hit a three, how important was that down the stretch?  
COLIN FALLS: Rob hit a big one, Russell was making free throws, I think I was
on the clock and you just have to make plays down the stretch to win big
basketball games and that's what we were doing.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what this win does for your profile?  
MIKE BREY: My profile personally? One of the things we talked about as we came
here, that I've been really impressed with that I think the committee looks
at, but no one talks about; we have been ranked 12 of 13 weeks.  
I don't care about RPI, strength of schedule or any of that. That sheet is in
front of those people in Indianapolis, too. That's pretty consistent. But
certainly beating a Syracuse team here and getting a chance to play the
regular-season champion helps, absolutely.  
We're trying to play for a trophy here and seeding next week right now.  
  
Q. What are the keys for you guys to beat -- inaudible?  
COLIN FALLS: Obviously you have to move the ball, but when you have four guys
who you can spread them out with, even their length, really can't guard that.  
  
Q. Now that you've got Georgetown, any thoughts on playing them?  
RUSSELL CARTER: Well, last time, you know, they whipped us, so to get a chance
to play them again, as Coach said, they are the regular-season conference
champs, and it's a tough challenge and we have to be up for it.  
  
Q. What has to be different this time than last time?  
RUSSELL CARTER: We have to win. (Laughter)  
  
Q. Luke, what allowed you to be effective down low all day today?  
LUKE HARANGODY: I think it was just for getting inside the zone and getting
some good looks inside, I just had to finish the big guys.  
  
Q. A couple of the 3s down the stretch, you seemed as excited as the fans.  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, I just love we were playing with a free mind. When Rob took
that one in the corner, I'm trying to get him to shoot it all year, that was a
big bucket right there and for him to step up and knock that down, I'll be our
biggest cheerleader when we get into a groove like that.  
  
Q. Syracuse has been so successful with their perimeter game, what did you
do to take that away today?  
MIKE BREY: I thought we did a pretty good job in man defending the 3-point
line and not letting them really get going from there. Only five three-point
shots.  
They drove us, they got into the paint a little bit. We'll give up some of
that because we'll trade some of our threes for your twos through the game and
that's been our philosophy.  
I do think when we went to zone a couple of times, it changed the rhythm and
all of a sudden, shooters are getting shots in a different rhythm. We
challenged and we rebounded there. Our defense was good, too, it helped out.
When we went zone, we created some turnovers. We didn't even have to rush the
ball -- because rebounding the ball was an adventure for a while because they
can really get up on the board.  
  
Q. You've come to New York with some very good point guards but talk about
the job that Corey did.  
MIKE BREY: Well, I've not come in here with a tougher guy, I can tell you that
much, physically and mentally, going 40 minutes tonight. He was fabulous. He
got into the gaps and the middle of that zone, he defended, forced steals, got
his hands on stuff. Just the toughness factor that that young man brings,
along with our other freshmen, has really helped us mentally and physically be
tougher overall.  
  
Q. You take away the perimeter game -- inaudible?  
MIKE BREY: My feeling was, those count, too. Especially when we get a lead in
the second half which we've had a lot in games, then we become even more
aware, and it may be from the 14-minute mark of three-point shots going in on
you being able to close the gap.  
See, you don't help in the post, and if our big guys cannot handle it on their
own, if we are scoring the ball pretty well, we'll give up twos and just guard
that line. You know, we've gotten pretty good at that.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Demetris Nichols](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13751)

### [Terrence Roberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13727)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
JIM BOEHEIM: I thought we just were not as active defensively in the second
half. I thought we looked a little tired. But you know, I think Notre Dame is
a very good team, offensive team against our zone. We had to be a little bit
better on offense than we were. When we had the 10-point lead in the first
half and they went to the zone, we didn't attack it very well, and I thought
that was the difference in the game. They got back in the game playing a zone,
which nobody has even been able to play zone against us this year. I didn't
think we attacked it very well.  
You know, I thought our looks from the 3 were good today; they were good
yesterday. We did not shoot it well here. From the three-point line, that's a
big strength of our team this year. I really like the looks we got. Obviously
you can't miss 13 free throws in a close game in a tournament, I thought that
was a factor.  
I thought Terrence and Paul did a good job on the boards, that's the best
we've rebounded the ball without a doubt all year. I just didn't think we made
some shots, particularly the free throws to win; Notre Dame is a very good
basketball team and they are the only team that we were not in the game with
this year coming in here.  
But you know, we had to shoot the ball a little bit better today, and we
didn't.  
  
Q. You talk about the free throw shooting, 16 for 29 in the second half
alone and Terrence going 0 for 6 from the cherry stripe --  
JIM BOEHEIM: Is there a question in there someplace?  
  
Q. Coming off the poor free throw shooting, how do you then try to build the
game somewhere else if you know you're not doing well at the free throw
line?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Well, there's nothing that I know that I can do about missing
free throws. You miss them, you try to get them back and you try to make the
next one.  
  
Q. Attacking from the perimeter, is that what makes Notre Dame tough?  
JIM BOEHEIM: They have been doing the same thing against us for the last eight
years.  
  
Q. But with this personnel --  
JIM BOEHEIM: They have had just as good of personnel or better.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Paul's game tonight?  
JIM BOEHEIM: I thought Paul was great on the boards. I thought he went after
it, you know, all night long. Terrence and Paul were tremendous on the boards
tonight.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys played well down the stretch, what do you think of
your position now going into the NCAA Tournament?  
JIM BOEHEIM: No idea.  
  
Q. In the first half, Demetris when they switched to zone, did that throw
you off or give you a different defense to look at there?  
DEMETRIS NICHOLS: No, you know, I don't think that we adjusted, you know,
right, and I think that really -- I think that really like -- I think they
tried to like, when they went into the zone, we wasn't doing the things that
we were supposed to do basically, you know, like trying to get the ball into
the middle and stuff like that.  
But you know, I think they just caught us off guard.  
  
Q. 11 offensive rebounds, 20 for the game, talk about how hard you are
working down low in the post to try to bring your team back?  
TERRENCE ROBERTS: I'm just doing what my team and my coach ask me to do. I'm
just working hard and giving it all I've got. That's what I should be doing
every game, out there and rebounding so we can get a win.  
  
Q. Demetris, yesterday you mentioned that you came off a bad game and came
back with a really strong second half yesterday, so you know how to bounce
back. After today's performance, you have to look forward to the NCAA
Tournament; what's it going to take for you to bounce back from today?  
DEMETRIS NICHOLS: I think just hard work and practice and preparing well. I
think that's about it.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Frank Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17014)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: It was a -- I guess anybody, I know it's late and this next game
is going to start about 10:15. But I think it was a great basketball game. I
believe that, you know, our kids, there's three different -- we just came out,
and I don't know if it was fatigue from last night. It took us a while to get
our second wind but we came out and did not play well to start. Fought back,
and if we were under double digits at half the way we started, I thought we
would be in great shape but we weren't. Certainly came back and had a chance
to win the game and so he's made a terrific play, Darris made a terrific play.  
So we don't get the win. But I can't do anything but tell you how proud I am
of my team, and I'm sure the state and the university, I know they are proud
of each other as well.  
  
Q. The end of regulation, the clock, it looked like it started for about
two/tenths of a second after the inbound pass to Sosa; did you see that?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I did not see that. I've just got to trust -- I've got to trust
that the timekeepers know what they are doing. I don't know if that would have
made a difference. It certainly got in the goal by that time and we hustled,
we got back, tried to get back and he just made a terrific play. Made him go
left which was terrific.  
We need a little bit of help on that last play, but Darris made the great play
to get us there. It's just it's a tough play to stop without fouling late in
the game.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about when it was right off the bat, 14-2, probably not
the way you want to start what got you guys back into it, and then you made
another run in the second half?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think we have great leadership. It's quiet leadership but it's
great leadership. They just stuck with what we had to do. We changed some
things up offensively and defensively.  
But it's a painful loss when you do everything and then you come back and you
take the lead. You know, they missed a foul shot, the story of our life there,
they offensive rebound and end up tying the game up and then Darris made the
big play.  
  
Q. Going on that 18-0 run in the second half, the second overtime, did you
see that your team was kind of tiring out?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I don't know, I'll have to look at the tape a little bit. But
they made some breaks go their way. We did not have many breaks in that last
overtime. So we just have to -- I'm better at watching the tape to try to
determine exactly what happened. I'm not -- I'm just trying to score points
and get the stops. The momentum and all those things, I'm just coaching during
that time.  
But they had a good team. There's a reason why they finished second in the BIG
EAST.  
  
Q. Do you believe you guys have done enough to get a tournament bid?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I hope so at this point because I think that, you know, this is
a very skilled committee, they have been through so much. They really look at
teams.  
I think that this is -- we are a tenth of a second away from a great, great
win. So you know, we certainly think so at West Virginia. We'll be keeping our
fingers crossed that they think the same way.  
We really played what we thought was going to be an aggressive schedule. Some
of those teams were young when we ended up beating them early in the year and
now they are not Top-50 teams anymore. They were very good teams when we
played them. Connecticut was nationally ranked when we ended up playing them
and North Carolina State has had a great year. You know, it's been -- I know
we have done enough, right, to get this there. But I know there's a lot of
teams that feel that same way.  
  
Q. Can you talk about so many of your players returning next year, what that
means, maturity process?  
JOHN BEILEIN: You know, our season is not over yet. I don't want to talk about
next year yet. (Laughing).  
But I certainly think that we have a lot of young men that will stay in the
program. But I don't want to -- this guy still has some more games to play we
think and hopefully we believe it's in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. When Darris hit that layup at the end of regulation, did the players
realize the situation, time remaining?  
FRANK YOUNG: I don't know if as a team we realized how much time was left. I
looked up at the clock right away and realized there was four seconds and
started yelling, "Get back, get back." I thought I saw somebody under the
basket but I just tried to help Darris, try to swipe the ball and get the ball
from Sosa and next thing I see he has an open lane to the basket. When you
look back in hindsight, I just think I could have done a better job of maybe
being in the lane to maybe protect the basket because I know Darris is a good
defender, to try to make him take a tough shot.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2007

  

### [Norm Roberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16973)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
NORM ROBERTS: I thought it was a really highly-contested game. Give Marquette
a lot of credit. They have got a terrific basketball team and they made a lot
of big plays. We did, as well, but they made a few more than we did.  
  
Q. A lot has been building up to this night, can you talk about the
experience coming to the Garden?  
NORM ROBERTS: I thought the experience great. I really enjoyed it. It's
probably the most fun I had coaching at St. John's to tell you the truth, with
the pressure of the game and the atmosphere was awesome. I thought our guys, I
told our guys, enjoy every single moment of it.  
That's why I told our guys to sit out there and watch some of the early game,
you know, and now when we got back in the locker room after the game, I just
told them, "Now when you take to you about postseason play and how important
it is and how good it feels and all that stuff, you know what I mean now."  
And hopefully our younger guys will be able to tell our freshmen coming in
next year, that's why we have got to work so hard to try to get to this point.  
  
Q. Could you have expected any more out of Aaron Spears?  
NORM ROBERTS: No, he gave it his all. Give Tom a lot of credit, Tom does a
good job of rotating his big guys in there, so they try to wear your big guys
down so they just depleted, just having three big guys.  
  
Q. Seemed like you stopped their guards pretty well.  
NORM ROBERTS: Yeah, Kinsella, he can really shoot. He did a great job,
Fitzgerald did a good job. He's got such size, he's six-seven, six-eight, so
he can really shoot over you, and he's a smart player.  
I thought our guys did a good job. I thought Larry Wright did a good job when
he was in there. Mason played his tail off. He did a great job for us. He hurt
his hand a little bit while it was going on, and then Jaiulionis even did a
great job on James. You couldn't ask for a better job against such a great
player.  
  
Q. You play on this court during the regular season. Talk a little bit about
how this game and protecting the home court.  
NORM ROBERTS: Well, we always want to protect the home court and we play our
home games here and the Garden is always great to us and it's a great place to
play. We are going to get better as a program and hopefully we'll come out
with wins instead of coming up short.  
  
Q. Marquette had extended a couple of double-digits leads in the second
half, but you came back to fight and tie, what do you say about the character
of your team?  
NORM ROBERTS: Well, they showed a lot of character. They stayed tough, stayed
within themselves. We told them Marquette is going to make runs, they are a
very good team and can do that. We kind of withstood those runs, but the key
was to rebound and get stops and they were able to do that on a few occasions.  
  
Q. Thoughts on an NIT bid?  
NORM ROBERTS: Love to play in the NIT. I don't know if that happens, if it
will or not. If it does, we will be prepared and love to have a chance. We
would love to continue our season because I think our team is growing and
getting better.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2007

  

### [Scottie Reynolds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16946)

### [Curtis Sumpter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16947)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
JAY WRIGHT: I'll look at the stats here as we ask questions, I didn't get to
see this yet. But just a classic BIG EAST battle. I think that DePaul -- we
played early in January, they kind of handled us and when you play a good team
like that, you learn about yourselves, and they taught us a lot. We just were
not tough enough back then. They got a lot better and we got a lot better. It
was good to see the improvement in our team.  
They are good. They are playing great basketball. Jerry has done a great job
with that team and that's why I feel it's a good win. They know what they are
doing out there. They are very good defensively, get the ball to the right
people and that was good for us to beat a team like that.  
  
Q. Over the last three games you guys have really shown you're able to close
out close games which you didn't show earlier in the season, can you talk
about the growth there?  
JAY WRIGHT: I think that's just due to chemistry. You know, just being -- for
you guys, or beat writers, I keep saying the same thing but it's the truth.
It's just getting Curtis back into practice so we can play together and we
know where people are. That's why DePaul is so good, they know where their
scorers are and to get the ball to the people in the right spots. When Curtis
was hurting we were always questioning down the stretch, "Do we go to him?"
"How bad is his shin?" "How bad is his hamstring?" We knew we wanted to go to
him, we were always trying to figure how. And Scottie was young, and we're
starting to get some chemistry. We're starting to know about ourselves.  
  
Q. It looked like Reggie twisted his ankle, what's up with that?  
JAY WRIGHT: I didn't hear but he got back in there. It's probably one of those
things that it will swell up tonight, and he's a pretty tough kid. I think we
have a chance of Mike being better tomorrow. We have to make that decision
today because we knew if we tried to play him today, he could get worse, and
maybe not for tomorrow, but maybe down the road. So we had a chance of him
getting better. Reggie, I haven't heard yet.  
  
Q. You mentioned being tougher this time facing DePaul; did you do anything
schematically, different to attack them in a different way?  
JAY WRIGHT: Not really. We defended a little bit. Last time, it was scary
watching that film last time. They just shot over everybody. I didn't think
last time we did a good enough job as a staff, understanding their personal.
But I know Jerry pretty well and we are good friends. I don't know if we knew
his personnel well back then and it kind of confused us. This time we are a
better team and we knew who was who.  
  
Q. Do you feel like it was an opportunity to --  
JAY WRIGHT: Our two games with Georgetown, when we beat them at Georgetown,
they played a much better game than us. We kind of got lucky down there.  
When we played at home, I thought we played a great game. We just could not
finish it as we were talking about. So obviously both teams have gotten
better.  
We've just had two great games. This is going to be a battle, man. That's what
it's all about when you get here.  
  
Q. How different do you feel from when you watched that game and
personally?  
CURTIS SUMPTER: From the first game we played? I feel a lot more confident,
like Coach said, back then we were not sure who to go to at certain times but
now we're positive. We know who we want to get shots for.  
Our defense was not as great as it is now, and I think over time, we've gotten
a lot better and that helped us out today.  
  
Q. You talked about the chemistry before. How did you feel about the
chemistry today with Mike off the floor so much?  
JAY WRIGHT: That's a good question. We were saying to ourselves on the bench,
the coaches, we were just saying, "we're just missing Mike's attitude out
there." It's quiet, it was quiet out there. Mike's always talking, calling
everything.  
Scottie knows what we're doing and he can run the show. But Mike's just like
another coach out there, and we kept saying that. We were thinking about,
should we just put him in there to give Scottie a rest just for his attitude,
his confidence; he's screaming out there all the time. That was the
difference.  
But the other part of it is Reggie Redding lives with him and Shane and those
guys, the young guys -- we've gotten freshmen and sophomores that are kind of
like a little cult and we have our seniors who take care of those little
babies.  
So Reggie fits in really well out there with Scottie and Shane and Dante.  
  
Q. Can you just sum up your feelings this year as opposed to a year ago when
you watched this tournament?  
CURTIS SUMPTER: I think anybody who has ever been hurt knows, you know, when
you're sitting down and watching the game, it hurts a lot but when you're out
there playing, you're just happy to be out there and you want to win.  
I just was a little disappointed that last year could I not help my team win,
but this year I'm able to help my team win?  
  
Q. Can you talk about what you saw from Reggie tonight and how he fits out
there?  
SCOTTIE REYNOLDS: Yeah, like Coach said, me and him are roommates and we're
always talking. You know, when Mike's out there, he's more passive in the
offense and things like that.  
But tonight, he had to come in and fill some big shoes, and he did. He did a
great job. The only thing I had to say to him was, you know, be aggressive and
you know, he made some tough plays. He was playing good D.  
I was proud of him, to be his roommate, I guess. (Laughing) No, I was real
proud of him and to make plays for us and to, you know, hit a big shot at the
shot clock showed his toughness?  
  
Q. Can you talk about being sent to the free throw line a million times and
making them and how the 33 out of 38 affected the whole game?  
SCOTTIE REYNOLDS: I was just trying to be aggressive. I kind of like -- a
switch kind of turned on in me where I just wanted to be more on aggressive on
the ball. It ended up where I was going to the line, and, you know, it worked
out, I guess.  
  
Q. In a game like this where there is not a lot of flow because of all the
free throws, do you worry about your guys losing focus in a game like this?  
JAY WRIGHT: You do. You always worry about that offensively. You worry about
getting out of the rhythm when you're just standing on the foul line and the
same guy is shooting free throws because no one else is touching the ball. You
do worry about that.  
However, if it does get into a free throw shooting contest, usually we're
pretty good. That gave me confidence. You know, we talked about finishing
games. If we can get into a position where we've got the lead, we're usually
pretty good, because our big guys shoot well. Most teams have guards that
shoot well, but Curtis, Dante, Wilshire, they all shoot the ball well.  
  
Q. Is it a little ironic that Scottie is the one telling Reggie to be more
aggressive offensively? Do you have to prod him to be more aggressive and does
that show his growth?  
JAY WRIGHT: Definitely. He knows what he's supposed to do, he just doesn't do
it all the time in terms of being aggressive. Recently he has been and we've
all seen it.  
With Reggie it's different. Reggie is always ready to go. It's us holding
Reggie back saying, "Reggie, not yet." When he gets a chance like this today
-- he's the all-time leading scorer at St. Joe's Prep, there have been a lot
of great players there. He's ready to go.  
  
Q. What was the key to the way you started the game and in the second half
the way you guys came out? They seemed to have more momentum going into
halftime.  
SCOTTIE REYNOLDS: We came out just -- I thought we had some good shots. You
know, me and Curtis were kind of mixing our drives and our threes up, but they
were not falling for us. We went down to the lane, just rolling off rim and
they kind of got on a run and made it like a two-point game.  
In the second half I thought we were more aggressive in attacking off the rim
and off the dribble and not just settling for threes all the time. Dante did a
great job in the second half, just try to get him in the post and, you know,
try to take the pressure off of me and Curtis on the perimeter and he made
some big plays for himself, for Curtis and for myself?  
  
Q. How anxious have you been in practice to play?  
CURTIS SUMPTER: I'm anxious to get a shot at the next opponent, I'm ready
already. Knowing it's Georgetown and our previous two games and how it ended,
I think we match up with them pretty well. You know, it's just going to come
down to who rebounds the ball better and who wants it more tomorrow?  
  
Q. You mentioned the cult of freshmen and sophomores, I don't know if that's
like skull and bones or anything like that, but when you get into this kind of
a situation where it's a grind, how much do you count on your upperclassmen to
help get them through what they are going to be going through?  
JAY WRIGHT: A lot. And I think sometimes people refer to us as a young team,
and we never want to use that as an excuse, because we have three great
seniors. Not just very good players and a great player in Curtis, but leaders
that can talk to these guys. Even coming into the lobby of the hotel, you
could see that the freshmen and sophomores are like giggling and Curtis and
those guys were just business and we talked to them right away about that.
They passed that on and it's very important for our team and our program.  
  
Q. Given the nature of this tournament, if you don't have Mike tomorrow --
it's a lot of shots and a lot of minutes --  
JAY WRIGHT: That's what this tournament is all about, staying fresh, it's
exactly what I talked to them about in the locker room. Go back, lay in bed,
drink liquids. No one is going to be on their feet. We'll be watching film and
literally we'll be pouring liquids down their throats and they will just be
laying around. It will be all mental preparation. We'll go over the film, go
over the scouting report but no one will be on their feet.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2007

  

### [Herbert Hill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16965)

### [Tim Welsh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14050)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
TIM WELSH: You know, obviously, we had a game plan of -- to get to their
shooters with our two-three zone and it worked particularly well in
Providence. You're concerned obviously when a team does shoot that many and
they are a three-point shooting team and it's a pick your poison with them.  
Tonight we stayed in the zone for a while, but it got to a point where they
were in such a rhythm that we had to change and go to pressure man-to-man. I
thought our man-to-man was good, it got us back in the game and cut the
deficit from 15 to 3. But then we had a couple defense misassignments and they
got a couple threes. It's just tough to overcome. It's deflating to have them
come at you at the pace they came today. Our guys, I thought they did a great
job of fighting back and playing with a lot of heart and grit. We had some
obvious mistakes out there, but it was not because of the lack of effort. It
was just lack of cohesiveness at times on both ends of the floor.  
Some turnovers hurt us. First half I thought pretty significant that we gave
them 18 second-chance points, and if we had eliminated some of that, then we
would have had a better feeling at half-time and they would not have had as
good a feeling as they had coming out of the locker room.  
Our kids got it back to where it was within reach but every time that
happened, the threes just kind of put it out of reach. Obviously the numbers
are overwhelming when you look at their numbers. You know, it's tough to shoot
51 percent from the floor and out-rebound a team and lose. That's happened
today. But they got 50-plus points on 3-pointers, and that's tough to
overcome.  
  
Q. What was the difference with your zone? Did they push out and make deeper
shoots?  
TIM WELSH: Well, they got into the gaps a little bit and they got in and
sucked us in and they got the ball to the corners. They overloaded and they
drove it in and got it past our basic set defense, and then got our defense
out of alignment on the weak side.  
Sometimes we weren't there on time and other times I thought we made good
efforts to get there and the ball just went in. I have to watch the tape but
my general feeling, the contests were pretty much there. They did a good job
of attacking. It's a tough thing when they spot five, they have five three-
point shooters and you are always chasing and so when we break you down rather
than have you that spread out, then the zone can collapse and they can drive
and kick the shooters.  
I saw that happening, I saw them in a rhythm and that's why we did go to the
man-to-man and with a smaller lineup to try to pressure them a little bit.  
  
Q. You got it to three like you said, they call a time-out, they get a three
and things seemed to unravel; can you talk about that?  
TIM WELSH: Yeah, I mean, it's deflating, all of the threes, you add them all
up.  
But you come all the way back and you make it a game. But I don't think that
particular one crushed us. After that we had a couple of turnovers that were
key and they turned them into easy run-outs and then that added, went from
six, back up to ten. Then that, you know, when you push it all the way back to
three, you're hoping you can keep it to a basket-for-basket game towards the
end of the game. When it goes back to ten, I think I saw our shoulders droop a
little bit where we lost a bit of our spark that we needed. But we did keep
fighting but they kept making the threes.  
  
Q. Inaudible?  
TIM WELSH: He's playing like one of the best players in the country, not just
our team. We told them that -- I feel bad for him that he couldn't make a run
in this tournament in his senior year because he's given us so much. But I
hope that the season is not over, and he can keep playing because he's just a
wonderful guy to coach, he's a great teammate, he's a great guy in the locker
room and a great player. Just, you know, think one of the best players, not
only in the league, but in the country in college basketball.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the -- (inaudible) to get you back in the game as
well?  
TIM WELSH: I wanted to press up a little bit and I wanted to go with four-
round and spread the four a little bit and place them man-to-man. It gave us
some life. We've got four guys that can shoot threes. We've got guys that can
break the defense down and you've got a great big man in the middle, a great
guy who can finish. It was really good offensively. We got hurt a little bit
defensively because now you're looking at match-ups, you've got Williams
guarding Akex Ruoff; he's six foot six; so their size hurt us a little bit.
But they did battle and it got us back in the game. It was a good look for
what we needed at the time.  
  
Q. Can you expand on Williams' performance tonight?  
TIM WELSH: Oh, it's terrific. He's got ice in his veins and he kept us in the
game and he got us back in the game, as well. He made a lot of good plays.
He's played terrific out there. He didn't play in the first West Virginia game
so we thought that he was another weapon we could use against the 1-3-1.  
Offensively tonight there's not a lot I can complain about. We had too many
turnovers, a little bit too aggressive, a little bit too -- when you get
behind, I think we started pressing and started trying to make plays on our
own too much. But Dwain did a super job keeping his head and his composure, a
super effort for a freshman.  
  
Q. Going back to the three-point shooting, when they played you at
Providence a few weeks ago, they were 9-for-41 and tonight they have 17 in the
game, a BIG EAST tournament record. What was so different between that game
there that ended up being a victory and tonight?  
TIM WELSH: Some of their looks in Providence were open, too, and they missed
them. They are an extremely difficult team to guard. You've got to kind of
match up with them well, and if you don't, you've got to try to mix and match
your defenses. Tonight we started in a zone, we played it the same way we did
in Providence and tried to make a couple of adjustments to what they were
adjusting to. They tried to drive it in a few times in the first half and
threw that shuttle pass out to the forward and thought that was a nice
adjustment and we readjusted to that. They tried to screen us a little bit
more, but they made a lot of shots, a lot of shots with hands in their face.
You guys were there in the game; it's not like they were standing on the line
all night long wide open. They made efforts, some of them we were open, but I
thought our guys pretty much got to the shooters when they needed to, and
sometimes they couldn't because I thought they had our us spread out too far
and they had good dribble penetration, which is why I think in the first half
they beat us a little bit.  
  
Q. Can you talk about closing out the threes, did they just go so far out
and sometimes you think you're there but you're not really there?  
HERBERT HILL: They did a great job of spacing us out and moving the ball. We
tried to get there but it seemed like everything they threw up just went in.  
  
Q. Are there any injury issues that you have to be monitoring if NIT is in
the future?  
TIM WELSH: I think it's been well documented that Jeff has been playing what
-- you know, partially sprained meniscus. He's got a little tear in there. You
can see his production. He's playing like a warrior, though. He's trying to
play through it. You can see his offensive game is not what it was because of
that, but he's going to continue to play through it. That's something that we
are going to have to do. Nothing we can do about that now.  
And hopefully Sharaud's finger will be healed enough where he can look for his
offense a little bit more. I think you saw today where he hesitated with his
offense, but other than that I think we'll be okay.  
  
Q. A few times you were running four to six points down, that's when you
made your last run, there were two key turnovers that turned it to six points;
that was the difference in the game, that 30-second stretch, because by that
time you were down ten and that was it.  
TIM WELSH: Right. Correct. (Laughter.)  
I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be funny, was that a question? Was that a
synopsis?  
  
Q. It's in between --  
TIM WELSH: As I said before, that was -- it's deflating when you get back to
three points and you turn it over and give them easy baskets. If they are
going to work for their buckets, it's fine. You can keep battling. But you
turn it over and then into runouts and it goes from six up to then ten.  
The three was important, but it went to ten quickly on two turnovers and that
was probably the key point.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2007

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

### [Dan Fitzgerald](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16972)

### [Dominic James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13757)

### [Wesley Matthews](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16971)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
Q. With Jerel being out, somebody needed to step up and it was you tonight,
20 points, can you speak about your performance?  
DAN FITZGERALD: We knew when he was out that everybody had to step up. We got
nine guys that are playing and I think everybody, everybody is stepping up and
doing a little more than what we normally do, and we have to win.  
  
Q. You struggled in the first half shooting, you only had four points the
first half and didn't pick up your next point until way late in the second
half; how did you feel out there tonight and how can you build from tonight,
poor shooting towards the regular season, how do you build for the rest of the
tournament?  
DOMINIC JAMES: Yeah, it was a struggle tonight, you know, shooting and things
like that. But throughout the game, I was just trying to find a way to impact
the game and impact my team winning.  
You know, just getting guys on the open shots, getting to the lane, a lot of
defenses collapsed on me and trying to get open shots and guys like Wesley and
Dan and Cubillan, Mike stepped up big for us tonight and hit a couple of
threes. That's the kind of thing I have to do to impact the game different
ways and it doesn't have to be scoring all the time. It's getting guys
involved in playing good defense.  
  
Q. Did you get concerned when the score was tied?  
DOMINIC JAMES: We just wanted to focus on our defense. They was getting a lot
of easy baskets and they was getting to the free throw line, too, so they was
stealing momentum away from us. That's the thing we looked forward to. In the
huddle, that's one thing we were emphasizing was getting stops and letting the
offense come. We were trying to run plays with a lot of continuity, everybody
touches it and make everyone work on defense and on offense, that's the kind
of things we were looking forward to doing.  
  
Q. What about tomorrow's opponent, how did you do against them this season;
how did you do so well?  
DAN FITZGERALD: Well, just like we did tonight, just playing as a team. We're
nine-deep and when we move the ball, and rebound and defend, and we rebounded
real well today, that was the goal to make sure we out-rebounded them. That
was a big key for us. So when we are defending and getting key stops and
limiting them to one shot and rebounding and running and start moving the
ball, that's when we are the best.  
  
Q. Towards the end of the game you got fouled and went to the free throw
line for a couple big free throw attempts, nine of ten tonight from the free
throw line, clutch shots when necessary; how do you feel when the game is on
the line and you need to make your free throws, what's going through your
head?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: You try to block everything out and you've been shooting free
throws for such a long time and it's the easier shot, just you and the hoop
and you've got to block everything out, block the time-out, block the score
out, just step up and make the shot. And that's just what I try to do. I knew
the team needed the shots and knew they were coming back and the time was
running down so we just need to keep pushing that lead. It was just stepping
up and doing what we've been doing forever and just making free throws.  
  
Q. Were you surprised at those three-pointers -- your reaction on the
bench?  
DAN FITZGERALD: He did the game before, he hit a couple big threes, too. He's
playing a little more three so he's on the perimeter more. Those are the kind
of things we need from our bench, coming off the bench and making plays and
either keeping the level of intensity or raising it, so he did a great job.  
TOM CREAN: Well, we totally anticipated a great game with St. John's. Our
respect for them is phenomenal. I think Norm Roberts is an outstanding coach.
When you look at his record of what he's done in the past and now what he's
doing at St. John's they are outstanding. They have got so many good young
players.  
Both teams had to play without just an absolute key heart and soul member of
their team, and McNeal and then with Lamont Hamilton, but they did not miss a
beat. They have good guards. Mason is a superstar in the making and Calhoun
is, too. We knew it was going to be a very aggressive physical game.  
Our keys going into the game, they are 12-2 when they out-rebound their
opponents and we did not want to make it 13. For us to win the rebounding game
was a huge step and it was our No. 1 key, and taking care of the ball on
offense and moving the ball was another key. 14 assists and eight turnovers is
good for us in that sense. We wanted to make sure that we got good shots, and
for the most part, we did.  
We knew it was going to be a great crowd. We knew they were going to be an
excellent team, and I don't think the game disappointed anybody in the sense
of how hard both teams played.  
  
Q. You had mentioned rebounding. You guys had 15 offensive rebounds today;
what do you have to say about the aggressiveness on the boards?  
TOM CREAN: We had to. You can't win big games, you certainly cannot beat a St.
John's team if you don't rebound the ball. So that was by far the No. 1 thing,
because again, like we said, they are 12-2 when they out-rebound their
opponents. He preaches rebounding, I'm sure, he obviously does because they
are excellent at it. We had to be in that position, we have to gang rebound,
we have to have our guards rebound, we have to have the bench rebound. We just
cannot rely on one or two people to clean up the glass for us, we have to have
a team that does it. For the most part we did a pretty good job of them
blocking out. For them to get seven offensive boards because Calhoun alone was
averaging four and a half the last five games. That was the key to the game
that we were able to win that battle.  
  
Q. Dominic James did not have a stellar game. You are also not playing
McNeal because he's battling injury but you had a lot of intangibles stepping
up in Hayward, Barro coming through. Talk about the intangibles and how
important that. Is?  
TOM CREAN: First off, your opinion on Dominic not having a good game is your
opinion. My opinion is he played an outstanding floor game, shots looked like
they were not going in, they just didn't go. But to have eight assists in this
game and to play 37 minutes and five defensive boards and keep his team
moving, great plays down the stretch, that's how I evaluate the game. He made
everybody else better. We obviously miss Jerel, no question about that, he's
one of our two leading scorers, he's an attack guy, steals, you name it, he
gets it done. But our team is growing. Mike has answered the bell the last
couple of games, and great line I heard this past fall from Scott Skiles when
he was talking about another BIG EAST guy, Adrian Griffin at practice, he
said, "A-play-on-demand league." And I think all sports are like that, college
and pro obviously. And we have talked about that all year, whenever you go to
the bench, those guys have got to be ready to contribute and tonight they
were.  
Burke playing the way they were, Cuby (David Cubillan), those really helped
us. We have a short bench right now so there are certain things we have to do
a little differently but we have to have great presence with guys like Lazar
and Ousmane and then with our bench.  
  
Q. There's been some skepticism in New York if the St. John's program is
moving forward; do you clearly think with the young talent they have they
are?  
TOM CREAN: Oh, my God, absolutely, there's no question that they are. I think
if you ran a poll, not only in the BIG EAST, but around other coaches, Norm
Roberts has got tremendous respect out there, he really does. They do so many
good things. They really -- their zone offense, we knew early on we could not
give them a steady diet of zone tonight because they do so many things against
the zone, their man offense, their ability to drive, his abilities as a coach
to come out of time outs and get what he wants -- he's a great coach. I don't
know their staff as well but they are really developing, I'm sure they are
good as well. Mason a year ago was a real prospect because of his youth and
length. Now he's as legit as they come. You're going to say the same thing
about Calhoun in a year. Lawrence has gotten better under him. Obviously
Hamilton and Hill are doing excellent things before the injuries and I'm
probably forgetting somebody. Patterson guards, Larry Wright comes in and
makes plays. He's made Larry Wright a ton better than what he was in high
school because we had a chance to see him a little bit. I think their program
is in great shape.  
  
Q. There's almost no rest, another game tomorrow, what do you have to do
against a tough opponent tomorrow?  
TOM CREAN: Well, you know, I think it's good for both teams that we just
played. It makes the preparation and the retention of that preparation that
much easier because we just went through it.  
So what we'll do is really focus on our rest. I'm glad we're playing late at
night. I think it's -- I love it, the Garden, there's nothing like it. And for
these guys to be in this Thursday night game is fantastic.  
We know they are good and they have been great games every one of them, the
four we have played with them. We have a lot of respect for what they do, how
hard they play defensively, their execution offensively. They have got,
certainly, in Aaron Gray, one of the most legitimate post-up players in all of
America. There again, they are far from a one-man team. They go nine-deep and
know exactly what they are doing. But that's what's so great about this
league.  
  
Q. (On Jerel McNeal's injury)?  
TOM CREAN: It's still on a day-to-day. If you went and asked him, he would be
planning to play tomorrow night. We are evaluating that every day.  
  
Q. Why have you guys had more success than most teams in the BIG EAST
against Pitt, do you think?  
TOM CREAN: I don't know. They have been great games all the way across the
board. I mean, every game has been outstanding, and come down to the wire.  
You know, we've just been fortunate I guess at the end of the games, but we
have a lot of respect for them, and it's hard to play somebody three times,
but our guys are more excited about being in the Thursday night game than
anything. And to know Pittsburgh is going to be there, we know we've done
something good, because Pittsburgh is an outstanding team.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2007

  

### [Jim Calhoun](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13682)

### [Jerome Dyson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16951)

### [A.J. Price](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16952)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
JIM CALHOUN: I thought that we started off the game exactly the way we wanted
to and had not done for quite frankly some time and that's by running. We got
our running, we got our legs, we got up and down the court very well. We
executed okay on offense, shot 46 percent. Okay on the boards, and not bad
defensively.  
Second half, we allowed a couple situations to dissuade us. We turned the ball
over sometimes, went to the hole a couple of times and let situations dissuade
us from staying the course, because there's nothing we can do about that and
just got to keep playing. When bad things happen to you by incompetent people
and they do happen to you at times. And as that built, we became a little more
frustrated. And then I thought Nichols just really took the game over and had
some killers. The three in the corner, we're down ten and he makes a three,
and mysteriously because there's no contact underneath all day, it was a
holding foul because there was a little contact on the boards and that becomes
a five-point play, and once we get down 15, it's just too much for us to
overcome.  
Syracuse was a better team than us, they beat us two-out-of-three this year,
and certainly we'll go home and practice on Friday and just hope that we get
an opportunity to play again.  
  
Q. Can you talk about situations dissuading the kids, coming out in the
second half, you played so well, you turned the ball over on the first two
possessions, is that something that's mentally -- inaudible?  
JIM CALHOUN: That's getting into situations I'm not going to get into. The guy
goes to the hoop and gets knocked down, I don't know what you do with that,
and that happened two or three times. I think that somewhere along the line,
you've got to play through that. That's the key. You don't turn the ball over,
maybe it leads to a basket or two, maybe you get down four. But you can't make
that four into ten because things are not going your way. You've got to play
through that. It's that kind of situation -- yeah, I thought the opening three
or four minutes of the second half was caused by us and other factors.  
  
Q. For those of us who don't see you much during the season, after all of
the success you've had the last few years, how easy or hard is it?  
JIM CALHOUN: Last year we sat here at, whatever the heck we were at the time,
25-3, and I was concerned about the kids and if we could win a National
Championship. I'm sitting here today at 17-14, hoping that we get to the NIT.
To me if I like the kids and they work hard, I am disappointed and they are
disappointed I'm sure, that we have not come along.  
We have nine first-year players, and everyone says they are young; we are
young. Everybody says they are young. Nine first-year players and then Jeff
Adrian, we don't have anybody who started a basketball game for us and we have
no juniors and no seniors on our basketball team, and that was a concern of
mine. I thought we could overcome it with athleticism but we ended up being a
-- a reporter asked me a question early: "Do you think you'll be able to shoot
the ball well enough?" And he was right. We don't shoot the ball well enough,
except for Jerome right now, and our youth shows. Our youth shows because we
don't know how to handle adversity at times.  
When you get into this, if you're only getting into it for the great moments,
then you're into it for the wrong reasons. I fully expect that a lot of these
kids will mature and be handling some physical play as Syracuse, what their
seniors did to us in the last ten minutes of the game.  
Once again, we coach because we coach. We coach to win. We are disappointed we
lost. We are disappointed in the season. But, you know, 17-14 is not what we
want, but honestly, you know, when we lost to Syracuse last year, I can't tell
you that I felt any less or more disappointment. You might say, well, you knew
where you were going afterwards. Yeah, well, we knew that if we didn't win a
National Championship, people would be disappointed. Either way, I would
rather be at that end and I expect, Connecticut expects to be back at that
end, and we will be.  
  
Q. This game had an almost semi-final or final BIG EAST atmosphere to it.
Were you coaching that way? You and Jim are friends.  
JIM CALHOUN: Well, I think it was a very competitive game and I really thought
there was one situation that got involved with the game that kind of took the
game and allowed it, and then Nichols took over, so there's two things;
something that got in the way early that I think kind of hurt the game. Let
the kids play and all of the sudden there's just some things that bothered me.
And then Nichols took the game over and put the game away.  
I would agree that the tenacity right up to two minutes to go, we get it back
to ten, yeah, there was BIG EAST tenacity and, you know, talk about the NIT,
I'm not politicking for it. If we don't go, we don't go.  
  
Q. Were the officials --  
JIM CALHOUN: I'm not talking about the officials. I'm not talking about the
officials. I said situation. Situation usually denotes single individual who I
think helped screwed the game up, yeah.  
By the way, you've got to adjust to that and understand that. If I agree or
disagree, I'm coming from a very objective standpoint. So what I say has to be
tainted a lot by the fact that I'm rooting for the guys in blue. But I thought
there was a particular point where a couple of things looked unusual to me,
okay, and they were not done by malice. They were done by -- well, they were
just done, or not done.  
But we have to overcome those. And then allowed Nichols to go out for 28
points.  
  
Q. The offense over the last few weeks, is that one of the better first
halves?  
JIM CALHOUN: We ran. First time we have run -- you could probably tell me
better -- you have to put chronologies of this stuff. I think that's the best
time we've run since I can't tell you when, maybe the last time against St.
John's. I can't think of the last time we ran that effectively. If we had
converted a couple more plays, we were heading towards 40, 45 -- we were
struggling to score -- (loud sound of pipes falling in Garden) that sounds
like the first five minutes of us dropping the ball. The sound of turnovers, I
guess. It's going to follow me all year, turnovers.  
  
Q. You guys have had a lot of comebacks this year, how hard is it mentally
to be in a tight game for a long stretch if you are not really used to that?  
A.J. PRICE: It's not that tough. It's what you ask for as a player and
competitor. Being in close games at this kind of a level. We were playing our
butts off and we had our chances to win and we just didn't execute. We didn't
finish off plays towards the end of the second half.  
  
Q. Jerome, you had a tough time feeding the ball down and Thabeet was
getting frustrated; what do you tell a player like him that is young and has
size, what do you tell him after a game like this?  
JEROME DYSON: He knows he's a good athlete and he can play. It's not really,
you can say something but just come out and play the next game as best as you
can. We tried to get the ball into him as much as we could, and they extended
their zone so it was kind of tough. Jeff was flashing and most of the time we
were trying to get it to Jeff at the top and get it to Hasheem.  
JIM CALHOUN: I think your question would be much more to get the ball to Jeff,
who was 3-for-12. I think Hasheem quite frankly had the ball go through his
hands. He tried to finesse shots up there and was not dunking the ball. He was
one step behind the defense the entire night.  
He's a terrific prospect and that's what he is right now, he's a prospect
playing in a game where prospects are not allowed -- no prospects allowed. You
have to bring your game, and he's got game, but he can't bring it every single
night, nor is he refined enough yet to be able to cause damage. He has caused
damage in certain games but he still has a way to go. The end of that is going
to be great. It's just that's going to take time.  
  
Q. You have the potential to be one of the top teams in the country next
season; are you guys going to work out together?  
JEROME DYSON: I think we've just got to get our teammates involved more in the
beginning of the game just to get everybody going I think. I think that's what
we did today and we just could not -- in the second half, we just couldn't get
it back up and going. We missed shots but we just couldn't get stops.  
I think if we come back and we just get motivated to play full 40-minute
games, we shouldn't have any problem with that.  
  
Q. Jerome, the shots you took in the first half were not there in the second
half, is that because Syracuse extended or matched up with you? What
happened?  
JEROME DYSON: They played better defense in the second half. I really was not
trying to go out and force anything. I just tried to left the shots come to me
and they just played disk defense.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2007

  

### [Draelon Burns](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16944)

### [Sammy Mejia](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16945)

### [Jerry Wainwright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16943)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
JERRY WAINWRIGHT: I certainly would like to congratulate Coach Wright and his
kids. He runs a classy program and they have done an awful lot in the last
couple of years to promote and enhance the image of the BIG EAST as well as
being one of the best teams in the country. So I wish him nothing but the
best. I certainly think they will represent our league in the NCAAs and I
thought they really responded today when they needed to, and obviously did an
exceptional job of shooting the basketball.  
  
Q. You were worried about the start, slow start in both halves but you kind
of survived that. Was it just not getting enough there, not getting that
stop?  
JERRY WAINWRIGHT: I mean, you saw the game, so they made four shots; we missed
four, both times.  
I think we had makeable shots in those four shots we missed. I know we
definitely had two point-blank shots. We had a lane shot. So we come up empty
and it's tough to spot teams points, no question.  
But I thought we responded. It takes energy to come back, and we were in a
position I thought to begin the second half -- they made two great plays, but
again we missed two shots, and instead of being down eight. If you're down
four, you're hanging in there.  
So we just didn't -- can't fault the kids for shooting the ball. They hit good
shots. They just didn't make them.  
  
Q. Were you satisfied with the shot selection, like when you guys were
making that comeback?  
JERRY WAINWRIGHT: I think obviously we have a weakness, and the weakness is
shooting. We're last in the league in 3-point shooting, and we're second or
third -- I they we fought back, our kids did an excellent job, both of these
kids had some slumps earlier in the year at the free throw line. But you know,
somebody has got to shoot.  
I think what happens is we've been an equal opportunity offense; I think
that's the best way to learn how to play. We certainly had wide open shots at
the end of the second half, and the difference is, when we made a mistake and
Villanova had one, they made one. And it would be from somebody -- I thought
Redding made two shots late in the game and they were point-blank, but
somebody else contributed.  
Now we had three guys -- we had three guys in double figures. If we wound up
shooting fairly well -- three for 16; we're 24 for 60. I think sometimes we
settle for shots instead of really working for them, and that's something we
really have to work on in the off-season.  
  
Q. Right this minute, can you assess whether you think you will, A, get a
call from the NCAA; B, get a call from NIT; or that you're done playing for
the year?  
JERRY WAINWRIGHT: You know, I thought this was a game that would -- the
reality of it is our kids know it, and Villanova knew and Jay knew, certainly
the winner of this game was in a very good position to represent our league in
the NCAAs.  
First of all, you get a chance to play one of the best teams in our league
which is guaranteed going, and that can only help you.  
No, I don't think we're done playing. I certainly think based on all of the
figures, and we won nine games and we're in one of the toughest leagues in the
country. I would hope our season is not over. I know our guys would like to
keep playing.  
  
Q. Sammy, late in the game you were able to get to the hole with no problem.
Was that something you wanted to do in the first half?  
SAMMY MEJIA: I think a lot of that had to do with the situation in the game,
especially in the first half.  
You know, we really had our mind-set to doing certain things on both offense
and defense, and you know, we try to stick to the game plan as much as
possible and try to -- pretty much we tried not to do too much. We believed in
the coaching staff and everything they ran, we tried to execute to the best of
our abilities, and in the first half, you know, other guys were getting it
going, especially Draelon, so we just tried to feed off of them.  
I'm never going to be the type of guy to try to force the issue. If it's
there, I'm going to go for it and if it's not, I won't. So I think the first
half was kind of a situation we compare to the second half, the second half
towards the end of the game, they were spacing out some guys and trying to
prevent some guys from catching and shooting threes and took advantage of that
and made some baskets.  
  
Q. They really only had two or three guys scoring all the points; was it
just frustrating that it was so hard to stop those guys, especially
Reynolds?  
DRAELON BURNS: I think the reason why it was so hard, they got off to a good
start. I think -- made the first three. Once a person makes the first three
early in the game, they get their emotions really into it which makes them
feel good and I think that's probably the most part of it.  
  
Q. Sammy, the parade to the free throw line, the guys that keep making them,
what do you think when you keep seeing the same guy?  
SAMMY MEJIA: You always want the guy to miss the free throws, but coming into
the game you know what kind of free throw shooting team they are. You know if
you put a team like Villanova on the line, nine times out of ten they are
going to make them. Our biggest issue is to not let them get to the line. They
shot way too many free throws compared to us. We were half a step late on a
lot of loose balls and on trying to take charges and rebounding, and they took
advantage of that, as every good team will do.  
  
Q. Urgency has been something that you've tried to generate; did you feel it
was there today, or the slow start, was it just --  
SAMMY MEJIA: It definitely was there throughout most of the game. I don't
think it was there through the full 40 minutes of the game. The way they
started the first and the second half, you know, was the difference in the
game. You know, we gave up eight points in the first two minutes of the first
half and eight in the first two minutes of the second half and we ended up
losing by eight. You take away one of those runs and we go into overtime.  
At this point in the season we just have to make sure that we come out with a
sense of urgency from the beginning of the game, whether that means we have to
loosen up more or run harder, I don't know what it is. But somehow we have to
figure out a way to come up aggressive and match the other team's intensity,
because I think that was the difference in the game. You know, when you make
runs, you try make runs to increase leads, not to catch up and tie the game
up. You know, that's what we suffered from today. We made a lot of runs when
they were up double digits or they were up and we got to close. But to
outscore a team like Villanova who puts up a lot of shots, it's always a
difficult thing to do.  
JERRY WAINWRIGHT: I will say this, they were definitely ready to play. So our
guys, again, they make four baskets, we go four possessions; that's not going
to do with urgency, nothing to do with anything. You've got to make open shots
and we didn't make them. It's not a magic game. They were more efficient than
we were, they took advantage. Our kids did a great job, they were ready to
play.  
Also about 12 or 14 of those free throws came in the last two minutes when we
were fouling trying to get threes.  
So, again, God bless their kids, they did a great job shooting them and we did
a great job hanging. Just hope they miss one, we make a three. They are a good
team and they took advantage of situations.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2007

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Demetris Nichols](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13751)

### [Terrence Roberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13727)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
JIM BOEHEIM: I thought the difference in the game, the second half, we just
got better shots. We moved the ball better. We tightened up a little bit on
defense. We did an outstanding job on the boards. The first time we played,
they out-rebounded us by I think 16, and the last two we've done a better job
on the boards and I thought that was the difference.  
I thought Terrence and Mookie were much more aggressive in the second half.
But the difference was we got good shots. D got some really good looks in the
second half and he knocked them down.  
Connecticut is a very difficult team to play in the first round of this
tournament.  
  
Q. A little different feeling this year than last year, a little easier the
first game, instead of waiting to come down to the end?  
JIM BOEHEIM: This may have looked easy but it certainly wasn't. We didn't need
a miracle at the end of it, but we played better. We played really well. The
first 15 minutes of the second half, we played, you know, just like we've been
playing. We played well at the end of the year. We played really well at
Villanova the other day. The games we've won, we've played well. We've really
played good basketball the last part of the year.  
  
Q. Did you feel there was a sense of urgency to win this first round game to
get into the NCAA Tournament?  
JIM BOEHEIM: We want to win every game we play. The same urgency is there
every night we play.  
The NCAA Tournament isn't about winning one game. It never is, never has been.
It's what you do on the whole season. Shouldn't be about one game. We're
playing well. We finished 10-6 in the BIG EAST; no 10-6 team in the BIG EAST
has ever not got into the tournament. We are in fifth place, fifth place in
the league. How many teams are going to go from our league?  
  
Q. But non-conference?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Who cares? We're fifth place if the BIG EAST. We had the second
or third toughest schedule in the BIG EAST.  
  
Q. But --  
JIM BOEHEIM: But what? (Laughter).  
  
Q. You know the second half, the tendency, you guys went up by 11 points,
but there's a tendency to kind of slow your guards down, did you want to match
their intensity to just keep pulling ahead?  
JIM BOEHEIM: We did just what we wanted to do in the second half. We moved the
ball, we were patient, we set good screens, we got some inside and we got
Demetris open from the perimeter.  
  
Q. Talking about Demetris, at times during games, do you wait for him to get
on one of those runs?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Well, we have to get him open. In the first half he was pressing,
he just was taking hard shots. The second half, I don't know what he shot in
the second half, but the first half, he was what, two for eight?  
DEMETRIS NICHOLS: Terrible.  
JIM BOEHEIM: 2 for 7 (laughter). I was trying to help you out. 6 for 10 in the
second half.  
DEMETRIS NICHOLS: Yeah.  
  
Q. You were able to hold Jeff Adrian and Hasheem Thabeet to fairly poor
shooting nights. How confident are you now that the zone is starting to really
come back after the first couple of times?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Well, I think we've played -- we're first in the league in field
goal percentage defense for the 16 games we just played. That's pretty good.  
  
Q. How important is experience?  
JIM BOEHEIM: I really don't know. I really don't know the answer to that. I
think experience always helps. But if it was going to bother them, it would
have bothered them in the first half; it didn't seem to bother them.  
  
Q. It looked like Andy played a little tight; do you think he'll settle
down, do you think he'll be a little looser tomorrow against Notre Dame?  
JIM BOEHEIM: The end?  
  
Q. Andy.  
JIM BOEHEIM: Andy. Oh, Andy. (Laughter).  
I don't know. I think he rushed a couple shots. You know, he's coming off a
bad shooting game. He's lost a little bit of confidence probably.  
I think we've got to work harder to get him better looks I think, you know,
but Notre Dame kicked our butts at Syracuse. They are the only team -- I'm
proud of this team. We've been in every game we've played this year. We've had
chances to win every single game this year, late in the game, every single
game. Notre Dame is the only game -- and even that game we were 28 down and
got it back to ten. But they played extremely well against us in the first
half in Syracuse, and they were very impressive. I've been impressed with
their team all year long, and it's going to be a tremendous challenge for us
to come back tomorrow and play Notre Dame.  
  
Q. Eric's play in the first half when really nothing else was going
offensively?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Eric saved us in the first half. He's the only guy. But we
created -- these guys created some great openings for him by screening him and
getting him where he can get in the lane, and he's very good in the lane. He
was very good. I thought he was very good tonight the whole game. You know, he
didn't make, you know, bad turnovers. He usually throws in a couple of those.
But he was, I thought, very good tonight.  
  
Q. You mentioned early on the last time you played them they really handled
you guys on the boards.  
JIM BOEHEIM: The first time they did.  
  
Q. Did you have anything specific to say to them about that? Did you have
one of your guys put together some type of montage --  
JIM BOEHEIM: No, they knew. I don't believe in that stuff. We were much better
tonight and we also forced them into playing a small team because we're so
good getting perimeter guys open, they ended up playing a smaller team to try
to defend our three perimeter guys. The first game we were not playing the
three perimeter guys as much together. That forces the other team to go a
little bit smaller to guard -- you know when they hit a bigger guy in
Demetris, that's when he was coming off and getting the good looks.  
Forces them to be a little smaller. You know, again, the first time we played
in Connecticut, Mookie played eight minutes and he hit five fouls in eight
minutes. Without him in there, we're a different team.  
  
Q. Demetris, this game kind of had almost a semi-final or final-type
atmosphere to it. Were you guys playing out there with the intensity of it
being more than just a first-round game?  
DEMETRIS NICHOLS: Oh, yeah, you know, we don't want to lose. We know how
important this game was to us and we were the champ and we wanted to defend
our title.  
  
Q. Coming off the Villanova game, a rough shooting night, talk about how you
rebounded today?  
DEMETRIS NICHOLS: Just shows I can bounce back from a bad game. Guys have bad
games, you know, but it's -- I think it's how you react to it. I think we all
played well as a team.  
  
Q. Terrence, you've been watching this guy for four years now, when he has a
bad game as Villanova, are you just waiting for the run to come?  
TERRENCE ROBERTS: I'm pretty much waiting for it, but I know if he's not
getting off like he should be, you can either look at two things: It's either
him taking bad shots or me and Mookie not screening well to get him open. I
think we did a much better job in the second half of getting him wide open
looks and getting Andy wide open looks.  
  
Q. The makeup of this team, this is the first year that you really are the
go-to guy, so when did you develop the shooter's mentality, if you have a bad
first half, you're going to keep shooting, and Jim, how much did you have to
keep --  
JIM BOEHEIM: He knew right away that this year it had to be his team and he
had to take the shots and he's done it all year long. He has not hesitated.
He's tried to make the big plays in all of the games all year long.  
The Oklahoma State game was unbelievable. He made plays in that game that were
incredible I thought. But he's been there all year for us.  
The big guys are doing a tremendous job. It's not that pretty to just screen
and try to get people open. It's not, you know, there's no stat line for that.
These big guys, Terrence and Mookie and Matt have done a great job of getting
those guys open.  
DEMETRIS NICHOLS: I think Coach answered that question. (Laughter).  
  
Q. What about the shooting - inaudible?  
DEMETRIS NICHOLS: I think I work on my game enough that, you know, guys are
not going to make all their shots. But I think if you have the confidence in
yourself, the next shot would go down, and that's what I continue to do.  
  
Q. I'm sure this isn't high on your list of priorities, but what did you
think of these new uniforms? (Laughter)  
JIM BOEHEIM: You know, I don't pay much attention to the uniforms.  
DEMETRIS NICHOLS: He doesn't care. He's been wearing the same thing for 30
years, he doesn't care. (Laughter).  
JIM BOEHEIM: I think I've actually seen this style once before a long time
ago. The players like them. They look good, I think. But I'm not really
involved with worrying about the uniforms too much. (Laughing)

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2007

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Alex Ruoff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16966)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
JOHN BEILEN: These guys all next to me and the other guys, we've got several
kids back in Morgantown that didn't travel with us because they were
redshirting or -- they are redshirting or injured. We're all thrilled to be
able to come in here on this stage and go out and play the game that we did.
We had very few mental lapses in the game, and we were just -- I'm really
proud of the way we've performed.  
Providence fought, got out on us and then fought back valiantly. We came back
and hit a big shot, and from then on gained our confidence. When we shoot like
that, we're a tough out.  
  
Q. You said you want to play 212 degrees a lot, that's your motto, do you
play a little hotter than that at times? Does that get you in trouble early
on?  
JOHN BEILEN: You know, I think a couple of times that we rushed -- I see we
only had nine turnovers, but we had a couple of them. If we're going to make
mistakes, we want to make those mistakes of co-ommission (ph) here. We want to
attack. We felt that we attacked by the 3 ball most all the time in
Providence, and we didn't attack off the dribble or really run.  
So if we were going down tonight, it was going to go down where we were in an
attack mentality, not necessarily that we shot ten less threes, but our shot
selection was better. But defensively, and they are so quick and they get in
the seam so much -- and look at their percentage. They were 10 for 16. The
freshmen, he walks into Madison Square Garden here and he makes his first four
or five shots, he's an incredible player, Williams. We didn't face him the
first time.  
  
Q. You brought up the last time you faced the Friars, tonight you make a
tournament record 17 of 31, 54 percent, and then towards the second half you
guys started working the ball down a little more. Was it important for you
guys to make sure that you could make the threes and rely on that game before
you worked on the inside?  
JOHN BEILEN: Well, they ended up going man. That was the big difference. They
were playing zone the entire time so we had one approach against the zone and
one approach if they played man, depending on how they guard us.  
We basically just tried to hit the open man. We don't go in and say, hey, we
are going to pound it inside or we are going to jack threes. We are going to
come into a game and take what they give us and adjust throughout the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the job Eric has done distributing the ball to get
your offense flowing?  
ALEX RUOFF: We cannot say enough about him, he is by far one best point guards
in the country. There's things that he does that doesn't come out on papers,
defensively and offensively. Like I said before, he's one of the best point
guards in the country and I'm honored to play with him.  
  
Q. The inevitable NCAA question, do you feel like --  
JOHN BEILEN: No, I think the best idea for everybody in the country is just
try and keep winning. The NCAA -- I know the NCAA selection committee just
does a terrific job, but we just need to keep winning and not worry about any
of that.  
  
Q. There's always talk about moving the 3-point line back. This may not be
the best moment but what do you think of that issue?  
JOHN BEILEN: You know, I'm one of the few BIG EAST coaches that agree it's
fine where it is right now actually.  
I just raise, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. We just really, both us and
college basketball, look at all of the kids that have gone pro. Look at the
changes in the conferences. You know, the March Madness has not cooled off at
all.  
If it's ever changed some day, who knows. We'll adjust if it changes. We'll
adjust. Actually we've played a couple of exhibition games where our kids
didn't know the difference. He shoots it from so far out, he doesn't care,
anyhow. (Laughter).  
  
Q. You got a lot of valuable minutes from Smith, can you talk about him?  
JOHN BEILEN: Yeah, I mentioned on the television broadcast that he was like
Frank Young. Two years ago when Frank came in here and lit this place up, I
turned to everybody and said, "Who is the coach that has not been playing
Frank Young?" And I said the same thing about Wellington today. That was quite
a performance for a kid from New Jersey, to come in here off the bench when we
are in foul trouble and play the way that he ended up playing.  
He's been patient all year and has had a great attitude all year, he was one
of the key players tonight.  
  
Q. Coming out of the time-out, can you talk about that as a turning point?  
JOHN BEILEN: The big thing is all of a sudden, we got -- we had a few mental
lapses. We had several at Providence, and we sort of morphed back to that time
where we just became unglued. So we came out of the time-out. I just called
the simplest of our plays for us thinking they might pass it and get something
and Nichols just knocked down a three and the momentum just changed. I don't
know if we got a stop at the other end but next thing you know, now we're
getting another one and now we're getting a layup.  
He is the leader right now without question on the team but this guy, same
thing, waited a couple of years, now he's playing. He doesn't say much.
Everybody knows, he's in charge when he has the ball.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about, you guys are going to enjoy this tonight I'm
sure but you have to get right back at it tomorrow.  
JOHN BEILEN: In 20 hours or so that we are back playing again. When Frank and
Darris were freshmen and sophomores, we got it all the way to Saturday night
one time. But I thought Thursday night and Thursday was a great day in New
York, you know, where all of the teams, you're down to eight teams and I think
it's one of the best nights here is the Thursday night game and we are just
honored to be playing them and Louisville.  
  
Q. Was that as good as you've played offensively?  
JOHN BEILEN: I think so. We've had our moments this year where we were
extremely efficient and we've had several moments or several teams, games,
that we just, you know, we just got young guys and somebody would throw us
off, just one guy, and then you know, we would be out there and shot clock --
in shot clock limbo and trying to figure out what we're doing.  
We really did a great job tonight, and I'm sure that Louisville will -- you
know, they were able to see everything and do everything and we'll have a
great plan for that.  
  
Q. Can you talk specifically what you think you have to do to beat
Louisville; obviously they are a team with a lot of offense.  
JOHN BEILEN: I can't speak -- we didn't play them this year. I really pride
myself on preparing for everybody. We prepared for Providence. My scouts have
seen them. My assistant coaches have seen them several times on that and they
have been watching them. I'm going to start in a couple of hours is what I'm
going to end up doing.  
We have played Louisville before. I think they still have some of the guys
that we played in the NCAA Tournament. I just think it was a wonderful,
wonderful season. Our guys will bounce back but Louisville was obviously a
better team than us during the year.  
  
Q. Could you sense any extra effort coming from Frank tonight, a senior in a
situation like this?  
JOHN BEILEN: Those first few rebounds that he got, where, you know, he's not
-- he will dispute this, but he's not our most athletic guy. (Laughter) and he
was our most athletic guy on several rebounds early in that game.  
As I say, he's been the leader from the day that those -- that we talked out
of Atlanta last year after Texas hit that shot, he became the captain, and
he's just done a terrific job doing all of those little things we need to do,
like hustling.  
  
Q. Two years ago in the NCAA Tournament against Louisville, a great game. In
football, West Virginia always play Louisville tough; is that a big-time
rivalry?  
JOHN BEILEN: I think our fans both travel well. Both sports are very
important. You know, you have some schools are basketball schools or football
schools. I think Louisville and West Virginia are very similar in that both of
them are contending nationally.  
It's an honor to be playing against them and especially in the BIG EAST
tournament.

# [BIG TEN COFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+COFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2007

  

### [Bo Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17045)

### [Kammron Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17048)

### [Alando Tucker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17047)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Coach Ryan, please.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Ohio State's defense and where they were
most effective, how they limited you?  
COACH BO RYAN: In the first half we just didn't get the ball. We were a half
step behind, a half click behind on pass and catch. We had 12 turnovers,
that's 12 shots you don't get. That's opportunities where the ball can never
go in, where you can't get an offensive rebound. That's way too many. You end
up paying for it eventually, even though we fought back. We got back right in
the second half.  
On the boards, a lot of hustle things we did okay on. On the glass, just on
the shooting, that's why I took Alando (Tucker) out of the game at the end.
Everything was really flat. At that point just get him some rest. He works so
hard all the time. Three straight games like that is pretty tough on a guy
that does all the things that he does.  
  
Q. Was this as tough a defensive team as you have played all season, or was
Ohio State as tough defensively tonight?  
COACH BO RYAN: Yeah, they always have been. There are certain things that they
can do, knowing that (Greg) Oden is back there taking care of the rest. But
Oden, he still moves pretty well for a big, so it's not like he just waits in
the paint for people to come. But you notice how tough it was getting the easy
ones. Even when we thought we had one when (Joe) Krabbenhoft got that ball and
put it up. Most people thought it was a goal tend. I can never tell until I
took at a tape.  
Oden got that one. The thing about Greg is he can play real well defensively
on the floor. He doesn't have to spend his time up in the air, and (Mike)
Conley is so good with the ball on the floor because most of the game of
basketball is played on the floor. They played the floor game better than we
did.  
  
Q. What would you say the turning point of the game was, maybe that three-
pointer with the shot clock going down that Butler hit there?  
COACH BO RYAN: Well, you can't say that. I mean, obviously it's a tough one.
Michigan State hit one like that in the first half, too, when we played at
Michigan State. We ended up losing that game. Do you say that's the turning
point? I don't think so. It was a culmination of 40 minutes of them making
more plays and making a few more shots than we did.  
If you're playing behind like that, it's very difficult to get to the free-
throw line, and that's a game that we usually like to play. But when you're
playing from behind, you don't usually get that many opportunities.  
  
Q. Alando, Bo was talking a little bit about Ohio State's defense. Can you
talk a little bit about what it was like out there going up against those guys
on the defensive end, when you guys had the ball going against Ohio State's
defense?  
ALANDO TUCKER: It was one of those things. Early we didn't get a rhythm. We
didn't establish a rhythm. A couple turnovers. On the first ten possessions we
had like six or seven turnovers, and it's hard to establish a rhythm. That's
usually one of the things we're good at, establishing that rhythm.  
They were tough defensively. They were throwing different match-ups, different
zones, identifying with guys pretty well. It was tough. They played tough.
Like Coach said, they have Oden in the back, so the guards are able to push up
a little more on our guards.  
  
Q. They needed a last-second shot to beat you guys at their place the last
week of the season. I'm just wondering from what you've seen of them this
weekend if they look any different or if they look like they're playing any
differently than they were a couple weeks ago?  
COACH BO RYAN: It's tough to answer that because you don't have your two days
to prepare or three days. You do your thing, it's not -- I can't really say. I
thought they played pretty well. I thought their energy was there and they
were doing some things. Except for that one spurt, it looked like they caught
a little bit of a lull and we caught fire some. But when you don't have those
couple days to prepare and get into things, it's a little different then.  
And I think what happened was the quickness of Conley with the ball and Oden
being such a presence inside, there's two pretty big factors of why things
turned out the way they did.  
  
Q. Can you tell us what Steimsma and Bohannon gave you today?  
COACH BO RYAN: Well, we went out there and played tough. Jason struggled with
a couple decisions in the first half, but he's a guy that can score, he's a
guy that can create scoring for other people. Steimsma is a guy that likes to
compete. There were times where he felt he got a bad shake and he's got to
learn to play through that and be stoic and tough and just keep playing.  
He got his dandruff up a little bit there and was pretty active, and those are
the things that he can do maybe if given a chance.  
It's tough sometimes for big guys. You know, everything they do doesn't look
as fluid maybe as some other guys. I'm sure some of the looks on Oden's face
when he was called for fouls and when Greg was called, it looked like a
surprise, but you have to just kind of play through that, and Greg did a good
job. He was active. I like the fact that he came to mix it up a little bit.  
  
Q. Do you feel that Wisconsin is still deserving of a No. 1 seed, and is
this perhaps the best two teams the Big Ten have ever sent to the NCAA?  
COACH BO RYAN: Well, I'm sure Tuck will tell you the same thing we've been
saying about seeds, but go ahead.  
ALANDO TUCKER: That's not on our mind. We're not focused about that. Right now
we're glad that we're going to be playing, and that's the main thing. We're
glad that we have another game to make up for tonight, so we're just going to
see where they put us. Wherever they put us, we have to be prepared to face
our next opponent.  
Q. And Bo, are these the two top teams?  
COACH BO RYAN: Well, you take the regular season, who were the two top teams?
Who were the two teams that survived the Big Ten Tournament to get to the
finals? I'll let you guys say who the two best teams were.  
  
Q. No, I'm talking about all the years you've been associated with the Big
Ten, those two tops, can you remember a better tandem, top tandem, that's
going into the tournament?  
COACH BO RYAN: I'm trying to remember who we played last week (laughter), and
you're going to have me think of two top tens? I can't think of that right
now. I really can't give you a well thought out answer, that's for sure.  
  
Q. For Kam and Alando, six free throw attempts, against Ohio State where you
struggled to get to the line, what are they doing defensively that's not
allowing you to get those free throws?  
ALANDO TUCKER: It was one of those things that Coach mentioned earlier, for
most of the game we were trying to play from behind, so it was kind of hard on
a lot of the looks. We were taking a lot of jump shots for the most part
because that's what was available. That's what was open at the time. We were
still trying to work on establishing an inside presence, but it's one of those
things. It's tough playing a team like that from behind.  
Q. If Ohio State was able to play at a faster pace than they were able to play
in the previous two games against you guys and how much you think that might
have helped them today that they were able to play faster.  
KAMMRON TAYLOR: Well, they have a lot of athletes on that team and they like
to get up and down. I think the first two times that we played them we kind of
controlled that, and we let it get away from us. Today we allowed them to get
out and get on a break and it caught up with us.  
COACH BO RYAN: It was the turnovers that gave them more possessions. If you're
turning the ball over the way we were, they're going to get more possessions
and quicker possessions because that just leads to something at the other end.  
Once we played five on five, I thought our half court defense was pretty good
for the most part. It was a lot of some bad decisions.  
  
Q. Just from this weekend, what do you think you guys gained from this that
you can take into the tournament?  
KAMMRON TAYLOR: Well, I think besides the game today, I think we did a pretty
good job defensively, and we did a better job in our first two games of just
taking care of the ball. When we do a good job of taking care of the ball, we
put ourselves in good positions to win the game.  
Besides the game today, I feel overall our decision-making got a lot better.
But it got away from us today.  
COACH BO RYAN: That's pretty much stating the obvious. You can't give teams
those opportunities. I mean, all the energy it took for us to get back there
those couple times, how many times can you do that? How many times can you
dig? The best thing to do is to not get into that hole. We had the lead at our
place, and then at their place we stayed within striking distance or had a
slight lead. You keep beating a dead horse, though. It's take care of the
ball, you don't put yourself in that position. Pretty simple.  
  
Q. Going along with the pace of the game question, can you talk about the
night Conley had, 18 points, 10 assists. How big was he in setting the tone
for Ohio State?  
KAMMRON TAYLOR: Well, he's the key to the team. He runs the show. He did a
great job of doing that tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll finish up with any remaining questions for Coach Ryan.  
  
Q. You've mentioned the turnovers a few times and decision-making. Was that
the root of most of the turnovers or was there something else, too, maybe the
way they were playing or some other things?  
COACH BO RYAN: Well, I always thought that if I made a bad pass, I didn't make
a good decision because I always take ownership. You'd have to ask the players
if it was just a bad decision.  
  
Q. What's the chance of Butch joining you all in the tournament?  
COACH BO RYAN: I don't know. He's rehabbing, though. They worked him down
here. So we'll see.  
  
Q. You can't say 50/50 or anything?  
COACH BO RYAN: I can't. I think it's illegal for me to say that.  
  
Q. Are you serious?  
COACH BO RYAN: Yeah. We just had a videotape on wagering that all the players
and everybody had to see and sign the form, and you're getting me into this
50/50 stuff. We're hoping. We're hoping that something good can happen.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Bo.

# [BIG TEN COFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+COFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2007

  

### [Mike Conley, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17065)

### [Ron Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17028)

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Mike or Ron, please.  
  
Q. Mike, now that you know who you're playing, what do you think about that
opponent and the fact that you'll be in Lexington, which isn't too far from
where you live?  
MIKE CONLEY JR.: Well, they made it to the tournament for a reason. They're a
good team. Coach has been scouting them pretty well. I know we're looking
forward to getting down to Lexington because it's pretty close to home and
looking to see a lot of fans out there.  
RON LEWIS: Yeah, the same what Mike said. Our coaches have been scouting every
team. They made it to the tournament, we know they're going to be a tough
opponent because they are in the 65. We're just going to be ready to play.  
  
Q. To Ron and Mike, can you both talk about winning this tournament and how
you think that experience might help you going forward into the NCAA
Tournament?  
RON LEWIS: I think it helps us with our confidence, and I think it helps us
with growing as a team. As you can see, in those three games we relied on each
other, we played team basketball, and we took the negatives that teams had and
made them into positives for us.  
  
Q. Mike, in terms of the game today, how big was it for you guys with Greg
only playing six minutes in the first half and not scoring and you were still
up six at the break? How big was that for you guys?  
MIKE CONLEY JR.: It was really big. We were just trying to keep it close
without him in the game. A lot of things are a lot harder because he takes up
so much space down low and we rely on him for a lot of things. I think a lot
of us stepped up in that first half.  
The seniors played great. The bench really came into play with Greg out of the
game. Matt Terwilliger played great, did his thing, got rebounds, and Othello
did his thing, as well.  
  
Q. How much of a factor in this game do you think was the fact that it
looked that you were able to impose a faster pace, on this game today more so
than you had in the two games before against Wisconsin, and I wondered how
much of that was a factor in how the game turned out.  
RON LEWIS: I think it was a factor. We got a lot of rest, rested our bodies
and our legs. So it was a major factor. Plus we were in zone, so it gave us a
lot of rest, as well, to run on the offensive end.  
MIKE CONLEY JR.: Yeah, that definitely helped us out. They're a great
rebounding team, and we felt if we could get rebounds and turnovers, I think
it turned into fast break points and rebound opportunities, and I think we
took advantage of that early and we just never let up.  
  
Q. It is said that offense wins games, defense wins championships. You were
definitely impressive the first half the way you held them with Greg out. Do
you think this kind of performance pronounces that you are defense-ready for
tournament play?  
MIKE CONLEY JR.: Yeah, I think it was a statement. Three games in three days
is a tough thing to do, and for our guys to come out and play defense for 40
minutes, even with Greg out of the game, and to stay in defensive stance and
do those little things that helps the team win, that goes to show how far
we've come as a team.  
  
Q. For either of you guys, you mentioned three games in three days. Now in a
Thursday-Saturday regional. What's the key here? I imagine getting rest
because it's going to be kind of a quick turnaround. How do you handle this
now?  
RON LEWIS: Just like you said, just to get rest. Our focus is on the
tournament. After we go home, finish our finals, we'll be on spring break, so
the main thing for us is just to get rest and focus on the tournament.  
  
Q. I'm just curious for both of you guys, how did you rank your goals
through the season; the conference championship, the Big Ten Tournament
Championship, the NCAA Championship, did you talk about that during the season
and how did that rank?  
RON LEWIS: We ranked it like you said, conference championship, Big Ten
Tournament, and then going into the NCAA Tournament and doing well in that.  
  
Q. In that order?  
RON LEWIS: Yep.  
  
Q. Mike, there was talk amongst you guys yesterday about the importance of
getting the overall No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, and obviously the way
it looked on CBS was that they put Florida and North Carolina ahead of you
guys. Number one, why do you think they did that, and number two, is maybe a
little motivation from that not such a bad thing going into the tournament?  
MIKE CONLEY JR.: You know, Florida and North Carolina are both great teams,
and they're deserving of the position they got. We're just playing each game
as that game. We're not worried about what's ahead of us and focusing on
seeding and who we play next. It's just one game at a time.  
We're not worried about getting that No. 1 overall seeding. We're fine with
where we're at right now, and we're just looking forward to getting into the
tournament.  
  
Q. So much was said about you being so young. Did you surprise yourself, the
things you were able to achieve with so much youth on the team?  
MIKE CONLEY JR.: I think a little bit. You know, I didn't come in with as much
confidence as Coach and the staff had on us as freshmen as being so young.
They had a game plan laid out for us, what we were going to do. I'm just
sitting there listening to every word he says, all right, we're going to do
it, and then finally we're getting into the season and we're actually
achieving some of these goals. Now we have the utmost confidence in ourselves
to do what we've got to do to make a run in this tournament.  
  
Q. Mike and Ron, you've been through this conference one and a half, almost
two times. What are your thoughts on five other teams from the conference
after playing all these teams, five other teams from the conference, making it
to the NCAAs?  
RON LEWIS: I think it's great. I think it's great for our conference. It shows
that we have a good conference and that we're still building.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll finish up and go ahead with questions for Coach Matta.  
  
Q. The same question that Mike answered earlier. They did see the No. 1s and
they had you technically No. 3. Was there any surprise to that?  
COACH THAD MATTA: Not really. I don't know how it works. So wherever they put
us, like these guys said, we'll play whoever. I think it's exciting. We were a
two seed last year, now a one seed this year. I think that hopefully says a
lot about our program and where it's come in three years.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about how the question I asked Mike about being
able to force the pace more so in this game, what were you able to do in that
zone to cause the turnovers that forced the pace?  
COACH THAD MATTA: Well, I think a couple things happened. Number one,
Wisconsin was a little bit flat on their shots today and it caused some long
rebounds. I thought that we did a better job. The challenge was to be more
active in the zone, get a hand up.  
We knew that Tucker and Taylor were going to try to take the majority of their
shots, Bohannon was going to catch and shoot. The big thing was the activity
we could create to force them out a little bit farther. And from there we
picked up a couple rebounds, got an advance pass, and it really seemed to get
the pace going for us.  
The other thing I think is we got our hands on a lot of balls deflection-wise,
and that led to advance passes and easy opportunities.  
  
Q. Two things. One, how do you handle with finals and everything and having
played here, a Thursday-Saturday in Lexington, and two, how far ahead in the
brackets do you look, because there's a potentially interesting second game
involving you?  
COACH THAD MATTA: Well, I think in regards to how we handle it, honestly, I
would love to get these guys on a plane to get home immediately because they
do have tests. We've been studying up here each day that we've been here.
We've got our people with us to help the guys. It is a quick turnaround. When
you play the last game and now you're playing on Thursday in Lexington, which
is close. With the potential second match-up we've got to take care of our
first game as they do, and we'll kind of see. It's a little bit ironic, though
and I think Bruce (Weber) is in the same situation and (Marquette head coach)
Tom Crean and Michigan State. There was somebody else in there and we were
laughing about it. It's part of it.  
  
Q. You needed a last second shot to beat these guys at your place in the
last week of the regular season and now you beat them by 20 with Greg
essentially available for a half, do you feel that in these past few days that
you're pretty much peaking and playing your best heading into the NCAA
Tournament?  
COACH THAD MATTA: I hope we are. I think that we're doing some things very
well right now. I think we're getting a better feel.  
The thing I'm most excited about and I think one of the big differences today
was our bench. I've said all year long I think we've got nine starters, and
one of the things we dwelled on last night in the team meeting was how many
minutes their guys were playing to how many minutes we had played in two
games. Was it psychological warfare? Yeah, maybe it was, but we wanted our
guys to understand that everybody has been contributing and we've been able to
give guys rest, and I think that was good for us.  
  
Q. Curious about your thoughts on five other teams from your conference
making it.  
COACH THAD MATTA: I think it's phenomenal. I think as you go through a Big Ten
season, it's amazing what it takes to win in this conference. Honestly, that's
why I'm so proud of what our guys have been able to do this year. There's
great players, there's great coaches, and for six of us to be in out of 11, I
couldn't be happier for the league. I think it's just another statement of why
the Big Ten is the Big Ten.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about why Greg only played the six minutes in the first
half?  
COACH THAD MATTA: Foul trouble. We had the lead, they cut into it but they
never got it over the hump. I thought those guys were doing a pretty good job
without him.  
  
Q. Did you foresee a No. 1 seed right off the bat when you brought in this
great recruiting class with all these freshmen?  
COACH THAD MATTA: No (laughing). As I said yesterday, I really didn't know
what to expect. I thought that we could have a really good basketball team. To
be sitting at 30-3 and have won 17 straight games and two of our losses are to
No. 1 seeds that were ahead of us, one was without Greg Oden, the other he had
been playing for three weeks, the other one was at Wisconsin, I'm pretty
excited with where we are today.  
  
Q. Obviously Greg didn't play a lot of minutes in the first half because of
the foul trouble you mentioned. But can you just talk about him still ending
up with a double-double basically all done in the second half? And also if you
could comment on how your kids take experience from winning this tournament
into the next one.  
COACH THAD MATTA: Well, I think with Greg (Oden) it shows the player that he
is, and I had to get on Greg's rear end in one of the timeouts. I didn't think
he was playing as hard as he could play, and really challenged him like I
haven't done before. He responded, which was good, and I'll put that in my
memory bank for when we play on Thursday.  
The second part of your question --  
  
Q. Taking the experience into the next tournament.  
COACH THAD MATTA: I think the one thing we've tried to do all year long is
learn from wins, from losses, from close games, from big wins, and really
build on it and try to exemplify through example of what we can learn from
this, and these guys, the thing I love about this team is they have been
phenomenal at listening and applying what we're trying to get done and how
we're trying to do it. I wish I was a great coach, but these guys have done a
tremendous job of listening and coming in every day and working hard.  
So I think that they see the benefits of playing because all we've talked
about all year long is playing our best basketball at the end of the year, and
hopefully we'll go along those stages.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. We appreciate your time.

# [BIG TEN COFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+COFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2007

  

### [Marcus Landry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17068)

### [Bo Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17045)

### [Kammron Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17048)

### [Alando Tucker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17047)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
COACH BO RYAN: Well, I know these guys need to get back and get some rest
because these have been two pretty tough physical games. I'll keep my remarks
short and say I'm happy we're playing in the championship game. This is good
stuff, being able to play the No. 1 team in the country and getting a chance
to get back on the floor. We're definitely excited about that.  
  
Q. At the under 16 time-out in the second half, Alando sat down for rest and
the rest of you guys scored seven straight with him on the bench, I think 10
of the next 12 overall. How important are stretches like that for you guys as
a team when you can produce when he's not on the floor?  
KAMMRON TAYLOR: I think it's very important. It gives the other guys on the
team confidence in themselves. When your best player is -- well, he wasn't
struggling, he just needed a break. He needed a rest. It was just good to see
that we had other guys step up and make plays for the team with our best
player on the bench.  
  
Q. Alando, can you talk about the job you guys did offensively, Warren
Carter 14 points but other than that no one else scored in double figures?  
ALANDO TUCKER: Well, they're a team that likes to work it in. As a team
they've been working it in more and not shooting threes. We knew if we
contained Shaun Pruitt for most of the game that we would force them to find
other ways to score. That was our plan coming in. That was a great team
defensive effort. That's what we have to keep looking forward to going down
the stretch.  
  
Q. Alando, you've now scored more points than any person to ever wear a
Wisconsin uniform. Can you just talk about that? And also, doing it in this
season with all the success you guys have had?  
ALANDO TUCKER: That's a great feat, a great accomplishment. It's one of those
things that the team has been so successful this year. It's one of those
things that it's helped me out, confidence-wise, the way everybody has been
playing. Our coaching staff keeps us on it, and it's been one of those things
where it happened unselfishly, and that's what -- in the manner we've been
doing it, we've been winning. It always feels good when you're successful, and
everything else comes. It seems like everything is falling in place. It's
great. It's great for the whole team.  
  
Q. Alando, can you talk about looking forward, if you are, to the rubber
match with Ohio State tomorrow? I'm sure there's so much on the line.  
ALANDO TUCKER: You have to look forward to it. As a player, a competitor, you
look forward to playing the best teams, and they're one of the better teams in
the nation. This is the third time we'll see them, and it's going to be a
tough game. There were two tough battles, one in Wisconsin and one in Ohio.
It's going to be a tough game. We're definitely looking forward to it. It's
the Big Ten championship game. I know the atmosphere is going to be tough.
We're prepared, though.  
  
Q. Marcus, in the first game Shaun Pruitt was the guy that gave you guys a
lot of trouble. Just can you talk about the strategy against him today?  
MARCUS LANDRY: Well, one of our biggest strategies was sticking to our rules
and trying to maintain him and get around him and in front of him, and it
worked out in our favor today.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the defensive effort and all the little things you
guys do, whether it's patience or what have you, to be successful?  
KAMMRON TAYLOR: I just think we work well together as a team. We have a lot of
good defenders on this team, and I just think we do a good job of moving our
feet. And at times when we're not moving our feet, that's when we get
ourselves in trouble. But for the most part, I think we do a pretty good job
of working as a whole.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, do you think regardless of what happens tomorrow
you've done enough to earn a No. 1 seed?  
ALANDO TUCKER: We're not really saying that we want a No. 1 seed right now. A
lot of teams get hurt doing that. Our focus is to win this game tomorrow, and
everything else will play itself out once we take care of business.  
We're not going out there and saying, okay, we're not going to lose this game,
and if we do lose it we've put ourselves in the position. We're going out
there with the idea that we're going to win this game, and that's the way we
approach every game. We can't get caught up in worrying about seeds because
then we'll lose focus on the task at hand.  
  
Q. You talked about after the Ohio State game that it kind of hurt how that
game ended. For you are you looking forward tomorrow to having another crack
at Ohio State?  
KAMMRON TAYLOR: (Laughing) I'm just happy to be in the championship game. It
is an added bonus that we get a chance to go against Ohio State again, but I
can't get caught up in stuff like that.  
  
Q. Kammron, you had ten points in a four-minute stretch during the second
half. Why offensively did things suddenly start to come together?  
KAMMRON TAYLOR: I was just making better decisions with the ball. I wasn't
trying to force things like I was in the first half and, you know, when shots
are going down, everything looks good. And when they're not, you know, that's
when things look bad. So I just tried to make a conscious effort at making
better decisions.  
  
Q. Alando, when you speak to the public, the media, you sound so much like a
coach. Where does that come from; just your leadership abilities?  
ALANDO TUCKER: This guy on the far left of us. I've been around him for five
years (laughter). I can't do anything but learn from him. I knew leaving here
I'd have to pick up something (laughter).  
COACH BO RYAN: I hope you picked up more than that (laughter).  
  
Q. For Marcus and Kammron, if you could describe what it's like to play with
not only a player with the special gifts of Alando Tucker all around but also
the special person he is, too?  
MARCUS LANDRY: Well, he's a wonderful person. I have the chance to be his
roommate and things like that so I see a lot of things that he does off the
court that maybe some other people don't see. He's a very talented person and
very caring. We hang out together and he's always making me laugh. Sometimes I
get down and miss my family and things like that, but Tuck is always there.
He's like a big brother. Just being around him and picking up some of the
things he does, he's a very great leader, and I'm just ready to follow in his
footsteps and get things done.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll finish up with questions for Coach Ryan, please.  
  
Q. Kind of what I asked Kammron and Marcus before about that second half
when Alando was on the bench and you guys wound up stretching out your lead at
that point. Can you put a level of importance on that? How important are those
kind of stretches when Alando is not on the floor and the other guys are
producing?  
COACH BO RYAN: All teams go through that when you have somebody that puts up
consistent numbers, and then you can maintain a lead or even gain in the lead.
That obviously says a lot about the team and gives them some confidence so
that if something happens where Alando goes down, has to come out, gets in
foul trouble, whatever, then guys always feel they can still play.  
Just like guys are trying to pick up for Brian Butch now. So it's basically
the same thing. Just because somebody goes to the bench -- a lot of times it's
mostly just for a rest, and to get refocused and be ready to go.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about your post defense and particularly the
job you guys did to get through it this time?  
COACH BO RYAN: Well, guys moved their feet, between Jason, Marcus and Greg. I
thought they did a pretty good job. There are still times where maybe on a
catch we could have worked our feet just a little bit better. I mean, we know
tomorrow night or tomorrow in the afternoon we're playing another guy that's
got a pretty good post presence. So we'll just go back and try to do the same
things tomorrow and keep working at it.  
But it's good whenever you have guys that are willing to commit to the work
ethic that it takes to guard the post against good post players. Pruitt is a
better player and has become a better player through I'm sure the coaching of
Bruce's staff and himself and the work ethic that Bruce has. So you'd better
be ready to keep him under control because he's been doing some really good
things because Illinois has played really well and Pruitt has been probably
the biggest reason for that.  
  
Q. What does it feel like for you for Alando to break the school's scoring
record, your player, the type of person he is and the win?  
COACH BO RYAN: I think it's really neat. I didn't even know. I haven't checked
numbers. Nobody told me any numbers. I don't read the numbers. I'm happy for
him. You know, I know what he's happy about. He's happy to be on the left-hand
side (the win column).  
Like in the summer when I'm riding the waves at Sea Isle City on the Jersey
Shore, right away, I'll come up for air, and I'll say, "boy, isn't that Tucker
something, he broke the scoring record?" That's usually when things dawn on
me, in the summer when I'm relaxed.  
But those kind of numbers I don't look at. But I'm happy for him.  
  
Q. What was the critical decisive segment today?  
COACH BO RYAN: In a game like this I don't know if you can say there is. But
just us getting some good looks and taking advantage of them, getting to the
free-throw line finally. We did not shoot a free throw in the first half
because we didn't attack the rim as much as I'd like to see, and we did a
better job of that in the second half.  
There weren't a lot of free-throw shots, but that's because both teams were
protecting the rim. There weren't a lot of opportunities to get to the rim to
get fouled. That was a good, physical game.  
  
Q. From your perspective when you watch your kids not only pull for one
another on the bench or make the right pass, be patient, play that kind of
defense, play in your team concept, from your perspective and your staff, is
that something that's satisfying in terms of the approach they're playing in
the game?  
COACH BO RYAN: What else would you do? I only know one way, so -- it's what
you're willing to accept in life, and as coaches, we're willing to accept only
certain things.  
So players learn that in a hurry and then they try to give it to us. I don't
think it's the other way around. "Hey, Coach, if I come to Wisconsin, can I
have 25 shots, can I shoot from the perimeter, can I do this, can I do that?"
We've probably lost some recruits because of that, because I say no.  
  
Q. I know you talked a little bit about your post defense, but a day after
holding Neitzel to 3-of-13 shooting you really shut down Illinois' guards. Can
you just talk about your guard defense?  
COACH BO RYAN: Our guys just work at it. The fact that Neitzel went 3 for 13,
as I looked at the film this morning -- I've got to learn to say DVD. When I
looked at the DVD (laughter) this morning, he had some looks. Sometimes a
player as good as Neitzel, he's going to go on some streaks. We just happened
to catch one of those streaks where he wasn't hitting, but Mike Flowers and
Trevon Hughes chased him pretty hard and worked him hard. Same thing with
McBride, but once McBride got open a couple times you see how good a shooter
he is. So we missed a couple assignments there, but I thought overall our guys
did a great job on trying to prevent the three-point shooters from getting
comfortable.  
  
Q. I know you don't get caught up a lot of times in the hype and hoopla that
a lot of media puts on games like tomorrow, but when you think about it you've
played two games against this team that have been decided by a combined total
of four points. Is this the kind of game with the preparation and the
experience of playing in it that can help each of these teams as they go into
the NCAA tournament to play tough regional games, regional finals if it comes
to that?  
COACH BO RYAN: I'm hoping you're right, but other people say, gosh, teams that
get into those kind of battles at the end of the year, they wear themselves
out. So I'm hoping what you said. I'm agreeing with you. What you said sounds
good to me. I get excited about these kind of games tomorrow. What would make
you think I don't get excited?  
  
Q. Tucker didn't want to talk about being the No. 1 seed. Has your team done
enough to be a No. 1 seed in your mind do you think or do you need to win
tomorrow?  
COACH BO RYAN: I wouldn't have any idea. I don't know the final determining
factors of any of that. All I know is, as Tuck said, Tuck said what he said
for a reason. He firmly believes that because he's been around me long enough.
We're going to play tomorrow and we're going to try to get that done. So it's
two good Big Ten teams going toe to toe and we'll see what happens. And
whatever they do after that, we'll be watching. We'll be there and we'll be
excited, one way or the other.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks for your time.

# [BIG TEN COFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+COFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2007

  

### [Carl Landry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17041)

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

### [David Teague](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17040)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
COACH MATT PAINTER: I thought our guys played very hard today and did a good
job of executing what we wanted to do defensively. We had a couple breakdowns.
Throughout the course of the game we did a good job of making some
adjustments, but we just had a difficult time rebounding the basketball.  
When it comes down to it, you just can't give those guys that many chances.
And I thought Carl did a good job on (Greg) Oden. We tried our best to contain
the dribble because we know if he has to help often, it's going to lead to a
tip dunk if he misses. So we tried to keep Carl (Landry) with him as much as
possible, but if a guy is going to get a lay-up, he's got to go over and try
to take a charge and contest it, and it's close to impossible for a guard to
drop on the opposite side to box him out.  
That's probably something that if we could go back, if we could do a better
job of, is just try to keep the guys in front of him so he wouldn't have to
help and put us in that bind. But they're very good and they're very quick,
and obviously he's a difference-maker when you can rebound the basketball like
that.  
But our guys did a good job. I thought down the stretch the last seven or
eight minutes of the game we did some very good things. The ball just didn't
go in the basket for us.  
And you can't confuse shooting poorly in the last eight, nine minutes with
playing poorly because I thought our guys went right after them and competed
and didn't back down. We just did not make enough shots in the last ten
minutes of the game.  
  
Q. Dave, you had a 43-40 lead, and Carl hit a couple free throws, but then
like Coach said you got in the stretch and you couldn't hit some shots. The
looks were there. Is that the frustrating part of this game is some shots were
there and they ran it out from there?  
DAVID TEAGUE: Definitely because we felt like we did a good job of carrying
our assignments for the most part of the day. Guards were hooked up
defensively and we made some big stops, came away with key rebounds, but just
couldn't connect offensively, and that's always frustrating when you give
yourself a chance on the defensive end and make stops and make plays and get a
good offensive look and it doesn't go down for you. I think that's what hurt
us down the stretch, not being able to make that shot when we needed it.  
  
Q. Carl, Matta talked about how Oden played 32 minutes this game and I think
he's playing a lot stronger now with the cast off and in better shape than he
was earlier. Did you notice a difference in him at all today than the first
two match-ups earlier in the season?  
CARL LANDRY: Yeah, I noticed that the cast was off, and then after that I just
tried to play as great of D on him as I could. He's just a great player down
there on the blocking end, on the defensive end. I was just trying to do all
the little things I could to avoid him from having a good game. He's just a
great player.  
  
Q. Is there anybody like him?  
CARL LANDRY: No, I think he's one of the best -- that's why he's up for
national Player of the Year, because he's just a great player. He can rebound
the ball, he can defend, and it's just his presence. I don't think I've ever
played against a player like Greg Oden. His presence, he's more to a team than
anybody else. He's just a great player, just his presence on the court that
makes him as great as he is.  
  
Q. Carl, just how much does he also impact things that he doesn't actually
-- when he doesn't block a shot, it seems like he also changed a lot of
things. It seems like sometimes players have him in the back of their mind
when they're shooting the ball. Does he have almost a psychological impact,
too?  
CARL LANDRY: Yeah, he's like 7-1 and he's long, athletic and moves. Even if he
doesn't block a shot he's going to alter it because he's very athletic and
long. You've always got it in the back of your head like where is he at. But
you've just got to take the ball to the hoop strong and try to get the shot in
the hoop.  
  
Q. How do you guys feel? You've played some really good ball in the last 10,
12 games. Do you feel like you've done everything you could do at this point
to go to the NCAA Tournament?  
DAVID TEAGUE: I think so. I think we've played good basketball all year, had
some good wins all year, and I think we've been playing some good basketball
of late, and I think we finished strong down the stretch.  
We feel like we're an NCAA Tournament team, and hopefully the selection
committee feels the same way. We just have to be optimistic and just have
confidence that we are one of the NCAA Tournament teams, and hopefully we'll
get there.  
  
Q. Along those lines for both you guys, I know you feel pretty good about
your chances, but what are the next 24 to 48 hours going to be like before the
selection show?  
CARL LANDRY: I might not even be able to sleep tonight. My heart is going to
be racing pretty fast and hoping that we do get one of those bids tomorrow.  
DAVID TEAGUE: Probably watching a lot of SportsCenter over and over
(laughter).  
  
Q. David, if you're watching SportsCenter, do you think you're going to see
that Oden dunk a couple times? They say people stop practice when he makes
those moves. Do you guys shake your heads after the game at that?  
DAVID TEAGUE: Yeah, I mean, even though he's so tall and athletic, you would
assume it's a given for him to make plays, but you still, during the course of
a game, catch yourself in awe he's such a great player. The things that he's
able to do at that size is just tremendous.  
I mean, he's so gifted. It's almost great to watch him, watch him play. But
you try not to get caught up in it while you're playing the game. But
sometimes you're out there and you kind of catch yourself in awe of some of
the moves and some of the plays he makes.  
  
Q. Oden is kind of the cornerstone of that defense, but talk about the rest
of Ohio State's defense, especially late in the second half.  
DAVID TEAGUE: They did a good job. I think they did a good job pressuring the
basketball. They did a good job being physical on screens and kind of making
it tough to catch the ball.  
But I think we got our good looks, had a lot of good looks in good scoring
positions where we wanted it. We just weren't able to knock it down. I think
you have to give them credit for playing physical and stepping up their
defense in intensity. That's where the credit lies, when shots don't fall, the
defense usually gets the credit for that.  
  
Q. I'm sure it's frustrating to have played them tough for the third time
and come out on the wrong side, and you know you don't want moral victories,
but do you feel perhaps you played them the way people wanted to see Purdue
play them to convince people that you belong in the NCAA Tournament, playing
them pretty tough for 31, 32 minutes or so?  
DAVID TEAGUE: I think so. We still didn't reach our goal of playing them tough
for 40 minutes. The No. 1 team in the nation, that's what it's going to take,
a 40-minute effort. You can't half step it against a great team like Ohio
State and expect to win. So I think we did play some good basketball out there
for a nice stretch out there. I think we proved that we belong in the NCAA
Tournament and that we belong up against any team in the nation.  
I think the last three times we've played them we've gotten better each time.
They were able to capitalize on some of the mistakes we made in the three
games, but I think we've played them as tough as anybody else, especially them
being the No. 1 team in the nation. We have all the confidence in the world
that we can play with anyone. Hopefully we'll get in the tournament and get a
chance to prove it.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll finish up with Coach Painter, please.  
  
Q. Who's the best college basketball player you've ever seen, and if it's
not Greg, how does he compare?  
COACH MATT PAINTER: Glenn Robinson - I'm obviously biased - but was pretty
good in his two-year stretch.  
Greg Oden is just different. I would probably as a player want Glenn Robinson
because as a player I didn't know enough about winning. I think as a coach I'd
take Greg Oden just because he dominates the game. He's got nine offensive
rebounds. We got nine as a team today. He changes the game.  
Glenn changes the game offensively. He changes the game offensively and
defensively. And just like Carl says, it's a presence. It's more than his
stats, it's more than his actual game, he's just affecting everything at all
times. You can't really put a value on that.  
I didn't see obviously guys like George McGinnis, guys that dominated, Cazzie
Russell, guys of that nature, so I really can't say. Calbert Cheaney was
pretty good, Jim Jackson was pretty good when I played. I don't think they're
the level of Greg Oden because of the things I just mentioned, how he changes
everything.  
  
Q. This probably isn't the most obvious thing to ask first off, but it
seemed like there in the final minutes, you making offense, defense
substitutions, calling timeouts, urging your team not to foul, how much were
you trying to manage the final score?  
COACH MATT PAINTER: No, I wasn't trying to manage the final score. We were
trying to foul Mike Conley, and they didn't put the ball in Mike Conley's
hands.  
So I just thought with the percentages with Jamar Butler and he kept the ball
in his hands and then the shot clock got down to 15 or 16 and you've went that
long in that particular possession, that's why I was saying no foul. I started
screaming it so they'd understand it. There's no sense in fouling for 20
seconds off the clock, you might as well try to get a stop and then try to
play through that.  
We were trying to foul Oden if he got a rebound on a miss and we were trying
to foul Mike, and I really didn't want to foul the rest of those guys because
they're very good free throw shooters and it didn't make sense at that point.
We were trying to win the game still.  
  
Q. If you were coaching Oden and he asked you about his future, what would
you tell him?  
COACH MATT PAINTER: Obviously I would say it's bright.  
  
Q. If you wanted him to stay for five years.  
COACH MATT PAINTER: If you're the one that's coaching him you want him to stay
the whole time, but also you invest in a person when you sign him, and you
want what's best for that person. When they're making that decision about
their future after the season, I think that parents and people that are close
to them their entire life need to weigh in on that, and if they ask you to
weigh in on it as a coach, you give your opinion on what you think is right
for that individual.  
I can't make a stab at that without knowing him personally because I don't
think that's fair for an opposing coach to step in on that delicate of a
situation.  
  
Q. You mentioned the rebounding. Carl had two. Is that okay? He was
obviously doing other things and had to be consumed with defending Oden.  
COACH MATT PAINTER: It's very difficult obviously to guard him. It's very
difficult to guard him without a backup. Think about what he has to do. I'm
telling him everything to do on hedge screens, post defense, when (Orthello)
Hunter is with him, when (Matt) Terwilliger is with him, when (Ivan) Harris is
with him, we try to do different things. And every time I say it, I finish it
with "and do not foul him." Not as much as putting him to the free-throw line
or trying to wear him down, just to try to keep Carl Landry in the game. When
he is around the basket, we do not help on drives, we stay with him.  
If a guy is going to get a lay-up you've got to go stop it. But if you miss
it, it doesn't really matter because now he's getting the rebound. And that's
what you saw happen late in the game. Our guys were getting blown by off the
drive, didn't contain the dribble, and now there he is cleaning up getting tip
dunks, and there's just not a whole lot you can do.  
I thought Carl (Landry) did a good job. Obviously I'd like to see him get more
rebounds, obviously I'd like to see him keep him off the glass more, but
that's easier said than done. I think he's given a great effort for us; I
thought he gave a great effort tonight. He did some things and brought it out
on the court, he made his shots, made some free throws, played within himself
for the most part and didn't have a lot of turnovers.  
A lot of times in these games when we struggle to score, he really presses. I
thought tonight he didn't press and he stayed with -- we just didn't have
enough guys make shots down the stretch, but it wasn't from a lack of effort.  
  
Q. I want to ask a question that probably won't find its way back to Greg
Oden. When you're playing with a team where you're playing with three guys who
have kind of been playing sore all year in Kramer, Landry and Teague, maybe
Landry, and you play on back-to-back days at the end of the season, and after
32 minutes wrestling with Greg Oden, just, I mean, is it natural maybe to
expect your team to wear down a little bit? Was there any fatigue?  
COACH MATT PAINTER: I don't think so. You really cannot gauge it because you
don't know with somebody shooting -- with some of the shots that we took from
the percentages, there's no doubt as you wear down, that can happen. But I
don't know how you really gauge it because I've seen those guys make shots in
back-to-back games in Maui, where we played three games in row.  
Now it's at the end of the year. I give them a lot of time off. We gave
(David) Teague and (Chris) Kramer one day off because of their knees. They
take them. I trust them to know their body and know what's best for them. But
they're both competitive, and Carl (Landry) is competitive.  
They made more plays than us. I think sometimes we overanalyze things. They
simply made more shots and made more plays and did a better job on the glass.  
  
Q. I know you don't want to lobby, but do you think this is an NCAA team,
your team?  
COACH MATT PAINTER: Yes, I think we've been very consistent throughout the
year. Obviously if we were in a position like Wisconsin and Ohio State, you
don't get those kind of questions.  
But I think we were very consistent, had a good run in Maui, played some good
teams and had a good schedule. Even though we have not had the road wins we
would have liked, we've still had some neutral game wins with beating Oklahoma
and DePaul and Iowa, and obviously winning two road games in the league. And
that's probably our Achilles heel.  
But if you look at the teams you're comparing us to, everyone has warts.
Everyone is going to have something. We have ten games we've won in the Top
100. Go compare that against anybody else. We've beaten some good teams this
year, we've remained consistent. We've competed with teams that are supposedly
tops in the country.  
Have we beat some of those teams? No, we haven't. If you do, you're not on
that bubble, but I do think we're an NCAA Tournament team and we belong in the
tournament.  
  
Q. That said, Dave talked about being nervous or watching SportsCenter over
and over again and Carl talked about being nervous. What are your emotions
going to be in the morning do you think?  
COACH MATT PAINTER: It's what you've done all season. I watch SportsCenter
regardless if whether we're on the bubble or not, so to me it's not a big
deal. I'm watching spring training stuff, I'm watching basketball stuff,
that's what I do.  
You pay attention to it because now you can't do anything about it. At least
we're not -- if we were at Southern Illinois, we'd wait for eight days. That's
waiting. You wake up, you go to bed, you find out tomorrow at dinner; that's
pretty easy.  
  
Q. Are you guys going to have something at Purdue tomorrow?  
COACH MATT PAINTER: We're going to do something at my house, and then we're
going to come back to Mackey (Arena) and meet the media there at 7:30.

# [BIG TEN COFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+COFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2007

  

### [Mike Conley, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17065)

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

### [Greg Oden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17027)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
COACH THAD MATTA: Well, it was a game. That's what I love about these
conference tournaments, when you're playing quick turnarounds. There's wasn't
a lot of juice there from us at the beginning of the game. We really had to
challenge our guys at halftime. It was really simple. We had to get a little
bit more active defensively and I thought we did that, and probably the
coaching move of the year, I said we've got to make some shots. Ivan (Harris)
got us going, Greg (Oden) had it going, Mike (Conley Jr.) had a couple nice
finishes down low. We beat a great basketball team today. I thought we, at
stretches, played well. We're moving on.  
  
Q. Greg, can you just talk about the put-back dunk you had, and when you
came back out on the court with your arms spread what you were feeling at that
moment?  
GREG ODEN: I have no idea (laughter). I didn't get blocked out, so I went up,
got offensive, tip dunked, and ran out and I don't know what I did. I was just
yelling. I enjoyed it (laughter).  
  
Q. Mike, everybody talks about the NCAAs next week and that will play out,
but can you tell us what it means to you in your first year to play for the
Big Ten Championship tomorrow?  
MIKE CONLEY JR.: Well, it means a lot to play. It's an honor to be in the
situation that we're in. Tomorrow we're going to play either Wisconsin or
Illinois. They're both great teams. We're just looking forward to being a part
of it.  
  
Q. Greg, how much emphasis was put on rebounding today? You had 19 boards
and you guys got a lot of second-chance baskets, and how important was that to
the win today?  
GREG ODEN: We just got a lot of tips, and we got a chance to get the first-
time rebounds, and that helped out a lot. It helped out with our victory
because it got our team going. We didn't get a lot of guys on the other team
getting offensive rebounds and getting put-back points, so that helped us a
lot, too.  
  
Q. Mike, what Thad said about the challenge of playing two days in a row,
how was this different than playing two days in a row at the end of the season
versus two days in a row in the BCA Classic?  
MIKE CONLEY JR.: It's a lot different. We've had a whole season to play before
this tournament. Back then it was our opening game, so we were pretty well-
rested. It's a little different now. You've got to save your legs a little
more and try and conserve a little energy.  
But we still try to play as hard as we can for the awards we're trying to win.  
  
Q. In what ways do you feel you've expanded your offensive game this
season?  
GREG ODEN: I think as the year goes on, I'm getting a lot more comfortable
just shooting that hook shot and taking my time and looking for the double
teams and being able to pass it out to my teammates if I am double teamed.  
  
Q. Mike, you had that three-pointer that missed by a few feet and then you
had that big one that kind of got you guys back in. Can you talk about what
was going through your mind after the first one and then after the second
one?  
MIKE CONLEY JR.: I wanted that first one back because it slipped out of my
hands, so the next opportunity I got I was going to try to put it up.  
When I saw Ron (Lewis) dribbling towards me I was yelling his name because I
definitely thought I was going to make the shot, so he passed it to me and it
went in, so I was very happy about that.  
  
Q. Thad talked about challenging you guys on defense, and I think the run
pretty much happened coming out of the timeout at 11:41. You got a lot of your
points in transition and deflections and defended shots. Anything in
particular about that timeout that brought the best out of you guys?  
MIKE CONLEY JR.: I think the seniors stepped up in the time-out. They were
getting us going, Ron Lewis and Ivan (Harris) and Jamar (Butler) stepped up
and really got us going. When we got out of the timeout, I think we all took
everything to heart and tried to play as hard as we could no matter how tired
we were or how beat up, just come out there and play as hard as we can for
that short stretch. I think it really benefited us.  
  
Q. Greg, you got three fouls there in the second half against Landry. When
you came back in did you change how you were playing at all, and how tough a
guard is it for you to go up against Landry?  
GREG ODEN: He's really strong and he's really quick, so what I had to do was
just sit down and play off of him. They wanted me to make him shoot over me
rather than him getting into me and me getting more fouls.  
  
Q. I just was curious about your reaction to Greg's screen. Was that his
best one ever?  
MIKE CONLEY JR.: I've seen a lot of them, and they don't change. But that was
an amazing play. I haven't seen too many of them. But it was a great moment to
be a part of, and watching him go crazy and waving his arms in the air was
something a little different.  
  
Q. Greg, are you mostly looking forward to dunking on Wisconsin or
Illinois?  
GREG ODEN: The winner (laughter).  
  
Q. Mike, how much easier is it on you guys as a team that if you guys do
miss if there's anything close to the basket that you've got Greg to come in
and get it, almost like a security blanket there?  
MIKE CONLEY JR.: Yeah, if we can get into the lane or draw on defenses to
collapse on us, we know if we miss a shot, if somebody not blocking out Greg
(Oden) or not blocking Othello (Hunter) and having those guys being able to
tip in shots is very comfortable because if you miss a shot, it might be a
good play. That's kind of bad to say, but I'd rather have an assist or a
missed shot because I know both Greg and Othello and the rest of the big men
can really go get them after they get off the rim.  
  
Q. Mike, in the game in Columbus, Purdue hurt you a little bit, especially
Crump with that dribble penetration, and today that really was not a factor.
Anything in particular that you did to kind of take that away?  
MIKE CONLEY JR.: I think we communicated a lot better. The first game they
really caught us off guard and messed us up with that pick-and-roll and didn't
have very good communication going. I think that was a real focal point in
preparing for their kind of game because they really hurt us with that the
last couple games. I think the big men did a great job of hedging out and
helping out the guards that were being screened, so we definitely made a big
change.  
  
Q. Greg has obviously been really good all year, but it seems like as he's
come down the stretch he's gotten better and better as he's gotten healthy.  
MIKE CONLEY JR.: Yeah, he's gotten healthy, but it's that time of year. You
win or go home. Greg is the kind of player who steps up to the occasion. He
knows we're in tournament time right now and every game is critical. He's
really stepping up his play both offensively and defensively and starting to
do a little more of everything each game. He's really leading us right now.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll finish up with questions for Coach Matta now, please.  
  
Q. I think they were ahead by three and I think it was a 20-to-4 run over a
10-minute period when you took control. What happened during that run that
kind of got it going for you?  
COACH THAD MATTA: Well, they did a great job. I mean, Matt (Painter) was
tremendous today. They were going four guards, they'd sprinkle a big guy back
in, and I felt like they kind of forced our hand to play match-up, and I
thought that really helped us and we were able to switch a little bit more on
some things.  
Just the activity, the help in the first half, they opened up, (David) Teague
hits two tough threes over Jamar (Butler). I think it was (Chris) Kramer hits
a pull-up over Ivan (Harris) for the first eight points, and I thought we lost
our juice a little bit, and we weren't getting there, and we got to where we
were challenging shots. We were making it hard to see the basket, Ron Lewis
getting out and using his length, I think that was probably the biggest
difference. It allowed us to get out and get a couple easy ones and get to the
free-throw line through transition.  
  
Q. You were 4-of-13 today from behind the arc. Yesterday you guys didn't
shoot a whole lot behind the arc. Are the three-pointers becoming less
important for you guys to succeed now?  
COACH THAD MATTA: I wouldn't say that. It's sort of what's there, take it. The
one thing that teams are really doing, they're not giving them to us right
now. So hopefully we can continue to play off of that and get inside the
defense a little bit more. But if they're there, I want to shoot them.  
Like I've said, I want to play fast, I want more points than 61. Let's get
this thing up and down and go.  
  
Q. With Greg up here to be pretty much 100 percent and particularly his
offensive game coming along, how does this team rate as far as what you
envisioned maybe what it would be at this time of year. Is this maybe what you
thought it could be?  
COACH THAD MATTA: Honestly, great question. I don't know if I have an answer
because I didn't know what this team was going to be. And quite honestly, I
went in open-minded because I didn't know. With Greg's injury, we didn't know
if he was ever going to get the cast off this year. We didn't know how long it
was going to be.  
So honestly, I had a vision, but I really didn't know where it was going. But
I like the way we're playing right now, I really do.  
  
Q. This is kind of a follow-up to that. Is this where you envisioned or
hoped that Greg would be if and whenever he did get the cast off these last
couple games?  
COACH THAD MATTA: Yeah. One of the big keys today is Greg played 32 minutes.
Does anybody know how many he played in the first two games? 42. That was the
big challenge for Greg today. We've got to keep him on the court.  
I think (Carl) Landry played 66 minutes to Greg's 42 minutes in the first two
games, and that was a huge challenge. Going in at halftime with no fouls on
Greg was something that we were hoping for. I think Greg is getting to where
we thought he could be.  
I'd still like to see him be able to step out a little bit more and knock down
those shots. He's doing that more in practice. The hard part is not getting
enough practice in obviously, but I think that will be the next step for him.
He went a little bit quick on his first couple post moves there. Slowing down
is something that's good for him. But I think his mind is so strong, he's a
winner, he's a competitor, and that's what you love about him.  
  
Q. What do you think when you see a play like that where the ball comes off
there and he slams it?  
COACH THAD MATTA: I turn into a cheerleader, yeah, I do. He does some things
every now and then in practice where guys will literally just stop practice
and kind of start laughing. That was one of those today. I mean, the first
time I ever saw him dunk, the only guy that kept playing was Michael (Conley).
Everybody else in the gym stopped.  
But I think he is special. I like the fact that that gave us some boost down
the -- some energy down the stretch that I thought we needed.  
  
Q. Now that you've seen Purdue several times, what's your take on them, and
are they an NCAA Tournament team in your opinion?  
COACH THAD MATTA: Absolutely. I think that for starters, I said this, Matt
(Painter) has done an incredible job when you think two years ago where he
started as an assistant. Last year's team, and you look at how they weathered
the storm last year with the injuries, and I think when you've got two players
like (Carl) Landry and (David) Teague, both fifth-year seniors, both have
battled injuries, I thought they both played with great energy. I think the
biggest thing for Purdue in my own opinion, I don't coach the team, but the
supporting cast has done a great job. They've gotten those guys better.  
They play extremely hard, they're well-disciplined, and there's no doubt in my
mind they're an NCAA Tournament team. I don't want to see them again, I know
that.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the next game, who you guys might be
playing, little strategies that you might be developing for either Illinois or
Wisconsin?  
COACH THAD MATTA: Which one do you want me to say because that's the second
time -- honestly, like we said, we knew we'd get asked. Whoever wins, we've
got both teams scouted back at the hotel. When we get back, we'll have
personnel roll in and -- at this stage, and Columbus people know this, I don't
worry about things I can't control. I think both teams are NCAA Tournament
teams, so they should be in great shape.  
Whoever it is is the hand we're dealt.  
  
Q. I know it's just another step to the big goal of winning a national
title, but just kind of talk about the significance of playing for a Big Ten
title or Big Ten Tournament title, and also, do you feel that you need to win
tomorrow to preserve you being the No. 1 seed in the tournament?  
COACH THAD MATTA: Well, I think -- it's funny, people asked coming into this
tournament how important is this tournament, playing 120 minutes in 72 hours
is strenuous. It's tough. If you get thrown into a Thursday bracket, what
happens is because we'll have to take Monday and Tuesday off, probably have
one day to prepare and we're playing on Thursday.  
But I think that for us, the competitiveness comes out. As we told our guys,
we came here to play 120 minutes of basketball, we've got 80 down. I think the
competitiveness will come out.  
As far as the No. 1 seed, nobody ever believes me when I say this, I don't pay
a whole lot of attention to it. I would have to think with what this team has
done, I think today was the 16th straight win. You keep hearing they lost to
North Carolina, well, Greg didn't play, and it was at North Carolina. They
lost to Florida. Our center was back for two weeks or three weeks at that
point. At Wisconsin, all those games were on the road.  
I've got to think that we're in pretty decent shape I would hope, but I'm not
in Indianapolis. Twenty-nine and three, that's a school record. I mean, I
think we've done everything we need to do to put ourselves in that position.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Appreciate your time.

# [BIG TEN COFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+COFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2007

  

### [Warren Carter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16999)

### [Shaun Pruitt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17060)

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: Obviously we had a difficult task with the lateness of the
game last night and how hard-fought it was going into overtime and then coming
back and playing one of the better teams in the country with one of the better
players.  
We just kept talking about grinding it out, keeping it close, keeping it
within reach, and then you never know what happened.  
(Alando) Tucker made some hellacious shots early. I thought we defended him
pretty well. He just jumped up, and he contorts his body and still is able to
have a good touch on some of those jump shots. And then Kam Taylor in the
second half made a couple of big baskets that got them over the hump.  
Overall they had 53, so we defended them halfway decent, but just didn't have
enough offensively, turned it over too many times, empty possessions where we
didn't get any shots. It's just probably not much legs, not much gas in the
tank to kind of get it done.  
With the score 27-25 I believe, Brian Randle threw it off (Rich) McBride's
back on a transition, and then they went down and scored, I think, back to
back, and that was it seemed like the breaking point in the game.  
  
Q. Shaun, it looked like they were keying in on keeping the ball away from
you tonight. Did it feel that way to you and is there anything else you could
have done about it?  
SHAUN PRUITT: Yeah, I think they did a good job of packing it in close and
just trying to push me out as best they could. I had a pretty good game when
we played them earlier in the season, so they definitely did a good job of
limiting me tonight.  
  
Q. Warren, I'm wondering how much do you think fatigue played a role and how
much sleep did you guys get last night?  
WARREN CARTER: There's no doubt about it, it did. I think we still got to bed
at a decent hour and got to sleep, but just fatigue, legs, especially from
playing a tough game in overtime with Indiana and then the Penn State game the
day before, but we put ourselves in that situation. We came out here, we
fought and we gave it all we had, but the better team won.  
  
Q. Warren, you look kind of dejected up there, but you guys had two wins in
two days and you put yourselves in a position to make the NCAA Tournament. Can
you look at this as a success? Is it possible for you to do?  
WARREN CARTER: Maybe tomorrow after the selection show if I see our team's
name called, then we'll look at it as a success. But right now we still don't
really know. We played hard, we came out here, won two games and won a great
game yesterday. We're just going to wait and see what happens.  
  
Q. Do either of you guys think you deserve the bid? You don't want to say
that or are you sitting back and waiting to see?  
WARREN CARTER: I think we deserve it. We've been playing very well here down
the stretch once we've gotten our guys back. Coach called it, our body of work
looks good. We haven't really had any bad losses.  
We definitely would have been better if we would have had some of those key
wins early. But as Coach was saying, with our body of work, it looks like
we're in good shape, but you still never know.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll finish up with questions for Coach Weber, please.  
  
Q. You talked about last night that if you made it to the weekend that you
should be in good shape, but will you still sweat it out until 5:00 o'clock
tomorrow?  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: Yeah, there's no doubt, until your name pops up. I got back
in the locker room last night, and you find out Nevada lost and Xavier lost,
so some of the leagues you probably anticipated -- one team, one bid leagues
turned out to be two, two-team leagues. So that means each -- somebody is
knocked off that might have been potentially in there.  
They keep saying we're one of the last five. You know, does that mean are we
fifth, first there or are we fifth? Where are we in that bunch?  
But at the same time, as they mentioned, when you look at it, all the things
they talk about, your RPI, your schedule rating, your last ten games, you
know, we played tough opponents. We have top 100 wins. And then if you include
the X factor of the injuries and what we've gone through, I've got to believe
we're going to be in.  
But it's kind of ironic, some of these -- and I guess it's all the so-called
experts, and they don't really know. The committee only knows. But they're
saying some of these other teams and we're ahead of them in all these
categories, but they're saying they have doubts about us. We'll just have to
wait and see.  
  
Q. Defensively what were Wisconsin's guards doing to your guards that you
guys really weren't able to get a rhythm from your guard play tonight?  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: We've struggled scoring from the guard position actually
this whole last stretch. We've kind of lived off of our forwards, Shaun
(Pruitt) and Warren (Carter), and Brian Randle didn't get much done today, but
they've been a little more effective. And then Chester gets a lay-up, get a
spot-up three. Rich, at least he got back in rhythm a little bit, went three
for six. Trent Meacham got a wide open look and didn't get it to go.  
Wisconsin, they're just a sound team. They don't beat themselves. Actually 11
turnovers for them is quite a bit, and they really didn't get to the free-
throw line, and they lead the league in free-throw attempts.  
You know, we did some things well, but they're just a solid defensive team.
They took Shaun away and just made it difficult for us to get easy looks, and
we just never got in a rhythm.  
  
Q. Regardless of what happens in the tournament or in the selection Sunday,
looking at this season and comparing it with two years ago, what is more
realistically the future of this program in your mind? Are you guys destined
to be kind of a 20-ish win team struggling or are you getting back to the
top?  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: You know, when you say 20-win struggling, for a lot of
programs that's pretty good. We're already at 23 and went through all we did.
If you have Chester (Frazier), you have Brian Randle, you have a lot of the
different guys at different times, you know, now you have 25 or 26. You know,
that might be a record for some programs.  
You know, I think we -- I'm proud of our kids. I'm proud of what they've done
this year. A lot of programs wouldn't have fought through it, wouldn't have
had the heart that these guys have had. I still think we have some things to
-- I guess to solve and that, but at the same time, you've got Shaun back,
you've got Brian Randle back, Chester Frazier back, you've got some people
that have been pretty successful. We've got to add a couple into the mix and I
think we can be a factor next year. How good will depend probably on who adds,
how good are they right away, and how much these guys work at it to get
better.  
  
Q. Having seen how close Wisconsin and Ohio State's two games have been with
the home team winning, I guess what would your prediction be for tomorrow's
game?  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: Probably a close game (laughter). Honestly, they just --
neither one seems to beat themselves. Ohio State seems to turn it on at the
end of games when they need to and make the plays, whether it's the Michigan
game, Purdue game. Wisconsin just seems more solid and consistent.  
You know, Wisconsin had a chance at Ohio State, they just didn't finish it.
Free throws, I'm sure Kam Taylor is going to remember that. If Tucker can play
like he did today, they've still probably got to get a little more production.
Flowers has nothing and Chappell has nothing, they were still able to beat us,
but I think Ohio State can score more points so at least -- I think they can.
The one game at Columbus was pretty low-scoring. I think it'll be a close,
hard-fought game just like the other two have been.  
  
Q. The assists to turnovers tonight, is that part of being tired?  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: Well, number one, you don't make shots, you don't get any
assists, so that's part of it. We had too many empty possessions.  
It was 27-25, I'm not positive. But Brian throws it off of Rich's back, then
we have the breakout, Brian tries to go to the basket, maybe bump, maybe
goaltending, goes our way, they get a couple possessions, then Brian turns it
over again, just a bad stretch, trying to feed the post.  
When you're playing against them, a team that is so efficient, you cannot have
empty possessions. That was probably the difference in the game.  
  
Q. If I could, just what were your thoughts on Marcus Landry and what was
his play out there tonight?  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: Well, he gives a different element to them. He gives them
athleticism. Obviously when Steimsma and Landry went out last year they were a
different team. Now Landry, he's not (Brian) Butch, but he still gives them
some athleticism. He goes one for five on threes, but the one he made was huge
and was a back-breaker for us. You're hanging in there, hanging in there, and
all of a sudden that thing swishes and it lets the wind out of our guys.  
You've got to give up something. Shaun comes to the bench frustrated, how are
you going to stop Tucker, how are you going to stop Taylor, you've got to give
up something to help out those guys. But it was a big bucket. He is definitely
a difference-maker for them because of his athleticism.  
  
Q. You kind of mentioned it, but just to reiterate, did you guys get done
what you wanted to get done here in sort of the realistic sense?  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: Well, I told our kids, I was going to bring four suits. I
wanted to get to Sunday. You know, I thought we were capable of it. I knew it
would be very difficult. The Penn State game was probably a harder fought game
than maybe you would have hoped. Then last night obviously that thing was a
hard-fought game, maybe one of the most intense games I've been around for 45
minutes. So it took a lot out of us. And then we said to get to Saturday, we
thought we'd be in pretty good position.  
Again, you don't know all the other leagues. That's the X factor. And I don't
know what's in the committee's mind, but I feel we have a pretty good case,
and I just hope we're not the first Big Ten team with over 20 wins and
finished over .500 in the league not to get in. I hope we don't leave a legacy
as far as that goes.  
  
Q. Alando Tucker just became Wisconsin's all-time leading scorer. Have you
seen him the last few years? I guess where does he stack up in terms of the
some of the best?  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: I think the big thing is he's made improvement. He came in,
I recruited him, SIU watched him a lot, he was a player that scored around the
basket, very athletic, very gifted, and he just kept -- his game has just
improved and improved and improved. He's a three-point threat, he can handle
the ball, he just can do a lot of things.  
I like it because, one, he stayed, and he's done what in this society now, no
one wants to do, keep working at it and getting better. Everybody wants
instant gratification, one year, go pro. I think they should be very proud, he
should be very proud, and he's a great example for kids that you can make -- I
hope he has great success in the NBA. I think it would be a good story.  
  
Q. In the second half did you do anything defensively against Tucker that
was giving Taylor clearer looks?  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: I just think they spread us out. Our guards probably got
tired. You know, they got it to Tucker and then we held and we
miscommunicated, he got an open look. I just think what goes before the legs
probably is the mental part, and we didn't communicate, couldn't score. We've
talked all year about we can't let scoring affect our defense, but it just
seemed like we just didn't have that extra zip, that extra fire.  
And now all of a sudden he gets one down, gets another one down because those
early shots, they weren't going. He was way off early. But he made big ones
when they needed it.  
  
Q. You have enough going on tomorrow with the selection show, but does this
league deserve two No. 1s do you think, two No. 1 seeds?  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: I think it's close. I think one 1 and at least a 2. They've
got to be in at least the top eight and get an opportunity to play close to
home I would anticipate. They're both very good. They've been very consistent.
They've played pretty good schedules. So I think it wouldn't surprise me if
they both got 1s, but I would think at least a 1 and a 2 at worst.  
THE MODERATOR: Appreciate your time, Coach. Thanks.

# [BIG TEN COFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+COFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2007

  

### [Ron Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17028)

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

### [Greg Oden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17027)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
COACH MATTA: I think the biggest key in the first half was the rebounding by
Michigan. They did a tremendous job, had us down 21-8 on the boards, and I
thought we were -- we weren't finishing plays, and that's one of the big
challenges that you've got to do in this certain segment. I thought guys made
plays.  
These two guys were spectacular today. Once we got going in the second half we
were able to put together some runs. But you've got to give Michigan credit.
They kept coming back, getting it to five, getting it to five, but like I
said, we were able to finish it off down the stretch.  
  
Q. Greg, just talk about your game offensively, 8-for-12. It didn't appear
they were doubling you. Just talk about your mindset as you were getting the
ball in good position there?  
GREG ODEN: It was just to be more aggressive and take what the defense was
giving us. They weren't doubling, so I had to go to work.  
  
Q. Greg, would you say this was your best performance of the season so
far?  
GREG ODEN: I don't know (smiling). It was a win. That's all that matters. It
doesn't matter about me personally.  
  
Q. Greg, it seemed like after Thad got the technical, you started getting
some calls inside. Was it not going your way for a while there in the second
half and after your coach helped you out a little bit? Did it start going your
way a little bit more?  
GREG ODEN: I guess so. I mean, I guess I looked at the referees, knew that
coach was going to be on them the rest of the way after he got the technical,
so they started giving us a lot more calls and getting him off their backs.  
  
Q. Ron, after that happened, though, you guys did go on a little run. Does
that spark you guys, when something like that happens?  
RON LEWIS: Yeah, it does. When your coach gets fired up, you get fired up, as
well. We just tried to hang on his back and ride the horse.  
  
Q. Greg, as you get into the Big Ten Tournament here and then ultimately
into the NCAAs the following weeks, do your juices get rolling even more so as
these games go on with more and more importance?  
GREG ODEN: It does. This is my first go-around in these types of tournaments.
So I just feel for the guys who have been here before and they know when the
time comes it's lose and go home. You've got to play hard every game.  
  
Q. Greg, you looked like in the second half you were all fired up. Did Thad
talk to you or were you just mad from what had happened in the first half?  
GREG ODEN: I was just trying to do something for us to win. I was just trying
to fire up my teammates.  
  
Q. This is for Greg or Ron. What did you guys think of the new uniforms?  
RON LEWIS: I loved them. If we keep winning in them, I'm going to keep loving
them. If they lose, I'm not going to like them anymore (laughter).  
  
Q. Either one, Greg, what did you think when you heard at halftime you had
been out-rebounded 21 to 8?  
GREG ODEN: I was amazed. But I knew going into halftime that we had been out-
rebounded really bad, and we just had to step it up.  
  
Q. Ron, besides winning, what do you particularly like about what they've
done to the uniforms?  
RON LEWIS: It gives the refs a better opportunity to call fouls if somebody is
grabbing your jersey because they're so tight. So if your jersey is coming
out, it's not because of you, it's somebody grabbing it. So it gives the refs
a better chance to call a foul.  
  
Q. Just a follow-up on that question about Michigan's rebounding advantage
in the first half, a lot of those rebounds were second chances on the
offensive boards. What was the key in the second half to keeping them off the
offensive boards more than you did in the first half?  
GREG ODEN: Just block out and get the first time rebound, snatch at the board
the first time when you get a chance to.  
  
Q. Ron, can you just talk about the offensive flow when you guys were
getting the ball to Greg, you were driving to the basket, just how the offense
was working generally, especially second half?  
RON LEWIS: I was really just spacing out and taking what the defense gave us.
Greg (Oden) had his opportunities when they weren't doubling him, and then I
took the opportunity when they spaced the floor and he was on the other side
of the basket.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll finish up with questions for Coach Matta now, please.  
  
Q. I'll steal Doug's question about the technical. Lots of times that's
going to go one way or the other. It's either going to help the other team or
it's going to help yours. I don't think it was premeditated, but what kind of
an effect do you think it had on the game and what prompted you to argue the
way you did?  
COACH MATTA: Well, I had no intentions of getting -- I never have an intention
of getting a technical foul. I thought Greg (Oden) had got hit. It was a rough
game, and I just said "call the foul." It was deserved. Those guys did a great
job today.  
I wanted them to know that we were -- that was important to us. It's just part
of what we do. I probably get a little bit too carried away with it, but it's
hard because it's so physical, and when you're going to Greg so much, there's
going to be contact. He's hard to guard. You know, hopefully we do what's
right.  
  
Q. You said that's important to you. What are you talking about there,
impacting your offense?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, and just the overall post play and those types of things,
yeah.  
  
Q. Do you sense any kind of desperation in Michigan? Did you expect it and
during the game did you sense it given their tournament situation?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, absolutely. I think honestly in the last six days we have
played them twice, and fortunately for us and probably unfortunately for them
we played pretty good basketball today. I've said this, I think Michigan is
one of the best teams in the Big Ten. I think they're well-coached, they've
got great talent, and quite honestly, if you go back and watch tapes, we've
been extremely fortunate.  
  
Q. The top seed in this tournament and possibly the No. 1 in the NCAAs
coming. Do you like that pressure of everybody gunning for you?  
COACH MATTA: We're 28-3, and it has been that way for 31 games. Quite
honestly, I'm used to it. And the one thing through all this, and it happened
really about midstream of the season and we talked to our guys about it,
there's nothing we can do about it. Let's keep the focus on us. Let's keep the
focus on us getting better every day because it is there, and quite honestly,
I've never coached a team like this.  
These guys have done a very good job of handling that, that we know wherever
we go, or some of the road environments we've been in this year have been some
of the most amazing things.  
I think you get numb to it all.  
  
Q. When you went into halftime, when you talked to the team, was it
something in your game plan, let's go to Greg, let's make a concerted effort
to go to Greg as much as we can in the second half?  
COACH MATTA: No. Honestly, the tone at halftime was basically rebounding and
defense, rebounding and defense. I'm trying to think of exactly what we said.
We didn't say a whole lot about offense. We were shooting 54 percent. We had
two turnovers. We felt like we were doing a pretty good job with it.  
  
Q. What was it in the first half with the rebounding? Was there something
you could see? And what did you try and adjust?  
COACH MATTA: It was finishing plays. They did a good job -- they had 16
yesterday and 22 today. It's like we're back in November (laughter). But I
think that the big key for us was finish the plays, get back in the play.  
Here's the thing: When they're shooting, those guys are just running and
jumping and it is a little bit of desperation. I've got to give Michigan some
credit. They were relentless on the boards.  
  
Q. Izzo credited Michigan State's good shooting yesterday to the fact that
his players talked him into coming over here yesterday morning for an early
morning shoot-around. I wondered if you guys had a chance to get an early
shoot-around here today?  
COACH MATTA: No, nowhere. We came and got on the court as quickly as we could,
but no, we did not use the facility.  
  
Q. Because of how young your guys are and all the high-pressure games you've
played in the national spotlight, does that prepare a young team for the
postseason or is there still a learning curve for these guys who haven't been
here before?  
COACH MATTA: I hope the curve is over because we're in the postseason. I think
the games that we've played, without doubt, have prepared us for these types
of situations. We've had some great challenges in the non-conference, we've
had some great challenges throughout the conference, and it's just -- I always
tell them, or they tell me this and I repeat it, "it is what it is."  
But you go down to Chapel Hill, you go to Gainesville, Florida, those were two
of the craziest places I've ever seen, and those were good learning
experiences with the losses for us.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what you like or don't like about the new uniforms you
guys are wearing and what you think it does for the players?  
COACH MATTA: Today was the first day I saw them. I was a little bit nervous
with the length of the shorts and I had a couple guys change, nothing major.
But I liked the look of them. I feel honored that Nike would think this highly
of us to do this, and for LeBron to take a special interest in our program has
been amazing. It's funny, in talking with him this summer and his people, he's
a Buckeye, and when you have a guy like LeBron James with his stature that
cares enough to put his logo on your uniform, it's flattering that he would do
that for us.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about defensive effort? I mean, they only shot 26
percent in the second half, 33 percent for the game. I know the rebounding is
part of defense, but what did you like about what you saw for your guys?  
COACH MATTA: I felt like we were more aware of what was going on. One of the
craziest things I've ever seen happen happened when Michael was trying to get
out on the skip pass and the guy fell on his leg and they couldn't get out
there and they make the three. The coaches were yelling, "come on, Michael,"
and Sims was laying on his leg. He couldn't move. It was like a bear trap out
there. But I thought that we had a sense of what was going on, and really, we
took a calculated risk.  
We thought we played Michigan -- there was a strong chance we'd play them
again, and we tried to take as many similarities from Minnesota to Michigan
and incorporate them in our three days of practice. The things that we focused
on, we did a much better job. The cross screen they got us in in Ann Arbor I
don't think they got us on one time today. The ball screens weren't as
effective as they were last Saturday. So I think our guys -- I'm proud of the
fact that they took to heart what we worked on.  
  
Q. I think you called this a tough game. Could you elaborate on that? What
made this a tough game?  
COACH MATTA: Well, I think just the -- you play a team for the second time in
six days, they're extremely athletic, you see that, they've got guys -- we're
fortunate, Harris, 1 for 13 today, he doesn't do that very often. He had some
pretty good looks. But I just thought it was physical at the end. They started
running and jumping and trapping and all those things, and I thought we
handled that well to the tune of five turnovers today.  
  
Q. About the defense, did you switch up more today between zone and man than
you did in the previous games? It looked like you were going back and forth
quite a bit, and was that -- I think maybe last week you talked about doing it
to keep them out of rhythm?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, and we did more in the first half. Second half we were I
think all man to man. But in the first half there, and maybe that had
something to do with the rebounding, I'll have to take a look at it, but yeah,
we just thought that it was effective for us up there. Our offense was a lot
better today than it was up there on Saturday.  
THE MODERATOR: Appreciate your time, Coach. Thank you.

# [BIG TEN COFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+COFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2007

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Drew Neitzel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16991)

### [Travis Walton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16992)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
COACH TOM IZZO: I was very disappointed. I thought we'd give them a better
game. For some reason our defense just let us down. It's been good for 31 or
32 games, whatever we played, and we really didn't check very well tonight.
That was probably the difference in the game, that and the fact that we just
can't seem to keep Raymar Morgan in the game. There was some key plays and I
was disappointed about that.  
They played well. I told my team before, Taylor was a big key. He got off to a
great start, and they deserved to win the game.  
  
Q. Drew, did Flowers finally get the best out of you this third time
around?  
DREW NEITZEL: I think they did a great job of playing team defense. Any time I
was coming off a down screen, there was always somebody there, whether it was
Krabbenhoft or one of the big guys always stepping up. I think they did a
great job of playing team defense tonight.  
  
Q. Drew, was that limp just something minor or did that affect you at all?
What happened exactly with that?  
DREW NEITZEL: I slipped a couple times on the court and just landed wrong. No,
that wasn't a problem, though.  
  
Q. Drew, at the same time you had an 8:0 assist turnover ratio. Was that
defense making you into a passer more than a shooter?  
DREW NEITZEL: Yeah, I think their goal was to try to get the ball out of my
hands. Coach said try not to force things, just let the game come to you.
That's what I tried to do, get the ball in the post and make them pay for
stepping up, and our big guys did a good job of finishing.  
  
Q. Why the defensive struggles tonight after playing so well defensively
against them the first two times?  
TRAVIS WALTON: We just didn't come out ready to play. We've been playing
pretty good defense all year, and the last two games our defense hasn't been
there. Tonight it caught up with us.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll finish up with questions for Coach Izzo, please.  
  
Q. Coach, are you confident in the NCAA tournament at this point?  
COACH TOM IZZO: I've said for three weeks that you earn your keep if you do
the job you did. I think this team has done their job, and I'm tired of
answering that question, to be honest with you. If they don't take this team
for what we've done and who we've played, the toughest schedule in this whole
damn league, we'll go to the NIT. If they do think so, we'll go to the NCAA.
I'm tired of answering that question.  
  
Q. A lot of times teams that play that first day kind of start better. The
other team takes some time to adjust, and tonight obviously the reverse was
true. Was that first four minutes the key to the game?  
COACH TOM IZZO: Yeah, I think so. I think that's a fair assessment. I was very
disappointed in how we played. We lost assignments. The only guy that played
well defensively was Travis.  
Offensively they did a good job of taking Drew away. We had some
opportunities. But, you know, give our kids credit, they battled back. And
when Raymar had that kind of breakaway dunk, and we got fouled and missed the
two free throws. I thought his fifth foul was terrible, and we can't keep the
guy in the game. Every time we play Wisconsin we can't keep him in the game,
so we're going to have to do a better job coaching him on that. We're just not
the same team with him not in the game. When he is in the game, he's playing
with either two fouls before the half and can't touch a guy, or with four
fouls at the end. So that part was really disappointing to me.  
  
Q. Just avoiding the foul situation against Wisconsin ...  
COACH TOM IZZO: It's a joke. That one I'm almost tired of talking about just
like I am the NCAA. Nothing good will be said and nothing good will come out
of my mouth, so then I'll look like a whiner and a crier.  
They beat us and they played awfully well. Like I said, I told them before
that (Kammron) Taylor was a big key, and he played well. (Michael) Flowers
made some shots early.  
But when we got it within five and missed the free throws and then got that
fifth foul our lineup is just not a lineup to come back with. We missed some
free throws and some good opportunities. (Alando) Tucker missed some
opportunities. He played well. They played well, we didn't play well. That's
how you lose by 12 or 13.  
  
Q. Do you think somebody could make a computer that could come up with where
you wouldn't have to play the same team two or three times in two and a half
weeks?  
COACH TOM IZZO: Boy, if I answer this one I'm really in trouble. I'm sick of
answering that question. That's why when somebody says "bubble," I swear it
doesn't phase me. If this is a bubble team for who we played and what we did,
you know what, then we're a bubble team.  
I think we're a little drained, there's no question. They had that bye week
and then the extra day and I think that helped. We've played so many big
games. Last night wasn't against the best team, but for our guys there was a
lot of pressure on that game. It's been 12 straight games of incredible
pressure, and I thought we did not play very well defensively. They played
well offensively. Which one caused the other one, I don't know, but I didn't
think we were very sharp from the get-go.  
And then we really wanted to put Raymar on Tucker, but once he got in a little
bit of foul trouble we just couldn't do it. Walton did a good job on him, but
what I needed was Walton to cover five guys, and that's not able to happen.  
  
Q. Suton really carried you in the first half when nothing else was working.
What happened with his production in the second half?  
COACH TOM IZZO: That's a good question. I really don't know. I think they did
a nice job of adjusting to him. I think they were stepping up on picks a
little harder, and we just couldn't get Drew in position. I think Flowers did
do a good job on him, but I think he answered that correctly. I thought
Krabbenhoft jumped up on him a lot. We missed some shots or -- we missed some
shots. We missed some free throws.  
You look at the free throws, I mean, 5 of 11, and we missed two or three front
ends of a one-on-one. We didn't get to the line enough, and this summer I'm
going to spend time just driving the ball and getting fouled. I think that's
the best offense right now.  
  
Q. Just to piggy-back a little bit on that with Drew, was there anything
special they did or was it just kind of an off night for him from the field?  
COACH TOM IZZO: I don't think he got a lot of good looks. You've got to give
him credit. I don't think he had a lot of good looks. I thought he had a good
look the first time; I thought he got fouled on to be honest with you. I don't
know if that got in his head. But then he didn't take a couple shots and came
off those screens and he tried to drive it to the hole.  
I can't tell you how hard it is to play without Morgan on this team. We're not
good enough. We're not good enough to start without him. We're not good enough
without him playing. The 24 minutes looks like he played a decent amount, but
when you play half of them in the foul trouble he's in and he's just got to
quit the charge, the last one, I don't know what to say to him. He played
eight minutes at Wisconsin, and we're not good enough to beat a top five team
with our second-best player sitting on the bench half the game, that's for
sure.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time.

# [BIG TEN COFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+COFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2007

  

### [Michael Flowers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17046)

### [Kammron Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17048)

### [Alando Tucker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17047)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
COACH BO RYAN: Well, I'm just proud of the way our guys played. We fought
through some things. We didn't get off to a great start in the second half but
fought through it and found ourselves on the offensive end and did a little
bit better job defensively. But that one run Michigan State had, that's how
they can play. They can cut into any lead, so it didn't feel safe until the
final buzzer, to be honest with you.  
  
Q. Michael, what was the difference for you on Neitzel tonight? You seemed
to block him better than you had the previous two games.  
MICHAEL FLOWERS: Well, there wasn't that much difference. Coach has been on me
trying to tell me to play disciplined defense. That's what I did. And today
some of the shots weren't falling and in the previous two games, those were
the same shots he was taking, but they were falling.  
  
Q. Alando, can you talk about the help you got specifically from teammates
kind of picking you up as you were struggling there a little bit in the first
half, and also talk about how important that will be now until Sunday and then
through the end of the NCAA Tournament in March, to get that kind of help from
everybody else?  
ALANDO TUCKER: I wouldn't say I was struggling (laughter). My teammates, they
were getting open, and that's one of the things that we've been making a
conscious effort on doing the whole season. When I get the ball, no one stands
around. Mike (Flowers) came out hot, and Kam (Taylor), and that's what we
need. When my teammates are doing that, they stretch the defense out, and
that's going to be big going down the stretch.  
  
Q. In the second half you guys started off slow offensively and Michigan
State was starting to catch up. I think you had 11 of the first 15 points that
the team scored. Was that a conscious effort, to try and keep the team afloat,
try and keep your head above water out there?  
ALANDO TUCKER: I was taking what the defense was giving me, and I knew at that
point in time that I had to step up. But it was one of those things that we
made some good calls, some good reads, and that's the way the ball drops
sometimes.  
So it was one of those things. I never tried to force the issue, but
everything just seemed to fall in place.  
  
Q. Kam and Mike, can you talk about your team, particularly on defense to
start the game and maybe the impact it had in the first half?  
KAMMRON TAYLOR: Well, we've just been trying to be more aggressive, especially
on the perimeter. We were just trying to keep them from getting open looks. We
didn't do a good job of that the first time we played them. But we just tried
to make a conscious effort of just picking up our man and basically just
harassing him and trying not to give him any good looks.  
  
Q. Kam, what was different for you today offensively than the other two
times you played Michigan State?  
KAMMRON TAYLOR: My shots were going in (laughter). I mean, that's it. I was
just being more aggressive on the defensive end as well.  
  
Q. Kam, what was the difference after halftime? It took you guys maybe about
seven minutes to score your first field goal in the second half. Was the
defense a little tougher coming out of half?  
KAMMRON TAYLOR: No, I don't think so. We just didn't do a good job with our
shot selection. Once we calmed down and started taking better shots. That is
when we caught ourselves.  
  
Q. This is for Alando. How conscious were you in the second half of how
close you were getting to the all-time points record for the University?  
ALANDO TUCKER: I never -- that never crosses my mind. Seriously.  
COACH BO RYAN: What is the record?  
  
Q. You were one short.  
ALANDO TUCKER: I never think about that. I'm thinking about winning. Had I not
done some things on the court, we'd have been going home. We'd be on a bus
back to Madison. That was my whole mind frame on the court. I never try to
think about records, and that's why I've been so successful, as well as the
team. We never think about records.  
  
Q. There were about four or five plays today where somebody was able to slip
underneath and get an easy layup. Was that just MSU falling asleep on defense
or good execution on your part?  
ALANDO TUCKER: It was good movement. The way they were playing me, when I'd
get the ball they were attacking me hard, and when our guys move they were
losing sight. Michigan State's defenders were losing sight of our offensive
players and I was able to find them. All of us, we always share the ball well.
That's one thing, if we're moving, that's Wisconsin basketball.  
  
Q. Michael, you talked after the game at East Lansing about how the team had
to do a good job of guarding the potential passers and Neitzel. Can you talk
about how your teammates helped you out tonight and just limiting the passes
to Neitzel?  
MICHAEL FLOWERS: Yeah, like Kam (Taylor) said, he was pressuring the ball
handler so that throws off their timing and Michigan State's offense is
primarily a timing, so Kam and (Alando) Tucker and Marcus (Landry), they were
pressuring the ball harder, and when Drew (Neitzel) was open, they weren't
able to connect, and I was able to catch up to them.  
  
Q. Alando, in the second half when you were getting hot you seemed to be
kind of showing, playing to the crowd a little bit. Was that just the
atmosphere or were you that excited to be making the shots?  
ALANDO TUCKER: It's emotion. You look at all my games, they're emotional. I'm
an emotional player regardless. It's the same thing if one of my teammates
make a play. I'm excited. It's just fun. This whole atmosphere, March Madness,
it's either win or go home, so you have to bring it all. That's one of the
things, when we're having fun, we're playing our best basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll finish up with questions for Coach Ryan, please.  
  
Q. After the technical, they were called for offensive fouls on three of
their next four possessions. Was that the point you were trying to get
across?  
COACH BO RYAN: No, not at all. It was just something on the defensive end, on
their defensive end, not on their offensive end.  
But it was just the way it was interpreted.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Greg's impact, especially on the
defensive end?  
COACH BO RYAN: Yeah, Greg (Stiemsma) is getting a little more comfortable. I
thought he moved his feet well, I thought his positioning was a lot better,
and this is a good opportunity for him.  
You have to understand our guys are human, and there isn't a team in Division
I that can't beat us, but to have played those 31 games the way we did, or 30
going into the Michigan State game at our place, and to say that because of an
injury to one of our players we're not as good a team, I thought -- I thought
you had to wait until you saw a team play a few times to look at it that way.  
Greg Steimsma, Marcus (Landry) and the other guys that have picked up for
Brian Butch, we just beat a team that ended up being by 13 that beat us at
their place by nine with Brian Butch. So Greg Steimsma is a big part of that.
We miss Brian. Every team would miss a guy that gave consistent numbers. But
to all of a sudden hear this conversation about Wisconsin with this injury is
not as good a team -- I'm not saying not a very good team, but is not as good
a team, wouldn't you want to just watch us play?  
So I thought our guys made a pretty good statement out there, the bigs that
game in and helped. Kevin Gullikson also came in and gave us some nice
minutes. And in all fairness to these young men, I say let them play. I don't
know what tomorrow is going to bring, but I thought they picked up for the
absence of a pretty good player and carried the load. That's my reaction.  
Talking about Greg Steimsma, Greg is one of those guys that got some of those
points in rebound, and the defense that he played. That's what he can bring.  
  
Q. Neitzel had eight assists today but didn't get his first field goal until
about ten minutes left. Was that the goal today to turn him into a passer
rather than a shooter?  
COACH BO RYAN: He's a smart player. He's going to do what's best for the team.
If he's got shots, he's going to take them; if he sees open guys he's going to
hit them. That's why he's a good player.

_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
COACH MATT PAINTER: Well, I thought the key for us coming out to play Iowa
really had nothing to do with the Big Ten Tournament or trying to get into the
NCAA Tournament. We played Iowa once this year in Iowa City and they
embarrassed us. They just flat man-handled us, took us to the woodshed, and
that was the one thing we tried to talk about all week was just trying to play
good basketball against Iowa and redeem ourselves, similar to what we did
against Indiana after they embarrassed us in Bloomington, and I thought our
guys responded. I thought they were aggressive. They were quicker to the
basketball. We won the battle on the boards, and I'm just proud of our
players. I thought they, in a big-time game, played very well but played very
hard, and that's what we have to do. We have to scrap and claw for everything,
and our guys just did a phenomenal job today being ready to play and going out
there and playing hard.  
  
Q. Dave, you picked up a couple of quick fouls and then Kramer came in and
just locked down Haluska. He was one-for-five from the field, and two games
against you he was 8 for 28. Can you just talk a little bit about what you did
to him, but also specifically the job Kramer did on him today?  
DAVID TEAGUE: (Chris) Kramer did a good job. Kramer has been one of our
defensive rocks all season. We had all the confidence in the world in matching
him up with (Adam) Haluska because we knew Kramer was tough and he could do a
good job of keeping Haluska out of his rhythm and making it tough on the shot
attempts. When I got in foul trouble, I think Kramer just took it upon his
shoulders not to let Haluska get going because he's the type of player that
can handle it and bring those guys back in and take over the basketball game,
and he just did a phenomenal job.  
  
Q. Carl, what was the difference for you this time against Iowa as opposed
to the time you played them last time?  
CARL LANDRY: I just tried to play hard, tried to stay aggressive. The first
game they were double teaming me from the top, from the bottom, from the side.
I was expecting it this game and tried to stay as tough as I could with the
ball and tried to find my open teammates and that's what we did tonight and
came out with the win.  
  
Q. Dave, as Matt just talked about, it seemed like you guys definitely came
out with a sense of urgency. Was the impetus behind that the fact that you
guys have been beaten so bad by Iowa before or was it starting the Big Ten
Tournament, obviously the NCAA Tournament? Just what was the crux behind the
emotion you guys came out with?  
DAVID TEAGUE: I think it was, first and foremost, being embarrassed down in
Iowa City. We only had one chance to play those guys in conference play, so we
knew this game was big from a revenge standpoint, and then it being the Big
Ten Tournament kind of added some fuel to the fire. We knew this was a big
game for us and to avenge that loss we knew we had to come out and be
aggressive but be smart on the defensive end and take some things away and
just be ready to play, something that we weren't ready to do in Iowa City. We
made drastic changes I think from an effort standpoint, and it showed early in
the ballgame.  
  
Q. Tarrance, it looked like you were able to get in transition so much.
Obviously I know what you love. What was going well for you this game that did
not go well in Iowa City? What did you guys see and were able to break down?  
TARRANCE CRUMP: I just tried a little harder and tried to take it to our
advantage. A couple times I got the ball on the break and I saw things and I
just tried to make plays and tried to help because they went down to two
fouls. We had to step up on the defensive end and I just took what they gave
me.  
  
Q. Carl, looking ahead tomorrow you'll probably get the task of guarding
Greg Oden. Can you tell us what that will be like?  
CARL LANDRY: He's one of the best players in the country and he's one of the
best low post players in the country, a great defender, an all-around good
player. It's just going to be tough. So tomorrow I'm just going to have to be
hooked up, try to take away some of his strong things that he does and make
him go to his weak points.  
  
Q. Tarrance, when this team has been good this year the bench has been good,
and today you did some good things defensively, but to provide 24 points on 10
of 13 shooting, could you just talk about the collective trio off the bench,
how big it was today?  
TARRANCE CRUMP: It was very big, especially when Dave (Teague) went down. We
knew someone had to step up. We had prepared to play very hard, harder than
they played. They gave us some open looks and we made some plays.  
  
Q. This is for David and Carl. How confident are you guys now that you're in
the NCAA Tournament, and do you belong, maybe lobby for that?  
DAVID TEAGUE: I feel like we've got a lot of work to do. Our goal was to come
here and win the tournament. We really can't look past Ohio State right now
and look to the NCAA tournament until our business is finished here.  
We still feel like we're in a good position to have a chance at winning this
tournament, and then from there we'll be a lock. If we win the tournament
we'll be a guaranteed seed in the NCAA Tournament. That's our main objective
first and foremost.  
  
Q. Carl, it seemed like in the first half you were seeing kind of the
swarming sort of defense that you saw from them in Iowa City, but then in the
second half it seemed like maybe you had a little more room. Did they change
something in the second half because you guys were shooting the three pretty
well?  
CARL LANDRY: Yeah, we started knocking down shots from the perimeter. David
(Teague) did a good job in the beginning, the first half, so did Chris Lutz
and the rest of my teammates. They have to focus on them guys more, and I was
able to get some position down low and get some baskets.  
  
Q. David, will it feel odd rooting for Illinois tonight because Illinois is
another bubble team?  
DAVID TEAGUE: No, I'm still not rooting for IU (laughter). It'll be good if
they won it and our chances were good, but I still can't root for IU no matter
how it shakes out. We just know we have to do what we have to do to take care
of our own business, to take care of business, but I still can't root for the
Hoosiers.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll finish up with questions for Coach Painter now.  
  
Q. I asked the players, but obviously David gets those two fouls and that
part of the game was maybe the key part of the game. Haluska, just he couldn't
do anything against him. Talk about how important that segment was and the job
that Kramer did on him.  
COACH MATT PAINTER: (Chris) Kramer started on him even when David was in the
game, so it wasn't like David got in foul trouble and we had to switch up. We
had David guarding in Iowa City and he did a good job and everybody else just
killed us. So we thought it was better for Chris to guard him and just to stay
with him the whole time and wear him down, similar to what we tried to do with
(Michigan State's Drew) Neitzel, just stay with him at times and don't give a
lot of help.  
There's some risk to how we defend players like Adam Haluska and Drew Neitzel.
I think Chris (Kramer) just has a strong will and a lot of discipline and
knows what's going on and when to go for steals and when not to go for steals.
I thought he did a good job on him. But I think that the key to our game was
just being aggressive and not letting those other guys go wild.  
Tyler Smith is a very good player. He scored points against us the first time.
But the key was not letting (Tony) Freeman and (Mike) Henderson and (Seth)
Gorney and Cyrus Tate combine for 40 points like they did in the first
meeting.  
  
Q. Talk about the importance of this win in terms of your NCAA tournament
resume. Do you belong in the tournament now do you think?  
COACH MATT PAINTER: Well, I felt that we belonged in the tournament before. It
doesn't necessarily mean you're going to get in. There's always a handful of
teams that get left out that deserve to be in it. I felt that we were one of
those teams, right there, either a little bit in or a little bit out, and
hopefully this helped our chances.  
You can't control that. The only thing you can control is how you prepare your
team and get them ready, and we're just getting ready for Ohio State, and if
it's enough, it's enough. If it's not, then there's not a whole lot you can do
about it.  
  
Q. Just to clarify then, your game plan, I know in some games you kind of
rotate guards on people like Neitzel and stuff, but do you really envision
Chris being kind of the guy in this game keeping him on them most of the
time?  
COACH MATT PAINTER: Exactly, yeah.  
  
Q. There was a time you got off to a good start and there was a time in the
first half where you lose David, and they were into the line a lot, which as
you know Iowa usually strokes it and they missed a bunch of free throws. Were
you thinking maybe then, maybe we dodged a bullet a little bit and the game is
kind of going our way?  
COACH MATT PAINTER: We were fortunate they missed some free throws in that
stretch. Our pressure was a little counterproductive at times because they
were getting some free points by us putting our hands on them. But with us,
when we've done that before and people went to the free throw line and we'd
back up, it's not been good.  
We lose our aggressive style and how we play and how we get after it and
pursuing the basketball and making that next play, and so we just tried to
stay with it and just kind of regroup a little bit and talk about playing more
with our feet and still putting pressure on the ball, and then at times give
it a little bit more help off non-shooters and talking to each other out
there.  
But I thought that was the reason why we got our lead, but it was also the
reason why they were cutting it, chipping away at the lead at the one time. We
just tried to stay with it and play a little bit smarter than we had before.  
  
Q. Marcus Green has obviously been spotty for you guys this year, but he
played pretty well.  
COACH MATT PAINTER: Spotty is a good word.  
  
Q. He played pretty well tonight, and then obviously Tarrance, and Chris
gave you some things when he was on the court. Can you just talk about that
package?  
COACH MATT PAINTER: Well, I thought Marcus Green gave us a boost and was able
to score the ball for us, and that's what we need him to do. He has struggled
with that. It's tough. It's like a pinch hitter in baseball and trying to get
some consistency. It's just a tough role to play when you're a shooter because
you never really get that rhythm because you don't play a lot of minutes. But
tonight he was great for us and I thought he did a pretty good job
defensively.  
Obviously when Tarrance (Crump) is able to break down the defense it gives us
another look, and he did that tonight and made some plays, especially in the
first half, and then (Chris) Lutz got into foul trouble but he hit a big
three, and then he gets three assists, no turnovers, which is very important.  
  
Q. It seemed like in the first half he got that kind of swarming, trapping
defense that he got in Iowa City, then maybe it looked like there was a little
bit more room for him in the second half. Is that a product of these guys
knocking down some shots or you spreading the floor a little bit more? Did you
change anything strategically?  
COACH MATT PAINTER: No, I was just trying to tell them to pass the basketball
and not shoot it so quickly. David (Teague) hit two right away, Carl (Landry)
hit one right away. There's half of them in the first five minutes.  
Keaton Grant hit one in the first half, Marcus Green hit one in the second
half. We had one three we hit in the second half. It didn't really have
anything to do with our ability to make perimeter shots. I thought if we were
patient and moved the ball and hit spacing on the defensive end we could do
things. If we rushed things or forced things or tried to pass it into him
after two or three passes they are going to be able to swarm him.  
I thought at times in the second half we didn't play really smart. I thought
if we could put them on defense we were in a great position, and when we did
that, we either got to the free throw line or we got a good look.  
  
Q. When last you saw Ohio State in Columbus, you kind of got them into a
grind-it-out game, was pretty low scoring. Is that kind of what your hope is
for tomorrow, or are you feeling pretty good about where you guys are with
your up tempo where maybe pace is not a big deal?  
COACH MATT PAINTER: I don't know if pace is a big deal with us. I think at
times we have to steal points, whether that's in transition or on the glass.
We have to be able to steal points and we have to be efficient from the free-
throw line. I think that's more important to us than the pace of the game. I
don't know if we have enough guys where we can dictate that, either, for how
they play.  
They are similar to how the fab five were when I played in the Big Ten. A lot
of people didn't realize how good they were in the half court. When you think
of the Fab Five and you think of up and down, running all the time, and I
think Ohio State, they have a lot of weapons, a lot of talent, but if they
don't get in the open court and they bait and they let the big fellow come
down or (Othello) Hunter come down, they're pretty good and they spread you.  
Whether it gets up tempo or it stays in the half court, I think Ohio State has
proven they have a lot of success no matter how the game gets played out.  
  
Q. That's kind of what I was going to ask you. Is Ohio State as good as
advertised, and what would it take for you to be successful against them?  
COACH MATT PAINTER: I think they're very good, and I think some of the close
losses they've had at home, whether that was to us or Penn State, to Michigan
State, especially the fashion how Michigan State unfolded with them being up
20 at the half and Maurice Joseph having a three to win it, I think it
strengthens a young team because they get in those close games where they've
had big leads, or they beat us by 18 points and they turn around ten days
later and play us again and now with five minutes to go it's a possession
game. So I think that strengthens Ohio State.  
They're very good. They're very talented. For me to gauge them against the
other teams in the top ten that we haven't played, that's hard to do.  
I just think Greg Oden is very good. He's a game changer. Regardless if he
makes a shot or not. He's a game changer. He makes you adjust what you're
trying to do at all times, and then when you bring in Hunter as a backup, I
think if he played probably for anybody else and got touches, he'd be an all-
conference type guy. I think he probably will be next year.  
They bring Daequan Cook off the bench and that says it all for me because I
think the world of him. He's very talented, and we'll see in the next few
years how talented he'll be.  
  
Q. Your message to your team tonight, will it be in part, guys, this was a
great opportunity, you're on national television, playing the No. 1 team in
the country, used to play in these games, haven't played in one in a long time
and this is a great opportunity not just to polish up your resume but it's a
great opportunity for the program. Will you mention any of that to them?  
COACH MATT PAINTER: I'll just mention the same thing that I mentioned about
playing Iowa. Iowa embarrassed you. Now we have to kind of get back and get
that respect back and prove to Iowa and their program that we're pretty good.
I think that's first and foremost for us. We've been down and out a little
bit, and we've had some tough times. We've had some tough years, and now I
think we're going in the right direction, but we still haven't beaten Ohio
State.  
I just ask them to work hard and be efficient and play smart and play harder
than them and put themselves in the same position they did in Columbus and
then don't play like your hair is on fire the last five minutes of the game.
For us that has a lot to do with Ohio State. I thought they stepped it up, but
we put ourselves in a great position there and we weren't able to convert. You
only get those opportunities so often to play a team of that caliber, and now
we have that opportunity again, but we have to put ourselves in that position
first before we can talk about it.

# [BIG TEN COFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+COFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2007

  

### [Warren Carter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16999)

### [Trent Meacham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17059)

### [Shaun Pruitt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17060)

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: It was kind of typical of the first two games, just hard-
fought games. Both teams I think showed some toughness. We both defend pretty
well. We know each other well and don't give each other easy looks. We had the
good start, they had the good middle of the half, first half, then we kind of
kept it close.  
I told them at halftime, we haven't played well at all and it's a three-point
game. It's the same type of game that was at our place, and we got going
second half. Then they punched back and hit the threes. But we didn't quit and
some things went our way, some plays went our way, and we made just enough
free throws to find a way to win it. It was a gut-check. Our kids, I'm so
proud of them. They've been so resilient all year. It seems like we just keep
getting knocked down, things happening, and they just haven't quit.  
We talked about if we could get to Saturday, we'd feel pretty comfortable
about an NCAA bid. I guess you never know, but we've talked about this, let's
fight through tomorrow, see if we can find a way to beat Wisconsin and get to
something, then you know you're guaranteed of something.  
  
Q. Shaun, I was just wondering if you could talk about that last sequence
when you shot four times and scored. You started off with the fadeaway. How
did you get back under the basket so quickly to get the first rebound?  
SHAUN PRUITT: When I missed the shots and got the rebound? My legs were kind
of dead and I really thought they were going to foul me, so I didn't want to
go to the free-throw line, so I just had to put it in. I don't know. We just
had a great effort tonight.  
  
Q. Warren, can you talk about what it feels like to win these two games and
get to Saturday, and Coach was saying this was a pretty key win.  
WARREN CARTER: It's definitely a big feeling. It's a big win for our team,
gives us some confidence going into the Wisconsin game, especially here in
Chicago. We had so many guys show up tonight. One of those guys, he made some
big free throws down the stretch for us and we've just got to enjoy it a
little bit and get focused for Wisconsin.  
  
Q. Warren, at the end you made some defensive plays. This turned out to be a
nice night for the big guys. Did you and Shaun talk about that, the way the
game was evolving?  
WARREN CARTER: Me and Shaun always joke around, we say Shake and Bake off of
Talladega Nights. Whenever our front court can do well, whenever our team can
go inside out, I think that's always a good sign for us. Especially when teams
go man, we always look to get the ball inside to Shaun and we try and play off
of him.  
  
Q. Could you talk about getting this done in the United Center? You guys
have a pretty good run going on here, and being from the area, do you guys get
a little extra push from this building? Just talk about that.  
SHAUN PRUITT: Yeah, we definitely do. I think it's like a second home for us.
We always have a great crowd of family and friends who come see us. We love
the support, and we have a pretty good record here, and we're not going to be
able to play here in the Big Ten Tournament for probably like five years or
something like that, so we don't be here. We just want to take advantage of
the opportunity to play here.  
  
Q. Shaun, you look pretty tired right now. You've admitted it. How much will
you have in the tank for tomorrow's game? How deep will you have to dig?  
SHAUN PRUITT: I should be good, as long as I can get some fluids and get some
rest. I like to play basketball, so I'm going to be ready.  
  
Q. If you guys are Shake and Bake, who's Ricky and who's Cal?  
WARREN CARTER: I'm Shake. I'm Ricky Bobby.  
SHAUN PRUITT: I'm going to take Bake. He's Shake, I'm Bake.  
  
Q. Warren, talk about this game. Does this game kind of summarize you guys'
whole season the way it turned out?  
WARREN CARTER: We've definitely had so many games like this that have come
down to the wire, and a lot of them didn't go our way. Finally we closed out a
game. We finally got the guys that we need.  
Like I said yesterday, our team is where we need to be now, and we're just
going to stick together and try to make a push to the end of this thing.  
  
Q. Trent, for you sitting out last year and then obviously playing a pretty
big role all through this season, how does it feel for you personally to get a
win that maybe gets you into the NCAA tournament?  
TRENT MEACHAM: It's tough sitting out, but I wanted to help in any way I
could. Tonight was a big game for the NCAA bubble. I'm tired of all the talk,
I just want to play. I'm tired, but for tomorrow I just want to play and help
the team.  
  
Q. Following up for any of you guys, even though it's not over until it's
over, do you feel you can exhale a little bit now in terms of the NCAA
Tournament?  
TRENT MEACHAM: Personally we've been playing in a sense of urgency the past
three weeks and we've got to keep that. Right now our focus is Wisconsin and
trying to win this Big Ten Tournament, then we'll look to the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about how big Shaun played today? It's kind of an era
where so many teams don't even have a true center. I was just wondering if he
played like a throwback true center tonight?  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: His development over the past three years has been
astronomical, just starting with the conditioning and strength, and then once
he could keep up with the game, now just kind of getting to post game. He's
making the next step now of kind of learning the post, how to steal, how to
look for the next pass, little things that can make a player more effective. I
think then if we can go the next step with just even taking another step and
really putting in the time this next summer.  
Probably the biggest thing he's done is he defends much better, and obviously
we've defended here this last stretch, and tonight those guys did a great job
on (D.J.) White, between Warren and him, and Brian Randle, we post trapped
him, made him kick it out, we rotated, just made it very difficult for them to
get easy looks.  
  
Q. Could you talk about what was going through your mind when Shaun is
missing and rebounding and rebounding and missing, and just the overall
feelings after coaching a game like this.  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: Well, I guess that play maybe showed it was kind of
typified our effort today in the game. We just didn't quit, kept going, kept
going. I think maybe early in the year, maybe the shot wouldn't have went in
and they would have picked up the rebound. That would have been kind of
typical of what we went through. We kept talking about, hey, we were here in
this same spot at their place, we didn't execute down the stretch. We didn't
execute on defense or offense. We didn't really break down at the end, and
that was key. We broke down at Indiana, at Bloomington, and we also broke down
at Iowa City, and tonight we didn't. So I guess we keep improving as a team.  
  
Q. In terms of looking forward to what you have to do these next two days in
the tournament, your guard play, your starting guards the first three quarters
of the game, they just defended well or they were not in sync? It was a big
man's game.  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: Well, we haven't scored well. We've struggled -- a lot of
it, people say we're making excuses, we just haven't had guys in practice.
We've talked about it all year. Our strength is getting it inside, and if
we're patient getting it inside, now we can kind of play off of it. We've
struggled. Rich (Semrau) has struggled. I really felt bad for him but he still
played 41 minutes and he defended. He does all the little things that help us
win. He's checked his ego in, and that's difficult for a kid to do in this day
and age. All he cares about is helping us win. I'm so happy for him and for
all the guys that we're able to have a nice stretch run here and build it up
to 23 wins and see if we can make a run at getting Wisconsin tomorrow. It will
not be easy. Obviously they're very, very good. But who knows. A lot of people
didn't think we could do some things, and maybe we can find a way to figure it
out tomorrow.  
  
Q. Talk about the play of Calvin Brock tonight. He didn't score a lot of
points but he did a lot of other things for you. Elaborate on that.  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: Well, obviously Trent (Meacham) did some nice things.
Marcus (Arnold) had some minutes defending on (D.J.) White, and then Calvin
really gave us a nice boost early, got some buckets. Has a tendency sometimes
to go too fast. But if he just stays settled down, they just decided to put
White on our three-man and put (Xavier) Keeling or White on Shaun early. Shaun
kept just posting up, they'd push him off the block, and then second half,
halftime we talked about getting deep. So now we're able to run Calvin, run
Brian (Randle), make White run around, and sooner or later he's going to not
be able to catch up with those guys. Calvin got a couple little short jump
shots, got a couple post feeds, and the bench was very important for us
tonight.  
  
Q. For you to see them play like this, considering this year and it's been
very difficult, for you is there a level of satisfaction to make this level?  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: Well, I'm proud of them and our staff and the kids, and
they haven't quit. It seems like the whole season nothing would go right. Just
when you maybe feel like you're getting over the hump something else pops up.  
It's been a long, hard season. It was a long, hard game. But it's not over
yet. We're hanging in there, Illini are hanging in there and they've got 23
wins and they're playing on Saturday in the Big Ten Tournament.  
  
Q. How do you think you're different and Wisconsin is different since the
game you played against them?  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: Well, that was a dog fight. We had a chance, we took the
lead under four and then (Greg) Steimsma made the big shots for them and we
couldn't find a way to make some shots.  
I think a lot of it, we do have a decent match-up for (Alando) Tucker. (Brian)
Randle, if we can keep him out of foul trouble, we can at least do that. I
think the key will be do we have enough energy to deal with Kam Taylor and
(Michael) Flowers. I think that will be the key thing, and then we've got to
find a way to score. Bo (Ryan) does a great job of defending. They play the
pack and just make it really difficult on you.  
Obviously we struggle scoring, so we're going to have to figure something out,
go back, eat something quick, get started watching tape and hopefully by
tomorrow morning come up with a little game plan for the kids after breakfast.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks for your time, Coach.

# [BIG TEN COFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+COFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2007

  

### [Earl Calloway](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17061)

### [Kelvin Sampson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13715)

### [D.J. White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17062)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: First of all, congratulations to Illinois. I thought
their team defended and rebounded. I thought they showed great toughness
tonight, and I thought our team did, too, two teams that just really guarded
each other. We hold them to 35 percent, we shoot 31 percent. Both teams only
turn it over ten times. It's just hard to find a good shot. Both teams are
good defensive teams. When you have two teams that play this way, it's going
to be a low-scoring game.  
At the end of the overtime, at the end of our regulation, a couple thoughts.
One was to throw the ball to D.J. (White) and run something for him. But the
only thing clean we probably could have gotten for him was maybe a -- they
were trapping the ball screen so hard, maybe pick and pop, release him off the
screen for a jumper.  
But the way they were clogging the lane and defending ball screens and
doubling him on the posts, we felt like if we could push everybody to the
baseline and give our man some space on top that he'd get a good look and he
did. He had a clean look, but just missed it.  
We had our chances. Second half, Illinois made a run, they went up, we came
back, went up four. Then we had the foul I think that was called on us on the
post when the kid made the three. He missed them both, right? I thought that
was a big play. It looked like we'd get the ball back up three.  
If you have the ball and a three-point lead with a minute to go or around a
minute to go, I thought that would have been huge for us. But still, we had a
chance to win the game, just couldn't get it done tonight.  
Another big possession in the overtime was I think (Shaun) Pruitt had three
offensive rebounds and a put-back there towards the end.  
But both teams played hard and both teams competed. We came up a little short.  
  
Q. Earl, how much is your shoulder still bothering you? It looked like when
you were heading to the basket you kind of held up except for that last drive.
Is it a concern going to the rim and making contact?  
EARL CALLOWAY: No, it's not a concern. Certain holes I can see and certain
holes I can't. I try not to force it. If it's a clear lane I take it, but the
main thing was to create for others because my shots were not falling, so I
was trying not to force anything. I'm fine.  
  
Q. D.J., can you just talk about the physical battle tonight? You were
obviously involved with a lot of rebounds, just a defensive battle. What was
it like being involved in that for 45 minutes?  
D.J. WHITE: Well, it came down to the wire. I just tried to go in and help my
team rebound. We came up -- the possession Coach talked about at the end, we
didn't come up with a critical rebound when (Shaun) Pruitt got three offensive
rebounds and a put-back. We just didn't find a way at that point to get the
rebound.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll finish up with questions for Coach Sampson.  
  
Q. How do you feel about your team going into the NCAA Tournament? Are you
okay with the way you're playing right now?  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: I just think we struggle making plays, but we're
capable. If we defend like we have defended the last few games, I think we'll
be okay. We can't survive when Rod (Wilmont) and Earl (Calloway) go 2-for-17.
We're not good enough to overcome that. We were good enough to win this game
and I think we're good enough to win games in the tournament.  
But I've said all year long, where we started and where we finished, we became
a pretty good team. But that was it. At no point this year were we really good
or very good or great. That's just not who we are.  
But I'm proud of these kids. We had a lot of opportunities tonight. By about
3:00 o'clock in the morning I'll have this thing figured out (laughter).
There's another play, Armon (Bassett) made a great pass to D.J. (White) where
it looked like he had a dunk. You've got to make plays. That would have put us
back ahead.  
But we just didn't do that. Rod and Earl -- obviously Rod has carried us the
last couple games, and Armon and A.J. (Ratliff) shot the ball well from the
perimeter. We didn't turn it over a lot. Just didn't have a lot of good looks.
But I give Illinois a lot of credit for that. I thought they defended us well.  
  
Q. You touched on this before, but you weren't -- it didn't appear you were
able to get the ball into D.J. very much in the second half.  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: Well, we did get it to him a lot, he just didn't get a
lot of shots. They did a good job monstering him. It's like (Shaun) Pruitt, we
did a good job monstering him too. But he got a lot of his points off the
offensive boards. If you look at his nine shot attempts, I'd say five of them
came off second shots and in some situations maybe even third shots.  
But our game plan was not to let Pruitt get to his right shoulder and have his
way. But I can't say anything -- our defense was good. Both teams' defenses
played well. We just -- if Armon makes the basket, we go home a winner. That
was a good look, but just didn't make it. That's the way it goes in
tournaments. It would have been nice to win it in regulation.  
THE MODERATOR: Appreciate your time, Coach. Thank you.

# [BIG TEN COFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+COFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2007

  

### [Tommy Amaker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14047)

### [Dion Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16977)

### [Brent Petway](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16976)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: Obviously, they're very talented, very deep, and I think
every time we were trying to get to a position to put even more game pressure
on them, they certainly had an answer. And obviously with (Greg) Oden on the
interior for their team, they can always throw it in there. We didn't do a
good enough job obviously of pushing him out further from the block. But
that's difficult to do.  
But I give them a lot of credit. I thought we did some tremendous things on
the glass. I thought we were active and had a lot of obviously second chance
opportunities, but certainly not enough offensive fire power to be able to put
the game away. We put more game pressure on their ball club.  
  
Q. Dion, why did it seem like some of the things you guys did offensively
against Ohio State in the first game, why did they seem less effective
today?  
DION HARRIS: I don't know. I just thought we didn't shoot the ball well. I
think that had something to do with it. Not to take anything away from them, I
thought they did a good job of shutting down some driving lanes for us, things
like that.  
But looking at the field goals and all, I don't think we shot that well. I
think that had something to do with us not executing our offense and scoring
baskets.  
  
Q. What's the mood in the locker room right now? How are you guys feeling?
How disappointed are you? How ready are you to move on? What's kind of the
general feeling?  
DION HARRIS: Of course we're disappointed. This is a big game for us in the
Big Ten Tournament. But with us, we've always done a good job of taking that
in and looking at things and what happened in games before and then moving on,
addressing things and then moving on.  
  
Q. This is for Dion: Did you happen to notice the new Ohio State uniforms,
and especially being a Michigan kid, what did you think of them and the
changes that they're trying to do?  
DION HARRIS: I don't know. I mean, obviously they were new uniforms, but I
don't think we paid much attention to that. We had a game to play, so I don't
know.  
  
Q. Brent, can you talk about your team and specifically your effort on the
offensive glass, just what you were trying to do? You did it against Minnesota
and here today, too. What was the adjustment during the regular season for the
Big Ten Tournament about offensive rebounding and especially today?  
BRENT PETWAY: I wouldn't say it was so much of an adjustment that we made. We
may have given it a little more effort. We were tipping a lot of balls out and
our guards were a little bit more alert, I believe, getting to those loose
balls when we were able to get in and tip them out. I think the whole season
really, I think we've always gone to the glass pretty hard, and again, that's
the emphasis we have in our program is to rebound offensively and defensively.  
  
Q. For both Dion and Brent, you guys had obviously made the NCAA Tournament
a goal this year. Right now it looks like you're not going to make it. Very
close. How come? What will you point to as to why you didn't quite get
there?  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: I don't think that's fair to say that we will not make it,
so I don't think we have that information to answer that question. So I don't
think you should ask them what would point to why we didn't make it. We
haven't been told we're not going to be included in that tournament yet. I
think that's fair. I don't think we should assume that right now and ask those
kids to have an answer for something that is not proven to be accurate yet.  
  
Q. Brent, how tough is it to handle Oden offensively and defensively,
especially late in the game when they can kind of dump it into him?  
BRENT PETWAY: Yeah, he's a load down there. He's a great player. He has his
size and he knows how to use it. It's tough to match up with him and not foul.
It's tough to stay out of foul trouble. We had that happen to us. That hurt us
a little bit. Again, you've just got to give him credit. He knows how to play
the game and use his size.  
  
Q. Do you guys think there's a chance you're in the NCAA tournament?  
BRENT PETWAY: I think we've always got a chance to get in. We played, we've
shown we have the ability to win some games. Again, it's up to the committee.
No one knows that answer.  
DION HARRIS: I agree with what Brent said.  
  
Q. Dion, was there anything they did specifically to you on defense that
kind of held you down, or was it just missing shots?  
DION HARRIS: I mean, if you look at the stats sheet, I didn't shoot
particularly well. I don't think I did a good job probably trying to go get
shots and make sure I worked hard for open shots like I did in the previous
games.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll finish with questions for Coach Amaker.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys really seemed like you stole the momentum in the second
half there getting it down to three, but then Oden came back and really
established himself and was dominant. Is there any reason you guys didn't
double-team him more during the game and let somebody else try and beat you
the way he asserted himself?  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: We've had a strategy playing their team the two previous
times and obviously it wasn't good enough to win the basketball games, but we
haven't been a team that's actually doubled that much in the post. I thought
that if we could make him try to score over the top of us a little. We didn't
do a good job of pushing him further out from the basket. I thought his post
position was so deep that it put us at a disadvantage. I like the strategy
we've had and we've been within striking distance with this ball club. I
thought we had opportunities, and every time we had one, we couldn't push it
over the top. We certainly felt we had a solid strategy of trying to go at
Ohio State.  
  
Q. Do you think you're in the NCAA tournament?  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: I don't know. I don't know if anyone knows the answer to
who's in the tournament. There's no need for me to answer a question that I
have no knowledge or input to make a reality. We're hopeful. We've done so
many things to put ourselves in position, but certainly a lot of teams are in
the same boat that we're in, so who knows.  
  
Q. Should you be in it and if so, why?  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: We're hopeful. We're hopeful that we can be included in
that, and if we aren't, we'll take the next step, whatever that may be.  
  
Q. Last year when you got the news that you were not in, you were very good
about saying we had our season, we had our chances, we're not going to gripe
or complain about it. Obviously you don't know what's going to happen, but do
you look at the season and say we did the best we could do and do you feel the
same as last year?  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: Again, it's premature for me to answer it. We're coming
off a loss, and if we get a chance to revisit the year a little bit and
reflect, right now I don't think it's the time for me to reflect on the whole
year.  
If we would like to talk about the basketball game today, I'm more than happy
to do that.  
  
Q. Where do you go from here? Do you sit and wait for Sunday? Do you meet
with the team?  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: We'll meet with our ball club as we normally will and see
what the next step is for us for this season, whatever that may be. We'll try
to look forward to it and do the best we can.  
  
Q. You went from 41 percent in the first half to your team shooting just
over 25 percent in the second half. What did they do different after the
break?  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: Well, certainly we didn't shoot the ball well in this
tournament, yesterday nor today. I thought our guards in particular took the
majority of our shots, didn't shoot well from the outside. I don't have an
answer right now what they did differently. I'm not sure that they probably
had a different strategy to change. We didn't shoot a great 41 percent. It's
not lighting it up. So I'm not sure they changed much.  
I thought we missed some opportunities We missed some chances to get a few
lay-ups when we had a fast break opportunity. I thought it was deflating for
us. No excuses. We didn't shoot the ball well and certainly it hurt us.
Yesterday it hurt us somewhat and certainly it hurt us against a very talented
Ohio State team today.  
  
Q. Having a 21-8 rebounding edge and down by six to Ohio State, what did you
tell the team coming out of the locker room?  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: Well, we certainly felt that we missed a one-and-one with
17 seconds left to go in the half, and then they came down and scored at the
end of the half with (Mike) Conley's shot. We thought we had a chance to close
the gap, we thought we did a tremendous job on the glass, and hopefully we
could continue that in the second half. We really felt that our ability to box
them out was going to be critical, and they were doing that for us. Our kids
were doing it. And then we thought if we could attack their zone, we thought
we were playing too much on the perimeter, not working the ball out for shots,
so we concentrated on those three or four things, and that was pretty much
what we talked about at halftime.  
  
Q. When you guys were leading in the rebounding category there for a while,
and when you do that you can get in transition, did you want to get into a
transition game, or did you feel like, you know, we really don't want to run
with this team? Was there something in that strategy where you did not want to
run or did you try to get in the transition game?  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: Well, we wanted to try and see if we could get easy
buckets. They're hard to score against in a half-court set. Obviously they're
big and physical and deep especially across the front line. We felt if we
could get something out on the floor and get a primary or fast-break
opportunity to get an easy bucket early, we certainly wanted that, and
certainly that wasn't the case for us today.

# [BIG TEN COFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+COFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2007

  

### [Steve Alford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17050)

### [Adam Haluska](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17052)

### [Tyler Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17051)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
COACH STEVE ALFORD: We obviously didn't play very well, and I think Purdue had
a lot to do with that. So my congratulations to Purdue. They were the better
defensive team today. It's almost a reversal of the last time we played them.
I thought we did a much better job the first time against their bench, and
this time it was 25-to-8, their bench dominated us. I thought our defense, our
guys did a better job in game one defending, and this game Purdue was the
better defensive team. We couldn't make a free throw, couldn't make a three,
and I think that ended up making for a pretty lopsided outing.  
  
Q. Adam, you've had two tough games now against Purdue. Any difference?  
ADAM HALUSKA: No, I just thought they defended well as a team. I thought for
the most part they got after all of us, and it's just one of those things
where the ball wasn't going down. But it started on our defensive end. I
thought we did a poor job, and it definitely wasn't a good performance overall
for our team.  
  
Q. Tyler, do you think you guys were nervous? Was there any reason why
Purdue was kind of the aggressor today?  
TYLER SMITH: I don't think so. It's just their defense. They get up into you,
and we had no pressure for them today.  
  
Q. Adam, just talk if you could about kind of your thoughts walking off the
court, your last Big Ten game.  
ADAM HALUSKA: It's disappointing. I think we had high hopes of coming in here
and doing some damage. I was definitely looking forward to playing tomorrow
and going on and playing on Sunday, as well. But with an effort like that it
just wasn't very fun out there to give that kind of effort. We definitely
played bad, and it's just not one of our best efforts.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about how are you guys going to rebound now and kind of
regroup for an NIT.  
ADAM HALUSKA: I think first of all, we've just got to come in and have the
right mindset. It's the next step that's going to be our next game, and our
next opportunity to win a championship. I think this team is highly capable of
going in there and trying to win that thing. It wouldn't be bad to go in there
and end the season on a win, I'll tell you that. There's only two teams in the
entire nation that's going to end with a win. I wouldn't mind doing that,
especially my last year.  
  
Q. Adam, what's been the difference with this team between home and road?
You know, last week looking so good against Illinois. It just seems like on
the road this season it's been consistent and it's been a struggle at times?  
ADAM HALUSKA: I think that's a mystery we've got to figure out ourselves.
Coach alluded to it in the locker room. We play so well at home, and it seems
like when we go on the road or even at a neutral site, the energy is not
there. I think especially our defense. Forget the shooting; if you can't guard
you're not going to win games.  
  
Q. Tyler, how tough was Carl Landry today? Seemed like he really did a good
job of setting the tone down there in the paint.  
TYLER SMITH: Yeah, we did a great job on him at home. We knew he was going to
come back today and try to give us his best effort to our big man. We just
wasn't helping him out a lot.  
  
Q. Did you have any sense in practice this week that this was going to
happen?  
COACH STEVE ALFORD: No. I think Purdue really played well. Sometimes you've
got to congratulate who you play. I think they played -- they came out, they
made shots. You're on a neutral site, a place you haven't been in, and they
make shots early and we don't, and they got a ten-point lead early and then
really it never went -- we got it to nine or ten, they got it to 13 a couple
times.  
It got to the position it was real late in the game when we were fouling. But
it was really the first five, six, seven minutes. Once they got their lead, it
really stayed there throughout. One team had a good start to things and the
other team kind of got on their heels.  
You've got to give credit to Purdue. Their defense was very solid, they were
aggressive. But I think the first half -- we're down 13 at half and we really
should be down about six or seven.  
But our foul shooting was atrocious today. That's something that has been
really good. We were 10 for 19 the first half with two front ends that were
missed, so that's really 10 for 21. That's really bad foul shooting, and
that's something that's been really good for us all year. If you shoot 19 free
throws in the half, it's hard for me to be upset with our offense because we
got to the free throw line, we just didn't make foul shots. We had guys miss
two in a row. I think that lets the air out of your offense a little bit.  
And then their two big guns had big nights. I think, what did they combine, 35
and 19 out of their two big guns. (Tarrance) Crump was better tonight for
them, their bench outplayed our bench. So there's a lot of reasons but nothing
that we saw in practice. We practiced well, we're healthy. I think it was a
situation where one team got off to a better start and then we just couldn't
catch them.  
  
Q. It seemed like you sensed the team was not in the right mindset early in
the game. You called a time-out and gave it to them pretty good. What could
you tell about how come they didn't respond to that?  
COACH STEVE ALFORD: Well, I never called a timeout. My first timeout was with
25 seconds to go in the first half. I didn't call time. Maybe I should have
(laughing). But I just thought that we were on our heels and then we talked
about that all week, that we don't -- you can't come into a one-and-done
setting and be on your heels.  
You've got to give Purdue credit. They were the more aggressive team today,
and because of their aggressiveness they got a win.  
I think our inexperience, you look at some of the guys playing in their first
Big Ten Tournament, and it was pretty telling. Other than maybe Kurt (Looby)
and Tyler (Smith), the other guys kind of struggled with things. Mike
(Henderson) never got in the flow being a senior, and playing in his fourth
tournament. I don't think he got in the flow very much.  
I liked what Tony (Freeman) did. I thought Tony did some good things. I
thought Kurt really battled. I thought Kurt did some good things for us.  
  
Q. Talk about the NIT a little bit looking ahead. Talk about the differences
in the tournament now. In the old days you guys had probably known you would
host a game there, with the seating and the way things could go now, you guys
could end up with quick turnaround travel. Talk about the differences in the
NIT.  
COACH STEVE ALFORD: Well, it's a lot better now than what it's been five, six,
seven years ago. I think having a 32-team field and having it bracketed, the
way they do things now it's a lot better than you play a game and then you try
to figure out where you're playing again and who you're playing. It's much
more organized by a group that I think has been in college basketball and I
think understood college basketball. So I think that's all helped this
tournament.  
This is going to be a good tournament for our guys, it really is. They're down
right now, we're down. We were a bubble team coming in, and that pops our
bubble, so that's never fun.  
With that said, this team has done a lot of good things. I look at what
they've done in the league this year. To finish fourth in the league, to get a
fourth seed in the tournament. Nobody ever likes to play one game in this
tournament, but we lose in the quarterfinals. We played ourselves into a
quarterfinal match-up. It was our non-lead that got us. Play 14 games, you go
8-and-6, Mike was never in the flow because of an injury, that really affects,
and we're so young.  
We had some losses that hurt us. Obviously the loss at Drake hurts, the loss
at Arizona State hurts, the home loss to Northern Iowa. Those were losses that
they end up -- if you get those back, now you're sitting here at 20 and 11, a
little bit different scenario after finishing fourth in the Big Ten.  
We understand that, but all in all, I'm very pleased with what this group of
guys were able to do. They've been great to coach and a lot of fun to see how
they've advanced during the course of the year. Hopefully we'll be upset for a
while, but we're not going to find anything out until Sunday evening. So we'll
probably take tomorrow off, practice Sunday, and then late Sunday afternoon
into the evening we'll find out who we're playing.  
That's part of college basketball, you've got to move on. We get beat at Penn
State, we've got to turn around and beat a very good Illinois team. We did
that. We beat a good Illinois team. Got to turn around and play a good Purdue
team, we lose. We have to get up off the floor and try to get another win.  
  
Q. This team looked like it grew up a lot between the middle of December and
middle of February. What was that? Was it simply Tyler or are the young guys
all in unison because you knew what you had in Adam?  
COACH STEVE ALFORD: I give a lot of credit to Adam (Haluska). There were a lot
of question marks at the beginning of the year of just his leadership because
he's such a great guy, and sometimes when you're in a leadership role there's
times you've got to be a bad guy.  
That's what I'm most appreciative of. I think the key was Adam's leadership.
You lose Jeff [Horner] and Bru [Greg Brunner] and Erek [Hansen] and Doug
[Thomas] and Justin [Wieck], those were all guys that not only were getting to
play, Justin wasn't getting to play a lot, but he's on our staff now, and he's
just a kid that everybody respected, and that group was really respected. Adam
was that one guy coming back.  
(Henderson) was going to help but Mike's injury kind of slowed things. So I
think a big key was Adam.  
And then the Michigan game. I don't know if they -- they had nothing to build
on because a lot of these guys weren't here last year. They had nothing to
build on for success away from Carver. Now, I will give them credit, doing
what they did at Carver against the competition we did it against was very
impressive. On the road they've struggled, but I think the Michigan game kind
of turned them around and we were able to get them a win at Minnesota, play
well at Wisconsin, play well on the road, so I think that was probably the
turning point of the season, but I think Adam's ability to lead was a big key
for us.  
  
Q. I know you have the NIT, but talk a little bit about the future of this
program in terms of Tyler. You mentioned Justin a little bit. Talk about going
forward now.  
COACH STEVE ALFORD: Well, I think our young guys are getting better. Obviously
there's some of them that didn't perform well tonight, but all in all, we got
our entire front line back. And all of our front line, really including Seth,
was going through their first tournament experience here. This was their first
tournament experience.  
(Carl) Landry is a fifth year senior. I mean, he understands what it's about
and he understood about trying to get to the NCAA Tournament and having a
chance to do that. But I think having that whole front line, having a spring
and summer and fall to work and continue to get better.  
You have David Palmer who's practiced with us all year, and he really gives us
an inside presence that can score because he's got a great scoring mentality.
You have Jared Cole and Josh Crawford, who continue to develop. So all of a
sudden we go from being kind of an inexperienced front line to not only having
experience but being big. It'll be a big team.  
And we have to try to fill the void of Adam Haluska. That's never easy, but I
think you see Tony starting to emerge as a scorer. I think Justin will score
more, Tyler will be asked to score more, and then obviously we have some of
these new guards coming in. We're still out there I think trying to get
another point guard.  
So I think all in all, we're pretty excited about that. I'm probably most
excited about the experience they've gotten so far this year and seeing how
they're growing and maturing. Now the trick is to try and get some postseason
play out of them. The more games we can play, the better, and that's something
we've got to work on here once we find that out on Sunday.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Drew Neitzel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16991)

### [Travis Walton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16992)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
COACH TOM IZZO: Well, it's hard to feel great and yet, again, as I told my
guys, Northwestern is a hard team to play against. I think it's one of the
harder teams to prep against, and we had some days -- I think instead of the
players, I've got to take some of the blame for not figuring out better things
to do offensively. It was stifling. I mean, it wasn't like we missed a lot of
good shots, but we did turn it over a little bit too much, although after the
first five minutes, I think we only had nine or ten turnovers the rest of the
way.  
We did not attack offensively as well as we could or should have, and then
they made some shots at the end. We had hands up and they made some shots,
give them all the credit. They just kept hanging in there.  
This is one and done time, which means win and advance is the secret, not how
well you played. We shot 57 percent and won by an eyelash. That's hard to do.
We out-rebounded them only by seven, and last time we did a lot better job of
that. But I think the whole thing was our poor offensive attack, and believe
me, that wasn't the players, that was me.  
We're going to get ready for Wisconsin, looking forward to that.  
  
Q. Drew, why do you think the game changed after you got off to such a hot
start and looked like you guys were going to coast?  
DREW NEITZEL: It's a tough game. Anytime you're playing against Northwestern,
it's hard to get in a rhythm. They're constantly slowing the game down,
slowing your amount of possessions down and they made some big shots.  
Scott stepped out and hit a couple big threes there at the end of the first
half that kind of changed the momentum. Late in the game they hit some big
shots, too.  
  
Northwestern really controls the tempo, and like I said, it's hard to get in a
rhythm sometimes.  
  
Q. Travis, how did you feel when (Jeremy) Nash threw that ball away on the
last possession of the Wildcats?  
TRAVIS WALTON: I felt great. Today was just a bad day on execution for
offense, but we stuck to it as a family and as a team and we got through it.  
  
Q. Drew, you seemed like you had a good rhythm going in the first half, hit
three or four threes, then second half you had a long lull without even taking
a shot. Is that because you saw something in the defenses or what was that?  
DREW NEITZEL: Yeah, it was tough. Like I said, Northwestern, that one three
one it's hard to simulate in practice going against it. Their players are so
long and they do a great job of getting their hands in the passing lane, where
I think they were taking me away a little bit in the second half.  
Not only shots, just touches, I didn't -- but we found other ways to score,
and some other guys stepped up and made some big plays, so that's what we
needed.  
  
Q. That tied the high for the most threes you've given up this year along
with Bradley. Is there any concern along with the perimeter defenses or is it
just a one-game thing?  
DREW NEITZEL: I think it's a one-game thing. Like I said, Scott stepped out
and hit a couple big threes in the first half and I hit a couple in the second
half. We knew their big guys could shoot. I think we were so worried about the
back cuts and things going towards the basket that we were kind of on our
heels a little bit, and we didn't get out and contest the shots. You've got to
give them credit, too, for knocking them down.  
  
Q. Maybe both you guys can address the free throws. You guys both missed
some free throws at the end. Anything in particular out there today?  
TRAVIS WALTON: Just came to the line, knocked down one and didn't knock down
the second one. Just didn't make it.  
  
Q. Drew and Travis, could you just talk about the Wisconsin game coming up?
You guys have played them twice in the last couple weeks. What sticks out
about those two games?  
DREW NEITZEL: I just think they're great. They were both great games that came
down to the wire. It's two great teams battling it out. We both kind of play
the same way, solid defense and don't pressure too much and kind of stick to
our principles.  
I think it's going to be another great game tomorrow, and we're going to have
to watch some film, get some rest and get ready to play.  
  
Q. Along those lines, as defenders go, how would you rate Michael Flowers
and the battles you've had with him in those two games?  
DREW NEITZEL: It's tough. He's a great defender, a good defensive team. But at
the same time, you know, he -- you know, I've had some good games against him
this year. He is a great defender. He's challenged me, and none of my shots
that I've gotten have been easy. You know, I think it's going to be another
tough day tomorrow, too.  
  
Q. Drew, is it nice to get this rubber match at a neutral floor here in the
Big Ten Tournament?  
DREW NEITZEL: Yeah. Like I said, it's been a great rivalry, especially in the
Big Ten. Over the past few years, two solid programs, so I think it's going to
be a great game tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll finish up with questions for Coach Izzo.  
  
Q. It's tough to play or win four in four days, but like you said, it's one
and out now, so you're actually in a two-day tournament. Is it easier having
played today as opposed to sitting out and not been on the court and played
the game?  
COACH TOM IZZO: That's almost like buying a car. If you have success buying
one kind, one model, you usually go back to it. The advantage of, I guess,
being in this a few years like I have, we've not played on the first day and
had some success and we've played on the first day, and last year we had some
success and wore down a little bit.  
But I'd say that the first day back it might be a little bit of an advantage
for the team that played, for tomorrow's game a little bit, although you
battle your familiarity with the court and the baskets if that's a big deal,
compared to your fatigue. That's the two things you juggle.  
So like I said, I've lost the first game and won the first game, I've gone so
many different ways. I'm not sure where the advantage -- I'm a little worried.
Drew (Neitzel) and Travis (Walton) both played 35 minutes, Raymar played quite
a few minutes. But it wasn't a taxing game. In other words, it wasn't a game
where it was a lot of fast breaking or pressing most of the game.  
You know, I'm just looking forward to the game. I think it's -- I think a lot
of people are looking forward to it.  
  
Q. I know your main focus is tomorrow's game and you want to win as many as
possible in this tournament, but do you feel this win today gives you a body
of work that merits NCAA?  
COACH TOM IZZO: You know, it's such a dangerous question because you don't
want to upset anybody, but I thought our merit of work was earned before we
came here, I really did. But that doesn't mean we were in then and it doesn't
mean we're in now. That's what's a little more difficult about this tournament
right now.  
But if you look at what we've done, I continually say our effect on what we
did in the Big Ten, I think it is and was enough, but you never know. I don't
like trusting the situation because you never know who's going to win those
tournaments. You don't know what's going to happen, so we'll just kind of try
to keep winning.  
  
Q. Their three-point shooting, is that just a fact of them making shots or
is that a cause for concern?  
COACH TOM IZZO: No, I'm not concerned. We did not play great. I have to give
them a lot of credit for it. But our defense, I mean, we did not play great
and they shot 43, and they shot a high percentage second half. I did not think
our big guys did as good a job. The two they hit on Travis at the end, I think
he's still maybe one of or the best defensive player in this league, and he
had a hand up, and I have to give him credit. He hit two bombs, otherwise it's
a 10, 12 point game. And five, six years ago when Dick was there, that's like
a 20-point win.  
I was impressed with Bill's (Carmody) team. They could have quit when they
were 16 down and they didn't. I think that shows a lot about them. I've
enjoyed going against (Tim) Doyle and watching him get better each and every
year. We actually did a pretty good job on him. The Coble kid is going to be a
heck of a player.  
We didn't defend it great. Our bigs really did a poor job, I thought, on
(Vince) Scott in particular because we knew what he could do.  
But no, no, I'm not going to let anybody talk about our defense when we've had
30 games of some of the most unbelievable defense in my career at Michigan
State, so that's not alarming for tomorrow. What's alarming is we just kind of
played the game after we got that 16-point lead instead of really having that
killer instinct.  
But I think that sometimes happens. We're still young, we're still growing,
and that's going to happen for a while until we learn how to get through that.  
But they deserve credit, guys, they really do. That zone, not many teams have
really cracked it much.  
  
Q. The four and four thing, do you have some ideas about what's important to
get a team from, say, the first day to at least playing on Sunday, what has to
happen, that sort of thing?  
COACH TOM IZZO: Well, I have to admit, I got to do a lot of things, winning
the first thing, losing when you're the No. 1 seed, I've done it all. One
thing I haven't done is four and four, so you're talking about an area that I
can't really give my expertise on.  
But I think when you've got a team that can guard people like I think we can
for the most part, you just -- you know, you keep hunkering down.  
It was kind of interesting because this is the first time I took our shoot-
around the day of a game. Everybody talks about shooting at this place. Our
players wanted to come here and shoot at 8:00 in the morning, so we got up at
7:30, and, shazam, we shoot 57 percent. It shows players are smarter than
coaches because I wouldn't have done that. You can rely on that one game, but
you're not going to rely on that for four games.  
I think the defense is something we can rely on for four games and I think
that gives us a chance. When you have the teams that you're looking at to play
to get there, starting with Wisconsin tomorrow, I can promise you I'm thinking
about nothing else except them.  
  
Q. Does it help that you guys are playing a later game and that you're not
right back here early in the morning?  
COACH TOM IZZO: Well, last year, I'll tell you, that was a killer, man, the
Illinois to Iowa thing was a killer, and I'm glad they made adjustments. I
hope it's fair for everybody because 1 o'clock in the morning we got back to
the hotel and we got back -- should have just slept in the arena, it would
have been easier.  
Yeah, I think now it's a fair shake that we get as much rest as you can
possibly get. The nice thing is I don't think we need a lot of prep time.
We've just played them -- this will be the third time in, what, 18 days or
something. So no excuses there. It's more about us getting some rest and
feeling a little better about ourselves.  
I think the guys were kind of disappointed in how they played, and I'm trying
to be cool about it, but I'd have to say I was disappointed that we didn't
execute better and maybe guard a little bit better.  
So we weren't as sharp today. I mean, but in a tournament you always have your
glitches. We beat Northwestern by one I think the year we won it and should
have got beat. Kevin O'Neill was there, he had us beat, Morris Peterson made
an incredible shot, or otherwise we lose to them. That's the problem with this
league, when you get a team like Northwestern who's a 10th seed but their
style and everything is so competitive, it's a tough game.  
  
Q. I was just wondering, the way they aggressively pressured the perimeter,
did that mess up the plan at all or were there just plays to be made that
weren't made at times?  
COACH TOM IZZO: There were plays. Sutton struggled at times. Every time he got
the ball in the middle it was like a hot potato.  
But I mean this sincerely, I didn't do a very good job -- this is one that, as
I said, I can get on a player or he can get on me. I can tell the media when
the players goof up and I can tell you when the coach did it. I did not think
we were as well prepared as we needed to be for that zone, and we had time to
do it. It's just that it didn't look as bad in practice because we didn't have
so much length in there. We had a bunch of midgets, little guys running around
in there as our walk-ons. A 5'8" guy couldn't simulate what the 6'7" guy
could.  
But we didn't make some plays. I thought we fumbled the ball and did some
things, and then we had MoJo (Maurice Joseph) in foul trouble and we thought
he was a zone buster that could help us. So there were reasons, but I think
more of it is their good play and maybe our lack of getting into proper sets
to go against that thing.  
  
Q. How scary was it for you when they started hitting the threes down the
stretch and drew within three with just ten seconds?  
COACH TOM IZZO: Well, it was. It was scary, disappointing, and yet that's the
way basketball goes. Like I said, I've been here with the team that won the
national championship and barely escaped. So I've been beaten by Wright State.
I've got a lot of things I can look back on and say I've been through it.
That's what I told the team, this is probably the calmest locker room we've
had because they knew. As long as they knew we didn't play as well as we could
have, that's all that matters to me.  
And yet, I'll continue to say this, not to give Bill (Carmody) credit, but
that team deserves some credit. They made some plays, they made some shots.
And that defense, to echo what you said about the wings and the pressure on
the perimeter, I'll tell you what, Doyle does a heck of a job up there. He
just plays it real well and those wings were very long and wide, and we
struggled.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [Geary Claxton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17002)

### [Ed DeChellis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17001)

### [Mike Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17000)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
COACH ED DeCHELLIS: You know, I thought we got off to a great start and we got
sort of stuck on 13 points for a long time, and Illinois made their run. That
hurt us.  
In the second half, I thought we came out, and we played okay and we had a
chance to win the game, and that's all we've ever asked is our guys give us a
chance, and we did that.  
I thought the factor in the game was obviously Chester Frazier making
perimeter jump shots and making threes tonight. He hasn't really shot many on
the year, and he did a great job of making some big-time shots for them.
Sometimes that's the difference in a game.  
  
Q. Mike, just talk about your second half. It seemed like just about
everything you put up was going down.  
MIKE WALKER: I got it going a little bit. You know, you get down 10 or 15, I
think a little more pressure goes on the shooters and the shooters have to
step up and make shots, and luckily today they went in.  
  
Q. Mike, is it a little disappointing when you make shots like that when
Chester Frazier is going off the way he did tonight?  
MIKE WALKER: Yeah, like Coach DeChellis said, that's not something we
expected. You scout guys all season long and you know they do one thing and
then they come out and they play big. He stepped up. He's a player in the Big
Ten. He's going to step up and make shots, and I think that was the
difference.  
  
Q. Mike, Chester shooting the way he did, did that remind you of some other
games that you guys have had this year?  
MIKE WALKER: It seems like a lot of games that we've been in, someone comes up
and steps up and hits shots for the other team. It's frustrating. Sometimes
you can live with it when it's a guy who's shooting 40 or 45 percent for
three, but the guy who's not that great of a shooter but does other things
great, then he steps up and hits shots, sometimes it's a little bit
frustrating.  
  
Q. Geary, did you see a change in their attitude? You got them down by 11
real early, and it kind of looked like you guys could maybe continue that.
What did they do sort of attitude-wise to put themselves back into it?  
GEARY CLAXTON: I think they just came out a lot more aggressive, especially on
defense, really pressuring us and getting into us. With Chester Frazier making
shots, you know, they were feeding off him and Warren Carter. That's how they
got back in the game.  
  
Q. Geary, what does it mean that you guys were able to get back in it in the
last few minutes?  
GEARY CLAXTON: We didn't stop playing. We didn't quit. We kept playing until
the end. We just came up short, but I think we gave a good effort tonight.  
  
Q. Geary, could you just sum up the season? It looks like this is sort of
the end here.  
GEARY CLAXTON: Yeah, it was disappointing for us, but it's in the past now, so
you've just got to move ahead, move forward, work hard in the off season and
look forward to next season.  
THE MODERATOR: We can finish up with questions for Coach DeChellis, please.  
  
Q. Ed, you guys made a decision to really pack in zone. Did you just feel
committed to that no matter what?  
COACH ED DeCHELLIS: Well, they really did a great job of manhandling us
inside, (Shaun) Pruitt, (Brian) Randle and (Warren) Carter just killed us and
killed us on the glass. So we thought that we would try to take that away as
best we could. Now, they're good players. But we thought we would try to make
somebody else step up and beat us, and tonight they did.  
(Chester) Frazier has, I think, made seven threes in the Big Ten season and
he's got five tonight. We rolled the dice. We tried to push out on (Rich)
McBride a little bit more and he didn't hurt us, but give the other kid
credit. He came in and made some big shots. But we tried to not let them beat
us with twos this time and make them make threes.  
Chester Frazier was the X factor. He played very well, and give him credit, he
made some big shots for them.  
  
Q. Are those three-point shots a theme to the season when you look back on
it?  
COACH ED DeCHELLIS: Yes, in a way. But we made some ourselves. We had ten,
they had ten. We made some big shots tonight as well and had a chance. It was
a little disappointing for me because I couldn't get them on the free-throw
line. We can't get to the free-throw line. We tried to drive it in the second
half. When we did get there, we missed some crucial free throws I thought,
which was tough for us.  
Sometimes you've got to roll the dice, and we thought if we tried to take
their post away as best we could and keep them off the glass that they
couldn't make threes all night, and tonight they did. That's the sign of a
good basketball team. Illinois is a very good basketball team, and Bruce
(Weber) has done a great job with them.  
But that's kind of how it's gone for us. You play pretty well and then
somebody out of nowhere comes in and makes some big shots against you. It's
frustrating. But that's the way it's gone all year.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Mike (Walker) tonight and in the second half of the
season? He started to find his shot a little more the past four or five
games.  
COACH ED DeCHELLIS: You look at the numbers and he shot the ball well here the
four or five games. We needed somebody to make some shots. We weren't shooting
the ball very well. Mike stepped up and made some big baskets for us, so we
kept trying to get him the basketball, and he continued to make some shots for
us down the stretch, which was very important.  
Frazier was making shots, we have a guy making shots. Mike got out and did a
great job tonight and ran the team very nicely. He and (David) "Mooch,"
(Jackson) and even Danny (Morressey) played a little point tonight. They all
pitched in.  
  
Q. Sort of the same thing I asked Geary, what does it mean that you guys
were able to come back and get within two as opposed to maybe losing by 12 or
so?  
COACH ED DeCHELLIS: Well, we've been a very resilient team all year. They got
us good at our place and we've had a couple games like that. Indiana last week
on the road was not good, but for the most part our kids have fought back and
been consistent that way. They've shown some resiliency even in the non-
conference season. So it's something to look at. But I would be disappointed
if we didn't come back and play hard and try to make a run at this thing.  
THE MODERATOR: Appreciate your time, Coach. Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [Warren Carter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16999)

### [Chester Frazier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16997)

### [Brian Randle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16998)

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: Well, I think early in the game we didn't have much
emotion, and the coaches told me in warm-ups they weren't real hyped and
geeked, and I don't know if the pressure of trying to get another victory,
advancing, maybe the whole mental drain of the season, I'm not sure. But once
we got through that early stretch, we played pretty good defense for quite a
while and then had the nice run at the start of the second half, and we just
didn't play very smart in probably that 12-to-6 minute mark, some careless
turnovers, some missed opportunities, some missed free throws. So that -- it
allowed them to get their head up.  
And obviously Walker just went crazy at the end, and finally we got a couple
stops and made a couple free throws. We knew it would be a gut-check game. We
knew they'd make adjustments. I talked all week, whether it was at
Northwestern, at Minnesota, at Penn State, each team makes adjustments, and
you have to adjust. They weren't going to let us get it inside and they made
us shoot from the perimeter. 28 threes is a whole bunch, but at least we made
some -- and Chester especially as we got deep into the game.  
  
Q. Chester, just talk about the team feeling going into this game in terms
of, you know, the NCAA and trying to rebound from the slow start Coach talked
about.  
CHESTER FRAZIER: Just trying to get wins. Any win looks good on the resume, so
we're just trying to add more wins to our resume.  
  
Q. Brian, Coach talked about maybe it was the grind of the season, and I was
wondering, you started out the year injured and you guys have had injuries and
controversy all season. How much of a grind has this season been?  
BRIAN RANDLE: It's been a grind. Every season is a grind. Obviously this year
we had guys in and out constantly, even up to this point.  
So I think more than anything, it's just been a test for us. We're always
going to go in there hard and beat each other up, but because we had less
guys, there's points in time in the season where we did have to back off.
Where we are now we feel like we probably should have been in December or
early January. So it's been interesting.  
  
Q. Warren, could you talk about getting it going after the slow start, and
do you block out any concerns about this game just getting away from you, or
is it too early at that point?  
WARREN CARTER: Yeah, it was definitely too early at that point. I mean, we put
ourselves in binds early in the year where we've been down in the second half.
And it kind of goes back to what Brian (Randle) said with where our team is
now, we probably should have been at this point in December. I mean, we showed
some poise and some composure just sticking together, and then we ran around,
like Coach said, in the first half and then we jumped on them again in the
start of the second half.  
  
Q. Chester, I saw you talking to Walker after the game. What did you say to
him?  
CHESTER FRAZIER: I said, man, you're tough, seven threes, all big shots. I
think he has a lot of guts for those shots, and he's a heck of a player.  
  
Q. He was so far out on some of those, did you guys think he wouldn't shoot
it from there?  
CHESTER FRAZIER: We knew he was going to shoot it, he just made some big
shots.  
  
Q. Chester, how much more was their zone packing this time around and was
the primary idea pretty much you putting it up?  
CHESTER FRAZIER: They tend to shade to Rich (McBride) more. You know, Rich is
an excellent shooter from deep. I'm not so good from deep, but they took away
the flashes and I made some opening shots. Not a big deal, just made some
shots.  
  
Q. Brian, can you talk about Chester, how he played tonight and maybe how he
energized you guys a little bit it seemed like midway through the first
half?  
BRIAN RANDLE: Really he's the heart of this team. You know, he sometimes puts
himself in positions where he probably shouldn't be in and falls down, gets
up, screams like it doesn't hurt. He gives us some toughness. You know, today,
as much as people try to knock him and tell him this and that, he's going to
play each and every game, and that's what we looked for him to do today. He
hit some big shots, gave us a boost offensively and defensively, and we got on
his back and he carried us.  
  
Q. Warren, where do you think you all stand right now in terms of the
tournament, and how much are you talking about that with your teammates?  
WARREN CARTER: Honestly, as a team we don't talk about it as much. We know
we've got to continue to get wins. None of us are on the committee so we can't
sit up here and say whether we're in the tournament or not. We know if we
continue to win and win on Sunday then they'll have no choice but to put us in
the tournament.  
  
Q. Warren, talk about going up against Indiana again, the things that might
be key there, and whether you think this is the game that would put you over
the top in terms of tournament?  
WARREN CARTER: I think that could be a possibility, but as I said earlier, I'm
not on the committee so I can never say. But Indiana is a tough team. They
play tough defense, they've had some days of rest. We've met each other twice
this year. They've both been grind out games. That's what I'm going to expect
tomorrow. We've just got to get some rest and get ready for it.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll finish up with questions for Coach Weber.  
  
Q. What's been the most difficult thing about dealing with this season to
get to this point?  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: Well, unless you've coached, and I had never been through
this, to be honest, and I've been doing it 28 years, when you don't have
people at practice, it's tough to get better. It's tough for them to get
better as individuals and it's tough for you to get better as a team.  
And I think what these guys said, we're probably -- now we kind of know our
roles. We have a feel of who are the scorers, who's not, who to give the ball,
how to get them the ball, and it took us -- this is where, as they said, it
should be December-January, not late February-March to get to this point.  
We did a thing with -- we turned in the NCAA obviously, or the Big Ten did,
how many games, man days we've missed for games. It's 50-some or whatever. But
I asked them to do -- our trainer to do practices. Brian Randle has missed 50
or more practices. That's two thirds of your practices.  
Chester has missed a bunch. Chester plays in games and everybody sees him
suited up, but if you don't practice all week and then play in a game, it's
like, he's got a lot of gumption. Then people are like, well, what's wrong
with him. Well, he hasn't practiced. You're just going out there without any
preparation. That's been the toughest thing.  
To our kids' credit, they have been pretty resilient. We've all learned, all
grown up. I think it's -- they say adversity helps you develop character, and
I guess and toughness, and I guess we truly have been that case this year.  
  
Q. You were yelling at your guys to get some inside touches early, but was
that even realistic?  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: Well, they just packed it up. They just said you're not
getting it in there. I thought early we were a little impatient and didn't
look. We needed to make some shots, and even when we made shots they still
really didn't come out. We made some adjustments, we actually put a few new
things in, just different looks, and they still kind of just sat back there.  
I'm just happy Chester (Frazier) made some shots. It would have been nice if
Rich (McBride) made some. It would have been a big difference maker. I think
Rich wants to -- he still gets ten assists, so he finds a way to do things for
us that help us win, and that's what you hope seniors would do.  
A radio guy asked me before the game on my pre-game show who would be the X
factor, and I thought Brian Randle, and I just threw it in. I said it would be
nice if Chester made a couple shots.  
I thought Brian (Frasier) had a very slow start. He really got us going, and
then obviously Chester made some big shots. Chester is a pretty good defender
and for Walker to get open like that and make some of those crazy shots,
you've got to give him a lot of credit.  
  
Q. We ask you every day so I guess we should ask again, where do you think
you're at with the tournament and --  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: I think we're in good shape. But that doesn't mean we're
in. That's my feeling. You still have some other tournaments left. Some
craziness can still happen. If you're in the last five, six left, well, if you
keep getting some upsets, each time that takes off a team, and I don't know
where we are in that mix. They're the only ones that know. I hope it maintains
our RPI in the 30s. Your schedule rating is still -- it's been a top 25. We've
dealt with injuries. We haven't had any bad losses.  
The one thing we don't have is probably the great win, but at the same time,
we've played a lot of people close, and if people watched us, you know, we go
to Indiana and play a game where we're leading and other teams have gone there
and gotten beaten pretty drastically. I don't know if scores make a
difference, but I think you can see the improvement in our team. There's no
doubt about that.  
But I will not feel good unless we get into Saturday or Sunday, and then I
think maybe I'd be a little more relaxed.  
  
Q. You said you've never been through something like this in 28 years of
coaching. Has this year been maybe more work than it has been fun?  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: I told the kids before, I thought we were a little tense at
Iowa, especially down the stretch. I'm not sure -- we didn't have great
emotion. We didn't have great emotion early today. I hope we're not mentally
drained. I just think they want to do so well, they want to get it. It's
starting to mean a lot more to them. But you still can't be uptight.  
For the coaches, and I told them before the game, I wrote energy -- all E's,
energy, enthusiasm, effort, and then I threw on there, "and enjoy it." This is
a special moment. You play college basketball four years, you're in the
tournament, you're in the United Center. No matter what I say, though, they
know they're trying to get to 22, 23 wins. They know what's at stake. But I
just said let's enjoy this and just go out -- I thought after the beginning
they let loose and played a little bit. We played dumb in that stretch in the
second half to let them back in it, and we can't do that again.  
  
Q. Is there a feeling on the team that if you guys get a couple wins here in
March it will mask a lot of the downs you had over the season?  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: I don't think there's a feeling. I think we could have a
great finish. I think we're capable of it. I think the whole league is capable
of it.  
Maybe we don't get in the 90s, but when you get into NCAA play, into
tournament play, it's going to be a possession game, it's going to be a half
court game, and obviously we've all had a bunch of those in our league.  
It might be to our advantage that you might see some surprises, and maybe we
-- I don't know if we have the respect or not, but I'm sure we haven't been
talked about as much on TV as a lot of people, and maybe that could make a
difference. We still -- they've won 22 games and we have the 25th rated
schedule, and there's not a team in the country that's had more man days
missed. If there is, I'd be surprised.  
So they've accomplished pretty much.  
Now, when you set the bar like we have the last three years, it's really --
probably tough to live up to it, and I think the kids have felt that pressure,
also.  
  
Q. You had a couple intense battles with Indiana. What do you expect
tomorrow? It's been pretty wild the last two.  
COACH BRUCE WEBER: I would expect the same thing. Calvin (Sampson) has done a
nice job. He gets them to play very hard. They've got some seniors that play
with great intensity, know how to play. You've got D.J. White, one of the
better big guys in the league, and they're going to run their stuff and grind
it out. They play good pressure defense.  
I thought last year Michigan State might have had a little bit of an advantage
because they played a game and then you have to sit all day like that, that
late game. It's tough to do. So maybe that will help us a little bit. I would
expect we'd have even -- we had a majority of the fans today. I think we'll
have a great crowd tomorrow, and maybe that will be a big boost of energy for
our guys, and we can come out and just play.  
THE MODERATOR: Appreciate your time, Coach. Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
COACH BILL CARMODY: We played them at the beginning of the Big Ten Conference
schedule, and they out-rebounded us by 25 rebounds. That was our main focus
today, to try to just sort of match their physicalness of their play. I
thought we did a pretty good job at that.  
They got a few more rebounds, but I think it was mostly defensive rebounds. We
missed more shots than they did.  
But it didn't seem like they got too many second looks, although a couple at
the end were real important where they rebounded and brought the ball out.  
But at halftime I told them, fellows, they're off an awful lot, you're getting
some open looks, and if we're going to beat this team, you have to make -- put
the No. 8 on the board, you have to make eight threes. If you do that, I think
we can beat this team. Each guy is going to have to step up, and we started
making some, five or six in the second half that kept us in there. I was proud
of the way the guys hung in there.  
It's not what you like, to go out on the first day because you don't get a
real flavor of the tournament to tell you the truth, but I thought they did
their best and I thought -- I think despite the record, we've been improving.
I think it's sort of promising for the future with a few guys, the few guys we
have in.  
Michigan State, they don't play on Thursday too often, and they played hard,
and they just made plays when they had to make them and shots when they had to
make them. And we weren't able to handle that. He had 20 points, but it seemed
very economical to me, not that many shots, and he made the right plays and
the right passes. So you know, we struggled guarding him.  
  
Q. Craig, could you talk about the comeback and the attitude and the shots
you hit and then that last pass that got away from you, the whole sequence and
the comeback and the shots?  
CRAIG MOORE: The comeback was basically just try to get the ball down the
court as fast as possible, get it to the open men, make a shot and then play
defense. I think we did that pretty well. Timmy found some guys, everybody was
making shots when we needed them to.  
And then the last play, Jeremy did everything right. He was on Neitzel, he
defended great, he rebounded the ball well, and I kind of -- I don't remember
if I called for the ball or not, but I kind of looked over at coach to see
what he was doing, I looked at the clock and then the ball flew past my face.  
  
Q. Mr. Doyle, you joined the illustrious likes of Isaiah Thomas and Magic
Johnson today, I think, more than 500 points, 150 assists. Say something about
how you crowned with your career. It was an exciting game even though you came
up short.  
TIM DOYLE: Yeah, I think it's a testament to Coach Carmody, that 13-18, 2-14
in the league, we just bowed out to arguably the toughest seven seed you're
ever going to face. This is a team that lost two games at the buzzer to the
No. 1 team in the country at their place. So it was just a tough game, but I
think it's just a testament to Coach. We came out and we gave all our heart,
we gave all our effort.  
The records are great. I want to look back when I'm an old man and enjoy them.
Today it's kind of a bitter taste, but it's nice to see the young guys respond
to the way I stepped forward, and I always give 110 percent and I see the guys
out there doing the same.  
  
Q. Kevin, you guys did a lot better job rebounding this game compared to
last time against Michigan State. Did you change anything or was it just
seeing the ball better?  
KEVIN COBLE: If you look at the majority of the games we lose, we get killed
on the boards, and that was something that happened there. The coaching staff
had emphasized that throughout the last few weeks of practice, doing various
rebounding drills. I think that's something we've keyed in on. We realize in
order for us to compete in these games and to win that we have to rebound. I
think we consistently got better as the season went on and kind of shortened
-- lessened that margin of rebounding deficit between the teams. So I think
that was a positive thing and something that we need to continue to work on
for next year.  
  
Q. Were you a little bit hyper, too quick fouls and you were sitting?  
KEVIN COBLE: I came out aggressively. That's going to happen sometimes, I
guess, in the game. I just tried to play hard, and those things are going to
happen. You play enough basketball, it's going to come back and get you. But
you just have to play through it.  
I was pleased with how everybody was able to respond to that, and I was glad
to come out in the second half and play a little bit better.  
  
Q. Tim, you had 16 in the first half and it could have gotten pretty ugly
pretty quick. Why didn't it?  
TIM DOYLE: A key guy, that was Jeff Ryan, and he's a freshman, and Kevin is a
freshman, and every game -- even midway through this game you could see
(Kevin) Coble getting more comfortable playing in the United Center. I think
he might have been a little anxious at the beginning like he just said. But
that's just a testament to our team.  
I think we've had that never say die, let's not bow out attitude. Then we
started to gain some confidence and Craig (Moore) stepped up, he hit a couple
big shots. We were right in that game. They shoot 58 percent for a team that
struggles scoring, and you know, they came into -- we came into the game
hoping that, big arena, early game, they'd struggle with their shooting.
That's a ballgame we can usually win if we shoot that well and get multiple
contributions from everybody on the team.  
Like I said, the effort was there and I think that was important because we
could have bowed our heads and showed up and took our free meal and left.  
  
Q. What excites you about the future with this program?  
KEVIN COBLE: Oh, I think just the opportunity to continue to learn from the
coaches and the incoming recruits that we have and just coming back and
playing with the same guys that I've gotten to know over the last couple
years. It's just an honor to be out there on the court with them and continue
to grow teamwork wise. And I think we can do some pretty special things with
the foundation that the seniors have sort of laid for us this year, and
leading into next year it's going to be something that's really special.  
  
Q. Can a game like this where you get your shooting touch back help you for
the future?  
CRAIG MOORE: Well, my next game is not for eight or nine months, so I'll
replay this game a couple times in my head. Coach is already talking about
what we have to do as individuals and what we need to do to succeed.  
We learned a lot from the seniors and we're going to miss Timmy (Doyle) and
Joe (Kennedy) and Vince (Scott) and Ivan (Tolic) next year, but we're going to
have to build on that and do more, do what we have to do to survive without
them.  
  
Q. Tim, this is a similar question that was asked earlier, but what has to
be done to kind of turn this thing around do you think?  
TIM DOYLE: Well, there's encouraging signs. We obviously lose the leading
scorer in the Big Ten last year and coming into the season we're picked dead
last in every poll. We go out and we have the best non-conference record in
the history of Northwestern. There's going to be little steps. So that's
something you've got to build on.  
Kevin (Coble), Jeff Ryan, Craig Moore, we're talking about some young, young
kids. Each year these guys are going to get better. Last year I assumed more
of a role player where this year I stepped up and I had to be the main focus.  
I think next year everyone says, what are they going to do without you, big
Vince? These guys are going to be fine. These guys are going to emerge.
They're 18, 19-year-old kids. Guys are going to get more assertive and play
with more confidence because honestly, I haven't really improved my game that
much. It's just I became more confident as I got more minutes and more
comfortable on the floor.  
The young guys, you're going to see them expand. We've turned the corner and
we're going the right direction, 11 non-conference wins or 10, whatever it is,
we're headed in the right direction.  
THE MODERATOR: We can finish up with Coach Carmody.  
  
Q. I think Craig touched on it, but you guys did everything right on the
last possession but threw the ball away. Talk about how disheartening that was
to see your plans not work out like you wanted them to.  
COACH BILL CARMODY: Like Craig said, they told them to keep the ball away from
Neitzel, Jeremy, and I told you if he beats you back there, I don't care, I'll
take the blame for it, but just don't let him touch the ball. It was a real
good possession defensively. We had Sutton taking the three, and air ball and
get the rebound. What can you say, that's part of playing basketball. Stuff
like that happens.  
I didn't tell them at the time, I had to call a time-out because I don't like
to do that, I just like to see what the situation is. Usually I don't. What
are you going to say? We all wish it was different, but you're playing
basketball. I told the kid to keep his chin up. That's all you can do.  
  
Q. How much did the run at the end of the first half and into the second
half a little bit get you or keep you in the game? It was an 11 to 2 run.  
COACH BILL CARMODY: Yeah, we started off pretty nicely, and like has happened
so many times this year, it seemed like we missed a couple easy layups. They
called a walk-on, (Ivan) Tolic, Jeff (Ryan) missed an easy one, somebody else
missed something I thought was capable, and then I substituted, I changed a
few guys, and it seemed like our defense went down. I took Tolic out and he
was doing a real good job in the middle there, I thought.  
It could have blown out. We could have been blown out in the first half. Those
last like eight minutes -- maybe it was the middle eight minutes, and then I
think Craig hit a shot at the buzzer and there was something before that that
went our way. We just hung in there. Still down nine, though, I think at half.  
I liked the way they were rooting for each other and stuff on the bench, and
the guys were coming in and -- that's important to me, you know, doing what
they're supposed to do.  
  
Q. You talked about the future looking bright. I say that every year at this
point. What's different now about the future than has been in the past few
years?  
COACH BILL CARMODY: I don't know, I think our freshmen are pretty good, and I
think that some of the guys we have coming in are going to help us right away.
It just seems like some of these freshmen are a little more focused on being
good and improving. It's still going to be incremental, I think, but I hope we
can get up towards the .500 mark in the conference next year. That would be
something.  
It'll depend on how much these guys get better and what kind of -- you know,
what the incoming guys give us. We clearly have to have -- our shooting has to
improve, and I think some of these guys are capable of that.  
  
Q. Tom Izzo was very complimentary after the game, very gracious. I wonder
if that gets old after a while. The idea is obviously for you to win games. Do
you almost get tired of that?  
COACH BILL CARMODY: Well, I like Tom and respect him a lot. He's a good guy.
We want to win here, all right, and that's the point of your question. It's
just, like, can we turn this thing around, can we get better?  
I think we can. I'm sure we can, and we haven't done it. But I feel confident
in the guys we have, and we're starting to make some inroads. I don't want to
blow it up too much in the Chicago area, but we're starting to recruit guys
and get guys from our backyard, and that's real important, not just this class
but the juniors and sophomores, and it took us a while to do that.  
I think we're making some inroads, and we're going to get some of those guys
and that's going to help immensely. So I understand the point. When is it
going to happen because it's been seven years now, so we have to do it soon.  
  
Q. To come within three points of tying it, does that give you an impressive
profile looking at it, help sell the program a little bit?  
COACH BILL CARMODY: Yeah, if you're watching the game, as far as recruiting,
you can say, hey, they hung in there. Last year we came out here and I thought
it was a disgrace, against Penn State. Leading up to this game I told the
guys, our seniors, that, and I think that they took it to heart a little bit
and worked hard and didn't quit. Sometimes you find out that if you don't
quit, then good things can happen.  
But I thought we played much better throughout the game. Even though we were
losing I know I'm going to look at the tape and see a little bit here, a
little bit there, a missed layup.  
We're far away but not that far away. It's hard for me to say.  
  
Q. On the last sequence Craig said he was looking to the bench to see --  
COACH BILL CARMODY: Yeah.  
  
Q. Is it a routine to look for him to see whether you're going to call
timeout and go, or at that point in the game should everybody just go?  
COACH BILL CARMODY: We got the rebound, and I mean -- there was ten seconds
left or something like that. Like I said, when he got the rebound, I didn't
want to call timeout right then. I wanted to let them all get down the court
fast. They all knew from the time-out that we're going to need a three. But if
when they came down, they saw that it wasn't good, then I would have called a
time-out. But I didn't want to do it from the full court.  
  
Q. If you had gotten the ball into your half of the court, do you think Izzo
would have let you all shoot a three or fouled you and forced you to just take
two?  
COACH BILL CARMODY: I'm not sure what he would have done. We would have tried
to prepare for both. You know what I mean? A lot of guys like to foul, a lot
of guys don't. I like to, but I don't know what Tom's (Izzo) thinking on that
is.  
  
Q. I just thought you knew him more as a coach, what his strategy would
be.  
COACH BILL CARMODY: I don't want to say anything because the next time I play
him it won't work out.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks for your time and patience, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [Tommy Amaker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14047)

### [Dion Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16977)

### [Brent Petway](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16976)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: We're very pleased and excited to have a chance to
continue in this great tournament here in Chicago, and I thought these four
seniors in particular gave us great effort in various ways to allow us to come
away with a hard fought victory this morning and afternoon.  
Obviously it wasn't a pretty game in a lot of ways, but certainly we had to do
some things in terms of loose balls, blocking out, gutting things out in a lot
of different ways after we got a big lead. I'm very pleased for us to have a
chance to continue on in the Big Ten Tournament.  
  
Q. Dion, do you think that it was almost infectious with both teams, that
both teams were struggling so much at both ends, it was almost getting into
both teams?  
DION HARRIS: I mean, we -- as far as offense, you mean? Yeah, I guess both
teams were struggling to put it in the basket. But in terms of us, we don't
really want to look at the offensive side of things and base our performance
on that. We really wanted to dig down defensively. I don't think we worried
too much about whether we've got it going offensively. Obviously we wanted to,
and we had to convert going into the second half.  
The main thing was trying to get easy baskets since both teams were struggling
to put it in as far as shooting from the outside, so that's what we did.  
  
Q. Brent, can you talk about the rebounding edge that you guys had and how
that played a role today?  
BRENT PETWAY: We knew coming into an arena like this, it was going to be a lot
of long rebounds because NBA arenas usually have the harder rims, so we knew
everyone was going to have to get on the glass. We talk about it every game
really. Collectively everyone has to box out and get to the offensive glass
and defensively I thought we did a pretty good job of having a balanced game
today.  
  
Q. Dion, could you just talk about the mentality of the team out on the
floor when the game got to within six and it looked like maybe they could have
got it maybe a little closer? What kind of was going through your mind having
a 15-point lead when it got back down to six?  
DION HARRIS: They got it back down to six, but once again, we've got to take
it upon ourselves as seniors to finish off strong and come out with the win no
matter what. Obviously we don't want a lead to get down to six after we had it
to 15. But we have to do whatever we had to do in order to finish strong and
come out with the victory.  
  
Q. For any of the players, just in terms of a chance to play Ohio State for
the second time in a week, and obviously what happened last Saturday, just the
opportunity that presents itself tomorrow for you guys against Ohio State.  
BRENT PETWAY: It's going to be another fun game. Hopefully we get to play the
No. 1 team in the country, and that's always an opportunity you look forward
to. It's tournament time, and it's just going to be fun. We'll be ready for
it.  
  
Q. For any of the players, do you guys pay any attention to the fact that
some people say you have to win one or two or three games to make the NCAAs?
Are you just concentrating on one at a time?  
DION HARRIS: We're not paying attention to any of that stuff. We know what we
have to do as far as taking it game by game, and right now all we're focused
on is playing Ohio State. That's it.  
  
Q. For anybody, considering the way the Ohio State game turned out that you
kind of had the lead for most of it, have you been thinking about that? Was it
hard to put that out of your mind for this one?  
BRENT PETWAY: Luckily we had a couple days to get ready for this game, so I
think that helped us a little bit, no question. But coming into tournament
time, it doesn't matter what you've done.  
Leading into the tournament, you can always start getting things rolling right
when the tournament starts. We felt like we have been playing our best
basketball in the past ten days, something like that, but it always starts
with the first game in the tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: We can continue with questions for Coach Amaker, please.  
  
Q. Winning four is difficult over four days. Is it an advantage, though,
going into your second game having played today on this court, or is it a
deficit of coming back, back to back?  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: Well, I'm sure you can get a number of different theories
on what's the best scenario, I think, and my experience always has been of the
mindset of getting in the tournament, and whatever tournament that is, and
obviously we're speaking about the Big Ten tournament now, try and get
momentum within the tournament.  
So by winning our first game, being the first game here today and hopefully
getting a point of reference with the arena, the floor, the court, all the
things around being in tournament play, I like the fact that we were able to
do that, and certainly it's always nice if you can say that and you have a
victory. We were able to do that now, so we're going to see if we can use it
to our advantage.  
I'm sure if you're on the other side, if you're one of the teams that has a
bye, that they're feeling good and I'm sure they're selling it to the players
that it's better to have an extra day of rest and feel the teams and scout
things. But certainly we feel good about winning this first game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about a couple guys getting in foul trouble in the first
half?  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: I mentioned to our kids in the locker room that I thought
our bench gave us a great boost today. I thought that the three by Ron
Coleman, I don't know if it was a three or a two now, but the jump shot that
he made late, certainly was a big bucket for us because we had been struggling
offensively and had the lead dwindle down. So I thought that was a big basket.  
But you're right, DeShawn gave us great minutes, especially with free throws
in the first half, trying to get out of the blocks. Both teams were struggling
to score as we did the whole game, but certainly the start of the game, and I
thought his aggressiveness, his energy around the baskets, getting rebounds,
put-backs, making foul shots for us, I thought he allowed us to break the ice
and get a little rhythm and be a little more comfortable in this environment.  
  
Q. What do you attribute the struggles offensively today for both teams? Was
it the nerves, the NBA style arena?  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: You could look at a lot of different things. I think a lot
of times you see it happen in tournament play where teams are struggling
offensively to score and shoot. I was pleased that we didn't allow that to
become a crutch for us not to continue to dig in defensively.  
I thought we were really hustling, getting loose balls, Jerret Smith being on
the floor a number of times throughout the ballgame, coming up with loose
balls. I thought it was one of those moments where both teams were struggling,
and whatever team was maybe going to hit a stride, and I thought we hit it in
the second half and opened it up and gave us the cushion that we certainly
needed to win this basketball game.  
  
Q. How important was this win for you guys personally? A loss here gives
some critics a little more fodder. How important was the win for you
personally?  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: It's not about me personally. I appreciate the question,
but certainly it's about our team and trying to see if we can advance within
this tournament. I thought our kids came in with great spirit.  
Obviously coming off, as some of you have mentioned, about our previous game,
our loss that we had in our final game at home, and being able to kind of
regroup and go for this tournament. I was very pleased with our kids for the
effort that they gave today, especially defensively on the backboard, and for
us to get 21 wins and advance in our tournament right now is a very positive,
good feeling for us.  
  
Q. How have you been able to internalize everything that's been going on
with you and surrounding this team? It's like you've been able to keep the
guys focused. Your team seems to be concentrating on the games and not
necessarily all the things that surround them.  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: Well, I'm pleased that they are. I think it goes to show
that we have really good kids. These four seniors in particular have been
tremendous with our ball club and doing things on the floor, being solid
citizens for us in the locker room and taking care of our team. I just think
our kids have been able to respond to what we've been trying to teach and
staying very focused. I'm not sure everything that's swirling around us and
all those things, we're focused on what's right in front of us, and I think
that's been the key, to stay focused, and I'm pleased that our kids have taken
that lead, as well.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, appreciate your time. Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2007

  

### [Jamal Abu-Shamala](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16979)

### [Jim Molinari](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16980)

### [Spencer Tollackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16978)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
Q. Guys, first Spencer. It looked like you went up to coach before the game
and sat down and asked him, anything that you said, anything important?  
SPENCER TOLLACKSON: He actually just called me over and just told me not to
worry about whatever happens on the offensive end. Don't worry about anything
that happens on the offensive end, just try to focus and try to play physical
defensively and just try to block out and keep my guy off the glass and the
offense will come.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about -- I'm sure you guys have answered this question
already, but just about how the season has been just during the losing streak,
and how do you maybe try to look on trying to build something for next year,
just being competitive against some of the top teams? You started out with
Ohio State and Wisconsin.  
JAMAL ABU-SHAMALA: It's been a tough year with a lot of adversity. We've kept
battling, and all the coaches and all the players, we just kept fighting
through it.  
We're a young team, and we had trouble holding off some good teams. In a tough
stretch when Spencer was out, we played them tough, but we just couldn't hold
them off, and I think that was partially experience and not having the
experience. We had a lot of new guys that just came in.  
It's just been tough, but I think we've just got to get back to work now right
away and not take any time off and just continue to get better. Just keep
building and trying to make things better for next year.  
  
Q. This is question is for Spencer. While you were injured and when you
watched the team play, and like I said, when they had a couple of those games
against some of the top teams and they were right there with them, what were
you thinking about kind of towards next year and how good this team could
be?  
SPENCER TOLLACKSON: I think it was obviously frustrating for me to have to sit
out, but I have complete confidence in my team with or without me. This team
has a lot of character, and I think that that's really where winning starts.  
We're definitely looking forward to next year. We're just going to -- like
Jamal said, I don't think anybody wants to take any time off. We all wanted to
play tomorrow and the next day and the next day. Unfortunately it didn't
happen.  
It's going to be up to our captains. We're probably going to take a day or two
off and get right back and start lifting weights again, having open gyms. I
wouldn't be surprised if we started giving each other workouts. This team has
a lot of heart and a lot of character, and we'll just put this year behind us,
learn from it and move on to next year.  
  
Q. Talking to a couple guys in the locker room, they were saying that coach
tells you some things outside basketball. Tell us what he's told you
throughout the year, life lessons, I guess.  
SPENCER TOLLACKSON: I mean, I think if I ever had a pencil and a piece of
paper, Coach Molinari would have written down more wisdom quotes, I guess you
could say, than I've ever heard in my life. He's like a wizard. Don't let the
gray hair fool you. He knows a lot about life. He's always talking to guys not
just about basketball. He's a great basketball coach, but we love him for the
person that he is, for the father that he is. He's definitely taught me
tremendous life lessons, especially going out with my hand this year.  
We've had private conversations where he's really touched me, and I'll never
forget that.  
But like you said, I'll say it and everybody else on the team will say he's
definitely taught us a lot of life lessons.  
JAMAL ABU-SHAMALA: I'll just add on that. I've never seen a coach work as hard
off the court with just trying to get guys to push themselves with academics
and basketball. Hardest working coach I've ever had. I mean, he just put in
more time than anyone that I've ever worked with. He's just really truthful
and has pushed us to be the best players that we could be. I just want to
thank him for that.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for Coach Molinari.  
  
Q. When you took over this team for Coach Monson, what kind of expectations
did you have? I mean, how good did you think this team could be?  
COACH JIM MOLINARI: I think I have higher expectations, but there's no
excuses, injuries are part of it, but Spencer going out for seven or eight
games really hurt us. That broke a lot of it -- he was playing at a high level
then.  
But I knew it would be a struggle, but I also think that this is a year in the
Big Ten where the middle of the pack is so good, other than the two top teams,
that every game is so important.  
I always tell people, you never want to be the bottom three. If you're in the
top two you get the best games, but if you're in the bottom three it's tough,
too. I knew it would be a struggle, but I think they've grown. I think they've
grown. We would like to have a few more wins, but I'm proud of them. They
never quit. They care.  
  
Q. A lot of years in coaching, how difficult was this season for you?  
COACH JIM MOLINARI: Losing is difficult. It's always difficult. I mean, it's
really difficult on young people, too.  
But other than that, no, there's a lot of reward. I kind of judged it going in
just to move the program along, moved them along, move every area along. I
think we've done that. I completely trust the leadership at Minnesota that
they'll benefit from this, and next year will be better. They're all back.
They've got to have some growth and probably some additions, maybe some
subtractions.  
It was difficult but it was also a great year, and I appreciate the
opportunity.  
  
Q. As far as your philosophy has always been defense, and it seemed like
there was a time when the team was playing pretty good D to start off and then
it got away from that. What do you think about this team's identity? Was it
ever to form an identity towards what you wanted them to do?  
COACH JIM MOLINARI: Well, I think we got back to it the last few games here.
We just had a hard time -- if you hold the team to 27 percent shooting and
lose. I thought this year we would get over the hump. I give Michigan credit.
They did a tremendous job. They're very long. They're very hard to shoot over.
So, I think they understand defense. We need help at the point guard, and what
happened this year. I'm sure that's going to come under way with the two
guards they signed.  
  
Q. Obviously you said losing is difficult, but after hearing what Spencer
and Jamal had to say, does that take a little sting away or make you feel
better about what you had accomplished this year?  
COACH JIM MOLINARI: Oh, yeah. I love this group. I love coaching and I love
doing that part of it. It's just like raising your kids. You don't tell them
what's important tomorrow; you tell them what's important in five years. But
that's the philosophy under Joel (Maturi), that's the philosophy of Minnesota
athletics. The student-athletes really are pushed in all areas. So yeah,
that's always rewarding, but still, I like to see them benefit a little more
from all their hard work. But I still say they will get that. It's hard for
young people if they don't get immediate gratification, but they will get that
down before they all leave.  
  
Q. After the experience this year, is your main hope to be a head coach
again or would you setting for an assistant?  
COACH JIM MOLINARI: Right, that's what I would like to do at the highest
level, no doubt. I appreciate the opportunity, no doubt, that's what I want to
do.  
The reality, these are all growing experiences. That's something I would love
to do.  
THE MODERATOR: Appreciate it, Coach. Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2007

  

### [Trent Plaisted](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16408)

### [Dave Rose](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13817)

### [Keena Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17069)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Brigham Young University head Coach Dave Rose
and student-athletes Keena Young and Trent Plaisted.  
Coach, if you want to begin with some opening remarks.  
COACH ROSE: Well, I thought it was a very hard-fought contest. I thought both
teams played really well. I'm very proud of our team. I thought we battled,
gave a great effort. They played like champions, like the champions that they
are.  
It was a game that came down right to the end. I couldn't be prouder of a
group of players because they battled to the very end.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Compared to the first time you played down here, can you compare those
games? Were there certain things you needed to work on specifically from that
first game, or was it a matter of the natural progression of the season that
led to a better start tonight?  
TRENT PLAISTED: You know, whenever you lose there's always things you
recognize and you got to work on. I mean, I'm sure that our coaches, they're
great coaches, they'll go analyze the film and we'll get prepared to practice
some of our weaknesses that we need to work on for the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Trent, seemed like every time you touched the ball, it was a struggle out
there for you. Seemed like they were on you defensively. Can you talk about
the defense of UNLV.  
TRENT PLAISTED: Yeah, they did a great job. They're big; they're physical;
they really did a good job on me tonight.  
Keena was great tonight. He really picked our team up and gave us a lift.  
  
Q. Keena, did you feel like UNLV really had no answer for you defensively?  
KEENA YOUNG: No, my team and my coaches just kept coming to me, and I had to
score. They gave me the ball and position where I could score. That's all my
teammates' doing.  
  
Q. Talk about the emotions of the game. It was going seesaw, back and forth.
A couple times you would score, then scream and go crazy. How emotional was it
today?  
KEENA YOUNG: It was very emotional (smiling). It's March. Everybody's
emotion's high; everybody want to win games. It was just a hard-fought battle
and both teams play well.  
  
Q. Do you feel like maybe you guys let this slip away and it really should
have been your ballgame?  
TRENT PLAISTED: You know, obviously you want to win every game you play. But I
think our team, we gave a great effort tonight. We fought as hard as we could.  
Whenever you lose a game, you're going to reflect on all the little tic-tac
things. I thought we gave a great effort. The result wasn't in our favor, but
we fought hard. What else can you ask for?  
  
Q. How big a role did you feel like the missed free-throws had in the game
tonight?  
KEENA YOUNG: Free-throws was big. You know, we didn't make 'em when we should
have. But, you know, we have to keep playing hard.  
  
Q. How does this affect your preparation, your momentum, in your opinion,
going into the NCAA tournament?  
KEENA YOUNG: It's going to hurt. But, you know, we got another game left, and
we'll get ready for that one. We got to put this one behind us and be prepared
to play the next opponent.  
TRENT PLAISTED: The great thing about our team is ever since I've been here
and since Coach Rose has been our coach, we've really responded well to the
losses. I mean, if you're trying to pull a positive out of a negative, maybe
that's what you look for.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, we'll let you guys go. Thank you.  
Questions for Coach Rose.  
  
Q. At one point I think White, Kruger and Wink were 1-14, but Umeh hit shots
that kept them in it. Can you plan for a guy like that?  
COACH ROSE: We thought one of the keys to the game was to be able to defend
the three-point line, knew that obviously Kruger and Wink had great seasons
and were really good from the perimeter.  
Umeh is a guy who has a lot of experience, has made big shots. After he hit
the first two, we kind of tried to change our defense on him a little bit.
That makes it tougher to guard the post because you got three perimeter guys
who are really good shooting the ball.  
Give UNLV credit, they played well, they battled. They did what it took to
win.  
  
Q. It seems like all season on the missed free-throws it's been like
something that doesn't want to be discussed. Is there a particular reason,
other than you just didn't make them, why you miss seven in the second half?  
COACH ROSE: I think the concentration level was good. Maybe fatigue a little
bit, playing three nights in a row. But you battle through it. You battle
through nights when you're not shooting the ball very well from the perimeter.  
You try to get inside, vice versa. We had plenty of chances. UNLV just made
more plays than we did.  
  
Q. Did you think the crowd, home court, moving this thing back here, was
there any particular reason? Again, was it your ballgame to win and you didn't
get it done?  
COACH ROSE: I think both teams played really well. It was a matter of tonight
UNLV played better.  
  
Q. I noticed even last night the first half you guys had a lot of touch
passing, not much dribbling in the first half, but in the second half you went
more to a dribble offense. Was there a purpose in that?  
COACH ROSE: A lot of it has to do with how teams are guarding you. I think the
pressure that UNLV put on us tonight, and Wyoming in the second half last
night, caused it to be a lot more difficult to reverse the ball.  
That's what we like to do: Reverse the ball in the perimeter, enter in the
post. They made it a lot more difficult to do that.  
We just kind of created a few other things off the dribble that we like to
run. I thought our guys executed it well. We shot 50% from the field and got
good shots. KT was doing what he normally does for us. Came down to a couple
plays late.  
  
Q. What are your feelings about having to play on a top 25-ranked team's
home court for the conference championship?  
COACH ROSE: Well, you face the challenges that are put in front of you. I
think that's what we talk about all the time with our team. That was the
challenge. I thought we were up to it.  
We played, you know, really well. We just didn't play well enough to win.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH ROSE: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Mountain West Conference champions UNLV head
coach Lon Kruger and student-athletes and tournament MVP Kevin Kruger, Wink
Adams and Michael Umeh.  
Coach, if you want to begin with some general comments about the game.  
COACH KRUGER: Outstanding game. Obviously I thought BYU opened it just as
they've been playing all year: just with great energy and poise. I thought
they were much more physical than we were in the first half, knocked us off
our spots a bit, got where they wanted to.  
I thought our guys really responded in the second half and made some
adjustments. It went right back at them, which you have to do to have a chance
against BYU.  
I think they're an outstanding club. Good to see a lot of our guys step
forward. So many guys making plays for each other down the stretch, especially
in the second half. Happy with the fans. The fans have been great.  
Obviously this is what memories are good -- memories from this will be good
for a long time. Happy for a lot of folks today. Delighted with the outcome.
Certainly want to congratulate BYU for their play, a great season. Hopefully
we'll get BYU and Air Force, we'll all go a ways in the tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for any of the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Michael, can you tell us what it means to you to come through so big in
such a big game for a coach that stuck with you, showed confidence in you,
despite early-season struggles for you?  
MICHAEL UMEH: Definitely ups and downs through the year. But, you know, we
definitely wanted to come out today, you know, prove that we're a good team. A
lot of guys stepped up in different ways. I'm real proud of the guys.  
  
Q. Mike, going through the injury, the hardships, then getting a chance down
the stretch for a little vindication. Had to feel good for you, huh?  
MICHAEL UMEH: Yeah, definitely feel good. My teammates are always pulling for
me. These two guys, Wink and Kevin, they've been playing great all year. We
stayed talking to each other. We stay pulling for each other. It was
definitely a fun experience in there.  
  
Q. Kevin, you struggled early on in the game. First shot you hit happened to
be a four-point play. That seemed to relax you and your team. Kind of the
changing point in the game. How big was hitting that shot for you?  
KEVIN KRUGER: I think it just helped me relax a little bit. It felt good, kind
of settled me down a little bit, put me back into kind of the mode I wanted to
be in or expected to be in the whole game.  
It just seemed like the game kind of slowed down after that point for me
personally.  
  
Q. Wink, last year you said you remembered watching UNLV play while you were
a kid back in the early '90s. Can you talk about how fulfilling a feeling it
is to be part of the team that has kind of resurrected UNLV back into a
national story?  
WINK ADAMS: All year we've been talking about setting the bar high, following
our seniors. I think Kevin and Mike, all our seniors, did a great job this
year, showing the things we need to do on and off the court.  
We just happened to follow behind 'em. They leading the way right now. We just
got to do what we got to do to back them up.  
  
Q. How nice was it playing on your home court with all those fans behind
you?  
MICHAEL UMEH: It was definitely, you know, nice. Four years I played here;
it's a great experience. The fans have been good all year. It's definitely
good to go out on top like this.  
  
Q. After the first 10 minutes you played about as bad you could play. What
were you thinking at that point it was going to take to turn the game
around?  
KEVIN KRUGER: After the first 10 minutes they came out and threw a haymaker
and it landed pretty much. We just had to settle down, be more physical.  
We talked about the things we had to do to change the game in our favor. We
responded well. Things kind of turned from there.  
  
Q. Kevin, how big of an advantage do you think it is being able to play on
your home court for the conference championship tournament?  
KEVIN KRUGER: I think it's an advantage. But, I mean, you look at it, this is
what conference tournaments, the way they're supposed to be. I mean, in other
conferences, the regular-season champion hosts the tournament.  
You know, this conference isn't like that. I mean, that was a pretty neutral
feeling out there for a while. BYU brought a lot of people. Other schools did,
too. Vegas is a place people want to be.  
  
Q. Michael, you were the first one up the ladder, which seems to be
appropriate. Spoon was here to see you today. Can you talk about when you made
the decision that you wanted to stay, and then you go through the knees, and
now being up on that ladder. Coming full circle for you?  
MICHAEL UMEH: Definitely has been a long journey. Definitely like to thank
Spoon for giving me the opportunity to come here. Glad he was in the stands
today. Definitely been a road, and I'm glad to be able to finish like this.  
I'm happy for my teammates. I'm happy for everybody who's a part of this.
Really looking forward to keep on going.  
  
Q. The two seniors, this being your final time on this court, walking off
the court, talk about the emotion, what you felt being so far down in the
first half, coming back and winning it like that.  
KEVIN KRUGER: It felt great. It was an emotional rush, you know, to kind of
come together the way we did and to win it. We could have easily folded and
packed up and considered it a pretty good tournament, a pretty good season,
regular season.  
But, you know, we didn't. We came together and fought through some things,
ended up with the victory.  
  
Q. Kevin, the thigh bruise against Wyoming kind of set you back. You were
out for five games. You're a very humble person. Third team Mountain West.
Today holding up that MVP trophy was a sweet feeling?  
KEVIN KRUGER: It was. But it's not possible. Today we came out, and Mike Umeh
was the MVP of the most important game. I mean, the trophy really doesn't mean
much, because if he didn't play the way he did, if Wink didn't hit the three
to out up one and get us over the hump, if Joel doesn't block a shot, you can
go down the line. There really isn't an MVP on this team.  
  
Q. Kevin, one of the leaders on the team, but a leader out in the community
in terms of drumming up support for this team this year. I'm wondering why you
made a choice to be a leader of this team?  
KEVIN KRUGER: Sports-wise, Vegas is a basketball town. You just have to
convince the people what they're paying their money to go see is a good thing.
To get behind and support is a fun thing to do. I mean, to go out there and
see, I don't know, what was it, 13,000, 14,000 at a conference tournament
championship game, the conference can't ask for anything better than that.  
We as players, that was fun to play in. If we would have been on the road and
played in that environment it would have been fun no matter what happened.  
But, you know, we felt that the fans getting behind us and helping us out, I
mean, it can't hurt anything. They did a great job. The fans are responsible
for a number of victories just by showing up and being loud and getting on the
other teams and whatnot.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thanks very much. We'll let you three go. Actually
attendance was 16,204 which was a Mountain West Conference championship
record.  
Questions for coach.  
  
Q. You've been around the game a long time. What does this game rank up
there for you personally?  
COACH KRUGER: Ranks very high. I think especially the way it came about. BYU
dominated us early, again, knocked us around, did things they wanted to do.  
Our guys had that look in their eye, yet they kind of regrouped, hung in there
and finally got a little bit of activity going defensively, got some defensive
boards, made some shots, then got on a really nice roll in the second half.  
I thought that stretch of basketball when it was going -- we were up one, down
one, back and forth for four or five possessions, was a pretty gritty effort
by players on both team, guys making really good basketball plays.  
  
Q. When you come into a program and you have a good player like that on the
fence of whether he's going to stay or go because someone else recruited him,
what did you say to him that you wanted him to stay? Knowing as he went
through the injuries, coming out today, what do you think of his journey?  
COACH KRUGER: Michael Umeh is just an outstanding person. It was very easy.
Spoon, you know, talked about the players when we came in. He raved about Mike
not only as a player but as a young man.  
You've got to have people in the core of your program to get things turned, to
get things going. Michael Umeh is as good as you can have in that regard.  
I thought his play today resembled what it was two years ago. Last year he
fought through those injuries. I thought today he had some pretty good bounce
and confidence in that jumper. He was outstanding.  
  
Q. You were down 11 at halftime. What did you say to your team or what
adjustments did you make?  
COACH KRUGER: Talked to the team about, you know, just playing each possession
like it's the most important one of a ballgame. Every rebound, every defensive
possession, every effort, to block out. Just all the little things.  
It's not a matter of getting 11 points back in one or two possessions. You've
got to grind away. Again, I thought our team grew a little bit in the area of
being tough enough and a little bit more physical through screens. Again,
that's because BYU forced that upon us. That was a good response.  
  
Q. Even in the first half when things got tough, they went to Young and he
came through. Most of the game he came through. Do you feel like you got a
player that you could go to when things get tough, or do you need somebody
like that?  
COACH KRUGER: As you know, on the year we've had different guys at different
times step up in big ways, hit big shots. Even today, as Kev mentioned, Wink
makes a three, Michael makes several plays, Gaston goes to the line, Wendell
some baseline jumpers. A lot of different guys I thought stepped up and made
big shots at different times.  
Young was terrific. He was outstanding. We had no answer for him. Even Joel a
couple times thought he had him measured defensively and Young still got it
around him and in. Real credit to Keena. He's had that type of year
throughout.  
  
Q. In here earlier Coach Rose addressed the 40 minutes of hell that your
defense gives. In the first half they were pretty relaxed, able to touch pass,
didn't have to dribble. What adjustments did you make to force them to put the
basketball on the floor? That takes them out of their MO.  
COACH KRUGER: Seems like on the year we've had stretches where teams are a
little bit comfortable, we kind of get into a little bit of a rhythm, figure
it out a little bit kind of on the fly. I thought just getting up into 'em.  
Again, that's when we've been successful, when we get up into the ball, force
'em to try to do things other than what they're comfortable doing.  
BYU is hard to do. Really good basketball team. BYU handled that pressure very
well early. I thought they handled it pretty well throughout. It was just a
case of, you know, some loose balls, some jumpers going down for us. I thought
BYU played great.  
  
Q. We know what you think of Kevin as a player. As your son, do you take any
of this personal, like he's giving a gift to you of having this great season,
helping you get your first tournament as UNLV head coach, drum up that
support?  
COACH KRUGER: Absolutely. Again, not only is Kevin doing that, but each of the
seniors and the other players on the team I think have really been focused on,
you know, playing as if they've got something to prove. Every day, making
progress, focusing on the next game.  
Again, I've said many times, this group has really maintained a perspective
that's allowed them to make that progress consistently throughout the year and
not get complacent or satisfied with just getting partway, but continuing to
improve. We've gotten better in the last two or three weeks.  
Again, that's coincided with being healthier, but we've definitely improved
throughout the year.  
  
Q. I saw a stat this week. I believe now you're the fifth coach in NCAA
history to take four different teams to the NCAA tournament. Talk about how it
feels for you personally coming all the way back from the time you went to the
NBA, here to UNLV, building to this point?  
COACH KRUGER: Feels great. I don't know that it feels good for me; it feels
great the satisfaction that the fans are receiving, the players, the moments
like this today. It's like opening packages. You much prefer watching others
open their packages than opening your own.  
That's what I get from this, seeing so many people enjoy it, so many people
come together, feeling good about the direction we're headed. People in town.
I mean, that's where the satisfaction is. For these guys to have memories that
they'll cherish forever is what's special to me.  
Again, there's no secret to it. Get good people, get good players. They buy
into a common cause, enjoy getting better and doing it for each other.  
  
Q. Most of the season the local media has been asking you about possibly
making the NCAA tournament. Now that you're actually in the NCAA tournament,
if you had an opportunity to address the selection committee, what would you
say to them as far as seeding, where you think you should be playing?  
COACH KRUGER: As you know, what I have to say is totally irrelevant (smiling).  
I felt going into today, I talked to some people beforehand, I thought the
winner of this would get and deserve a four, if not a three. Maybe BYU could
have bumped it to a three. The loser, you know, four, five, six. I think
that's the way it should be. All that means nothing. But I'm a fan, too. My
opinion's not worth anything more than anyone else's.  
I think Air Force, they've been there all year. They deserve to be in. I think
the three teams can represent the league very well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks very much, coach. Again, congratulations. Good luck
tomorrow.  
COACH KRUGER: Thank you.

### [Dale Layer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13802)

### [Cory Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17063)

### [Jason Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16403)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Colorado State University head coach Dale Layer
and student-athletes Jason Smith and Cory Lewis.  
Coach Layer, general comments on the game.  
COACH LAYER: I thought we had seen the best UNLV team last Saturday, but I
thought they were even better tonight. There's no way in the world that I
would have thought we would even be in the game having witnessed them shoot 15
for 25 from threes.  
I'm just proud of our guys for fighting and getting after it and making it a
game as late as a couple minutes to play. I would have figured anybody that
would have shot 60% from threes would have been up 20, 25. I'm proud of our
guys for hanging in there, competing to the last tick of the clock.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jason, what's it like when you're out on the court and a guy is hot like
Kruger was, hitting three after three?  
JASON SMITH: It was a struggle, but Kruger's a really good player. He was
really hot tonight. He did a really good job tonight.  
  
Q. Cory, you were going like you knew it could be your last game. Jason, you
just look exhausted. How did you find anything left after last night?  
CORY LEWIS: We just dug deep. We knew as a team we had to come out and play
hard because they're a very aggressive team, a very good team. We knew we had
to play even with more energy because we was at their house, too.  
It was going to be a hard-fought game. We knew we had to find energy, some
way, somehow. We had to full together as a team and keep battling.  
  
Q. Jason, it seemed like as the game went on, you kept driving inside. Even
when you had the open shots, they sometimes weren't falling. Was it just one
of those nights?  
JASON SMITH: It was definitely a struggle for us inside. They also had
Anthony. He's a real big presence inside. He affected a lot of our shots. They
have a really good team. I think UNLV will do really well in our tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, guys, we'll let you two go. Thanks, Cory and Jason.  
Questions for Coach Layer.  
  
Q. Can you talk about their guard play.  
COACH LAYER: Well, they just shot the lights out. Gee, what are you going to
say? I mean, they had, what, four or five guys knock down threes. What are
they shooting on the year, 33%? They have just a little bit better than an
average game, we may win.  
But they shot the lights out. I thought we played much better tonight than we
did on Saturday here. I thought we battled. Every possession, every bounce of
the ball we fought. They just had it going. I mean, I don't know what you do.  
They were 9 for 12 from threes in the first half. 9 of the 12 were contested.
They had three open looks. Well, hey, we were doing our job. We were playing
pretty well.  
You know, their pressure is really, really good. They've got five seniors who
have been through the wars in two or three different leagues. They're on their
home court. They're should shoot the lights out. Who beats 'em tonight?  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.

### [Brandon Ewing](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16406)

### [Brad Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16414)

### [Steve McClain](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13814)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by University of Wyoming head coach Steve
McClain and student-athletes Brandon Ewing and Brad Jones.  
Coach, general comments on the game.  
COACH McCLAIN: I thought, one, BYU played really well. They shot the ball
really well in the first half. You know, I thought our kids gave a gutsy
effort in the second half. We got it to six, then we just could never get it
below that.  
But, you know, I think they showed -- our kids showed they were going to just
keep fighting till the end. You know, I think that's what our program stands
for.  
You know, it's disappointing, but you hope you learn something from it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Rough first half. A great second half for you. What was the big
difference? Seemed like you had a hard time containing BYU in the post in the
first half, but better in the second.  
BRANDON EWING: Well, the main difference was we got on each other in the
locker room at halftime. All the trouble was we didn't want to lose, we didn't
want to go home so soon, so we came out and showed everybody we wanted to win.  
Just we came up a little bit short. We cut it to six opinions. But that
20-point deficit at halftime, it really hurt us a lot. If we were able to cut
it down to 10 at halftime we probably would have come up with the win.  
  
Q. What happened in the first half today that was so different than against
Air Force when you got off to the fast start? Were you just stunned? What
happened?  
BRANDON EWING: No, it wasn't stunned. It was just they came out ready to play.
We had the right mindset. We had good open looks. We just wasn't knocking them
down. Every open look they had, they knocked 'em down. Every open look we had
they knocked 'em down. Whether it was a three or a good move, I played there
in the post.  
They were just clicking on all cylinders in the first half. It's hard to beat
a team that's clicking like that. I take my hat off to them. They played a
great half.  
BRAD JONES: Like Brandon said, they came out strong in the first half. We had
the same mindset as yesterday. They was just knocking down shots and we
wasn't.  
  
Q. Did you feel a little shellshocked at first when they kept hitting shot
after shot? Sometimes teams just get on a roll like that.  
BRANDON EWING: No. I don't think we was kind of shocked. We knew they was a
great team. They top 25, so we knew they was a great team coming into the
game.  
It was just, you know, they were just on tonight. It was one of those type
nights for the whole team. When a player hit every shot - and their whole team
was hitting every shot - it's kind of hard to defend one player.  
  
Q. Brad, the last minute or so, it was such a wild helter-skelter thing.
You're pushing the ball down the court, you fell, kept on going. Talk about
how that play was.  
BRAD JONES: Well, I was just trying to make something happen, trying to play
hard. We was down eight points. I was just trying to get the ball down the
court as quick as I could.  
I guess there's a lot of dead spots out on the floor out there. I kind of hit
a dead spot. Didn't come back to me. Tried to dive for it. Just laid into the
crowd. Just trying to do whatever it took to win.  
  
Q. Last year you made it to the championship game. You talked about all year
how that was something to build on coming into this year. Can you build on the
almost comeback that you made here? Is that going to fuel your fire over the
summer?  
BRANDON EWING: We just had a long talk. Coach made a great comment to us at
the end of the game. He said, Let's not put ourselves in a situation where we
have to win a tournament just to make something special happen.  
Why not come in in the situation like BYU, 24, 25 wins, you lose the first
round, you're still going maybe a No. 2 bid in the NCAA tournament.  
Next year that's what we wanted to work on. We kind of want to put this behind
us. We'll probably take a week off and get to work, because next year we just
want to win 24, 25 games, play the tournaments, not put so much pressure on
ourselves to win the tournaments.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.  
Questions for Coach McClain.  
  
Q. I know you talked yesterday. Keena Young had two big games against you in
the regular season. He was kept in check pretty good today. Plaisted and
Cummard and Ainge, they're just full of so many weapons. Were you pleased with
what you did on Young, kind of discouraged about those our guys going off on
you?  
COACH McCLAIN: Well, you know, like Brandon and Brad said, every time early in
the game when we did try to go double 'em they kicked it back out and hit a
three. You know, it was kind of like we were playing the devil's advocate.  
You know, if they'd have missed a couple of those, you can keep going double,
keep trying to do it, but it was almost like anything they did was going to
work. You know, Plaisted just had one of those days where he'd toss it up
there and you think, That one ain't going in. It would just roll around the
rim and go in.  
I thought in the second half, Daaron did a better job on him, got more
aggressive with him. But, again, I just -- you know, they got off to the kind
of start we got off to the night before. You know, we kept trying to recover,
but the harder we went, the more they just kept making shots.  
But, you know, again, that's why they're a good team. Somebody else stepped
up. We did a good job on Keena Young. Plaisted stepped up and had a big night.  
  
Q. During that fast start, were you frustrated with your team's defensive
effort? Were they not guarding as hard as you wanted, or was it strictly BYU
being in the zone?  
COACH McCLAIN: You know, you asked the guys in -- the game in the first three
minutes just had such a different pace to it than what we had spent 40 minutes
the night before. They're coming down just pulling up from three and shooting
threes on the break and they're burying them. Now, if they hadn't buried them,
we would have went down and got layups on them.  
So, no, I think it was more of just we had to adjust to the quickness of the
game, and it took us a while to do that. But, you know, we were in the right
positions. They were just making every shot.  
  
Q. The free-throw line wasn't too kind to you tonight: 15 of 28. Do you want
to comment on that? What was the factor on that?  
COACH McCLAIN: I don't know. The other night we go 21 for 28 or whatever we
were. We've been a good free-throw shooting team all year. We just had some
stretches there where we didn't convert. You can go back to early in the game,
we got to the free-throw line a couple times, couldn't knock them down to cut
that lead a little bit.  
But we've been a good free-throw shooting team all year. Some nights you're
going to have them roll in and out, and we had a few of those tonight.  
  
Q. Commenting on what Brandon said about not putting yourself in the
position to have to win the tournament next year. And obviously you can go
back and look at games during the season and go, We could have got that, We
could have got that, and that probably could have done it.  
COACH McCLAIN: And I think the good thing for us, and why Brandon says that,
why I said it to our team is, we got one senior sitting in that locker room. A
lot of teams are going to leave out of here with four or five seniors. We got
one senior sitting in there.  
Now it's time for these young guys to grow up. Last year they experienced
winning 17 games. This year finishing fifth in the league. Coming out here
with the expectation to win.  
You know, but you do, you go back to the Wisconsin, Milwaukee game. We lost by
two. The Charlotte game we lost by two. We had so many close games there, but
yet I'd love to go back and play those games right now with this team because
we're such a different team now.  
I think that's where Brandon and myself and Brad, you know, you go, just don't
put yourself in a position you have to come out here and win. It doesn't mean
it will happen, but that's what you'd like to do.  
  
Q. What was said at halftime? Was it by you, a player who took charge in the
locker room?  
COACH McCLAIN: I told Brandon walking up the ramp, I said, You're going to
have to get in 'em. You're going to have to just challenge them. I walked in
and challenged them. But I still think there's a difference when one of them
challenges each other, too. And I thought they took that challenge.  
I couldn't have been prouder of how they finished the game. I guarantee you
most of the people in there thought, We're going to get beat by 20. The kids
just weren't going to let that happen. That's the mentality they have. That's
the mentality of our program.  
I got into 'em, then Brandon got into 'em. They came out and responded. That
was good to see.  
  
Q. What's next for you?  
COACH McCLAIN: I don't know. I don't know.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Appreciate it.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2007

  

### [Lee Cummard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17053)

### [Trent Plaisted](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16408)

### [Dave Rose](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13817)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Brigham Young university head Coach Dave Rose
and student-athletes Trent Plaisted and Lee Cummard.  
Coach, if you want to open with some general marks on the game.  
COACH ROSE: Well, I was very proud of our players, how they came out and got
off to a great start. I thought that we were playing very well together, were
unselfish, sharing the ball, we were hitting shots. We got a nice lead.  
The first half was pretty much -- I felt like we, you know, from that early
lead had the half under control. We knew in the second half it would be a
different story.  
Wyoming played very, very hard, had a real will to compete. We matched that
and were able to, you know, kind of carry that early lead into a victory.  
Proud of our players. We'll go back, regroup, got a big one tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Trent, you got 27 points and tied a career high. Can you tell me what was
the trouble at the free-throw line? What would you attribute the nine missed
free-throws to?  
TRENT PLAISTED: You know, there's not really much you can attribute it to. I
didn't step up and knock 'em down when I needed to. I'll do better tomorrow.  
  
Q. Either player, you got off to such a fast start and were able to pretty
much own the paint as well. Did you see anything or try to do anything to get
off to such a fast start?  
TRENT PLAISTED: That's always an emphasis for our team: To get off to a good
start, kind of get a lead that we can work with.  
It's hard when you get a lead as big as that as early as we did. You know, you
might get a little bit complacent. We were able to hold 'em off. It just
worked out for us.  
LEE CUMMARD: Like Trent said, emphasis, coach wants us to win that first four
minutes. Austin created some shots. We got some steals for easy buckets.
Obviously our defensive effort is what created the big lead.  
  
Q. Can you talk about now moving into the championship game, the thrill it
is to play for a title here.  
TRENT PLAISTED: You know, that's been our goal all year long. You want to win
a Mountain West championship. Obviously when you come to the conference
tournament you want a championship here.  
We've put ourselves in a great position to do that. Whoever we play, we'll be
ready for 'em.  
LEE CUMMARD: Along the same lines. Tomorrow's going to be a fun night. No
matter who we play we're looking forward to it. We got great fans coming to
support us. Got really fun tonight when it got loud, interesting at the end,
so...  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, we'll let you two go. Thank you.  
Questions for Coach Rose.  
  
Q. Big first half, then Wyoming made things interesting in the second. What
was the big difference? Was it maybe the lack of focus in the second half with
the big lead, or did Wyoming do anything different?  
COACH ROSE: I think a lot of it was Wyoming, I mean, they're very athletic.
You get in a situation at this time of year when, you know, players realize
that the season's over if you don't win, and it changes the mindset.  
I think they came out in the second half with great determination. I think we
were real fortunate we played as well as we did in the first half.  
  
Q. Lee talked a little bit about the crowd, enthusiasm, how loud it got
inside the stadium. Can you talk about moving from Denver to here? You have
more fans it seems here. Also moving into the championship game, thoughts on
that?  
COACH ROSE: Well, I think the way we've addressed it as a team is that
wherever the conference decides to have the tournament we'll go down and play.
This seems to be a lot more excitement -- there seems to be a lot more
excitement here as far as ticket requests are concerned.  
That must mean there's a lot more people that are here. But as far as who we
play, we'll deal with that in a couple hours.  
  
Q. What did you say to the team when it got down to six opinions with just
over three minutes or four minutes to play? You had a timeout. What were you
communicating to your team?  
COACH ROSE: Mainly we were just trying to be positive, you know, trying to get
some confidence going. All we needed to do was make a free-throw or make a
shot and it would really settle everything down.  
But we knew they were going to continue to contest every pass, contest every
dribble, contest every catch, and that we just needed to get ourself in a
positive mind frame of, you know, we just need to finish the game off.  
But that time, that three minutes or two-minute mark, I mean, we knew that
there would be a lot more possessions in the game, that the game was a long
ways from being over, that we just needed to continue to be confident, play
confident.  
  
Q. How big was Mike's three?  
COACH ROSE: I think Mike's three was very big for our confidence. But I also
think that put-back that Lee had sometime in that stretch was a real big shot
for us.  
I've said this all year long: it's hard to win games. Your guys have to really
compete. You have to compete for 40 minutes. I thought our guys did really
well down the stretch.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. Good luck tomorrow.  
COACH ROSE: Thank you.

### [Wink Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17064)

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

### [Kevin Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17015)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UNLV head coach Lon Kruger and student-athletes
Kevin Kruger and Wink Adams. Coach, if you want to just give some comment on
the game.  
COACH KRUGER: Again, a ballgame that, you know, had different stretches
throughout. Some parts where there was a real good pace to it, we had things
going defensively, other parts where it seemed like it took forever to finish
the last 12, 13 minutes.  
A lot of good guys stepping, in making some plays. A lot of guys shooting the
ball well obviously, created a bit of a margin there prior to halftime and
played with that throughout most of the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kevin, you were in a zone there with the three-pointers in the first
half. Did you know going into this game that you were going to have an
opportunity? Did you think they were going to leave you open?  
KEVIN KRUGER: Just, you know, with the way we play as a team leaves a lot of
people open. Like we've said kind of from day one, there isn't really one
person you can focus on.  
I was, you know, open. My teammates were finding me. The ball was just going
in tonight.  
  
Q. Kevin, you get a second chance at BYU. They beat you by 27 up there. Have
you been looking forward to a shot at them again?  
KEVIN KRUGER: I think so. You know, we really just had to take care of
business, you know, yesterday and today. Tomorrow's going to be no different.
We're going to go into tomorrow the same way we went into the last two days.  
  
Q. How nice is it to play at home and not to travel? You have a lot of fans
here. How will that help you tomorrow against BYU?  
COACH KRUGER: You better answer it the way he posed it or he won't like it for
his story (smiling). Don't have to travel. I guess that's the answer.  
KEVIN KRUGER: It's nice not to travel. What was the other one?  
COACH KRUGER: Got our fans here.  
KEVIN KRUGER: We've got our fans here, that's always nice.  
COACH KRUGER: He didn't even try to trick you. He just laid it out there.  
KEVIN KRUGER: And it will help tomorrow (smiling).  
COACH KRUGER: There you go (smiling).  
KEVIN KRUGER: It's nice, you know. We sleep in our beds, play in our gym.  
WINK ADAMS: This is my first time playing at home, a conference tournament. To
me it feels great. I mean, it doesn't change for me.  
I mean, it's just like playing in the regular season, playing at home in front
of fans. Everybody else have fans here too. It's a great atmosphere to play
in.  
  
Q. Both of you shot well tonight. Do you feel like you will have to shoot as
well if not better tomorrow to give yourselves a chance to win?  
KEVIN KRUGER: I think, you know, each game you're going to have to step up a
little bit because you're playing a winner from the day before. Tomorrow
you're playing the winner from the day before and the day before that.  
We're just going to have to play well and stick to the things we do well. I
think, you know, it will help us be successful.  
  
Q. Wink, describe what you were feeling when you were matching Kevin knock
down his first five threes in the first half?  
WINK ADAMS: I mean, when Kevin's hot, all I can do is get the ball in Kevin's
hands to give him an open shoot, try to create advantages to get other
shooters open.  
I believe in Kev and other people. Kev knocked down two in a row, and there's
more to come. I tried to get the ball in his hands as much as I can.  
  
Q. Kevin, you seem kind of modest about the way you were shooting the ball
tonight. You said last night you were afraid you might get 0-for tomorrow. I
guess you didn't have to worry about that.  
KEVIN KRUGER: It's still a possibility. Tomorrow I might go 0-for again, or
0-for. I'm not going to take anything for granted and stick to the feeling
I've had lately. Hopefully it will translate into success tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, we'll let you two go. Thank you.  
KEVIN KRUGER: Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach.  
  
Q. I want to talk about the foul situation. Colorado State was in the double
bonus about seven minutes into the second half. How is the team going to have
to improve? Can you talk about how it's going to have to change tomorrow
afternoon?  
COACH KRUGER: Colorado State, as does BYU, they got those big guys inside,
they pound it in there, tough to guard without fouling some. We got them into
the bonus way earlier than we would like to, for sure.  
But, again, they're big targets. They're hard to guard in there.  
  
Q. Talk about just the game tomorrow. BYU, they're playing very well, but
yet Keena Young, one of their best players, struggled the last two games. Are
you worried he's due for a big game tomorrow?  
COACH KRUGER: They've got a lot of players that are great. They're playing
with a lot of confidence. Keena Young is a huge concern all the time. He's a
terrific player, big-time scorer, in that midrange, low-post area especially.
A lot of other guys, too, to worry about.  
Really like the way they're playing. I think they've been the most confident,
most aggressive team over the last -- well, throughout the conference. That's
why they're conference champions.  
Love what Coach Rose has done. They've just got a ton of weapons. They play
with great energy and play very well together.  
  
Q. Do you recall a point in the season where you said, No matter what
happens from this point out, we're a success, or has that point come yet?  
COACH KRUGER: We felt good about the progress we've made throughout the year,
yet I think our message and reminder to the guys is we've got to focus on
getting better.  
Regardless of what's happened previously, you know, there's no advantage to
not continuing to try to get better each day. Or the attitude of playing to
win one more and playing to get better as you do that.  
Certainly the guys have done well. A lot of teams in the country can feel like
that. I think a lot of those teams also feel like you've got to make progress
and there's still better things to come.  
  
Q. Obviously BYU, they like to push the ball up the floor. Are you going to
try to control the tempo and maybe slow it down or continue what you've been
could go in this tournament?  
COACH KRUGER: BYU does a great job pushing the ball. We like to push it. I
think BYU is pushing it a little more aggressively than we are. They're doing
it great. As always is the case, we'd like to limit theirs and still get ours.  
Yet that's a fine line, because we don't want to get caught up into a
situation where they're playing like they're most comfortable playing, which
obviously is pushing the ball very aggressively.  
  
Q. You guys certainly are not playing tonight like you thought you are
already in the tournament. And of course BYU the same way. Can you talk about
the matchup, having a one-two seed, which is so rarified in conference
tournaments?  
COACH KRUGER: Based on the standings, based on the play throughout the
conference season, you've got the two teams that have played the best during
conference play.  
BYU, I think they're playing with a ton of confidence. I think our guys are,
too.  
I think it will be a great game. I think the atmosphere will be terrific. BYU
has a lot of fans here. We've got a lot here. Should be really exciting and
enjoyable game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH KRUGER: Thank you.
