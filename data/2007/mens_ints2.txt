_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement by
Coach Floyd and then take questions for the student-athletes. Coach?  
TIM FLOYD: We're obviously real pleased with the way our guys played today. I
thought Gabe Pruitt did a terrific job out front on Augustin and we felt like
he was the guy that dominated the ball and really relied on his penetration.
And I thought that Nick and Keith Wilkinson and Taj Gibson behind him really
provided the help to keep Augustin out of the lane. Which was really
important. I thought that our two freshmen Hackett and Lewis did as good a job
as you can do on Durant. He's a special player.  
But I loved our unselfishness today, I loved the way our guys switched screens
and were into each other on the defensive end, the way we defensive rebounded
and we tried to make a big deal about not fouling Texas. We felt like that was
their fourth scorer, and I thought our guys were really aware of playing
without their hands and playing without, and playing with their feet today.
And I thought that that was as important as anything that happened.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Daniel, just talk about defending Durant and what was your reaction when
you were told you were going to be chasing him.  
DANIEL HACKETT: I just tried to go out there and play my best. He's a great
player. The job that I did was nothing if it wasn't for other guys helping me
and screen and rolls and switching, so it was a team deal.  
  
Q. Nick, can you talk about going to the Sweet 16. You guys were kind of
dismissed early on this season and now here you beat Texas by 19 points. Going
to the Sweet 16. Just kind of your emotions and what that feels like.  
NICK YOUNG: Just we're all very excited. We haven't been in a situation like
this. And we're just playing great team ball right now. It's something we need
to do going down the stretch in the NCAA tournament. Hopefully we keep it up
for the next game.  
  
Q. For Daniel, it seems like two of your better games have been the last
two. Did you have any nerves coming into this tournament or was it just
something you had waited to do for so long?  
DANIEL HACKETT: Well, no, I just came in here focused. Ready to win games. And
ready to sacrifice and do whatever it takes to win.  
  
Q. Nick and Lodrick, did you feel like it was a big advantage for y'all that
Texas really only has three really reliable scorers?  
LODRICK STEWART: No, they're an all around great team. Its just not those
three. They're a great team all the way around. They get up and down the court
and they rebound the ball well and they take great shots. I think what really
helped us is our defense of keeping them from the free throw line because we
knew last game they shot 41. So we kept them from the free throw line and that
gave us an advantage right there.  
NICK YOUNG: Those three can play against anybody in the country. They got one
of the best players they're saying right now in the country. So we just went
out there and tried our best against those three and fortunately we came out
tonight and hopefully we just try our best against North Carolina.  
  
Q. Daniel, you came here a year early are, were you thinking at all today
about maybe you might not even have been here today if things had broken
differently.  
DANIEL HACKETT: Being it's been a learning process for me since day one. Guys
like Lodrick and Nick embraced me and did a great job of explaining the
situation.  
I'm just playing hard.  
  
Q. Nick, what did you tell Durant after the game and I guess give us are
thoughts on going up against North Carolina.  
Nick YOUNG: I told him just stay focused and keep his head up. And make the
right choice. Whichever way he goes, decide to go. North Carolina, they're
just a great team. All five of them could play even their bench. So we're
going to go out there like we did tonight and give it our all and win or lost
we're going to keep our heads up.  
  
Q. For Lod and Nick, you got two teams coming out of here from the Pac-10.
Can you say what that says about the strength of the conference that you guys
play in?  
LODRICK STEWART: It speaks a lot about how tough the Pac-10 is. It's a great
conference. One of the best in the country, if not the best. So that just
speaks a lot for us and it's going to just carry this program to the next
level. Well actually Tim Floyd will carry this program to the next level.  
TIM FLOYD: I didn't make a basket tonight.  
LODRICK STEWART: But it's him. It's his system and we just listen to what he
say and go out there and execute tan he just put us in a situation to win.  
Nick YOUNG: Yeah, it's a we'll be here for a long time. We got players in the
Pac-10 like Brooks, Taj Gibson, that play great tonight. Even though he got
hurt. He couldn't talk really out there he still went out there and gave it
his all. So the Pac-10 looking to the future is going to be a great
conference.  
  
Q. Nick, was there ever a time way in the back here, at your time at USC
where you said, boy, I don't know if a moment like this is ever going to
happen?  
Nick YOUNG: Oh, yeah, definitely my first year. We were second to last in the
Pac-10 there. And we only won 12 games I think. So it was very hard for us,
very tough for Gabe and Lod and me being here and then all of a sudden we just
got some great freshmen that came in and helped lifted us and now we're
playing great. Like I said, I hope we just keep it up. It's a great feeling
right now.  
  
Q. Nick, to continue on that theme, we know that your team's been getting
better over the last couple years, but still when people think of L.A.
basketball they think of a different school. Are you still coming in under the
radar or do you think you're a national power?  
Nick YOUNG: We're still the underdogs and that's great for us right now. No,
later on down in the future SC will be one of those UCLA's, those North
Carolina's, those teams they mention in the top five because we got a great
recruiting class coming in and for the future we're just looking, it's looking
bright right now.  
  
Q. Can you guys all talk about the role coach played today with the
defensive game plan and just get getting you guys ready?  
TIM FLOYD: I would like to answer that. It wasn't my plan it was Phil
Johnson's plan and Phil's been doing 16, 18 hours of film work on every team
that we have prepared for all year long. And 95 percent of every plan is his.  
We have been together three different jobs now, and he's the best I've seen at
that type of thing. And I think these guys would concur.  
Nick YOUNG: Oh, yeah. Early this morning we were watching film at breakfast
time so we have been watching film all week and every day just going through
each team's plays and he's been ready, he's been one of the main coaches out
there just guiding us through everything.  
LODRICK STEWART: I'm satisfied how we played out there on defense. Not about
our offense. Just how we get down the stands, talk hands off, and keep teams
from the free throw line and we have players like Daniel that stepped up big,
played one of the best players you'll ever see at the college level great, but
it took a team effort. People behind him just everybody working together. But
we have to give credit to the coaches because their game plan, they put us in
this situation and got us this far. So hopefully he just keep going on, play
North Carolina, we're happy about the win, but we got to go back to L.A. and
get back in the gym and work hard, because that's a great team.  
Nick YOUNG: New Jersey, New Jersey, never been there. Excited about that.  
DANIEL HACKETT: Well, we just came in with a game plan and followed our
scouting report. Coach Johnson, like Coach Floyd said, was incredible. And it
just made the game easier for us. And the second part is on us. For making
plays and running back on defense.  
  
Q. What would you say are the keys to this game and why you won?  
LODRICK STEWART: Defense.  
Nick YOUNG: Rebounding.  
DANIEL HACKETT: Defense.  
(Laughter.)  
Nick YOUNG: Defensive transition. Like coach said.  
  
Q. You guys keep referencing defense. Of the 68 points Texas scored 50 of
them were from two guys, from Durant and Abrams, the defensive scheme that you
were playing, was that kind of what the coaches had set up, hey, kind of keep
a lid on Durant and defensively we're going to shut everybody else out?  
Nick YOUNG: It's basically nothing you could really do against Durant. We just
focus on the or two guys like D.J. Augustin and A.J. Abrams, and we just, you
know, tried our best to contain them to, there's nothing really you can do
about a six-nine guard who can put it on the floor and shoot the three at the
same time.  
  
Q. For Nick or Lodrick, did you get any kind of a boost or a lift from
having Ryan Francis's mother here this week?  
LODRICK STEWART: Oh, yeah, this is a very difficult time for her, Paulette and
our team, and we just got behind her and tried to help her get through
yesterday. It was her son's birthday and it was a tough day for us because we
just think about the times we had with him, the good times and he could easily
be here with us. Enjoying this. But we know he's here with us, because his
spirit is going to live on. In all of us. He will never be forgot to know. So
we just have to keep playing and keep doing this for him, because the
beginning of the season we said we're going to do this for Ryan Francis.  
Nick YOUNG: Oh, yeah, he's been winning all these games for us, he's been our
guardian angel up there just keeping eyes on us, so, no, we didn't win this
game, he helped us.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, gentlemen. Take questions for Coach Floyd.  
  
Q. Kevin Durant scored 30 points, yet you guys are pleased with the defense
you played on him. Can you explain that dynamic and what you did like about
what you did against him?  
TIM FLOYD: Well, I thought the first ten minutes were critical. And that's
where we did our best job on him. Those 10 minutes. We were able to get a
little confidence, we still have a new group that's trying to figure out if
they really belong here or not.  
I think that getting started with him and getting it in their minds that he
was defendable gave them a little confidence in what they were doing
defensively. Now had he gotten out of the box and had 12 early, and they made
that run on us at the end of the half and the beginning of the second half, I
think it could have been a different story.  
But I think the real key was Augustin and the job Gabe Pruitt did on Augustin.
And the help that he had behind him on Augustin. And you know we have been
able to score all year long. We don't try to hold it, we're trying to push it.
I don't know how many we had against Arkansas but 87 again today and our kids
are just real unselfish and we have got great shot makers. But they have got a
belief system right now at this point in the season on the other end and I
think the Oregon game may be helping us. Because I know the difference in how
we're playing now and how we played against them.  
  
Q. Talk about the decision to go with a smaller guy on Durant.  
TIM FLOYD: Phil Johnson wanted to, so I did it. That's about the decision. We
felt like we were going to have to score the ball against them as well. And
that's one of our better scoring lineups. We felt like we had opportunities to
double with the smaller lineup and get there quicker.  
We felt like they were an offensive transition team. That that was, that is
still their biggest focus is getting it from off the defensive board and
getting it down and laying it up. And it enabled us to get three guards back
on defense and instead of two.  
So for the majority of the game they were having to walk the ball up the
floor. And I think that was a result of the small lineup. Had we not gone
small then they probably would have been more transition baskets.  
  
Q. Same question I asked the players about the Pac-10 and what having you
guys and Oregon coming out of here says for the conference?  
TIM FLOYD: Well, you think what's important about our league right now is that
we are so positioned I think for dominance in the future because 16 of the
Top-20 scorers in our league are being back. 15 of the Top-20 rebounders are
back. You have Davon Jefferson and O.J. Mayo coming into our place. Bayliss,
who I think is, you know, certainly a top three or four players in the country
going to Arizona. Everybody's back. You look at the honorable mention team,
those are the guys this our league that everybody is talking about being pros
out of our league. It's a special league and we have referred to that all
season long that if we can survive our league, going against the people that
we have to go against every night, that we are going to have all the
confidence in the world going into the NCAA tournament. And we have referred
to going to Kansas early and playing them on the road, we played them fairly
well. Without Pruitt early in the season, so I think our guys have a belief
that they can play against everybody. Believing it and doing it are two
different things when you're playing North Carolina.  
  
Q. How do you construct a defense that can help out on both Durant and
Augustin?  
TIM FLOYD: Well, you know, we had help from Nick Young and help from Taj
Gibson all night long. The fours and the fives. Just they were just there. But
the key thing you have to do is you have to stay between him and the basket.
And that's what Pruitt did. And Pruitt used his length to keep him off the
foul line. D.J.'s special at getting into the lane and throwing his body into
you and drawing the foul and getting the and one's. And Gabe understood that.
And I think he played him with the proper space and I think that doubling the
screen and rolls really helped us because it put him going north versus south.
Coming off the screen and rolls and allowed us to build in some help behind
him.  
  
Q. It looked like Taj had to leave after he got hit in the mouth. What is
the injury and what's his status at this point?  
TIM FLOYD: Well, they may have to X-ray it and look at it. It was a problem
with his jaw. I hope that it's not broken. But he can't speak right now. He
tried to talk to me in a time out and I didn't understand a word he said. I
had to ask him about eight times and finally he got frustrated telling me and
he just shut up. But he couldn't talk. He was just slurring his words. So I'm
fearful that he might have broken it. But we're going to have to look at it
and see. But I thought he was just absolutely outstanding tonight on the
glass. And he's got a great ability when teams try to press us to handle the
ball in the back court and get us, get the ball into play safely as another
guard.  
He's a very versatile player.  
  
Q. Did you ever think with the injury that of not going into him, but you
kept going to him?  
TIM FLOYD: No, we wanted to keep throwing it to him. We wanted to keep
throwing to him because good things were happening when it went inside.  
  
Q. You've been in the NBA, could you size up Kevin Durant's impact if he
decides to go and would you be surprised if he came back?  
TIM FLOYD: You know, I don't know. It's really not for me to say. It's obvious
that he's going to play in that league when he chooses to play in that league.
And when he does, he will be a guy that people are going to compare other
players with. He's going to be a standard in that league. I really believe
that.  
He's going to get stronger, he's going to get better. He may decide he wants
another year of getting stronger, I don't know. The thing that impresses me
about him is his approach to how he's gotten to this level of greatness. I
wish that more players in our country understood that this kid wasn't out
playing street ball, and wasn't playing pick up games, that he was locked in a
gym in DC for seven years working on individual skills. He's not great because
he's six-ten, he's great because he knows how to play the game and he has a
skill package that allows him to play.  
And I told hum after the game that I don't want him to change because I've
been reading his quotes for three years and the best thing that anybody can
ever say about him ten years from now is that he never changed. Because he's a
wonderful wonderful kid that gets it. Now I had a dinner with a man last night
from Chicago that was telling me about his son's a manager on the Texas team,
and his son plays intermural ball, and in Austin, and Kevin goes over there
and keeps the score during the intermural games and is there and everybody's
there to see Kevin so their intermural games have more people at them than a
lot of the schools in the southwest conference because Kevin is hanging
around. But he's a humble kid and I love his quotes. They're always about
team. But he has built himself because it appears to me that he's just got a
tremendous skill package and he wasn't out playing street ball game, he's
developing like the kids in Europe are developing and how Jordan and Baylor
and how all those guys developed years ago. He gets it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your feelings, I mean this is a team that had huge
question marks and now here you are, you beat a great Texas team by 19 points,
you're going to the Sweet 16. You got feel good about that.  
TIM FLOYD: Well, we're obviously pleased and then you know we talked about it
going into the year that we weren't going to sell this team short. That we had
some players that could obviously play for anybody in the country. And the
questions were the back court. Now I think Gabe Pruitt and Daniel Hackett
deserve the bulk of the credit for their adjustment to a new position, their
ability to get us into play, Gabe's unselfishness his willingness to give up
his scoring, Gabe's a guy that can score 30 on anybody in the country any
night. But he's been willing to defer in order to keep Lod and Taj and Dwight
Lewis and Nick Young involved. And now he's become a defender at that spot.
And he's just getting better and better.  
  
Q. You talked about the Oregon game helping you there you this week, does
this game is that something you build on with North Carolina? Do you know,
have you taken a look at the next game and?  
TIM FLOYD: Yeah, we'll go back and just watch film on these guys. Give our
guys tomorrow off. We'll try to have a plan in place for Tuesday. Against one
of the best front lines in the country.  
They're outstanding. They got one of the better point guards in the country,
they got one of the better two guards in the country. They're outstanding.
They're young but they're very, very talented. And they're very deep. But
we'll try to get on the phone and talk to a few people, but I've seen them and
we know that they want to run it and they want to push it. But so did Arkansas
and so does Texas and we're just going to have great awareness like we did
getting back defensively like we did in this game.  
  
Q. One of the players mentioned that yesterday was Ryan Francis' birthday
did you do anything special to mark that and did you have his mom talk to the
team again today before the game?  
TIM FLOYD: Well, we wanted his mom here. Because of that. And all of our guys
were able to see Paulette, visit with Paulette, and just be around here her.
We just wanted to be around here. We didn't want her to have a lot of time on
her hands by herself. And she's been involved with the wives in the athletic
department, my secretary, Vanessa, has been unbelievable with her all week
long. The coach's wives, my wife included have been around her all week long.
They enjoy her. And this isn't something that's going to go an Iowa. She will
be around us as long as I'm here.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks coach, good luck.  
TIM FLOYD: All right. Thank you.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have an opening statement by Coach Kent and then go to
questions for the student-athletes. Coach?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: First of all I just want to make a couple comments. One
about Winthrop. Because they were a basketball team that we heard Cinderella,
we didn't feel that. We thought that they were a great team and they certainly
brought out our A game because it got our attention just how well they had
been playing coming into this tournament.  
Secondly, Spokane has done an outstanding job of hosting us. People have been
superior, it's been great being up here. The fans have been great and there
couldn't have been a better venue for college basketball in this great part of
the country.  
And the last thing is, you know, we heard quite a bit over the last couple
days about our defense and we feel like we're really a good defensive team.
Particularly in the last six or seven games we held people under 40 percent
shoot with the matchup and the man defense and this team did a great job of
rising to the challenge and really defending a very good basketball team at
the other end of the floor and that was the difference in the game today, it
was just our defense.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Oregon student-athletes.  
  
Q. For any of the guy, what did you guys say in the huddle out there at the
end when you celebrated after the game?  
AARON BROOKS: We get together and said The Lord's Prayer. We're thankful that
we are here and just to be able to play the game of basketball and we just got
to give thanks.  
TAJUAN PORTER: He pretty much said it all. We just thanked the Lord for giving
us the strength and ability to go out on the basketball court and play and
showcase our skills.  
  
Q. For Tajuan, you came out in the second half on a mission, can you just
comment on all those threes you nailed right off the bat?  
TAJUAN PORTER: Just confident. I tried to take good shots and give my team
energy from the start. I felt we started off a little flat. So I just brung a
different type of energy to the team in the second half.  
  
Q. Just to follow-up on that, what was different for you in that second
half? Were they defending you differently or did something change for you and
also how is your hand?  
TAJUAN PORTER: Well the defense opened up. In the first half they were keying
in on me a little bit, but the driving lanes opened and I was involved in more
ball screens, so I was able to get my shot off. And my thumb is okay.  
  
Q. Aaron, did you feel disrespected personally and did you guys feel
disrespected as a team in this matchup today?  
AARON BROOKS: I think we just took it as a challenge. Analysts are going to
pick who they think will win and we just got, we took it as a challenge and a
chip on our shoulder and we came out and played like that. So we can't let
that -- we got to be able to play like that every game without analysis
dissecting us and telling us what we can't do, we got to be able to come out
and play like that every game.  
  
Q. You were very quiet yesterday, you didn't come to be interviewed, what
was going through your mind?  
AARON BROOKS: I wasn't asked to be interviewed, so you know, I can't just come
down if they don't ask me. Some days I'm quiet, some days I'm not. I think
that, I don't know, I was a little outspoken, I think we -- I didn't like the
way we came out in the first game. We came out and played like we were tired
and quiet or whatever, so I didn't like that. So I knew that our team needed a
little boost and so I had to kind of switch modes and get guys going a little
bit and as a leader on the team I felt that's what was needed.  
  
Q. Do you think conditioning of the team showed in the last 10 minutes?  
ADAM ZAHN: Yeah, absolutely. I think it showed all year. We really made a
decision just to work hard this year and through the summer spring. We really
dedicated ourselves to being in good shape and I think it is showing to be
really helpful.  
  
Q. Yesterday I asked you Adam about having, you having five fouls to use up
today you were out there you didn't use any of your fouls up, but made a
presence and got a standing ovation.  
ADAM ZAHN: Right. Well, yeah, I guess I yesterday I had just some built up
energy, just came out a little too aggressive. Didn't work out like that
today. So, yeah.  
  
Q. Tajuan, back to the start of the second half, did you feel like you could
get a shot just about any time you wanted either off the dribble or from the
jumper?  
TAJUAN PORTER: Yeah, that's pretty much I feel that way all the time I'm out
there on the court. The most important thing is just take good shots and keep
my space.  
  
Q. From the first time you drove the lane, Aaron, they hit you with the
body, I know you can't comment on officiating, but did you have to adjust your
game the way they were calling it?  
AARON BROOKS: I think you always have to adjust your Guam the way they are
calling it. I think the good thing was I was able to get to the hole and that
was a good sign for me early in the game. So that you can get to the middle I
knew that would be open whenever I needed in the game and that kind of just
opened up my game a little bit and got me a couple of shots because they were
playing me soft a little bit. So I think you have to adjust your, adjust to
the officiating. We haven't met these officials before, we haven't seen them,
so that's a big key to the game is adjusting.  
  
Q. The help defense that they seemed to be pretty tenacious every time they
looked into the low post it seemed you had two or three bodies immediately
collapsing down. Did you feel like they were settling for jumpers as this game
progressed or do you think that maybe you just flustered them so much they
just stopped looking inside?  
AARON BROOKS: I think we really took it as an initiative to play defense and
play hard. We have a great rotating defense. We work on that all the time. I
think our help side was great and I think they wasn't settling, I think they
had to settle for 3-pointers because we were locking the stuff up in the
middle with our switching and our help. So we were playing great D and we was
ready for them today.  
  
Q. Adam, can you talk specifically about the approach defensively against
Bradshaw?  
ADAM ZAHN: Well, we talked a lot about the screens that they have and
switching. And I think that the communication was just incredible today. He's
a good player. We knew we had to stop him. Keep him from getting off on us.  
And, yeah, we just the switching and the communication really helped today.  
  
Q. For Aaron. Tajuan certainly has been hot before this, in this season, is
there a look you see in his eyes, is there something when you guys know that
he's hot we got to get the ball to him?  
AARON BROOKS: You can see when he's about to shoot the ball because he gets a
little step in him and he starts shaking it. When that ball go up you just
want to get back down the court and play defense, because sometimes you can
tell when he's feeling it and he, you just got to go ahead and play defense
and let him do his thing. But he's an outstanding freshman and he made big
shots for us and that's what we expect out of him. He's a great player.  
  
Q. Ernie, did you envision this team as a Sweet 16 team when the season
started.  
THE MODERATOR: Let's direct questions to student-athletes.  
  
Q. Aaron Brooks, Adam Zahn, did you envision this as a Sweet 16 team when
the season started?  
AARON BROOKS: We definitely envisioned we had a great basketball team. We knew
that the sky's the limit with this team. We knew we had to put the pieces
together and the seasons before this we didn't put the pieces together. We got
everybody, we got, that we need to make a 16, be a Sweet 16 team. We just
didn't put the pieces together, wasn't playing together, and I think in the
summer when we made the effort to bond together and condition and stuff like
that, that's when I felt like that we had a chance to be special.  
ADAM ZAHN: I felt that we could definitely play with any team in the nation.
We have had goals all year. One was to win the Pac-10 tournament. And now with
each game it's just when you see more and more how much talent we have on this
team, and how good we can be, if we just really play together and play
unselfish and make our shots.  
  
Q. Question for Tajuan. In the early part of the game there was a turnover
by Bradshaw at the baseline and you were covering him.  
TAJUAN PORTER: Yeah.  
  
Q. It looked it was kind of a Kodak moment where I couldn't quite tell what
happened, the details of the play, what happened and how did you feel
defending him?  
TAJUAN PORTER: It was just rotation help. They threw it over the top so I
wasn't going to be able to get the ball so I stood my ground and took the
charge. He didn't see me so he walked.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. For any of you guys, what do you know about UNLV?  
ADAM ZAHN: They look like a very athletic basketball team. We got, we're going
to have our work cut out for us definitely. Yeah.  
TAJUAN PORTER: I really don't know too much about them. But I know they are a
great basketball team. They beat a good team today. Every team in this
tournament can play, so we just got to be prepared to play.  
AARON BROOKS: I know that they're in the Sweet 16 and we got to be ready to
play because they deserve to be there. Just going to come out and I think
we'll go over film and get a better understanding for them. But we didn't
really know Winthrop until we started studying them. So I think we just got to
do that and then we'll be fine.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thanks, gentlemen. We'll take questions now for
Coach Kent.  
  
Q. You found Tajuan while you were recruiting Malik, is that right?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: We found Tajuan and we went back and we were after Malik and
I'll never forget the day that Coach Duncan said, you need to come in and take
a look at Malik and when you do there's another guy I want you to look at and
sure enough we watch him and there was this little guy that was just automatic
from every where on the floor.  
And we said then that we're going to many could back and recruit him and his
coach talked about a lot of people have been in it gym looking at Malik and
everybody saw the same thing you saw and everybody thought he was too small to
play at this level and my theory is it has nothing to do with size it's how
big your heart is. Because he's a guy that's five six, but he plays six feet
tall. Aaron Brooks is six feet and plays six-five when you talk how hard they
play. So size was not an issue. Here was a kid that as a unique special player
because of his size he has developed himself into just a sharp shooter, knows
how to get his shot off over bigger people, he goes inside and he has not hurt
us at all defensively this year. He rotated on the weak side and guarded
Bradshaw and forced him to travel just because he did a good job of getting
position and everything.  
  
Q. Aaron Brooks this season obviously has had something of a turn around.
What do you attribute that to and what have you seen in him that's different
this season?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: His story has been told often enough and he's just someone
who has grown up and matured this year. He's always had tremendous amount of
energy, he's always been a gay that had a great passion for the game and
worked every day in practice. And he's just grown.  
Tajuan Porter has allowed him to grow even more because it really has taken
the pressure off of him to have another point guard on the floor where he can
just kind of do things over the two guard spot and then when we need to take
over the game and we put him over at the point guard spot and let him control
the game for us.  
  
Q. A lot of turning points but any one specific one that really stands out
for you?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: The first game against Miami. I just felt like they needed
to get a game underneath their belt and they did a great job on that game
playing a different style of play and basically he beating a team at their own
style of play. The grind through the game play. I knew we were going to play
better this game because you had an up tempo game, a little bit more relaxed
and calm, they had a feel for what center stage was like and I just thought
they did an outstanding job defensively. We switched at the three, four, five,
sometimes we switched two, three, four and five and then this team did a good
job of communicating and taking over the low post game.  
  
Q. Can you talk a bit more about the switching on defense and you know
Maarty said that he thought you guys did more than you had all season and
against especially on the big guys?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: Well, it was just the game plan. This is not a team at this
time point in time you need to look at a lot of film on an opponent. We just
get together the game plan. We met three times and went through walk through.
We watched probably 10 minutes of film and they were ready to go. Because it's
really about what they do because at this stage there's no new found offense
out there. Everything everybody runs the same stuff across the country it's
just a matter of getting your team ready. We switched more in this game, we
matched up zone more in the Washington win, we trapped more in the Oregon
State win, this was an adjustment in this game, let's switch and take away all
their screens because they do a great job of bringing the big fellow to the
ball down low and I think the switching defense really took them out what have
they wanted to do.  
  
Q. What did you say at half time they got a shot right at the buzzer,
momentum for them definitely going in but you guys came out on fire, what did
you talk about at half time?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: We talked about a couple of things. Number one, they had six
offensive rebounds I believe at half time, that probably gave them six to
eight second chance points. We needed to take care of the glass and keep that
away.  
Number two, we felt like we had a couple turnovers that should not have been
there and just understanding good shot/bad shot.  
And number three, they stand between us and St. Louis. I left that team alone
and said when you're ready to come out of this locker room you come out of
this locker room and let's go get it done.  
  
Q. Maarty it looked like started a little slow today. But he really made an
impact. You look at the final numbers, 12 points I believe. And he seemed to
make an impact on the defensive end also, particularly against Bradshaw. Can
you talk about him?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: I don't think he started slow. I thought defensively he was
great right from the beginning of the game. Maarty had Bradshaw at times,
Malik had him at times, Aaron Brooks had him three possessions. I thought
Maarty was great at the end of the floor. Offensively he started a little
slow, but that's because the ball just didn't come to him initially
offensively. When we got out -- the difference in the game, is we started to
get our stops and we were about an eight to nine minute stretch where we had
gotten into transition a felt like we fatigued them a little bit and ran them
pretty good and that was the difference in the game.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit more about what you emphasized to make sure
that your team knew that Winthrop wasn't a Cinderella-type team?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: Well, a couple things happened along the way. They do watch
TV and they heard all the stuff on TV about everybody pulling for them to go
forward. The thing I said is they won 19 straight games in a row. They took
North Carolina down to the wire, Maryland they played a good game, they took
Wisconsin down to the wire. That's not Cinderella, that is a very good
basketball team that's well coached. So it wasn't even a matter of Winthrop,
it was about the performance we needed to give. It was the fact that Winthrop
played so well so much is said on TV it just raised us to make sure we gave
our A game and gave our best performance. So it worked out well for us that
this was the game that we needed to step up and we did a good job of it.  
  
Q. You talk a lot about adversity and just everything that your team has
been through the last couple years can you kind of tell us what emotionally
you've been feeling just since the game ended and what's going through your
mind from an emotional standpoint right now?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: UNLV is the only thing that's going through my mind. I've
seen them, I need to see a lot more of them. I'm thinking about giving these
guys a couple days off. How much fun we're going to have on that plane flying
back to Eugene. How much fun we're going to have over the course of the next
couple of days resting and getting ready. How much fun we're going to have
going to St. Louis on that plane and then it will be time to go to work.  
  
Q. Coach, your next will be 29 which is what the national championship team
won. Is there any significance in that number to you?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: The significance is that Admiral John Dick is still alive,
that played on that team, and traveled with us today. And every time I look at
him I realize what a special place this is, the University of Oregon. To see
this man still supporting his Ducks. Because people don't understand, once you
go through that program and I mean even as a coach, in the long run, I went to
school at Oregon. And every time I look back on this I'm a Duck. I'm a Duck at
heart. I grew up a Duck going to school here and I'll always be a Duck and
Admiral is the same way.  
  
Q. Porter started at the beginning of the second half, what do you tell a
kid in that situation? Do you say, go out and look for your shot there or is
it just a matter of him playing within with the flow and doing what he's what
he normally does?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: I told him before the game to light them up. Because he's a
great shooter. I said nothing to him after that. When he gets into that
groove, you just let him go. And there's no such thing as a bad shot for him.
There might be a coaching moment at some point in time to help him through
being a freshman in that but you really just let him go, let him get in that
rhythm and everything and these guys have done a good job of allowing that
freshman to come in. Sometimes he might take a bad one. He complained about
his thumb and dribbled back out and shot a 40 footer, so I thought he was okay
after that. But he gets into that rhythm sometimes and he just can't be
stopped he's a great shooter you think he's been in double figures something
like 17 games here and he's great on the road as a shooter.  
  
Q. This will be the first time since '95 that no double digit seed has made
it to the Sweet 16. Do you think that speaks to how well the how good the
higher seeded teams this year are or how well the tournament was seeded, do
you have any explanation for it?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: No. I think that the committee did a good job and there's is
a very, very, very, very tough job. And as I looked at all the games and one
of the things I talked to my staff about, do you notice in this round all the
games are close. All of them. They were coming down to the wire and teams were
closing the gap and you would have to really coach the game up in the last two
minutes and here we are in a game where you get a 18 point lead and basically
us just manage to get out the game the last sick minutes or so. But I don't
know what the explanation is that no one is advancing all I no he is that
everybody at this level, once you get chosen in that field of 64 or 65,
everybody's good and everybody can beat anybody. You got to show up ready to
play because all it takes is for one off night by two or three guys and you
don't defend well or whatever and you can get beat and you go home. We're one
of these teams that we have been fortunate, this is new stage for these guys,
but they're starting to get a feel for it and a that taste for it and I kind
of think they like it. So I hope we go back and regroup and get ready to go
forward again.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH ERNIE KENT: Thank you.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement by coach and then go to
questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: It's, when this magic carpet ride comes to an end it
ends rather abruptly and it's not an easy thing to accept. Certainly don't
have to like it.  
We ran into a very hot team today. Especially two hot guards that played very,
very well and shot it in from very deep. They played better than us. We did
not execute offensively and they had a hand in that as well with their
defensive switching and intensity.  
That doesn't take away from the year that we have had and what these guys to
my right and every one in that locker room has accomplished.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Craig, you just talk about they were putting a lot of a few different
guys in there on you and only able to get up about six shots or so. Talk about
their defense and what they were doing to try to slow you down.  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: I guess they were switching a lot. On top of that though
fronting. It was kind of difficult to get the ball inside. And if they did
throw it in, there was help there to steal the ball. So it was just
frustrating for me. Like you said, six shots. But I'm proud of my team and we
have had a great ride.  
  
Q. Torrell, when Craig only gets six shots did you feel like you needed to
take a little bit more on yourself and felt like maybe you forced a few
things?  
TORRELL MARTIN: I felt that we should have got the ball inside more tonight. I
don't normally take forced shots. A lot of my shots are in rhythm and with set
place so if they didn't fall, that was it. But ultimately tonight a lot of the
switching that they did caused a lot of different angles and it kept us from
getting the ball inside. But we definitely should have went inside more and
got Craig some more looks.  
  
Q. Chris, Tajuan Porter started at the second half. Did he extend you, it
seemed -- I was sitting at the far end and couldn't tell, but it looked like
some of those jumpers were pretty deep.  
CHRIS GAYNOR: Yeah, he's a great player. He really had his stroke going
tonight. Just got to give him all the credit. His shots went in and ours
didn't.  
  
Q. For any of you guys when Oregon got to the point where they were throwing
it and running it up and trying to push the pace a little bit, did it wear you
guys or fatigue you guys at all?  
TORRELL MARTIN: I personally wasn't fatigued and I don't believe my teammates
were fatigued. We really crashed the boards with three offensive guards, I
mean one guard and two big men, so a lot of times we would be in there
crashing and they would have a two on three break or something like that but
as far as fatigue I don't believe that played a factor in us getting back on
defense.  
PHILLIP WILLIAMS: Same thing. They, I remember one time one of their big guy
had a run out because we're in their rebounding trying our hardest to get
another shot for our team and there's really nothing you can do about that. We
have seen -- we have to go as hard as we can go. When their number one guy
breaks, it really he just breaks down our defense.  
  
Q. 8-31 from the 3-point line tonight, was it a matter of defense or just
shots simply not falling or just kind of break it down for me.  
TORRELL MARTIN: It was one of those games where like Chris said they made
their shots, we didn't make our shots. A lot of my shots were open and a lot
of them were mismatches and shots I normally knock down and same as Michael
Jenkins and Chris Gaynor. But I mean you can't control how many shots you
make, all you can do is play hard and try to get to the next play. I believe
that's what we did tonight. But ultimately their shots went in and ours didn't
and that was the difference in the ball game.  
  
Q. Torrell, right at the end of the first half you were up 27-23. I think
you had, and by my count you had 10 possessions six turnovers, it seemed like
everything sort of fell apart at that point. Was that the turning point for
you in the game do you think maybe?  
TORRELL MARTIN: In the first half that definitely gave them momentum swing
going into the half time. That's uncharacteristic of our program of the
turning the ball over so many times like that in a row. And we just looked a
little rattled and we just needed to calm down. Drey making the shot before
the half gave us a little boost going into it only putting us down four and we
came out the second half and tonight we just didn't execute. That was just a
key factor. We didn't play like a veteran program.  
  
Q. Craig, can you remember a team switching so much down low on you and
what, why does that switching make it so difficult to get it inside?  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: We played a lot of teams that switch. But I guess with them
that they always had weak side help. And like I said on top of that they were
fronting. I guess we just shot the ball too much played their style and tried
to be up and down with them.  
Yeah, it's just frustrating. But I'm not saying it is my teammates fault. I
give all the praise to them, they helped me out for my season, they brought me
up, and they keep on passing me the ball, so I can't complain.  
  
Q. In retrospect over the your whole season, you guys have achieved a lot.
And a lot of accomplishments. You put Winthrop on the map. You got that first
victory. You beat a rated team. You were ranked in the Top-25. Can you talk a
little bit about that?  
CHRIS GAYNOR: Like Craig said, I'm proud of our whole team. These three guys
here and their great, they have been like brothers to me since I stepped on
the court. Losing them is going to be real tough. This season was just, it was
great. You can't complain. We had a chance to advance and into the Sweet 16.
Who would have thought Winthrop could do that beside the people from Rock
Hill? You know, and I think that everybody knows who Winthrop is now. Like you
said, we're in the Top-25, never been done, this whole season was just making
history time and time again and tonight we just ran into a great team.  
PHILLIP WILLIAMS: Looking back it really was a great year. Getting to the
Top-25 was definitely one of my personal goals that I had for this team. I
felt we were capable of doing it. But it was just a fun year too. I remember
going into places like Missouri State and Mississippi State and sticking
together as a unit and in a hostile environment. Just pulling out a gritty win
there. So my teammates this year were a special and unique group that I'll
definitely miss.  
  
Q. Torrell and Craig obviously you guys have something to look forward to
with Portsmouth coming up, can you guys talk about that a little bit, what you
guys have to look forward to with your NBA futures.  
TORRELL MARTIN: I probably haven't even had a chance to think about
Portsmouth, because I've been so focused on trying to win, but I'll sit down
and look at it. I guess it's time for me and Craig and Phil to think about
what we got to do for ourselves. Winthrop university has gave us so many
opportunities and now we have the opportunity to play professional basketball,
so I plan on working on my game, working harder, working on my weak points and
my strong points and going into the PIT, you know, and displaying some talent
for these scouts and seeing where that take me.  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: I'm just really excited to go. Of course I'm going to train.
It's pretty soon. So I'll be in the gym probably this week. It's ongoing for
me, it always has been. And I'm just going to keep on trying to get better.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, guys. We'll take questions for coach now.  
  
Q. How much of a factor was the defense that Oregon played and were you
expecting them to be quite that tenacious and switching quite that much?  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: To be honest, no. Yesterday in the one day that we had
to prepare we prepared more for the matchup zone that they employed quite a
bit against Miami. And in a short turn around that's the case. If we had two
or three days to prepare and maybe had we had that, maybe we would have been
able to work on it more and better. But you got to give them credit. They did
a great job with their man-to-man. And they only went zone, to my knowledge,
one or two times in the whole game.  
I think that they got out of the zone when Torrell hit a jumper in the left
corner and I guess they blew an assignment or whatever, but they didn't need
to, their man was that good. And we talked about and we have gone against
teams that have switched and denied and whatnot that way, but not -- we have
generally executed a little better. Our shooting percentages were down our
turnovers were up, especially in the first half. And the game was at a pace
for us in the first half but they did start playing a little quicker in the
second half. And they made some shots and Porter got really hot to start the
second after half and they pushed it to 10 and basically that was the game.  
  
Q. You said you turned over the ball seven times in the first half. Michael
Jenkins was having a bit of a rough game. And he's one of your big guys and
you took him out and you took him out of the game and how do you feel about
that situation therewith his play?  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: He's a great player. He's had a wonderful year. I didn't
take him out because he missed shots, I took him out because he had two fouls.
He got a second foul fairly quickly in the first half. And that may have
played a factor. But he had some pretty good looks that he normally knocks
down and he's had a great, great year and tonight wasn't his night. But they
have all had great years. This is a team that has done things that can never
be duplicated. Because they have been the first to do this, the first to have
go you know defeated in our league, the first to be ranked in the Top-25, the
first to win a game in the NCAA tournament. The first to sell out our
coliseum. Which they did three times. So they as a team and our program and
for that matter the university that we represent, Winthrop, our community,
Rock Hill, the league that we represent, the Big South, none of, all those
things are on very solid ground and maybe at their high water mark, their
peak, if you will, in terms of what, how they have come together and achieved
and been able to attain special things this season.  
  
Q. You mentioned it before the game that you wanted to take Brooks out of
the game as much as possible. But what about Porter? Did he surprise you with
what he did?  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: No, he didn't surprise us. If you watched videotape like
we have watched in the last 48 hours, I mean he's a great player. How he got
out of Michigan, I don't know. The guy can really shoot it. He can handle it.
He's not as fast I don't think as Brooks, because I coached against Brooks as
a freshman and I remember if you go back, if you check the archives, I was
very, very complimentary of Brooks as a freshman. And I just said, man, that
guy is really good. So he's gotten me twice now. He's got me as a freshman and
I praised him and now I'm praising him as a senior and who knows how far he
can go. But Porter is somewhat like him. Not diminutive little guy, but just a
big heart and he hits big shots.  
  
Q. Any theories as to why we're seeing all the top seeds advance this year
when there are usually some lower seeds advancing as well?  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: Not really. I think George Mason last year making the
run that they did woke up some of these giants and said, hey, you know, the
Winthrops and the VCU's and the George Masons and the Gonzagas look like
they're here to stay. And the hype that our program generated this year
starting in mid February was unbelievable. And it's a great, we're
appreciative and we're honored for people to talk about us being the next
George Mason, but then the flip side of that is to have to wear that into
battle. You're not going to sneak up on Notre Dame, you're not going to sneak
up on Oregon.  
But to be honest with you, there's a lot of good players and a lot of good
teams in every league in the country. And that's what makes the year that we
had so special. My assistant, my graduate assistant, he's a GA, he's a first
year coach, his name is Dana Ford, he played at Illinois State for four years,
and last night he put his arm around me and he goes, are all years in coaching
like this? And I almost laughed. I said, no. And I just wrote down 29-4 and I
said, do you know what that means? He goes, we have had great year. We have
won a lot of games. I said, yeah, and I wrote an arrow and I said 4-29. That's
what the people that have competed against us are as a collective unit this,
to this point in the season. So it's a great, it's been a great run. And I
guess Butler now will have to carry the flag as a mid major into the rest of
the tournament, but next year's another year.  
  
Q. Is this a little bit of a kind of a pick your poison type of thing in
terms of defending the ball screens with Tajuan and Brooks able to just pull
up and shoot long threes, if you step out they're going to blow by you and go
for layups can you speak to that the challenges that you face in that
regard?  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: Well there's a handful of ways to defend ball screens.
We choose to hedge most ball screens, which is the guy defending the screener
he shows his full body and tries to alter the penetrating path of the
dribbler, if you will. You can trap it, you can press up, which is put your
chest perpendicular to the screener's shoulders and try to push him out as
much as you can with your body and not your hands. But we try to do that with
Leunen early, we wanted to hedge on everyone else, press up on Leunen and all
of a sudden Brooks is hitting 25 footers behind the screen. So you're right,
you have to pick your poison a little bit, because he is so quick and he can
finish with his right, his left hand, he's just a very, very good player.  
  
Q. What about that run I mentioned earlier at the end of the first half
where you had the ten possessions, six turnovers, seemed like that kind of
took, messed up every, all the rhythm that you had?  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: Yeah, we had a lead and I don't know what our lead was,
but we ended up going in the half down four. So it wasn't the end of the
world. But you know how turnovers affect me as a coach. So thank goodness I
didn't have a whistle around my neck because we would have been on the line
doing some sprinting, I would have a couple technicals and probably been
kicked out of the game. So yeah it's just not very characteristic of our team.
We came out better in the second half and only turned it over four times. But
still didn't make any shots. But we got to get quality looks when you play the
tempo and the way we play.  
  
Q. Do you think the predominant question is not going to be where is
Winthrop, but what's next for Winthrop?  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: That may be. I know that some fans from out here as we
walked in were chanting where is Winthrop? What state are you in? So and there
may be some more people out there like that. Either they don't get a newspaper
or they don't have electricity and don't have a television, so that's, we'll
win them over one at a time, but the bottom line is what's next for Winthrop?
That's yet to be seen. I no he that like I said, the program's on very solid
ground. We red shirted all of our freshmen. Didn't burn any of their
eligibility. They had a year in the program. Kids are getting stronger, bigger
and more skilled. And we got three new guys coming in. And we're very excited
about them. Who knows. I think we can surprise some people next year and have
another great year.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:
SPOKANE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+SPOKANE)

### [A.J. Abrams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15572)

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

### [Kevin Durant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17055)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Texas players and coaches. First of all a few opening
comments from Rick Barnes.  
COACH RICK BARNES: Our basketball team did a lot of good things this year, but
it's always disappointing when you end the season on the note that we ended it
today.  
But again, I'm not sure if you lose the first game, the second game, the third
or fourth whatever it may be, it's always disappointing to end the season this
way. But I think that Southern California played a great game. For whatever
reason, you look at the stat sheets they got great balance, we have 50 points
of 68 between two guys and you're not going to get it done this time of year
with just two guys doing it. And I'm disappointed in that, that we had been a
team this year that found away to work through some tough situations and today
we weren't able to do it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kevin, could you give us some insight into your emotions knowing that the
season is over now.  
KEVIN DURANT: Like coach said, I have a sour taste in my mouth from ending the
season like this. I kind of regret not playing as hard as I could today and
throughout the whole see some. Like he said we did some great things
throughout the season this year but as always tough to lose like this.  
  
Q. A.J., could you talk about USC's defense, both the way they sent some
smaller guys at Kevin and the way they tried to choke off D.J.'s penetration,
how it affected your game.  
A.J. ABRAMS: Like coach said, they're a pretty good team. And they had a good
game plan. Coming in the game. And them taking away D.J.'s penetration, it
kind of hurts a little bit because when D.J. penetrates he gets our offense
going and we all move for him. And just like he said they played a great game
and for whatever reason we didn't give our best effort today.  
  
Q. You guys have been so loose all season long, did you feel loose today or
did you feel kind of like you did going into the New Mexico could state
game?  
A.J. ABRAMS: Me personally I felt like I was loose. I came out, with the
mindset that I wanted to be aggressive player. But any game you're going to
have pressure on you because in the NCAA tournament you know if you lose you
go home. So that's always kind of on your mind. But when you're playing you
can't really think about it.  
KEVIN DURANT: I felt like I just had, we had to come out be aggressive as a
team and for myself I had to be aggressive as well. But USC was better than us
today. I give all the credit to them.  
  
Q. A.J., what were you guys supposed to do to counter their defensive game
plan and what went wrong there?  
A.J. ABRAMS: We didn't have anything to counter for it. We always have the
same game plan going into our game. We're going to push the ball and play
tough defense. And know our matchups, but for whatever reason we didn't
execute like we usually do, like we did in the Big-12 tournament or in
previous games.  
  
Q. Kevin, can you talk about your thought process and when, how you'll go
about making the decision about whether to come back or not?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I don't think that's an appropriate question right now. I'm
just worried about this team and where we could be next year as a team. But I
don't really think that's an appropriate question.  
  
Q. Kevin, you came out in the second half and were very aggressive and were
taking it to the hole and the whole idea of them putting a smaller player on
you with help behind him, can you talk about counting that?  
KEVIN DURANT: Like I said I just wanted to be aggressive going to the basket.
I think we got some open looks going to the basket. But they did a great job
of fronting me while I'm in the post and hoping on the back side. So I had to
do something else. So I got the ball on the wing, tried to get to the basket,
pulled up some shots in my mid range game and tried to get fouled.  
  
Q. A.J., can you talk about you guys cut it to four right after half time,
what was the mood coming out of half time and then what are you guys thinking
at that point?  
A.J. ABRAMS: We all came out of half time with the mindset that we had
everybody had to pick it up. Pick up the intensity and we just had to be more
aggressive. In the first couple minutes we came out with more aggression and
for whatever reason it just faded away.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you Kevin, thank you A.J.. questions for coach.  
  
Q. How difficult is it, generally you have a three scorers, you were looking
for a fourth today, you only had two. How much tougher does that make it?  
COACH RICK BARNES: You're not going to win this time of year. You can't have
-- you look at the, their balance, you lack at ours, and we get 50 points
between of the 68 between two guys and we knew coming in and we had told D.J.
that he was going to have to shoot the ball. I said there's no doubt they, we
thought they would switch ball screens when they went with this are they are
small lineup we knew that was going to happen. We knew they would take away
his penetration and we said to him he was going to have to shoot the ball, and
he was reluctant to do that early. And when that started happening he over
penetrated, turned the ball over some.  
And we just, you are not going to get it done right now this time of year
without, with just two guys that are being aggressive for you. It's going to
be all not only the five you start but guys that come off the bench. But even
when we got back into the game and started the second half it was changed on
the offensive boards. Through that time right there, Taj Gibson had his way
inside. We got some stops, but they were able to convert those stick backs and
even in the first half we gave them three run outs where we again told our
team that we didn't think they would guard Damion and Connor and they would be
looking to run through passing lanes. They did that and they were able to get
six points off that in the first half. And you take that away and the
offensive rebounds, it could have even with as poorly as we played on offense,
it could have been a different game.  
  
Q. You only got to the line 16 times tonight and they went there 38 times,
can you talk about the difference that made?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, them getting there that much was obviously because we
were behind and we had to start fouling. It has a lot to do with that. But
again, we got tentative. Where they were backing over they were forcing guys
to shoot jumpers. It's easy to play sometimes when you only guard a couple
guys. And they were going to let D.J. Augustin and Kevin, and, I mean D.J.
Augustin and Justin Mason and Damion James have all they wanted. They were
going to let them shoot it all they wanted. So they were backing in there on
those guys and any ball screen action they switched it. But you got to loosen
that up by taking some shots.  
And you look at it, we didn't do that early. About you still work it, but we
just have to shoot the ball and those guys have proven this year that they can
shoot it but for whatever reason today they were reluctant to do it and they
were hesitant to do it.  
  
Q. Right after you closed it four points it seemed like their transition
game they went on a 19-3 run. They beat you back pretty easy several times on
those, can you answer?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Poor offense. Poor offense. For that reason we didn't have
good, we were again we wanted to get the ball going from side to side to try
to move their defense a little bit as I mentioned they were being pretty much
contained oriented to where they were going to let us shoot the quick shot and
we settled for that. And a couple long rebounds and they ran out on us. Out of
bounds play again we shot it quick coming off, which is a shot, but we didn't
get back to get the court balanced and those plays were huge plays. And again,
when we were able to make a little move there, we made it too easy for them by
giving them those run outs and offensive rebounds.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the process that you and Kevin and his family will
make about whether he's going to come back or not?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well I think what will happen again I think right now
everybody will just step back and there's plenty of time. There's plenty of
time to make that decision. I think you step back and let the emotional season
and what he's gone through settle in. Obviously he's had a great year and but
he's disappointed. If you know him, I mean, he's all about wanting to win. And
to lose again like I said, this time of year, you lose, it's it leaves a tough
taste in your mouth. But we'll step away from it for a little bit and then in
a couple weeks we'll all get together or and again it won't be any time soon,
again he's got plenty of time to weigh all of his options and that's what
we'll do. And he said right now it's not important right now. He's got plenty
of time to do that. I said all along that he and his family will we'll gather
the information that they need and when it comes time to make a decision they
will make the right decision.  
THE MODERATOR: No further questions? One here.  
  
Q. We talked a lot about their defense, but what about their offense? They
had all five of their starters in double figures.  
COACH RICK BARNES: They do a great job of getting isolation. Our concern
coming in it is that they were bigger, a taller team and probably more
athletic than people think. But they do a nice job of getting isolations and
the fact they can shoot the ball, they can spread you out that way, and then
they have got a guy in Taj Gibson that can really cause problems inside. But
their approach is pretty simple in terms of theirs isolations, they will take
turns on who it is they want to go after and they do a good job with it. But
again, they're playing good basketball. They have played good basketball over
the last couple weeks and they have got as good a chance as anybody right now.  
  
Q. I apologize if you've been asked this already, having USC and Oregon come
out of this, what does that say about the Pac-10 and the strength of that
conference?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I think early in the year everybody realized the Pac-10 was
probably a little bit underrated and again, what I like about the Southern
California team is they have gotten better, they have continued to improve.
Certainly Oregon has had a great year coming through winning that league.
There's so many teams now that can play and this tournament is so much about
matchup, who do you get matched up with and both teams play good basketball.
Obviously Oregon had a tough one the other day, but came back today against a
good team and got it done. And again southern California's playing good
basketball right now. They're playing really good basketball. So but I would
say that the Pac-10 should feel pretty good about the year they have had.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thanks Coach Barnes.  
COACH RICK BARNES: Thank you.

SPOKANE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+SPOKANE)

  

## March 17, 2007

  

### [Malik Hairston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17125)

### [Ernie Kent](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17095)

### [Bryce Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17097)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and take questions for the student-athletes from
Oregon.  
  
Q. Dribble penetration, big weapon for you guys, can you kind of put it into
your own words for me just exactly how you guys use that as a weapon and also
when you do penetrate, are you guys looking to finish with the ball or are you
guys looking to kick and find open teammates?  
BRYCE TAYLOR: We just try to spread the floor out and allow our guards to use
their quickness to get by their defender and if help side comes up, try to
kick it to the open man. But like you said, that's a big part of our offense.
We try to share the ball and that's one of the ways we do it, just using our
quickness to get by our defender and then when we drive help, we try to kick
it to whoever is open and keep the ball moving until somebody gets a good
shot.  
MALIK HAIRSTON: Bryce pretty much said it. We have a lot of offensive weapons.
We try to get the ball moving and basically he just get the ball to whoever is
open. We use the pump fake to get in the lane and draw the defense, kick it to
the open guy and just continue to do so until we get a good shot.  
  
Q. You and Winthrop kind of have a similar style of play. Quick teams, get
up and down the floor. Do you think that will work four advantage, Miami
slowed that game down for you and it gave you some trouble.  
MALIK HAIRSTON: I think it will definitely be a more fun game. It will be more
up tempo.  
But I still think the focus or our focus will be defense. Being able to shut
somebody down that's definitely been the key to our success. And I still think
that will be our focus.  
BRYCE TAYLOR: I would agree with everything Malik said. It does play to our
favor, just because like you said Miami tried to slow it down and limit the
possessions in the game. We prefer to get up and down and get more shots up.
But the key is going to be able to guard somebody and that's what the game is
going to come down to.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about Coach Kent and his style of directing you guys?
Is he very vocal? Is he very demonstrative. Can you just kind of break him
down for us, please.  
BRYCE TAYLOR: Coach is very vocal and he's a demanding coach to play for. But
he gives us a framework in which he likes us to play within. And then he gives
us the freedom to just to make plays and just to play our styles.  
So he puts us in a good position to be able to show what we can do and at the
same time everybody can play to their strengths within that. So it's
important.  
MALIK HAIRSTON: It's definitely been tough getting to this point, but I think
he's done an exceptional job of leading us. And getting us to this point. And
kind of giving us a blueprint of what winning is. And I think we have done a
good job of picking it up. But ones again I think he did a great job of
showing us.  
  
Q. Chamberlain Oguchi has basically been playing off the bench this year and
last year at this point well in the Pac-10 tournament and second half of the
year he's just lighting it up. What's been the biggest reasons for him --
what, why he has he not been as productive this year?  
MALIK HAIRSTON: I think he can shoot it like that every game every year. He
did a great job last year and he's still a big piece of this basketball team
and he'll definitely have more opportunities coming up to showcase his
abilities. He's a very good basketball player. A very good shooter. And we're
just a very balanced basketball team. We have a lot of players that can score
a lot of guys coming off the bench and the starters, so I'm sure he'll get
another opportunity to showcase what he can do.  
  
Q. Is it confidence with him? Is it a confidence question?  
MALIK HAIRSTON: Champ has confidence and he should. He works on his game, he
gets in, shoots the ball, it's just a matter of the right situation.  
  
Q. One of the Winthrop players they referred to he referred to his team as
little old Winthrop and that people don't really know about them. Do you look
at them any differently than you would like an UCLA or some of the Pac-10
powers that you play. Are they just as good as these other teams. Is that how
you view them coming in?  
MALIK HAIRSTON: Definitely. They're here where we are. Where a lot of teams
have been left out and where we have been left out the last couple years,
they're in the tournament. They're definitely a very good basketball team. We
don't necessarily buy that little old Winthrop. They have had a lot of success
and they play well together. They played a great game yesterday. I think it
will be a great game, a great college basketball game.  
BRYCE TAYLOR: They're 29-4. And they went 14-0 in their conference, so there's
not a lot of teams who can say they have done that. The teams that they have
lost to Wisconsin, A and M, North Carolina and one other major schools, I
can't remember who the fourth one was. So that tells you a lot with about the
type of team they are.  
So they don't come from a big conference, they don't have that name, but just
the fact that they're a 11 seed is probably something that surprises me just
because of 29 wins is a big deal. It's going to be a big game. We're going to
have to take that approach like we're playing any other big name school
because they're going to be ready for the challenge.  
  
Q. To kind of piggyback on that last question, Winthrop comes from a
conference whose RPI is 29 and you guys beat them by 15 points two years ago
with the same roster intact, and you guys won the Pac-10 tournament, one of
the best conferences in the country, do you think you have better players?  
BRYCE TAYLOR: I'll just say we both have great players. Their coach would
probably want to ride with their players and the same thing for our coach. So
they have Bradshaw and Martin. Who are seniors. And their lead guard leads
them in scoring. So they have great players and it's not really going to come
down to that. I feel like it's going to come down to who plays best as a team
and who is going to play with that discipline that it takes to make it to this
Sweet 16.  
MALIK HAIRSTON: Bryce said it perfectly. Two very talented basketball teams.
Playing up tempo style of basketball. I just think that we realize the
importance of defense as we continue to stay, just stay with whatever gets it
done for us. That's the key to our success thus far and so we got to hold on
to it.  
  
Q. Winthrop, they obviously possess some matchup problems with Craig
Bradshaw in the middle and how big and athletic he is. Is this going to be a
defensively for you guys just a kind of contain him by a committee or is this
going to be really resting on the shoulders of Maarty down low?  
MALIK HAIRSTON: If you watched us for the earlier this year, it's definitely
going to be a team effort. Definitely playing against Georgetown with their
guy it was a team effort. Maarty Leunen does an excellent job of fronting and
fighting down low in the post and playing a very solid defense. But it's
definitely going to have to be up to the rotations, our communication, just
our determination kind of containing him in the middle.  
BRYCE TAYLOR: It's always a team effort. That's what our team defense is. We
like to help each other. And especially with the strong post players we
usually front and then give good weak side help so that's going to be the main
focus.  
  
Q. Maarty is basically a four, three, four type player playing in a five
position. I know you're playing down low a little bit, obviously, to help this
team out, is that, has that taken an adjustment for you? Has that taken you
out of are game a little bit?  
MALIK HAIRSTON: I definitely wouldn't make an excuse and say it's taken me out
of my game, but that definitely has taken an adjustment. Not necessarily being
used to it. But I have a team that's fighting down there with me. And this is
all about sacrifices. And if we didn't make certain sacrifices, we wouldn't be
at this point and my whole thing is I want to be able to do whatever I can do
for my team to succeed. And I'm sure that's the same for Bryce, the same for
Maarty and the rest of the 11 guys.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk a little bit about the Pac-10 tournament, Bryce
obviously in the championship game you had I would think one of the greatest
games you have ever played. You take your regular season finish in the Pac-10
and then throw in what you guys were able to accomplish in the tournament, can
you just talk about maybe the level of expectations for you guys based on well
just the fact that you guys showed such a great performance in the Pac-10
tournament and how that translate into the NCAA tournament?  
BRYCE TAYLOR: One of the things I read was people were questioning whether we
peaked too early coming into the tournament and could we continue to shoot the
ball as well as we did in the tournament. And there's always high
expectations, we got a three seed, so that's important for us to just try to
live up to our part, which is just come out and give our best effort. You
can't always control how well you shoot the ball but there's other things,
other things on the floor that you can control which is your effort and your
defensive effort and making plays to get loose balls and things like that. So
for us it's just important for us to do what we can control and try to handle
that as much as we can.  
  
Q. Is it safe to say right now you guys in the next 20, 25 minutes when you
guys go out and take the floor that this is the most important practice of the
season for you guys and if so, tell me why.  
BRYCE TAYLOR: I wouldn't say it was the most important practice because it's
not like we're going to go and coach is going to kill us. But it's important
for us just to realize what it's going to take to get this done because just
from what I noticed watching the game yesterday Winthrop is extremely
confident right now. It's not going to be an easy game at all. People look at
the name Winthrop and they don't realize what a great team they are and the
record that they have. So for us it's going to be about just getting as sharp
as we can and making sure we don't come out flat like we did yesterday,
because they will take advantage of that. And it's going to be tough if we
come out and play like that.  
  
Q. Could you guys talk about Aaron Brooks' season and what you see in him
different this year than last season.  
MALIK HAIRSTON: Aaron Brooks, I think he's done an exceptional job of leading
this basketball team and just kind of making the turn around from last year.
He kind of was scrutinized a lot last year but he's a very good player. He's a
very athletic, he has a great feel for the game. And he's clutch. He's made a
lot of big shots for us. And he's a big reason why we are here today.  
BRYCE TAYLOR: For Aaron, I think the most important thing is just this year
he's just playing his game. And he keeps everything loose for him. That's
important. Just him being able to play freely and just show he can do all
around the floor. So he's just played a huge role for us this year and he's
stepped up his leadership and been more vocal in that way too and I feel like
in some ways that's even more important than what he's been doing, numbers
wise on the floor, because we always know we can look to him and in late game
situations and we have that belief in him that he's going to come up big in
late game situations and just lead us. So that's been extremely important for
us thus far.  
  
Q. You guys always have a good fan following wherever you go. You got
Winthrop who seemed to take-over the crowd in their game, you got a Spokane
crowd that's probably going to root against you because you haven't lost to
the Cougars in a hundred years in a row or something like that, you got two
teams running and gunning fighting for the Sweet 16, how much fun is it going
to be out there tomorrow?  
BRYCE TAYLOR: It's fun. Just watching the games on TV, that's something that I
have done for awhile now. So it's just exciting to picture myself out there
tomorrow and we just got to make sure we keep everything in perspective
though. Don't get overly excited or nervous, but just enjoy the moment and
just have fun with it.  
MALIK HAIRSTON: I think it will be a great atmosphere. Two teams with the
sense of urgency. We want to be able to have another practice. We want to live
to play another game. So I just think it will be very exciting out there and
like Bryce said, it's not getting too excited, just being able to keep our
focus.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thanks, guys. Okay. At this time we'll take
questions for coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about using dribble penetration as a weapon. Obviously that
seems to be a big part of your offense and also without having a dominant shot
blocker in the middle, what you guys need to do defensively to kind of prevent
Winthrop from exploiting that in their game.  
COACH ERNIE KENT: We feel like we're a very quick and explosive basketball
team in the full court and even in the half court. And one of the things that
we spent a lot of time on is attacking defenses once you get them spread out
with the dribble.  
We have got five six, seven maybe eight really skilled basketball players that
can pass, dribble and shoot the ball. And when you have an ability to shoot it
teams have to honor your 3-point shot which gives you a lot of opportunity to
get in the lanes and penetrate and draw and kick. And either get a layup or
get somebody else a great look. Not having a shot blocker, all year long we
been talked about being too smaller too this and kind of like that movie what
was that horse Geraldo? Hidalgo. Whatever that horse is. My jockey is too big
and my horse is too small. I guess that's kind of us.  
And really to overcome that, we have done a good job of fronting the post and
having great weak side help. And with that the ball has a hard time getting in
there. And the game yesterday there was an exceptional player on their team
that really wore us down a little bit inside which gave us an opportunity to
kind of forced us to go to the matchup zone which has been a great second
defense for us since we're not really a full court pressing team, having only
six guys, seven guys that we play and really not having that quickness and
pressure in the full court, we really rely on our half court defense and the
matchup zone. The matchup zone gives you an opportunity pressure the ball,
front the post and have great weak side help and it's really aimed at taking
away a low post basketball team that really wants to pound the ball inside and
that's exactly what it did yesterday that gave us a chance to get back in the
game against Miami.  
  
Q. No that you've had ample time to figure out this Winthrop team, what do
you know more about them today versus yesterday?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: Well, we have always known a lot about them. Having played
them a couple years ago and watched them through the year, the thing that I
know more about today than yesterday they are not a Cinderella basketball
team. That is a very, very good basketball team. They have got the big guy
inside, they're loaded with shooters, they're loaded with athletes, got a deep
bench, great coach and they played a tough schedule. When you look at what
they did with the people in their conference and non-conference, playing
Wisconsin, Carolina, Marylands, that close, you're not a Cinderella team
having those types of teams in your schedule and playing that tough of
basketball against a caliber of opponent. I know that they're very similar to
us they want to run, spread you out, attack you off the dribble, shoot it
everywhere. And they got a dominating center inside. So we're really, really
going to have to be on our toes defensively to neutralize some of those
players on that team and no one goes off and has a monster game on you. If we
have a player has a big game like that it could be along afternoon for us.  
  
Q. You just kind of hit on one of the things that I think is going to work
to your advantage, you both have a quick upstart game. Do you think that
that's going to go better for you guys Miami of Ohio slowed you down and gave
you some trouble there.  
COACH ERNIE KENT: With Miami of Ohio again, they dictated the tempo of the
game. Because again the only, with only playing six or seven guys it's really
not super quickness sitting down on the bench that we can get out and press
for 40 minutes a be maybe speed Miami of Ohio up that would have changed the
tempo. So you can do it two ways: Get up the line defense and maybe get some
steals, we weren't getting that. Or, maybe you could create some steals out of
your matchup zone, which gave us an opportunity to speed the game up and gave
us just enough transition. Other than that, very similar to Washington State,
we had to beat them at their own style of game. So again I thought it showed
the diversity of this team with being able to play in the half court and grind
out a game and win it in the last seconds. But we have done that quite a bit
here and we have been in a lot of games like that. This game tomorrow maybe
the advantage of playing Miami of Ohio is that maybe we're not as worn out
because we just didn't run like we usually run and we didn't get in up tempo
came and this game tomorrow is going to be up tempo. I don't see either of us
changing that style of play in the next 24 hours to say I'm going to walk it
down the floor and milk a clock. They're not going to go away from who they
are, we would like to play, we're better suited in my opinion to really go out
and run and spread you and attack and lots of shots going up because we can
really shoot the basketball and we're really pretty good beating you off the
dribble too as well.  
  
Q. What was kind of the demeanor of your team when it got back to the hotel
last night? Was there kind of a sense of relief more than satisfaction of
winning?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: I think there was a sense of relief. I think there's a
little bit of sense of disappointment which is good too that they felt like
they could have played better. I wanted to bring to their attention that we're
going to play better. Having getting through this first game. None of these
guys have been through this before. They needed to go through it. The good
thing is we won a basketball game. Maybe it was a slow down game and
everything else, but I pointed out to them to realize you shot 50 percent from
the field, 50 from the three, a hundred percent from the free throw line. You
only had five turnovers in the game, and you had to grind out a game and win
it at the buzzer, that is good basketball game playing against a team that
plays a very similar style.  
The key thing though is to let them understand, let's go back and realize what
got us here, hard work and defense and on Sunday, we're going to have to bring
hard work and defense to get through this game and really execute down the
stretch in these games as well.  
  
Q. Can you kind of define your coaching style and the way you communicate
with your players?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: I like to feel like I'm still playing. So I like to stand
and move although this year with bad shoulders and bad hips I sat down quite a
bit. And now you're at tournament time I think it's important that you have
the intensity that is needed. And these guys need to understand the intensity
that's needed to be successful. That's something we have cranked up here from
our conference tournament on. But it's a style that allows them green light to
shoot it any time they want to shoot it. They don't need to look at the bench
and realize whether it's a bad shot, they need to understand good shot/bad
shot, but it's one that I hope that gives them an enormous amount of
confidence that they can play the game with a lot of freedom. So there's a
method to the madness that we do on the floor.  
But at the same time I want them to have an enormous amount of confidence and
maybe look at it like a Saturday afternoon pickup game, that type of mentality
you get when you're just out there playing around and shooting it up and you
get on a roll and the ball starts going and away you go and it's a lot of fun
involved in this it as well. Defensive minded I'm really, that's where I put
the attention. You have to defend otherwise they're going to take you out that
have ball game.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.  
COACH ERNIE KENT: Thank you.

### [Lodrick Stewart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17102)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with the USC players. We have Gabe Pruitt and
Lodrick Stewart. And we'll open it up for questions.  
  
Q. For both you guys, you guys have your top four players are two juniors, a
senior and a 21 year old freshman. Texas has four freshmen starters and a
sophomore, does that give you an advantage at all having a little more
maturity, having played together for a longer period of time?  
LODRICK STEWART: I don't really think so. They're a great team. They have
mature players on their team that's out standing players. And they're a great
team all the way around. Offensively and defensively.  
So it's going to be a tough task for us. I don't think it neither team have an
advantage.  
GABE PRUITT: I don't think it will matter too much. They have been gelling
together all year. They have won big games even the games that against good
teams. They're a closer. It's going to be, even though they're young, we don't
look at that. We're still coming in that they're looking to fight us.  
  
Q. Gabe, did you tweak your hamstring yesterday and what's your status
today?  
GABE PRUITT: Yeah, it's a little tweaked, but I'm fine. I did a lot of
stretching today with the trainers. And I'm fine right now.  
  
Q. Both you guys, how profound was the NBA influence that Coach Floyd
brought to USC?  
GABE PRUITT: I think what Coach Floyd's brought to us really helped us because
he's been where we're trying to go. We really respect him. And he's brought
kind of that man's mentality to our college level. And he's kind of forced us
to mature. He's put a lot on us. And we had nothing to do but to respond to
him to be successful.  
LODRICK STEWART: I feel the same way. We run a few NBA sets and stuff like
that. He's just a great coach just to be around. Not just because he coached
in the NBA. Yes, we all have dreams to go to the next level and play at that
level, and he give us tips and pointers of how hard we need to play to even
get a chance. But it's just about him being a great person, a great individual
that helped us to see this year come together.  
  
Q. Could you tell me a little bit about your, what Texas poses defensively
and offensively that you guys are going to have to do or try to do both on
your offense and defense against a team like that?  
LODRICK STEWART: Well, I'm not going to give our game plan away, but they're a
physical team. They're very fast getting up and down the court. So I think
what we need to do is just get back. That's probably the only thing I can
really say. We just need to get back and just play hard.  
GABE PRUITT: They're quick, they're fast. They're long. I guess I can treat
Augustin just like Ervin, so they're pretty similar. So I don't think it will
change too much. But just like Lod said, get back and stop their second chance
baskets.  
  
Q. You guys almost have to guard against over committing to Durant and
putting too much emphasis on him in this game?  
LODRICK STEWART: Not really, we're just going to keep doing what we have been
doing. We have a game plan that coach gave us and we're going to execute
whatever he say do. Not just going to focus on one player, it's about us
getting a win. Whatever we can do to get the win. So we just got to focus on
the whole team because it's just not him as a standout player, it's the whole
starting five. They're very deep, all the bench players, they're great too, so
we have to focus on every one.  
GABE PRUITT: We can't put too much emphasis on Durant. Obviously he's a great
player, but there's other guys around him that can also play. We can't put too
much attention on him and allow the guys to go off.  
So we got guys on our team that can accept that challenge and do a job on
Durant and then we just can't forget about the other guys as well.  
  
Q. On that again, he is kind of a unique player, so is it team defense in
order to contain him? Can you just elaborate on that a little bit?  
LODRICK STEWART: It's just about doing what we have been doing. Help side,
just denying the wings the balls, just getting up. When your man get the ball,
face up and be a man and take that challenge that you have to keep him from
getting in the lane. Not just Kevin Durant it's the whole team. They have
great perimeter players that can break you down and shoot it and get to the
foul line.  
It's going to be a challenge for all of us, but it's going to take a team
effort. And it's from me all the way to the Tim Floyd it's going to be a team
effort to beat this team, because they're a great team.  
  
Q. Is there a Pac-10 team that you can compare them to then or that you guys
have played in the Pac-10?  
LODRICK STEWART: I think that's a unique team right there.  
GABE PRUITT: It's a pretty unique team. No, there's not a team I can think of.  
LODRICK STEWART: They have great quick guards like Oregon, I can say that. But
with Kevin Durant in the lineup, it's just a different matchup and we have to
just take a different approach to this game. We're going to come out and
fight. We're excited to be able to get this opportunity to play against Texas
because they're a great team. And I feel we're a great team too and as long as
we execute our stuff and just go at it the way we have been going, stay in our
routine that we have been doing every day, I think we'll be all right.  
  
Q. In Pac-10 play you guys are pretty familiar with who you're going
against, guys you played against in high school. In the tournament setting how
much more important is the other scout team guys for giving you a good look
for a team you haven't seen before?  
GABE PRUITT: It's really important. We don't have too many days to prepare.
It's kind of like when we go on the road and you play one game, you have a day
to prepare. So we're kind of used to it. Our scouting team, they do a real
good job of really getting in and doing what they do and having us prepared or
whatever, but it's real important. But we'll treat it as -- we'll treat it
like a road game where we have one day and do our preparation for that game.  
  
Q. Lodrick, you touched on it briefly, everybody talks about Kevin when
they're getting ready to play Texas, how important are Augustin and Abrams to
their overall success?  
LODRICK STEWART: They're a great team because I know he get a lot of pressure
and stuff because he is like one of the greatest college players that ever
played the game, I mean stat-wise, and you really don't see many six-ten wing
players like that.  
But them two guards are great. They shoot well, break people down, get to the
basket. And I think they really helped him and opened up his game. Because
it's hard, like the film we watched, it's hard for a player to stay between
them, keeping them from getting to the basket. So they play a major role in
their success this year too.  
  
Q. Is there an excitement level in the challenge of facing a player who
could be the first pick in the NBA draft?  
GABE PRUITT: Yes, it's very exciting. We see Texas all the time on ESPN. You
hear Kevin Durant's name and whenever you talk about college basketball and we
have an opportunity to play against him. And we have been doing a lot this
year, we have been successful, and we just are getting another opportunity to
show how good we are. And I think this is a perfect opportunity for us to do
that.  
LODRICK STEWART: Man, he's a great player, but like I said before, and Gabe
said, we're not just focusing on one player how to stop one player. We want to
stop the team. And just be able to walk out of here with a win. We're going to
have to go at this game and watch a lot of film tonight and just prepare for
this game. And our scout team has really helped us out this year just running
through all the plays and stuff like that. That's been really a major part in
our success this year.  
  
Q. Football is one of the few games here and there at USC and they have won
like a gazillion baseball championships. Where does basketball rank in the
pecking order on sports on campus right now? You guys getting recognized all
the time and is the culture changing?  
LODRICK STEWART: I really don't know where we rank. We don't really think
about that. We just focus a game at a time and just we really can't say where
we rank because it's not over yet. We're just going to keep playing and hope
we can go very far in this great conference, great tournament.  
GABE PRUITT: We're starting to turn heads. We got our good share of
compliments around campus. But we feel we still have more work to do. Football
team, baseball team, they have been winning championships and we have yet to
win a championship. So I don't think people would look at us as them until we
win a championship. And we still got a lot of work to do to be put in that
category with them. But we're turning heads right now.  
  
Q. Do either of you guys feel like you have to avenge what happened in the
Rose Bowl a year and a half ago when Texas defeated Southern California in the
last second with Vince Young? Has anybody said, come on, you guys got to beat
those guys and avenge that?  
LODRICK STEWART: People have said that, but we're not looking at that. We play
basketball they play football. So we're just trying to get the win. Just, it's
not really about because they beat us in football, we just have to come out
and play and just focus on the game and just go in our same routine and just
try to get this win.  
GABE PRUITT: People have said it, brought it up, with the football game, but
we don't look at it as that. Like he said, we're basketball and they're
football. We just have an opportunity to play against a good team with a
couple good players. But we don't look at it as getting revenge for the
football team.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, when you guys go on the road a lot though particularly
like maybe against UCLA or that they wear the Vince Young stuff and say "Hook-
em Horns" and do stuff when you play against other teams, right?   
GABE PRUITT: I seen that, if we play Oregon or whatever I see people around
with Vince Young jerseys, just to try to get back at us. But, no, we just try
to get the win. That's our, that's us getting back at them. It's getting the
win.  
  
Q. With the new arena, with the recruiting class you guys have coming in,
should UCLA be afraid of what's going on at USC?  
LODRICK STEWART: Man, any team that get the opportunity to be coached by Tim
Floyd, I think should be afraid. He's a great coach and he turn programs
around. He's going to make this into a powerhouse.  
So I mean, he's a great coach. He's going to turn it around. I'm happy for him
what he have done with USC basketball. Because people over the years have
forgot about USC basketball. Because I remember last year it was funny we were
on the road and people looked at our stuff our warmups and said USC, they
thought it was the University of South Carolina. And that was kind of funny.
And we were like, dang, they really don't know who we are. So I think we're
kind of earning a name for our self and people are starting to recognize who
had we are.  
GABE PRUITT: I don't think not just UCLA, but I think anybody who has to face
us should be worried. We're a young people, obviously Lod's leaving and that,
but we just have a lot coming back and we got people that's going to be added
on to it, so I think any team that we play should be kind of afraid to matchup
against us.  
THE MODERATOR: I'm anxious to know who Kevin Durant is on your scout team.  
LODRICK STEWART: We we're about to do that right now. We're about to go to
practice right now so we'll see.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Any more questions? All right. Thanks, gentlemen.
We'll go ahead and talk questions for coach.  
  
Q. Wanted to be the guy to say if it hasn't already been said, welcome back
on behalf of the media and what's it like two decades later to be going in for
the Sweet 16 here on this court?  
COACH TIM FLOYD: Well, it's great to be back in this region. It's special area
for me. This is where I got my start as ahead coach.  
Bill Belknap gave me a chance at the University of Idaho and got some great
memories from being back here. And we have had a chance to see some old
friends and that part's always great.  
  
Q. Did you see kind of a rejuvenated Taj Gibson yesterday and how
prominently does he factor in tomorrow I know you don't tell us your game plan
but he's obviously going to be in the mix with Durant, it seems like.  
COACH TIM FLOYD: You know, I wouldn't say rejuvenated, I thought he was the
one guy that really played in the Oregon game. I thought he really played
there. And I thought he played exceptionally well against Stanford. And
Washington State. In the tournament. I think he's benefited from his
experiences. He was, he played last night like he did the first two months of
the season. He had an adjustment to size and length in our league affect
Oregon, Oregon State series, early in the season. When you saw Hawes again,
when he saw Stanford for the first time.  
And we're getting to where we expect that from him, night in, night out. He's
a great competitor. Taj is going to give you an effort every night. And he'll
have obviously a prominent role for us. I'm not saying towards Durant, I'm
just saying he's going to have a prominent role, because he's a guy we play
through offensively and he's a guy we rely on on the boards and defensively.  
  
Q. A follow-up on Taj. Given that his age and as you say his experiences
that he's gone through, does he play like a freshman at all? Does he seem like
he's already an upperclassman?  
COACH TIM FLOYD: Well, he does. I think the adjustment that freshmen go
through are how hard you have to play. And Hackett hasn't experienced that.
Nor has Dwight Lewis. Those guys all play hard. And that's why they're playing
significant minutes for us.  
  
Q. Watching tape, is there any team that you think that is best in defending
Durant?  
COACH TIM FLOYD: Well, if I answered that then they would know how we're going
to try to defend him. So we have watched a lot of tape. And I wouldn't say
that we necessarily have a plan in place. We're going to work on some things
that we think are basic to the game today. Watch some film tonight, have a
little walk through again tomorrow and talk about specific coverages. He's
gotten his points in a lot of different ways, but thing that jumps out at me
is his great ability to offensive rebound. And he gets it as far as scoring in
that he understands that guys that score get to the foul line. And teams have
talked about playing him physical, teams have talked about playing him soft. I
know that I probably would rather see him shoot threes than get to the foul
line all night long. Because he shot 92 percent from the foul line over his
last four games.  
  
Q. Rick Barnes likes to show clips sometimes to his players to motivate
them. Do you, one, do you show clips to your players and if you would, if you
do, would you show them USC versus Texas in the Rose Bowl from last year where
Vince Young scored late to beat the Trojans?  
COACH TIM FLOYD: I doubt we would show them that one. No. I don't think it has
any impact on this game whatsoever. No. No, I don't really show them clips. I
don't. But that's a good idea. Maybe we can come up with one before tomorrow.
But I don't think it will be Vince.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. You guys have, key player-wise, a couple juniors, a senior, and a 21 year
old freshman. They have four freshmen and a sophomore in the starting lineup.
Does that give you any advantage of having guys that have played and been
together?  
COACH TIM FLOYD: They have one game of NCAA tournament experience, we have one
game of NCAA tournament experience. I think that they lost in their conference
finals, right? We lost in our conference finals. I don't think there's any
real advantage. I don't. Not this time of the year. Their freshmen aren't
freshmen any more. Taj isn't a freshman any more. Daniel is not a freshman any
more. These guys have had enough game experience that you figure that they
understand what they have to do, when they have to do it, and how they have to
do it and we're going to have to play hard both teams are going to play
exceptionally hard and try to play together. Try to play smart and play
together.  
  
Q. Is it harder to win at an established program or at a remote place like
Idaho or Iowa State, or a place like USC where it's really not part of the
culture or history?  
COACH TIM FLOYD: They're all hard. The hardest job is the one that you have.
And that's because of expectations. It doesn't matter if you're at Idaho or
New Orleans or Iowa State or USC. You have expectations the second you take
the job. This job has been the easiest recruiting job that I've ever had. I
think it's because of the great marketing that our football program has given
us. I think there's a mystique about our football program. I think kids pay
attention to it regardless if they're basketballers or footballers, it's
provided us great recruiting weekends. But in addition we have a new arena,
and we're in an area with 18 million people that has served us well in our
recruiting. And that will be the real key to our future success is the
recruiting base that we have.  
We didn't necessarily have one in the Palouse. Although that has changed a
great deal in the last 20 years. There's some outstanding players in this part
of the country now. We didn't necessarily have that in the State of Iowa.
Where, oh, about 40 percent of the state was with the cyclones and 60 percent
was with the Hawkeyes. And of the two Division-I players it was a flip of the
coin what birthright you had and whether or not you were going to have a shot
at the kid.  
And you go outside the area, go into Chicago they grew up wanting to play in
the Big-10. Go down to St. Louis, Kansas or Missouri. And we had to think
nationally. And down at New Orleans, although there were players, they all
grew up and wanted to play in the SEC. So, but this is a job that has great
potential because of the recruiting base, the academic reputation and the
marketing that we're getting from our football program, and the new arena.  
  
Q. How much more important are the scout players in a NCAA tournament
setting where the players aren't necessarily familiar with the players they're
going up against they have never seen Texas on the court before.  
COACH TIM FLOYD: You know, I think you just talk in terms of the whole. Things
that we have to work on in terms of concepts that we have done throughout the
course of the year. The change from game to game depending on who you're
playing. And we will give them an idea about their personnel, what we think
their personnel likes in terms of the where they like to get their shots, how
they like to go get them, what shoulder they like to turn over, etcetera. But
with 24 hours in a turn around, it's very difficult as we have learned in the
Pac-10. And our league is a Thursday, Saturday league. And you don't have a
chance for that repeat practice to make sure that it's instilled in your
players. And a lot of it is just going to be on instinct and playing hard. You
don't want to make them think this time of the year. They just got to go play.  
  
Q. Did you enjoy coaching in the NBA?  
COACH TIM FLOYD: Well, I think to enjoy anything in our business regardless of
if it's junior high basketball to the NBA, you have to win. Because that's the
essence of what we do. So take a quick glimpse at my record and tell me how
much we enjoyed it.  
(Laughter.).  
  
Q. Following up on the scout team question, who plays Durant on your scout
team?  
COACH TIM FLOYD: Oh, I guess Kyle Austin. We expect him to be Durant a year
from now.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. When he's red shirting?  
COACH TIM FLOYD: He might. He might. He might.  
  
Q. Are you ahead of schedule or do you believe in schedules doing so well in
your second year?  
COACH TIM FLOYD: Well, I was asked this question last week and these guys, if
y'all don't mind repeating it, my schedule was to try to get here before my
contract ended. Which is three years from now. So with that being said, we'll
have to regroup and reestablish where we want to go from here, but we have an
administration that at some point wants to try to win a national championship.
We all want that. Do we have the pieces in place to do that one day? Yes. I
think it can happen at some point.  
We had no idea what to expect this year but I think Gabe Pruitt's played the
point guard spot, Daniel Hackett has played at the point guard spot, those
were our real questions going into this year and I think they have handled
that situation terrifically. Both of them. And I think Lewis and Taj Gibson
have been outstanding and we expected Nick's play, we expected Lodrick
Stewart's play. Weren't sure about the other four guys that we talked about.
We knew Gabe was a great player. But we didn't know how he would play with the
ball in his hands at the point. And he's just gotten better and better every
game.  
  
Q. Would being picked six in the Pac-10 was that a slap or did you use that
as motivation?  
COACH TIM FLOYD: We didn't know really what to expect to be quite honest with
you. We have always believed that college basketball's about guard play and
typically you go as far as your guards allow you to go. That's why Washington
State's been outstanding, I think it's why Oregon's been outstanding, why UCLA
has been outstanding. Certainly Texas, their back court, teams that are
playing this time of the year have great back courts. We didn't know what our
back Court was going to be like with the loss of Ryan Francis with Gabe's
ineligibility, the fact he couldn't practice with us the first semester and
now to go try to convert to a point guard and he's gotten better and better
every game. That's been the real key is our perimeter play. And Taj's
addition.  
  
Q. Talking about perimeter play, you talk a little bit about what you see
out of D.J. Augustin and A.J. and the challenges they present?  
COACH TIM FLOYD: Yeah, D.J. has got a lot of savvy, a lot of poise, I haven't
seen him take a bad shot in the films that I've watched. He gets it. He
understands where the ball needs to go. Last ten minutes of the game. It seems
like it's in Durant's hands. He does that unselfishly. I talked to six
coaches, three of them said you got to force him right, the other three said
you got to force him left. Which all that tells me is he can go either way
with it. So I think he's terrific. I think he's absolutely terrific.  
And Abrams, he's got unbelievable range. And great quickness. And a great
ability to get it off quickly. The two big guys, when they rebound it they're
pretty darn hard to beat and that will be a real key in the game.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let Coach Floyd go to practice.  
COACH TIM FLOYD: All right. Thank you.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have starting at your left Torrell Martin, Michael Jenkins,
Chris Gaynor, Craig Bradshaw. Let's go ahead and open it up to questions for
student-athletes.  
  
Q. The three guards up here, this game is going to be predicated a lot on
guard play, and what I would like to ask you guys about is dribble
penetration. How much do you expect that facet of the game to kind of
influence tomorrow's outcome. And when and when you guys penetrate are you
more offensive minded thinking score first or thinking penetrate, draw the
defense and kick?  
TORRELL MARTIN: We think that's what they're going to do. They run a lot of
ball screens. A lot of pick and rolls. A lot of things like that. So we have
to stick to our principles and get under the ball screens and focus on really
not coming out to shoot it. They like to draw the defense and kick the ball.
So part of us preparing for are what we have to do we have to really stick to
our principles and if we do that we should be all right.  
MICHAEL JENKINS: Yeah, the big part of the game is going to be stopping
dribble penetration on our part. Because if we don't contain their guards
we're going to have a tough time winning. Because that's basically what they
do the whole game is try to penetrate, kick for threes or penetrate. Get
fouled or penetrate and get all the way to the basket. And for our team, with
us, we, if we penetrate, we look to kick the ball more than get all the way to
the basket. But if we're open, yeah, we'll go all the way. But most of the
time we penetrate to find the open man.  
CHRIS GAYNOR: To add on to what they're saying, yeah, I think that dribble
penetration is going to be a big key to tomorrow. They got primary four guards
starting. They got Brooks, Porter, Bryce Taylor, and Malik Hairston, and
that's typically four guards right there. So we'll have to be on our A game,
especially on the defensive end and like they said, we got to do the same
thing. We got to dribble penetration and get it to Craig and the rest of the
big men and just take advantage of that.  
  
Q. Guys, how do you feel, what do you think you've learned from last year to
this year that is going to help you go further in this tournament?  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: I look at that every position counts. Going to keep on being
aggressive. No matter if we're up 20 or whatever. Just contain people and
believe that we are, we belong here and that we can beat some of these teams.  
CHRIS GAYNOR: I think you see that people really want it more this year. After
making history time and time again this year, to be in here for the second
round and have the chance to advance to the Sweet 16, you know, that's what we
all dream about. We really weren't picked high major like everybody else was
in the country and for a little old Winthrop to be here, you know it's
something special. So you think that you could see in every's eyes that we
really want this.  
  
Q. Question for Chris. Did you go on the tour of New Zealand?  
CHRIS GAYNOR: Yeah, I went to New Zealand.  
  
Q. What was your impression of first of all the BBQ's at Craig's. And
largely, the whole tour of the nation of New Zealand?  
CHRIS GAYNOR: It was a great place. To see Craig's hometown, it was something
wonderful. We might not ever get a chance to go overseas again. And the
cookout all the hospitalities that the Bradshaws showed us was wonderful. It
felt like we were really back in the states.  
  
Q. Was the food like American food?  
CHRIS GAYNOR: I mean, you know --  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: Better.  
CHRIS GAYNOR: Yeah, Craig said it's better. So I'm going to have to go with
Craig. It was better.  
(Laughter.).  
CHRIS GAYNOR: Don't want to upset my big man.  
  
Q. Chris, you guys played Oregon at Mac Court back in 2004. You guys all
played in that game. Talk about what you remember about that game and
particularly Aaron Brooks who you may have had to guard. At that time he had
25.  
CHRIS GAYNOR: Yeah, yeah. Well, one of my worst games ever, you know. Really I
remember it being sold out in there. Being a freshman. It was something that
to take in.  
He had a heck of a game. He was on fire. It was like I said it was one of my
worst games ever. And he's a great player, give him all that, but I was
talking to Rayshown Terry the other day and I told him we had a chance to play
Oregon and he said I can't give him too much credit, he's not as good as
everybody says he is, you know, I just got to go out there and play my game.  
  
Q. If you could all answer this. I heard coach's style can be somewhat hard
driving. If you each could just address what his coaching style is in practice
and in the games and maybe give some examples of how tough he is.  
TORRELL MARTIN: Hard driving? That's an under statement. Coach Marshall, he
has a unique style. But the thing about coach that you learn early is he's
going to get his point across and we're going to do things his way and that's
pretty much all there is to it. And the thing that makes it so significant is
when you do it his way it tends to work out. So.  
MICHAEL JENKINS: Yeah, well Coach Marshall, his method of coaching, as a
freshman I didn't really buy into it, but I have now. It's just like you have
to -- he's going to get his point across. And Coach Peele told me you can't
listen to the tone of the message, you are have to listen to what the message
is saying. Just try to block out the yelling and the vulgar language or
whatever language he's saying and just listen to what he's saying. Torrell
helped me with that too. And that's it was just the way he coaches.  
CHRIS GAYNOR: I think that he's a great disciplinarian. He's real tough. And
that's what we need. We have been very successful for me and Mike three years
in a row and the year before that with Craig and Torrell, they were pretty
successful too. But you think that's what we need and that's where we get all
or energy and passion from him. And that it carries on into the game.  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: I think it's more of a motivator. He's a great coach. But you
think he gets the most out of players. He knows how to push the buttons, of
some players, and he gets -- he got the best out of me and we go to practice
every day with the mindset that we're going to get better every day. He makes
you work. He's a great coach.  
MICHAEL JENKINS: Coach Marshall, he's gritty guy, a gritty coach. So he gets
gritty players and he gets us to play gritty. So his coaching methods goes
with the players.  
  
Q. Craig seems like kind of looking at the last 10, 12 games, you're kind of
production has been going up more and more. Have you kind of looked to be more
aggressive or looked for your shot more of this time and maybe Chris could
talk about Craig and how he's come on as the season has gone along?  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: Yeah, I had a shaky first half of the season. I was injured. I
had other things on my mind. I just relaxed and this is my senior year, I'm
going to have fun. And just go out there and play like I know how to play. And
it's worked. Hopefully it continues tomorrow.  
CHRIS GAYNOR: Playing with Craig these three years has been, he's made my job
so easy. I like it when he's aggressive, I think we play better when he's
aggressive. And the outcome is always great when he's aggressive. These last
couple games like you said he's really been playing aggressive and he's
unstoppable, really, in my eyes, when he comes ready to play, I think he takes
our team to a new level.  
  
Q. Kind of a follow-up to what I asked before, why do you guys think he's
Coach Marshall has been as successful as he's been in his time at Winthrop?  
TORRELL MARTIN: I think the difference between us and a lot of programs is a
lot of programs let their players play and they just rely on their talent. And
that gets teams real far. But the difference is in our system that we run a
system. And we run that. And then once that breaks down, then we let our
players play. And Coach Marshall I know stills that in us early so, that we
don't just have to rely on our natural God given talents and that is what
prevails often in games.  
  
Q. Chris I think you mentioned earlier about little old Winthrop being here,
do you really refer to think of yourselves as still an underdog team with the
winning streak and the fact that the only teams that have beaten you are still
in the tournament or do you maybe use that to your advantage a little bit and
also for the other players maybe to respond to that.  
CHRIS GAYNOR: Last couple days everybody's been comparing to us George Mason.
And we're really we haven't did everything George Mason has done. They made it
to the Final Four. We won one game in the NCAA tournament. We can't come here
and be satisfied just from one win. We need to keep going, keep playing the
way that we have been playing and then once we make it the to Final Four, then
teams people can compare us to George Mason then.  
MICHAEL JENKINS: Yeah, I still feel in our eyes that we are an underdog
because people didn't respect us playing Notre Dame we got all the media
attention, and everything else. They still didn't respect us. And we came out
here and showed them that they need to respect us. And like Chris said, we
still people comparing us to George Mason, but we haven't done what they have
done. So in my eyes I hope in all my teammates eyes we do feel like an
underdog and the more we feel like an underdog the more confident we're going
to be to go out there and show everybody that we belong.  
  
Q. The rest of you could comment on that game a couple years ago about
against Oregon. Just your memories from the atmosphere and the guys you
faced?  
MICHAEL JENKINS: Oh, well, that game, you know, it was a track meet. Oregon
just ran the ball up and down the court. All I could remember is running down
the offense next thing you know I'm running back down on defense and the ball
hasn't even went back, got back in bounds yet and I'm running back down on
defense. So it was a real fast paced game. It wasn't as high scoring as you
would think it would be, being that fast paced. But Oregon really pushes the
ball up the court. And we just didn't play, we played well, we played well,
until the last couple minutes and then we had, I think we was only down like
five with three or four minutes to go and then we had to foul and they took
the lead about 15, I think.  
TORRELL MARTIN: I remember coach talking about the players individually and
what type of players they were and the pro prospects and I remember looking at
film and just thinking in my head I don't think these guys are going to be no
better than us. And then getting out there and realizing they were a step
above us and I just remember that how fast paced the game was. And realize
that had we had to step our game up a little bit after that and I believe we
did that. I feel now we're on the level now that we can compete and we're just
as athletic, just as fast and fundamentally sound as Oregon is.  
  
Q. Question for Torrell, but you others can respond too. Tell us a little
bit about the need that philosophy and also the junkyard dog?  
CHRIS GAYNOR: I started it. I started it.  
(Laughter.)  
TORRELL MARTIN: Need that is a saying that I just kind of came up with. I
actually got it from one of my friend who played at UNC Charlotte. Its
basically when you're in dire need of something whether it be a steal, big
block or shot. Perfect scenario, Chris Gaynor yesterday we're up one and we in
desperate need of a shot and he shoot it and I'm just looking like you know,
need that. And that's basically what it means. It could be in anything. Out of
shoes, you need a new pair of shoes, you get them, you know, need that.  
(Laughter.)  
CHRIS GAYNOR: He always comes up with everything he's real creative. Torrell
is -- and the team just embraces it and we just use it all the time.
Especially the song that we have to sing after the game that he came up. Craig
really enjoys it too.  
(Laughter.).  
MICHAEL JENKINS: Our phrase and saying coordinator, Torrell Martin. You know.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Just to follow-up to that game a couple years ago you mentioned that game
was real fast paced up tempo, do you expect tomorrow to be more the same and
very similar to that?  
TORRELL MARTIN: Yes, definitely. But thing about us is we like to get out and
run too. But we plan on slowing them down a little bit and controlling the
tempo and if we do that the game will work in our favor.  
MICHAEL JENKINS: I think it's a mutual court game, that back then it was on at
their place. And we're more we're a smarter team now more veteran team now,
more seasoned team. So we're not going to just let them get out and just run
up and down like they did when we were all just like freshmen and sophomores
back then so it will be a more, more slow placed game probably tomorrow.  
CHRIS GAYNOR: And we played against the nation's leading scoring team. And
they run more than anybody. And in the nation. They get the ball out and maybe
shooting it from half court. And that's how fast paced the game is. So I think
we'll be ready. Hopefully everybody will come out with fresh legs and it won't
be the same outcome as it was at Oregon.  
  
Q. Craig, Miami gave them trouble kind of slowing it down they were
obviously kind of frustrated with that. Does that almost make you guys think
that would be something that would work or do you stick with your own style?  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: We're going to try to do the same thing, like Torrell said.
Slow it down. They like to play a fast paced game. So we're just going to run
our sets, try to exploit them there. And yeah, basically that's our plan.  
  
Q. I can't let you off without telling us what the song is or saying it.  
MICHAEL JENKINS: Craig?  
(Laughter.)  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: No.  
  
Q. You look ready to sing it.  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: Oh, no. No. My voice is a little sore.  
TORRELL MARTIN: Can't even breathe, I guess.  
(Laughter.)  
TORRELL MARTIN: No, it's, we can't tell you that, that's a personal song, so
we can't share it with you. Hey, if we win we might sing it after the game.  
CHRIS GAYNOR: You have to come to the locker room for that.  
  
Q. You just remember thinking when you guys were playing Notre Dame you guys
looked so confident you guys just seem to have a ton of fun together and seem
like a very confident group. How much do you think that factors into your
success?  
TORRELL MARTIN: That's definitely important. The thing we don't overlook any
team. We have much respect for everybody we play. And the thing about us is we
play a dire preseason or conference schedule, we play some of the top teams.
Once you play some of them and then you start playing everybody else and you
get into a winning streak, then you your team naturally gets confident and the
thing you must do as a program and a mature program is not let that go to your
head but at the same time have fun with this game and we have so much
camaraderie as a team and we just have fun with it on and off the court. I
think that's the big difference this year.  
MICHAEL JENKINS: We have been around each other for a long time now. This
group here. It's all just come together. We laugh all the time. Joke around
with each other. We get mad at each other. But still love them. And that helps
out there on the court too. We play so many road games during the season and
that builds us too. Ready to take anything on. We're road warriors and a very
close group and it makes us very what's the word I'm looking for? Makes us a
very dangerous -- thanks, Chris -- makes us very dangerous in a tournament.  
CHRIS GAYNOR: I think that confidence comes from trust. We were up 20 against
Notre Dame and they made their run and they took the lead and then just we had
a to trust that and Craig and because he was having a monster game him and
Torrell, and Mike was doing other things, with all the assists, that we just
weren't going to get rattled. And we didn't. And it came down to the next play
down, got a bucket from Craig from Mike. And so it's just a trust that we have
in each other. To me.  
  
Q. You guys mentioned you still feel a little bit like an underdog and
disrespected a little bit. But the last couple days have you felt a little
different about yourselves having had that first win? Do you feel -- there had
to be a little bit of doubt as far as whether you really belonged and
whatnot.  
TORRELL MARTIN: We know we belong in this tournament. We still just adding on
to the winning streak. That's what it felt like yesterday. I was excited
extremely, but we are always going to be the underdogs, winning one game is
not going to change it. Maybe not winning two. Two might give us a little bit
to talk about. We have to go all the way to Atlanta before we even get the
respect that we need. So we just got to keep pushing and do what we need to do
to get there.  
MICHAEL JENKINS: There was never any doubt in our mind yesterday that we
couldn't play with Notre Dame or we couldn't play with anybody in this
tournament. We're like we said, we're a very confident team. We don't boast
around and brag and stuff and do crazy stuff out there on the court, but if
you look at our demeanor on the court, you can tell we're very confident and
there's nothing that anybody could do to take that away from us.  
CHRIS GAYNOR: Well, yeah, I think that being the underdog is something that we
need. We really didn't win any big high major games this year. We were always
in the vicinity of winning them, never could get over that hump. So until
yesterday when we finally did get over that hump, we got a little respect that
we needed, but I mean it was still going, we'll still be Winthrop, you know,
the team who was 0-6 from Coach Marshall's era and the NCAA. So but I mean it
was just something that we need. We need that.  
(Laughter.) Need that.  
THE MODERATOR: Craig, do you have any thoughts?  
(Laughter.)  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: Yeah, I think we thrive on being the underdog. I think teams
really don't know too much about us. Even though they say they do. But I think
they come into the game not as prepared as us. We really do a thorough
scouting report on everybody and we know so much about the team whereas I get
the kind of, I don't know, sense, that maybe they just take us lightly. And we
just exploit that and take that and run with it sort of thing.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll excuse the Winthrop student-athletes for their
vocal practice and we'll welcome Coach Marshall in just a moment. All right.
Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Could you talk about how dribble penetration is going to factor into this
game. Obviously Oregon really relies on that. You're guys seemed a little bit
it sounded like they don't really dribble penetrate as much and they were more
focused on stopping Oregon in that aspect. Can you just elaborate on that a
little bit.  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: Well our motion offense, we cut, screen, shoot a lot of
jump shots. We got some guys that can dribble penetrate, DeAndre Adams, one of
our back up guards, Michael Jenkins has gotten really proficient at pulling up
at the foul line after penetrating the perimeter. But Oregon's guys, they
really he are tremendous at it. I think that Brooks and Porter, Bryce Taylor,
even Hairston and Leunen can all dribble penetrate. They can put it on the
floor and the thing that they do so well is if you help, they want to
penetrate and pitch to a wide open 3-point shooter and all five of those guys
mention shoot 40 percent or better from the 3-point line. So it's a very, very
important aspect. We cannot play looking at the backs of Oregon's jerseys. We
need to make sure we're all the time focusing and in front of them and looking
at the front of the jersey.  
  
Q. The players talked about your demeanor as a coach and what you expect out
of them just talk a little bit about what you expect out of your players and
how you approach coaching these guys?  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: Well first of all they're great guys. They're great
young men that allow myself and my staff to coach them. That's a key component
for us because we do try to coach them, we try to develop them, as
individuals, and as a team. And we work hard. There's no doubt about it.
Winthrop is not a program for every one. It's a program for people that want
to achieve and be excellent. Not just really good.  
And we work hard each and every day. When we hit the court, whether it's for
an hour or two hours, we're going to really work hard, we're going to demand
perfection and if you work for perfection, often times you achieve excellence
and that's what we, I thought the play that we ran late in the game when we
went down one, that was perfect.  
It gave us the one point lead back, when we laid it in with basically no
hindrance to the basket. And it got us to the lead back and gave us some
confidence and we were able to go back and win the game after Notre Dame made
their great run.  
  
Q. I've been lucky enough to be with you guys since March 6, when you,
before the selection, and I really noticed that you have a great assistant
coaches. Can you talk a little about those guys.  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: Yeah, they're really just a tremendous staff. I'm very,
very blessed to have Paul Molinari, Earl Grant, and Randy Peele. Randy Peele's
taken a team as ahead coach to this great tournament before. Coach Molinari
was a manager and graduate assistant. So he's been with one of the guys that's
went to the tournament. And then Earl Grant is a young man that I recruited
and have known him since he was in high school and just all three of these
guys have tremendous work ethic, they really develop these young men, not just
on the floor, but off the floor. And they're great examples of how these young
men should try to lead their lives.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how Bradshaw ended up at Winthrop and kind of how you
heard about him or if that and then kind of the way he's playing right now in
particular like the last month or so really coming on. He mentioned there was
an injury earlier in the year he got over a that and what was that injury?  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: Well, first of all, a gentleman by the name of John
Watson, who had played basketball in the United States but is living in New
Zealand, thought that Craig Bradshaw could develop into a good division one
player. And they sent us a videotape and then followed up with an e-mail. And
at that time I was just had gotten a computer and was learning how to work
e-mail. And I got this tape and it talked about this kid being X amount of
centimeters all and X amount of kilograms heavy and I had no idea what that
was. So I got someone that's a lot smarter than me to translate that over to
weight and heights that I could understand. And he happened to be about six
nine, 190. And I popped the tape in after we got it formatted because it came
on a format that would not work in our VCR, so we had to go to Charlotte and
get it reformatted. Once we got that done, I said, you know, if this same kid
that's on this videotape gets off the plane then we have us something special
because he was long, but you could tell that he was athletic, he could dunk
with either hand, he could shoot the three at the international line. And
thank goodness when we went to the airport the same kid that was on the
videotape got off the plane, and as a freshman he averaged two points and two
rebounds, then he goes back to New Zealand after his freshman year, has
opportunities to go pro, after making their Olympic team, and opportunities to
transfer to high major programs. Couple of people had seen him in the Olympics
and gotten to him one way or the other. And asked him to transfer. And we
almost lost him. On both accounts. But he stuck with us, then last year he
played in the World Games, last summer, he's played against Carmelo Anthony
and LeBron James and Yao Ming and those people so nothing phases him, he's
played against the best in the world and this I think what happened of after
the World Games this summer is then we did our 15 day tour of Australia and
New Zealand, and then now that was first, then the World Games, and then he
comes back and I couldn't get him to take time off. He kept working out, he
kept playing pick up ball in the fall. And I think really he got worn down.
And then he strained a muscle in his calf and in the North Carolina game our
second game of the year he dislocated his thumb on his shooting hand and
didn't stop playing. That's how tough he is. And just played through all that
though not well. And he was actually in a little mini slump, and he came to me
and he never does this, but he came to me and he was concerned. He said,
coach, I don't know what's going on or how I can fix it. I said look, you just
do your thing, you keep playing, and his mother came and he played so well in
New Zealand and Australia because his mom and his dad were following us
around. And when his mom came right before the Big South tournament, last
couple of games of the regular season, and then stayed through Senior Night
and the Big South tournament, he dominated. Much like he did yesterday. And
that's because of his mom when she's around, he plays great.  
  
Q. He seems to have a rugby mentality that he's brought to basketball. He
said that that was, that's his passion and his love. Can you comment on
that?  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: He's a tough kid. I don't know if you have seen much
rugby, we watched it life and we watched it on television when we were down
there, this past May, it's a physical game. There's no pads, there's no face
masks, I mean it's rough. And these guys are big and strong and thick calves
and thick thighs and they just maul each other but the bottom line is you got
to be tough to play that game. And he's a tough kid. His dad has his own
landscaping business and his dad's tough. And they're just hard working
people, and he's a combative warrior type kid. He's not afraid of any
situation. I remember as a freshman two guys squared off in practice one day
and one of them was him against our starting center and he's a little thin
kid, but the guy had thrown an elbow and of course we quickly broke it up. But
he did didn't back down. He did not back down as a 195 pound freshman.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that 24 hour period last year when you take the
Charleston job what brought you back and kind of this week with this victory
have you been thinking back to that at all and the decision to come back?  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: I think I made the right decision, as I sit here today
and you know it was a great offer from the College of Charleston. And the
hardest thing I ever had to do as a professional coach is tell that group of
young men that team that I love coaching so much, that I was going to leave
them. Simply because I was going to get a bigger paycheck. And I told them all
that I would love to have them go with me, and it was a very intense anxious
emotional 45 minute meeting that evening before I took the College of
Charleston job. But I went down there and my wife and I decided on the ride
back that it just wasn't the right time. To make that move. And I think that
back now and hope everyone's over it. And can deal with it. Bobby Cremmins had
a great year there. He's a great friend of mine. And we got a lot of friends
there. But as you sit here today I feel good because I did what was in my
heart and stayed with this particular group.  
  
Q. How do you see your two styles, your style and Oregon's style matching up
and maybe on that note or maybe not as far as the 2004 game, does that even
enter your thought at this time or is that so far back that that doesn't
matter?  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: That was an interesting game. We played them pretty
well. It was a single digit game late in the game. I think, I don't know what
we lost by, but I know it was five or six points with a minute or two to go.
And as I recall I we had chances to win. And that was when Brooks was just
coming into his own and he was dynamite that night. And Malik Hairston also
played well. But I just, we looked at the box score from that particular game
and they did play some zone in that game as I recall. So we have got an
essentially the same team that we had out in Oregon.  
And they have added some guys. But I just know that their style, you better
get back in transition. You got to value your possessions and you got to --
I'm not saying we're going to play in the 50's like Miami did they did their
thing and almost won yesterday. That's not our style. We like to get out and
run and press a little bit.  
So I hope it's not in the 80's or 90's, if it is, it's a problem for us. But
if we can keep it in the 60's or low 70's, I think we have a shot.  
  
Q. Can you run down the process last night after you get back from last
night's game, who handled getting the scouting reports started and what the,
what the difficulties are in the short turnaround like this?  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: Well the most important thing is we had already started
on Miami and Oregon. First time in seven trips that we had literally already
broken down film of the next round's opponent. And maybe I shouldn't have been
doing that maybe I should have been doing that all along. But we made sure
when those players came in, we were going over Notre Dame, that they also saw
on the big screens in our hotel meeting room some Miami over here and some
Oregon over here just to send the message that we're looking to get to the
next round and the next round. So Earl Grant already had some all the Pac-10
tournament games, had broken those down. And then last night we watched some
Miami edits. We had a nice a fair with Doctor DiGiorgio, our president, had a
nice dinner and reception for the team and the fans that made the trip. Then
we broke down some film. And then did it again this morning. Went over a paper
scouting report. Did more film. And then had the hour and a half practice that
you're allowed.  
  
Q. I would imagine if I moved to New Zealand it would be a bit of a culture
shock for me and I would think for Craig coming up here it's a culture shock
for him can you talk about the other three guys about how they maybe brought
him in and how Craig's personality kind of meshes with those guys and vice
versa?  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: Well his best friend was the only starter that was not
allowed up here and I wish he had been. Because he's a key component of our
team Phillips Williams, and they're buddies, best friends. Craig Bradshaw, the
last three Thanksgivings prior to this past one, has come to my home for
Thanksgiving dinner. This year he chose to go with Phillip to his home. So
they're almost like brothers. And it's interesting Torrell Martin was on the
podium with me as a Big South preseason Player of the Year. So he had to go to
Charlotte for a meeting this past fall, and he was asked a question about how,
he's a great player, but he also got a great teammate in Craig Bradshaw. Can
you tell me what that's like. And Torrell's response was, well, when Craig
first got here he didn't speak English. And I had to -- but what's interesting
is New Zealand, their native language is English, but Torrell just couldn't
understand him. I mean, he talked so fast and so soft and I had to explain
well that's not exactly the case, they just, there was some language barrier,
but it was more Torrell's English and Craig's English not jiving. But the
bottom line is he's matured beautifully as a young man, physically
emotionally, spiritually, intellectually, he's just come a long way and I know
that he like all of these guys that we're were sitting right here are going to
be successes, because he's a hard worker, he is a very, very respectful young
man and he just, he's a, he's a tremendous person.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you coach.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions now for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. A.J., I wonder if you could talk to me about the similarities and
differences of USC to the team you played yesterday and how you guys plan to
approach the game, whether you're going to do anything differently
offensively, defensively.  
A.J. ABRAMS: Just from watching a little film on them, they're a very athletic
team. They got some four and five men that can go inside and outside. But they
also got some guards that can, that are great shooters.  
So I think we're going to have to do a great job of defending them. But as far
as our game plan, I think we're just going to have to be conscious of their
shooters and just be ready to help down low.  
  
Q. I guess for all you guys, can you talk about first who USC reminds you
of, if anyone you've played, and then what Damion brings with his energy and
his defense.  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: Coach kind of compared them to Kansas. They have a lot of
guards that can play. And push the ball. They also have a post presence. So
we're going to approach them like we're playing Kansas and just contain them
and try to help out as much as we can. As a guard, you know, help the big men
out. We have to help them out.  
KEVIN DURANT: Yeah, coach compared them to Kansas. They're very athletic team,
they get up and down. They got inside and outside guys. Like D.J. said, we
just got to be a group effort. Everybody got to help each other each other one
the defensive end.  
  
Q. What about Damion? What he brings with his athleticism and defense.  
A.J. ABRAMS: Damion brings a great presence for us inside. He blocked some
shots, even though he's kind of outsized sometimes, but he brings great energy
for us on offense and defense. When he gets rebounds, he gets our break going.
And he gets our offensive rebounds which provides us a spark too.  
  
Q. For D.J., just looking at USC last night they looked like they're thick,
maybe as physical a team as y'all have seen all year. Does that compare, did
you see the same thing and is that any concern of yours considering as much as
you penetrate?  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: Yeah, they're a pretty big team and physical and like coach
been telling us, they're going to try to shoot over me and A.J., the smaller
guards, they're going to try to take us down low and try to get some
mismatches and we just got to play hard and just play tough.  
  
Q. Kevin, you move around quite a bit on defense as far as sometimes playing
inside, sometimes playing out side. Where do you like to get the ball? Are you
more comfortable on the wing than say down low?  
KEVIN DURANT: I mean, I'm comfortable wherever I get the ball at. I think that
I would rather stay down low a little bit because if they double team me are,
I could pass out so we can get easy buckets that way and sometimes I can shoot
over the smaller guy, so really it really doesn't matter to me, as long as
we're scoring points as a team and winning, so it really doesn't matter.  
  
Q. For the group, you guys rely on a lot of freshmen and sophomores, USC's
key players are two juniors, a senior, and a 21 year old freshman. Do you feel
like that puts you at a disadvantage at all because they played together a
little bit longer?  
A.J. ABRAMS: I don't think it bothers us, because everybody knows we're a
young team, we're a young team. We haven't let it affect us all year. Pretty
much all year we have been going up against teams that are older than us.  
So we can't, we don't look and say that they have been playing together
longer. The freshmen came in in the summer and we gelled pretty quickly. So I
think we have the team chemistry to be able to play with anybody.  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: We pretty much play with anybody. And the team we played Friday
night, New Mexico State was an older team. So the age really doesn't matter.  
KEVIN DURANT: We have been through so much this year as a team, so I don't
think we see ourselves as freshmen and sophomores, so like they said, we have
been up against a lot of older teams and it's going to be a regular game for
us.  
  
Q. For A.J., coming into the year people kind of looked at you as a spot up
shooter, could you talk about the things that you did to develop the mid range
part of your game and why you think that's important.  
A.J. ABRAMS: Over the summer I talked to coach and coach said I was going to
have to do more than just spot up in the corner or whatever and develop a mid
range game. Which I kind of had that in my game already, just hadn't really
brought it out. But it's important to have a mid range game so you can, so
guys, when the guy's trying to run you out of the 3-point line and you can you
can go in there and find open teammates.  
  
Q. Kevin, do you know much about Taj? What have you seen on him on film, Taj
Gibson and what do you think of him so far?  
KEVIN DURANT: He's a great player. Man, he's an inside/outside player, type
player. He's a very long player, athletic and it's going to be a touch matchup
for us but I think with the help of just the team defense we can try to
contain him a little bit.  
  
Q. A.J., back to that other subject, you seem to be taking maybe a few more
of those mid range shots and drives recently, is it true and are you more
comfortable than you were say earlier in the year?  
A.J. ABRAMS: I won't say I was uncomfortable at the beginning of the year.
Just the game plans are trying to get me off the 3-point line, which I don't
think I have a problem going in there to dribble, pull up, or go to the
basket. So I'm not just going to settle, I'm going to take what the defense
gives me.  
  
Q. As the group, how much difference it makes to have the one game out of
the way and get your second game in this building and the comfort factor?  
KEVIN DURANT: It was good for us, man, but I mean we just want to look at it
as another game. We played in this building before. We know how it is. So we
just got to come out with that fire.  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: It's good for us, but we just got to keep playing every game
like we been playing. Play every game like it's our last. So that's the
mindset we're going to go in with the next game and just try to play hard.  
A.J. ABRAMS: No, just the first game is just probably the toughest game to get
out of is your system. Pretty much everybody on our team's their first NCAA
tournament game. So it was kind of nerve wracking, but I think we handled it
well and I'm happy to get it out of the way and move on.  
  
Q. Who do you guys see as kind of the key guy to shut down for USC, Nick
Young or do you have to look out for a couple of guys?  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: It's pretty much the whole team. They have a great team and a
lot of guards and a lot of big men that can pretty much do everything. So it's
going to be a team effort and we just got to play hard.  
KEVIN DURANT: A team effort with them. Got a lot of depth coming off the bench
and we just got to be a collective effort, everybody helping out each other
out on defense and offense and we'll be good from there.  
  
Q. Kevin, what do you expect from USC in terms of trying to guard you? Do
you expect a lot of double teams?  
KEVIN DURANT: I really wouldn't know. From what coach has said they might
double when I get in the post and they might face guard, but I mean I've been
through so much this year with the defense, so I don't think it will be
nothing I couldn't, I ain't seen before. But it's always tough playing against
those type of defenses, but my teammates do a great job of helping me out.  
  
Q. Kevin, would you talk about the value of the two guys to your right and
what you guys look for from them game after game.  
KEVIN DURANT: Every game we been in so far they have come out the gate strong.
Whether it's on the defensive end or offensive end and they sparked us up. And
they come out with energy every game and we just follow them from there.
That's been great for our team and it always helps.  
  
Q. A.J., coach was talking about the clips from movies that he shows you
guys, I guess Chappelle Show was on a couple of days ago. What any other funny
moments from this trip?  
A.J. ABRAMS: I mean there's a -- just like hanging around there's a lot of
funny moments, but as far as watching film or anything, I think that the Dave
Chappelle one it has to be the funniest one that we all got a kick out of that
one.  
KEVIN DURANT: I would have to disagree, man, we watched Coach Todd's high
school tape and that was pretty funny. It kind of loosened us up a little bit.
We were all tense before that but when we watched that that was pretty funny.  
  
Q. When was that?  
KEVIN DURANT: I think it was Wednesday? Thursday. Thursday we watched it. It
was funny, man.  
THE MODERATOR: Do you have a favorite, D.J?  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: I'm going to go with Kevin on that one. Coach Todd's high
school team. It was funny. He tried to show us how hard he played when he was
playing and he was crazy.  
  
Q. Is that something that's a trademark with your coach, just trying to get
you guys to have fun and relax when you go out therefore games like
tomorrow?  
KEVIN DURANT: I would say so. Coach always joking with us, man, and I remember
one time we played Kansas in the Big-12 Championship and we were in the huddle
I think it was about 35 seconds left and he just came out with a joke and made
us laugh and that we kind of loosened up after that. So I think he always does
that.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thanks, gentlemen, we'll get Coach Barnes up next. Okay.
Questions for the coach.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could talk about the athleticism of USC now that
you've had a chance to see some film on them and what you know about them.  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, they're a very, very explosive offensive team. I
think you look at again I do know they led the Pac-10 with field goal
percentage defense, which is really the probably the real indicator of how
good a team is. They don't give you many easy baskets. Then on the other end,
offensively I think they do a great job of getting their isolation set up that
they want to attack you with. And they shoot the ball and they lead the Pac-10
with that too. 3-point shooting. But they don't take that many of them. They
are athletic and I would imagine that they're looking at their athleticism,
their guards being bigger than ours, that they can try to get them in some
areas where they could get over top of us and it will take a great team effort
for us defensively to try to combat some of that.  
  
Q. Have teams at times overcommitted to Kevin Durant and has that helped to
open up other players?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well I do think people put a real focus on Kevin. But they
also do it most of the focus is Kevin or A.J.. those are the two guys that
people seem to really focus on. They look to get more help away from Justin
Mason or any one in that position and the other post position.  
But again, I think teams do what they have to do, what they feel they need to
do because we're going to certainly at times play through him, other times we
really don't. People would probably be surprised how often we don't. But
because of his feel, he gets the ball because of the way he -- really
yesterday he didn't move as well without the ball as he had been. He was still
on the perimeter more than he had been. Then when we do call some sets for
him, obviously people know what's coming. It's pretty simple what we do with
him. And then it's up to him to read how people play him and they're going to
double team him he'll look to pass out of it. But yesterday the way he was
being played we felt like we needed to get him away from the basket and let
him drive and get to the foul line and he did a great job doing that.  
  
Q. I don't know if did you coach against Tim Floyd. Was he at Iowa State?  
COACH RICK BARNES: No, he had already left.  
  
Q. Have you ever coached against him and how would you evaluate him as a
coach?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Tim's excellent. I think when you -- what you respect about
him is his teams are very, very, very sound fundamentally. They transition
defense, I know that's a big thing with them. They don't want to give up many
easy baskets. Defensively they will give you some different looks. I think
he's a kind of coach that will not only play your players, he'll play
personnel. He'll, I'm sure at some point in time tomorrow they're going to ply
triangle two. Whether they put it on A.J. and Kevin or D.J. and Kevin or
whatever combination they decide to go with he's going to do what he thinks he
has to do to win a game. And I like the fact that coaches do that.  
I think he takes his players and you watched his teams over the years, he
coaches according to his personnel. Which I think is a sign of a great coach.  
  
Q. Nick Young is so versatile and can hit outside, he was posting up a bit
yesterday, have you decided on a defensive plan for him if there is one?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I think it's going to have to be a team effort with whoever
and however we matchup. We know we're going to have to really work hard
staying in front of the ball. We do know they will look to post, because of
our size, they will look to do a little bit of that. But it's not going to be
one guy, we're going to have to have a great team defensive effort to be
successful against these guys.  
  
Q. What will you do offensively? Anything different than what you did
against New Mexico State?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I hope we do a lot differently. I didn't think that we were
very good on offense. We went back and when we looked at the tape we just put
too much on D.J. Augustin. He was carrying the load in terms of really getting
us started and when he would get down the floor guys were really too slow
getting into our action. We didn't move the way we needed to. So I would
expect us to come out, we want to play fast, we have always wanted to do that,
but we need to, once we get into the half court, have a little bit better flow
with our offense. And I'll be surprised if we don't do that.  
  
Q. Obviously Tim's just getting started at USC. How do you think he's done
in two years and do you think he can win really big in basketball at a
football school?  
COACH RICK BARNES: He already is. He's one game away from a Sweet 16. He's,
right now, I think the teams that are left playing are obviously good enough
to beat anybody on a given night. I think that again what I know about Tim I'm
sure that just like my situation at Texas, I'm sure he feels that football
does nothing but enhance his program. The exposure that they generate
football, just like ours, again, and you start winning, people want to be a
part of it.  
There's no doubt in my mind that with their new arena, I think that's what
they probably needed there for a long time. They got a guy that knows what
he's doing. He understands this business and there's no doubt that they're a
major factor in college basketball right now.  
  
Q. Some people say that it's hard to expect a deep tournament run from
freshmen-laden teams. What have you seen with your players that makes you
think they have the poise and maturity to go real far in this tournament?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I think a little bit yesterday and as much as coaches you
don't want to ever admit that your team's come in and maybe this tournament
can freeze you a little bit. Especially if you never been in it. As much as
you don't want to own up to that sometimes, I don't think that there's any
question that but we were hit by that a little bit yesterday.  
I would be surprised if we don't come out and play better tomorrow. In terms
of the way we want to execute anyway and, but again, I don't know, this time
of year, if it matters. I think teams get on a roll and again we have played
enough basketball now that I would like to think that we're not that young any
more. Because we have had some guys that have played almost every minute of
every game. But we don't talk about it. We just know what we have got a game
in front of us right now, we believe that if we can play as well as we can
play, that we'll have a chance every night we go out.  
  
Q. Your players have talked about how you like to keep things loose, showing
some movie clips, could you tell us a little bit about that technique and why
it's part of your philosophy?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, what it is, it's just positive reinforcement. We do
show some things just to try to get the point across different ways. I think
that sometimes I run out of things to say myself. Sometimes I need to do it
for my own purposes, and so if we come up with some things that we like and
there's always something that you can hang your hat on. More than anything we
even if we have a little bit of a clip of something, we always go right into
positive things that we do in the way we want to play. Because we want to put
that right in our minds. And we do, do that right before we go out the last
time and something we started this year but we have always used these tapes
and some of them work, some of them don't. But I think our guys like it. I do
like it. I think that they look forward to from game to game the different
things that our staff puts together for them.  
  
Q. They talked a lot about the Dave Chappelle tape. Is that something that
you knew on your own or did you need a little help?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I didn't know that. I knew nothing about that. When I saw
that it was really kind of funny. And it was really funny. But I guess they
had seen it. But I had never seen that the whole clip of it. We had used a
certain part of it where he says, "Shoot it." You know. And things like that.
But to see the whole thing together was pretty funny.  
  
Q. Do you see much NBA influence in Tim's coaching style at USC and the
second part of that is why do you think college coaches aren't more successful
in the NBA later?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, yeah, I think I actually have spoken to Tim once, we
have a manager on our staff that Tim called and recommended to us that he's
real close with his father and knew him when he was in Chicago and Tim and I
spoke one day and we talked a little bit about, you know, some things that he
liked up there.  
So I do think that, yeah, I think that when you coach in that league you're
going to pick up some of the isolations, probably the ball screen actions that
happen. But I think that to be successful at that level it all goes back to a
lot of things, but one of them is what kind of team do you get involved with.
I think if you put Tim Floyd in a situation unlike what he had in Chicago
where they were totally rebuilding there's no doubt in my mind he would be
highly successful. That's what it's about. We know that talent is the common
denominator of all great teams. But most college coaches when they get those
opportunities, there's not always with a great franchise to start with. And
what, the average lifespan of a coach I think in that league is, what, about
17 months? So that's pretty tough. If you don't get in a situation where you
can get going pretty quickly.  
  
Q. Is that appealing to you? That lifespan?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Maybe 10 million dollars and hope you get fired. You know.  
(Laughter.) That's appealing, you know.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, Coach Barnes.  
COACH RICK BARNES: Okay. Thank you.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll go ahead and get started with Coach Theus
making an opening statement. And then we have Elijah Ingram, Marin Iti, Justin
Hawkins. Coach?  
COACH REGGIE THEUS: Well, I really thought that we, our game plan worked. We
had the tempo in our favor. I thought that we made them play the style of
basketball that we wanted to play.  
They're a great basketball team. A couple of great players out there.  
We're really extremely proud of my team I am. I can't even begin to tell you.
When we went up with the about six minutes or so left in the game, all I told
our guys is that we would have a chance if we out rebounded them, and played
harder than they did, we would have our chance.  
There's not much you can say that, they were phenomenal from the free throw
line. Every time we made a run it seemed like they were going to the line. And
I thought the refs did a great job tonight, but when you look at 26 free
throws and 12, it's not much you can do about that. Especially when they only
missed one of them.  
THE MODERATOR: Question for student-athletes?  
  
Q. What were you guys able to be do effectively to get back into the game
and then those last four or five minutes were you guys a little bit tired at
all?  
COACH REGGIE THEUS: No, I thought the energy level picked up. I thought that
all of a sudden that they realized that the way we were going to get in this
and have a chance is to really turn them over and to pressure them. I thought
the energy level was just very strong at that point. And I had I think Hawk
and Tyrone were out of the game at that point. So it was just a team out there
that brought energy into the game and gave us a chance to get back in it.
Because I think we were down pretty heavy at that point and it was nothing
there was no gimmick about that, because we were going to press them the
entire game. We were going to use multiple presses and really try to take
Augustin at least take him out of the open court game. That's what we were
trying to do.  
ELIJAH INGRAM: Oh, you know, just played, we started playing real hard. And we
picked up the defensive intensity. And that's pretty much what started it.  
  
Q. Justin, could you talk about the fact that 25 threes, that's not too
characteristic of this team. Did they force by backing the defense, did they
force you guys to shoot more long jump percent than you would have liked?  
JUSTIN HAWKINS: No, I don't think so. I think we took good shots today. Some
of them came at the end of the game when we were trying to cut the lead a
little bit. But I don't really think that the way they played defense really
changed the way we played our game.  
COACH REGGIE THEUS: I thought they packed it in quite a bit. When you pack it
in, what that tells you is is they're trying to stop our big guys from getting
involved. And when you have lying on the floor and Ted Knauber I think those
two guys shoot threes just as well as anyone. I only thought maybe there was a
couple that were not warranted. Pretty much the rest of them came in the flow
of the game.  
  
Q. This is for Martin and Justin. With about five minute to go you were up a
point. Did you guys think this was yours?  
JUSTIN HAWKINS: Yeah, definitely. I mean we felt like that the momentum was in
our favor. We had it going.  
But then like coach said, I mean, it seemed like every time we got a run, you
know, there was a foul or something and they were making their free throws. So
that kind of kept them in the game.  
MARTIN ITI: Yes, same as what Justin said. We made a run and they hit free
throws down the stretch. So that was the difference in the game.  
  
Q. Justin, just didn't seem like offensively you ever got many looks, did
you ever feel like you were in the flow offensively?  
JUSTIN HAWKINS: I think that they did a good job of bringing guys around me
when I caught the ball. So I was just, I didn't want to force anything, and
just try to throw up shots at the rim.  
So I tried to kick it out and I think that's why Elijah and Ted were able to
get some looks because the ball, you know, eventually found its way to them
and they got shots up so I think that's, I think we they had a pretty good
game plan of trying to stop me.  
  
Q. Justin, can you talk about the defensive plan against did your rant. What
you felt worked what you felt didn't work.  
JUSTIN HAWKINS: Well, I mean I think we did a good job as far as just not
letting him be comfortable. He really, I think he worked for the field goals
that he did make, I think he worked for them. He didn't get any really just
open looks. But we got a lot of touch fouls and stuff on him just pushing him
holding him a little bit. And he got to the line. And good players or good
scorers they find a way to score. And he got it done.  
  
Q. You guys normally hold the advantage in free throws attempted. That's
been a pattern when you win. More attempt and usually more makes. What
happened tonight that only the 12 attempts? Did you talk about let's try to
get more aggressive, let's try to get to the line maybe match their attempts
or was it just within the flow not possible?  
COACH REGGIE THEUS: Well I thought that there were, I thought there were
opportunities out there for fouls to be called. Taking it inside I mean we
didn't shoot a free throw in the first half. So and of course in saying that
I'm not going to say the referees didn't do a good job because I thought they
did a pretty good job. Especially in terms of communicating their thoughts and
how they were trying to call the game.  
But the truth of the matter is we didn't shoot a free throw in the first half
and we go inside as much as anybody in the country. So it's unfortunate but
it's a little skewed in that way. A little lopsided.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, we'll excuse the three student-athletes and take
questions for coach.  
  
Q. Were you given an explanation on the technical?  
COACH REGGIE THEUS: Not really. I just think that he I think he just really --
he warned me a couple of times. And although I didn't think that it was
warranted, it was enough that if he wanted to call it and that he did. I
really didn't say anything out of line I was just challenging the fact that we
hadn't had a call. And I know that probably more than anything that it was
just sort of in the open.  
These are veteran referees and I would probably say that other than -- without
the language there was no language in there that would have warranted a
technical. It was just the aggressiveness, I guess. But you think we went on a
run right after that, so that was good. That's really what I was looking for.  
  
Q. All by design, right?  
COACH REGGIE THEUS: That's what I was really looking for.  
  
Q. One point game both ways, the last few minutes, breakdown the last five
minutes, what do you think transpired in the last five minutes of the game?  
COACH REGGIE THEUS: Well it's so difficult because and I want to be very
cautious about this, because I don't -- when you have a free throw disparity
like that, and they're not scoring buckets, they're going to the line, you
cannot go without saying that that was a huge part of what was going on.  
And an I can't say that there wasn't just as much contact on the other end.
But if they're not scoring buckets, if they're not getting field goals and
they're going to the line and we're going to the field goals and not getting
to the line you can draw your own conclusion much and that was the really the
last part of the game. We really didn't get a chance to stay in our rhythm
because they kept taking us out of it.  
But again he's a great player, he went to the line 16 times. He made 15. I
don't think for a good portion of the second half he only had one field goal
from the baseline. So without sounding like I'm whining about the calls or
anything like that, it's, you know, you have to draw your own conclusion and
it is what it is.  
  
Q. Nelson's final foul at the end could have gone perhaps the other way and
might have changed the game. How crucial was that and in a larger sense, what
is it about did your rant's game that is so hard to defend against, he seems
to adjust.  
COACH REGGIE THEUS: Well, the answer to the first part of the question is that
yeah, I mean I thought Tyrone, I thought maybe dipped his shoulder, but of
course at that point you're hoping that they don't call it the other way. I
mean he never really got a chance to play tonight. In terms of being in foul
trouble from the beginning of the game.  
Durant is a pro. And pros know how to adjust. There are very few great
offensive players that only have one way to play. And I will tell you from my
own personal experience that when you're able to draw fouls, you will be a
great scorer. And that's his ability is his ability to take you off the
dribble, to get you in the air, to create contact, and of course you know
let's be honest the referees take care of him a little bit and he's earned
that right.  
  
Q. Why has he earned that right? He's a freshman.  
COACH REGGIE THEUS: Well, yeah. Well, I'm old school too, so you know. But
he's a great freshman. He's a different freshman. But he's averaging 28 points
a game. He has the ball in his hand a lot. He's getting a look at the basket
at least every other time down court. And when you have that you create your
own destiny when you have the ball in your hand and you can get guys off their
feet. Of course I think that he at his size, there's always a mismatch. In
terms of size. And he's always going to have a height advantage when he's
playing the three or he's playing the four out on the perimeter. Because you
have to put a guy on him a little bit smaller, maybe a little bit stronger and
quicker.  
  
Q. Can you just kind of bottom line the season and then talk about what the
future holds for this program?  
COACH REGGIE THEUS: Well, the bottom line is that we had not made the NCAA's
since '99. And our guys worked extremely hard to get here.  
We were injured early. We would have been in a situation more than likely with
a much better opportunity seed-wise had we had a few more wins. But in the
beginning of the season we were, we had two of my starters weren't even
playing, they missed almost a month of the season.  
When you look at -- if we're bottom lining it, it's the growth of the program,
the growth of the city, the enthusiasm level that we have created and we have
created and turned this program around with my seniors and the guys I've got
coming in. Or I had had coming in. I'm just real proud of everything that
encompasses our season. From our fan perspective, from our administration, and
really more than anything, I took a team and a team that had only two guys
that ever went to the NCAA's on it and I promised them if they worked hard and
they got after it, and they learned the integral things about winning
basketball games and we lost that game to Nevada but we played I thought
really hard, we played very well. And I told them if they took that emotion
and that focus into our tournament, that we would win our tournament. And they
got it done. And I'm very, very proud of this team from the team losing and
only winning six games a couple of years ago to now 25.  
  
Q. These four seniors, recruiting-wise, you're losing four seniors, what do
you look to go to from here?  
COACH REGGIE THEUS: Things are good, things are very good. I'm very proud and
happy about what we have got coming in. We have got one scholarship left. And
I think that the guys that we're bringing in will bring energy. You think that
we have addressed a lack of shooting on the team. We still are going to have
size and it's crazy as it may sound its going to be the first time that we
have had 13 scholarships. We started off with nine, we only had 11 this year.
And we're deep with 11. So I can't even imagine having a full 13.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH REGGIE THEUS: Guys, thank you very much. Appreciate it.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:

### [Taj Gibson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17109)

### [Nick Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17101)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have the USC student-athletes and coach Tim Floyd. From the
left we have Taj Gibson and Nick Young. We'll start with an opening statement
from Coach Floyd. Coach?  
COACH TIM FLOYD: Well, we played a very good Arkansas team. And I know our
guys were concerned, they watched a lot of film this week. Games like against
Kentucky and Vanderbilt games. At Florida, where he this played them to seven.
And we had a lot of respect for them coming in.  
I think our guys were disappointed with their performance against Oregon the
last time we played. It's as good a defense as we played this year. I thought
we were very solid on that end. I thought that every guy, I thought that the
job that Nick did on Weems was important. I thought the job that Lodrick and
Daniel did on Beverley was important. I think Taj having an understanding of
who those guys were, Beverley and Weems and Ervin and him providing help along
with Cromwell and Wilkinson was important. I thought the job that we did on
the defense board was what we were most concerned with. We did great there.
And played very unselfish offensively.  
THE MODERATOR: Open it up for questions for student-athletes.  
  
Q. Guys talked a lot about their size and maybe how that was an advantage
and yet you out rebounded them by 13. Can you just address that?  
NICK YOUNG: We just working hard. It's tournament time we went out there and
tried to give it our all. We were a little disappointed how the things went in
the finals against Oregon so everybody just came out there and fought tonight.  
TAJ GIBSON: Coach stressed to us if we want to win this game we have to play
defense and get all the rebounds. As many rebounds as we can. On the defensive
end.  
We just came out real hungry because we let a lot of our fans down in our
hometown in the championship game at the Staples Center. So I had to bring it.
It's one loss and you're out.  
  
Q. Were you guys aware that no five seed had lost before this game and that
usually one loses a year. Were you worried about that a little bit?  
NICK YOUNG: We have been hearing that all week. About how 12 seeds always beat
the five seeds. But we didn't try to pay no attention. We just went out there
and if we win or lose, keep our heads up. And we went out there and tried our
best.  
TAJ GIBSON: Coach just stressed to us that keep the rules of our defense. And
we should be okay. If we come out and play sluggish, then they will, it would
have been an upset. But he did stress this week to just play hard and go let
it out. Because it's one loss and you're out. And it's the NCAA tournament and
the winner goes on, loser doesn't go on, loser goes home and watches on TV.  
  
Q. Taj, a lot was made about the size like you said, but points didn't come
really easy for you today. Were you surprised at how easy it was?  
TAJ GIBSON: Not really. I was worried about getting my teammates open. It was
not about one person, it was all about getting my teammates involved and if
they get open shots and the shots go down, that's just happy with me because
we just want to make it to and keep producing each round because each team is
good and another one come out it never comes down to any individual. We try to
play as a team. The more we play as a team the better we'll be.  
  
Q. How much was Ryan in your guys thoughts tonight and when did you get a
chance to talk to his mother?  
NICK YOUNG: He's been on our minds all year. This is a great thing for us to
go out there and do this year. And in honor for him. He's a great person, he's
always will be remembered by all of us. And we miss him. So we just went out
there and fighting and using him as our sixth man every game.  
TAJ GIBSON: Just thinking about him. Thinking about if we had him, would they
have even gotten that many points. Because he's right now if he was here, I
don't think any guard would get it past half court.  
  
Q. Did you guys watch any of the Texas game and what are your initial
thoughts just on Sunday?  
NICK YOUNG: They're a powerhouse program. They're a great team. Got a lot of
great players. They run and gun. So we just got to go out there and play our
best and try to get some key matchups.  
TAJ GIBSON: It's going to be a hard fought game. We got a lot of respect for
those guys over there. And just have to do our homework and prepare for the
next game.  
  
Q. Taj, have you got a chance to even now to think about Durant and inside
and what that's going to be. You can see Nick is already laughing knowing that
was coming?  
TAJ GIBSON: I think about his presence and then I think it's not just one guy,
it's other guys on the team. Like Augustin and Abrams. So in the back of my
head it's I'll be thinking about him, but we know that that's a whole unit.
There's other guys that play just as well as him. So we have to do our
homework and just think about the game.  
  
Q. Coach, how strong do you think the team's composure was first tournament
game for all of them.  
COACH TIM FLOYD: Really pleased. When you go in with a group that hasn't been
there before you have no idea what's going to happen. And first six minutes of
the game very concerned. And you look back on it, they had us down and five or
six down and we were trying to find ourselves. Maybe a little tight.  
This experience should help us on Saturday. These guys played to win. They
didn't play with any agendas in mind. Playing on a national stage, playing big
games. They have done that in our conference. I think playing in our league
helps us for games like this.  
We were very pleased with them. I thought their unselfishness and their
commitment to helping each other defensively and commitment to getting five
guys on the glass was the real key.  
  
Q. Taj, this is kind of a follow-up on the earlier question, but obviously
everybody knows Kevin Durant. You're kind of the same height, same body style,
did you ever stop and think this year any time like how you might matchup with
him or?  
COACH TIM FLOYD: He might not be matched up with him. We may have somebody
else on him.  
TAJ GIBSON: Like coach said, we're just trying to play as a team. Whatever
coach says, goes. So if that chance comes, it doesn't really matter. Just as
long as we get the W and we're just going to play as a team because it takes
five.  
NICK YOUNG: W.  
  
Q. Coming off the Pac-10 game, championship against Oregon, did you guys
feel like this was a statement game you needed to make? In this first round?  
TAJ GIBSON: Not really. Coach stressed to us that game's behind us. It's NCAA
time, one loss and you go home. And he just kept stressing it's to us all week
we're just going to adjust and do our homework and get over that game. Make up
our mistakes, and come out and play hard defense. Because that team that we
just played is a good team. They will probably beat a lot of top seeds in this
tournament.  
NICK YOUNG: Just been watching film all week and just getting ready. We try
not to put so much pressure on ourselves after that game. Wasn't trying to go
out there and do too much. Just went out there and just gave it our all tried
to play as a team as much as we can and try to get a W.  
  
Q. Nick, you've been wanting to play in the tournament for so long how is
does it feel to get that furs one and advance?  
NICK YOUNG: It feels great. I was out there a little nervous in the beginning,
because my first time I playing out there in an environment like this and
after like the first five minutes we started getting it going and I started to
get in the zone and things started to flow for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, gentlemen. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. What were your thoughts about the whole 5-12 thing? You were going into
the last people and it hadn't happened since 2000. So did that even cross your
mind?  
COACH TIM FLOYD: No, it really hadn't. I'm telling you you never think along
those terms. Everything was geared towards Arkansas and everyone we talked to
in that league just had so much respect for them. Their talent. They kept
talking about their talent and their length and their size and their ability
to change shots. Their ability to get out and run and the different defenses
they threw at you. And we hadn't really played anybody quite like them in our
league. And that always concerns you. Plus the idea that you're, you got a new
group playing on the stage for the first time. Those were the concerns.  
  
Q. I don't know if you had the chance to watch any Texas tape but what are
your feelings about Durant and how do you go about stopping him, slowing him
down?  
COACH TIM FLOYD: I don't really have a plan for him right now. You start
thinking Texas while you're playing Arkansas then you know we would be on the
charter right now heading home.  
We'll go back and watch some film tonight. We have until 4:45 tomorrow to try
to think about how we're going to go play. We understand that he may be the
best individual who's been in college basketball in many years. But we also
understand that they have four freshmen and one sophomore who grew up in
Big-12 play. And they got better and better and better as the season went on.
They got a great belief system in winning. And they're going to present all
kinds of problems for us. In addition to Kevin. So we'll just have to go on a
few hours sleep tonight and give it some thought and try to come out with a
plan tomorrow.  
  
Q. How much of their cold outside shooting was your defense versus them just
simply not making shots?  
COACH TIM FLOYD: I think our pressure was outstanding tonight. I thought Gabe
Pruitt was great. I thought Lodrick Stewart did a tremendous job on Beverley.
I thought Daniel Hackett was at times the most intense player on the floor. I
thought he just really brought a tremendous amount of energy to this game. I
thought he was outstanding.  
Taj, I'm so proud of him because two months ago he was just worried about
guarding the guy he had and he should have. He's a freshman. But he was he had
a great purpose. He and Sean and Keith too, those three perimeter players, and
I thought we just played well collectively.  
  
Q. What about your thoughts on Ryan? Did he cross your mind tonight?  
COACH TIM FLOYD: Well, you know, his mom was in my hotel room for 20 minutes
this afternoon. We had a good visit. We talk to Paulette all the time. It's
every day. It wasn't because we were in the NCAA tournament, it's every day.
We think about that kid every day. And how much he would enjoy being here.  
  
Q. You were talking about Taj getting better. How much is he ahead of maybe
where you thought he would be at this time?  
COACH TIM FLOYD: Yes, he is. He is just outstanding. We have got three
terrific perimeter players. Really five. Y'all didn't see much of Dwight Lewis
tonight but he started 12 or 13 games. Those kids can all play. But we had
good perimeter play a year ago. He is really helped change this program and
our team.  
We can throw it into him and he's unselfish, he's a great passer out of the
post. He's a guy that can get himself to the line, can finish shots, he's on
the boards he jumps more than one time. He's a multi bounce guy. And he's got
great length. He's changed us rebounding wise. I remember our last game in the
Pac-10 tournament last year was against Leon Poe and Cal, I think they out
rebounded us 20. And we haven't had many of those nights this year.  
  
Q. Was the lack of quite tonight just because Hackett was doing so well on
defense?  
COACH TIM FLOYD: Yeah. And it's quite, if we had thrown him out there chances
are he would have done the same thing that Daniel was doing. We just called
Daniel's name and I just was knocked out by how he played. So there was no
reason to change just to get a guy into the game. I got all the confidence in
the world in Lewis and he knows it. And who knows, he may play 35 minutes
against Texas, it's just how we have done it all year long changing our fifth
starter and our first sub. I think that's why our bench is so good. I think
it's why Hackett has played so well and Wilkinson and Cromwell. And these guys
are growing up. We have three freshmen play a lot of minutes. But it just
wasn't, there wasn't any real reason to make a change just for change's sake.  
  
Q. Now that you can look back a little bit, did that loss to Oregon maybe
help you focus for this game?  
COACH TIM FLOYD: Oh, I don't know. I know that might not have helped the
players, but it helped me understand that we weren't guarding anybody and we
went back and I don't think we shot a ball this week all we did was he defend.
Because we couldn't get back against those guys, we couldn't stay between them
and the basket and we were pretty good in both those areas tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thanks.  
COACH TIM FLOYD: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:
SPOKANE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2007&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+SPOKANE)

  

## March 16, 2007

  

### [Gary Ervin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16937)

### [Stan Heath](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13792)

### [Sonny Weems](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16988)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
STAN HEATH: We faced a very good basketball team today. We really felt that we
had a legitimate chance to maybe get the win today.  
Unfortunately, it just didn't happen that way. They had some matchups that
were very difficult for us to guard. They utilized them very well against us.  
The foul problems early in the first half set us back a little bit, just
trying to be able to guard them with foul situations. Guys with two fouls.  
And we got off to a good lead and I thought that we would keep things going,
but the game changed and ones they got a few runs going, it didn't seem like
we were able to slow them down. But I'm proud of our team, the way we were
able to fight towards the end of the season and we we're excited about being
here. Unfortunately it didn't go our way.  
THE MODERATOR: Now take some questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sonny, just on the inside, what were they doing especially Gibson that
made him so effective?  
SONNY WEEMS: I don't think they did anything different. I think they just came
out with a high intensity level and they wanted it more than we did I think.
They came out to play like it. So I don't think they did anything different.  
  
Q. Was it their defense that really affected your shooting tonight or?
Sonny?  
SONNY WEEMS: I don't think it affected our shooting. We had open shots we just
wasn't able to knock them down and those are shots that we usually make. They
just wasn't falling for us tonight.  
GARY ERVIN: Well, like he said, we started the game off playing good and once
we started missing shots they kind of got on a run and we just didn't knock
down shots that we usually knock down, like he said.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about in the NCAA tournament --  
THE MODERATOR: Let's finish up with the student-athletes first. Did you have
any more questions of them? Okay. Then we'll let the student-athletes go.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about in the NCAA tournament how once you fall behind
even by double digits how difficult it is to try and mount a comeback against
NCAA tournament teams.  
STAN HEATH: Well, everybody who is in the field is good. And everybody is
probably a league champion are a team that finished very high in their league.
And have learned through the season how to get a lead, how to hold on to a
lead, how to hold a team off.  
There's normally at this particular time teams that are very efficient and
very effective. And USC is definitely one of those teams. Their guards, we
knew that coming in that their guards were very good, they know how to play,
they can make shots, they are able to guard you pretty well. And it just
seemed like once they got the lead, it was hard for us to just cut into it.
Either by us not finishing a play or them making a timely shot as we were
maybe scored two or four points in a row.  
But they're definitely a team that has a chance to have success as they
continue on.  
  
Q. What did they do to kind of keep your big men from taking the height
advantage you had hoped that y'all would take?  
STAN HEATH: Well, I think it was two-fold. We probably didn't get it in there
as much as we needed to. But the times we did get it in there we either got it
stripped away or knocked away or we didn't finish the play.  
So it was a two-way street and they did a good job too at times of just
denying fronting and not letting us get it in there. Once we got behind, what
made it difficult to play in that area was trying to play one of my four men
against their guards and their guards having the ability to take us off the
dribble, make some plays.  
Charles Thomas was able to go, that helped us, but he still didn't have maybe
the same mobility that he's had in some games where we played at Vanderbilt,
Mississippi State where we had four guards where he was able to guard those
players more effective than he was tonight.  
  
Q. Also with Stefan was he just pressing because obviously you needed him
tonight with the foul problems and everything.  
STAN HEATH: Well, I think that all of our guys maybe if we would have made one
or two in a row or so and just got a good rhythm going and confidence going,
it would have helped us. There's it's the first time out there for quite a few
of those guys and they're trying so hard. Sometimes when you're trying to hard
you press a little bit. And then the shots that you're used to making they
just don't fall. But we struggled shooting the ball. And this wasn't a good
day to pick to miss shots that we can make.  
  
Q. What did you think of USC's defense overall?  
STAN HEATH: They're a very good defensive team. They got great quickness, they
can pressure the basketball. They can recover. When there's a mistake made or
if they need to get some help and get back.  
Gibson is in person gets a lot more done than maybe what it shows on film. His
ability to guard people, move, and even his offense. Offensively he was able
to do some things I wasn't sure he was able to do. And he was a big factor in
the game, but they're a very good defensive team. I think it was a combination
of us missing some shots that we can make and them being a very good defensive
team.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about mixed feelings of the way you guys ended the
season, getting on that run just to get into the tournament, but then to turn
around and lose the way you did in the first round.  
STAN HEATH: Well, we're disappointed about that. One of our goals was to not
only get into the NCAA tournament, but we wanted to advance. And I felt our
guys were focused, they were practicing very well. I didn't see anything in
preparation terms of not being on this stage and performing at the level we
needed to. Sometimes you have those games where it just doesn't work out and
sometimes you face a good team that makes it difficult for you. I think that's
what happened to us in both areas.  
  
Q. Do you know what comes next as far as your personal situation? Is there
going to be an evaluation, has Coach said anything? Where do y'all stand?  
STAN HEATH: Since I've been here five years, nothing has ever been any
different. Every year we have a season, Coach and I sit down, we talk. And we
make evaluations, he picks my brain, I pick his brain, he gives me his
thoughts and he has never come to me and said, hey, I want to talk to you or
anything, it's always been the same. So I know there's sources and speculation
and people who have all the answers, but the guy who's in charge, my boss, he
hasn't changed from the first day I have been here.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks coach.  
STAN HEATH: All right. Thanks.

### [Bryce Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17097)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and have an opening statement from Coach Kent
and then go to questions for the student-athletes, Aaron Brooks and Bryce
Taylor.  
COACH ERNIE KENT: As I sit here and glance at stats, it was almost an
identical game played by both teams. The number of shots, the 3-pointers made,
the assists, the turnovers. And they're a very difficult team to play against.
That style of play. Very similar to Washington State. But for us we're 17
games now coming down to single digits and we're 13-4 in those games and it
just became a game that we had to grind out and finish off at the end and I
thought we did a good job and went to the matchup zone to get back in the
game. They're a tough basketball team, very well coached, and they should be
proud of themselves for coming out here and battling like that.  
But the key at this level is just to win and move on and I'm proud of these
guys for hitting the free throws, getting the stops. Maarty played great.
Bryce Taylor, two or three big 3's in the second half to close it out.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Aaron, your previous two shots were blocked and then you took it in the
key again. Were you pretty determined to get to the line at that point or had
you put the blocks out of you your mind then?  
AARON BROOKS: Yeah, you got to be a competitor and go in there and try and
make plays. My jumper wasn't falling so I had to get to the paint. You can't
really -- yeah it was a great play, but I figured if I got in there again I
could probably make a play.  
  
Q. Aaron, your opponent seemed to be very patient and very poised today.
Were you at all surprised or worried that they were so close in the final
minute of the game?  
AARON BROOKS: No, like coach said we have been through this before against a
couple teams that we played. We have been in the Pac-10, we had a lot of games
that was close. But the veteran leadership we have on this team helped us pull
it out and that's what we expected. Everybody here in the tournament is here
for a reason. They're a great team and we battled it out and we got the win.
That's all that matters.  
  
Q. Bryce, last week in L.A. the team shot the eyes out of the basket. Today
it was a little struggle. What was the difference?  
BRYCE TAYLOR: The difference was it was just a much more slower paced game. We
didn't get to get up and down as much as we like to and that usually opens up
a lot of open shots for us. But it slowed the game down and also they were
scoring a lot and a lot of the time those shots come off stops for us. So when
they're scoring pretty much it says here 50 percent of the time, so it's tough
for us to get in a rhythm getting up and down and sharing the ball and playing
like we usually do. So you got to give a lot of credit to them for playing
their style and not letting us get up and down.  
  
Q. Ernie, you went with the matchup zone obviously before or after they
scored on four straight possessions, was it simply how come you didn't come
out right out of the gate with that zone?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: I felt like we were a little bit jittery out the gate. Just
a little bit sluggish too. We played so doggone hard last week it's going to
be hard to duplicate that energy early on. I liked the way the matchup zone
gave us a chance to get some energy on the floor. Joevan came on the floor and
we went on a 20-0 run there and got back in the game and got control of the
game. So this team is very versatile. We used the matchup to beat Washington
State and bash Washington, California. Man to man has beaten Arizona and USC.
Both of them saved us today. We were sluggish in the first half. But to shoot
50 percent from the field and the three and a hundred percent from line in the
second half. I thought we did a pretty good job of getting back in the game
and closing out the game. But we knew it was going to be a grind.  
  
Q. For both guys, do you guys feel tight today at all? Did you feel the
pressure of being the number three seed against a team that was seeded so
high?  
BRYCE TAYLOR: I feel like just every team that comes out especially for us
it's our first time here, so it was important for us just to get a good sweat
going and see a couple shots fall. Just to make those pregame or early game
jitters go away.  
So I feel like now we got the our first game out of the way and we have seen
that it's going to be very competitive. So we have to start preparing now for
a Winthrop team that plays a lot different than they played and we feel like
once we get started in the second game it will be a different start for us.  
AARON BROOKS: I think that it was a little bit of pressure. We had a pressure
coming into a lot of games this year. Definitely you don't want it feel it but
it's there. So now that we got this game out of the way I feel we can just
come out and play. I think that this is a good win for us. Next game will be
better.  
  
Q. Did you get a chance guys to watch any of the Winthrop game? Were you in
the Arena watching and if so just your thoughts on those guys?  
AARON BROOKS: I think they're a very athletic team. Great guard play. Veterans
on the team. I think there's a couple they have some of the same people that
we played my freshman year on the team. And they're just a good team all
around. They like to get up and down. Our games kind of match a little bit. So
it will be a funner game, we'll get up-and-down and shoot and play like Oregon
basketball.  
BRYCE TAYLOR: Yeah, just over the course of the year I noticed a couple
players from their team I believe their name is Torrell Martin and Bradshaw. I
saw he had a great game today. So they just looked like they play with a lot
of confidence and they feel like they have something to prove. So we know
they're going to be ready for us on Saturday. Or Sunday.  
  
Q. Was this game not fun? The way they the way you guys had to play it?  
BRYCE TAYLOR: We always have fun playing. But it's just a different style. So
of course we prefer to get up-and-down and be able to run and gun and share
the ball and drive and kick. But at the same time they slowed it down and the
most important thing for us I feel like I'm speaking for everybody, you just
get fun out of getting a win. So we got that first game out of the way now, so
just excited to be playing in another one.  
AARON BROOKS: I agree. Nothing else to say about that. That pretty much sums
it up.  
  
Q. For Aaron, let's talk about those two free throws you nailed at the end
of the game.  
AARON BROOKS: Oh, yeah, well this year I been in the position to shoot the
free throws quite a few times. And it's kind of easier to shoot it when you're
up a little, you know, when you're already up one. And my team got confidence
in me to hit them so it wasn't really that big of a deal to me.  
We played great D after that and we shut them down and we got the rebound and
Maarty hit two big free throws, so we got a lot of people that can shoot the
ball at the end, it just happened to be me.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thanks, gentlemen. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Will your guys performance today cut it against Winthrop?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: I don't think Winthrop plays the way this team played today.
This team made the game tough. Just because again they shortened down the
game, limit your number of possessions, you milk the clock and it was a
learning experience for a couple of these guys being on this stage. They
played defense for 30 seconds and came down the floor and T.P., one, two
dribbles, boom. I said T.P. you got to understand something here, we played
defense for 30, they just played for 2. We need to control the tempo of the
game better.  
So it was almost a learning process at this level on that stage and
everything. But whether or not it will cut it, I don't think Winthrop you can
get into this type of a game. I don't think they're going to play that way and
we're not. So that's hard to say. I would like to think we need to play better
and I would like to be satisfied with getting a game underneath our belt with
a group that's never been here before. Winthrop has been here two or three
times. So we're going to have to play better just in terms of a little bit
more sharper in that game with Winthrop.  
  
Q. How much are you able to use the game two years ago to game plan against
Winthrop? I think you beat them by 15 at your place?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: Well, some of those guys are still there. They are a veteran
ball club right now. That's been to the tournament. And they are playing like
they're on a mission. So we're going to have to up the ante in that ball game
and we're going to have to do that and get ready to play and be in for a
tough, tough ball game. So again, obviously everybody knows what's at stake,
they do and we do. And we got a day off in between to kind of regroup a little
bit and I think this team will play better the second time out having getting
a game underneath their belt now.  
  
Q. You said they were jittery and sluggish, at what point did you realize
that and what can you do when you see something like that?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: Well, the jitters I noticed right off the bat. Just because
they were kind of reacting slow, more slow than what we did last week. Knowing
your opponent and knowing the stage and a lot of energy and everything else.  
The sluggish part came because I thought we didn't do a good job of executing
the game plan of fronting the post and taking the ball out of the hands of the
big guys. We went to the matchup, the matchup gave us a lot of energy, we got
moving. Our feet, we moved our feet, it gave us an opportunity to get them to
miss. It gave us an opportunity to get in transition where we're at our best,
able to run and I thought we calmed down and started playing a lot better.
Once we started getting stops and getting out running transition but the start
of the game, man to man a little nerves, we weren't stopping them, they were
getting easy layups, so the zone really gave us an opportunity to get going on
them and from that point on I thought we had control of the game, even though
they were making runs back and forth at us, we still felt like we were in
control of the game and we were going to win the game coming down the stretch.  
  
Q. Your guys are winning games almost with your defense lately. Are you
comfortable with this situation for Oregon?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: Absolutely. We talked about that today. We heard a lot about
their defense. You got to realize again we held them to 56 points. And we held
USC down, we held Arizona to 50 points. We're a really good defensive team and
Sunday is going to be another big challenge for us defensively. Hopefully with
a chance to open up the offense a little more.  
But defense is the key. You got to set the tone that way and we did not do
that in the first three or four possessions in our man and I thought we did
that on our 20-0 run with our matchup zone.  
  
Q. Two things, one you had so much success with the matchup zone and what
brought you out of it and at the end what defense were you in on Bramos' last
shot? That was Joevan at the top that forced him to shoot over him, right?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: Yes. What brought us out of the matchup zone was number 24.
He hit two or three threes on us. We felt like he was getting away from us a
little bit so we needed to lock him down a little bit from man. We actually
went back to the matchup zone two or three times in the second half and we
just kind of, we wanted to throw it at them to keep them off guard a little
bit.  
We have done a very, very good job winning at Arizona, beating Cal in Eugene,
beating Stanford in Eugene, beating UCLA in Eugene, Georgetown at Georgetown,
and I could probably name about six other teams in that 17 game stretch we had
of winning single digits is going to what we call the switch defense.  
We put the same sized players on the floor. Brooks plays more 6'-5" even those
he's six feet and we switch everything. So it's difficult to run ball screens,
flare screens, get open shots, any pick and rolls we just switch, switch,
switch, especially when a team needs a 3-pointer. And we won a lot of games
with that down the stretch and really surprising teams putting bigger people
on the floor. Josh and Williams and others down there at the tournament. That
came out of our switching defense. So it was a good adjustment on our part and
I thought it really put a lot of pressure on them and it took them out a
little bit further than what they wanted. I think their first option was
coming to the corner and 24 was the next option and Duke did a good job of
getting pressure on him.  
  
Q. I know you the game was already in hand when that last three went in at
the buzzer there. But what were your thoughts, what was the first thing that
went through your mind?  
COACH ERNIE KENT: USC at home when they beat us, scored six points in
something like three seconds and hit a shot like that.  
But really it wasn't necessarily escape, you sit there and say you do have a
big cushion. Obviously it would have been a different situation in a 2-point
game, 3-point game, if it were there a three point game we would have defended
it differently. But having the lead in the game was just a matter of not
letting them throw up a Hail Mary. And we would have done it differently if
the game would have come down to that last shot, we would have defended it
differently. If the game would have come down to that last shot.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.  
COACH ERNIE KENT: Thank you.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Brey and then
questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH MIKE BREY: First of all, Winthrop's very good. And I thought their
experience and their men tonight played like men. Defensively they did a great
job on us. We missed shots, but I think we missed shots because of their
defense. I'm very proud of our team after getting put it on us early in the
second half to comeback and have a chance to win.  
But you got to give Winthrop credit. I thought that their experience and their
men, their pro prospects played like it today.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. In the first half you were up seven points and you got possession of the
ball with a chance to stretch the lead, where did this one slip away, where
did Winthrop, how did Winthrop kind of seize the lead from you guys and put
you in the big hole that you found yourselves in?  
TORY JACKSON: I felt like they stepped up on defense. They kind of got up
under us a little bit and we kind of got frustrated.  
From there on it kind of went down hill. And we bounced back, but it was kind
of too late.  
LUKE HARANGODY: I'm just like Tory said, they really picked it up on the
defensive end and I think we had some let downs getting back on defense. We
were kind of flat there.  
ROB KURZ: I think that towards the end of the half they had a couple big plays
where they hit a couple of threes, and then just to start the second half I
don't think that we played defense like we should have. They got off to a
quick run. Got out to I think a 18 point lead and then it was too late for us
to -- we did a good job fighting, getting back in the game, but in the end
they were too tough. They played great.  
  
Q. Tory, if you could describe the run that you guys made to come back in
the game and take the lead?  
COACH MIKE BREY: Your emotions and during the run and then before. Because
Mike took out you and Russ right before that and when you came back in you
made that run.  
TORY JACKSON: I was -- I felt like that me and Russ had to get back in, I felt
like we had to be, have a lot of energy when we came back. And we felt like we
had to be the ones to start it up a little bit. When we came back in we talked
to the rest of the players that was in there, Luke Harangody and Rob and Colin
and we talked to them and just we, we know, I mean we got here because we
earned it. So we're not going to blow it, you know, like the way we played in
the beginning.  
So we just fought back and just put our heart on the line. It really showed.
And it paid off.  
  
Q. Luke, were they doing anything special inside? You kind of struggled
early and well struggled really the whole game. Did they do anything special
that will to stop you?  
LUKE HARANGODY: Both their post defenders are, they really got into me and
tried to push me off the block and they kind of took me out of position. I
think that had a little bit to do with it. But I never could really get into
the flow of the game.  
  
Q. Did they do anything to surprise you?  
Rob KURZ: I don't think they did anything that we weren't prepared for. We
knew coming into the game that they were a really tough team. And had a lot of
experienced guys. So I don't think that it was necessarily anything they did
or any adjustments they made, they just played really tough all game long and
they made some key plays and some clutch shots and so I don't think it was
necessarily anything they did in their game plan.  
LUKE HARANGODY: Yeah, we scouted them the whole week and we knew their game
plan. They just came out and I think that they played well of the they had a
good flow to them and hit some big shots like Rob said before. I think they
played like a veteran team like they are.  
TORY JACKSON: We were prepared for them. They just executed very well. They
came out with a win.  
  
Q. I know it might be difficult now, but all of you guys are coming back
next year. What does an experience like this do for the future?  
TORY JACKSON: This gives us the momentum going into next year. I'm very
excited to play with these guys again. It's going to be very -- this had team
is going to be nice. We're going to make a lot of noise next year. So I'm just
happy about this.  
LUKE HARANGODY: I think this is for the summer and work outs leading up to
next season is going to be a lot of motivation. I think we're all going to
remember this like coach said, look around because we want to be back here
next year.  
Rob KURZ: I think that even though this game was disappointing for us it was
our goal ever since last season to get back to the NCAA tournament. I think
it's definitely something to build on. We have Kyle coming back and these two
guys next to me and we feel Luke we have a lot of talent. We know we're going
to work hard all summer and hopefully put ourselves in a position to win a
first round tournament game next year.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions now for Coach Brey.  
  
Q. 3-point shooting tonight's really been your thing all year and you guys
have struggled. What did you see?  
COACH MIKE BREY: Well, I think in the first half we got some pretty good
looks. Especially Colin. And we'll live with that. I do think that they
defended those guys pretty well though overall. They took away the 3-point
line. And that's why in the second half we had a little more success with both
of them just driving the basketball.  
We probably could have done a little more of that in the first half. We talked
about that.  
But Colin got some good looks, that's how we play. You can't change it all of
a sudden. But I give their defense a lot of credit. They were quick. They
react quickly defensively.  
  
Q. Rob ended up with three first half fouls and Carter had a couple. Can you
kind of talk about how foul trouble factored into this contest at all?  
COACH MIKE BREY: Yeah, both teams were banging on each other early. One of the
things that we have done with our front line always is told them to play and
not worry about foul trouble. We use our depth and rotate those four guys. I
felt we had to have Rob in the basketball game and because we were losing the
handle of it a little bit at the end of the half. But we have just not really
reacted to foul trouble on the front line as much because of our depth on the
front line. We're a little smarter try to be a little smarter on the
perimeter, especially with the starting perimeter. Because we, it's a drop off
when those one of those guys comes out.  
  
Q. In having to respond to the adversity there when they were on that 37-10
run, was it something where it hit so fast your guys were a little shell
shocked at what was happening?  
COACH MIKE BREY: I thought the end of the first half and then the beginning of
the second half we were back on our heels. They really executed in the half
court. We didn't do a very good job of Bradshaw on him, when they were
building the lead. And we were a little demoralized. We were a little knocked
back. We looked young, they looked old. They looked like the men, we looked
like the younger group, the first five minutes of the half.  
Once we were able to press and change the climate, our energy level got going
again and we had our chances. We had an opportunity to win the game.  
You wouldn't have thought that -- I told our guys in the huddle, I said, when
we were down 20, I said, CBS has left this game. Let's make them come back to
it. And I think that they did. And we made a run at it. So I'm proud of our
kids. I would hope that how we ended the game as I told them, is some momentum
into next year with our young guys. Just playing with a lot of energy and
going for it.  
  
Q. I think you during the first half you had a seven point lead and I think
you made 10 of 12 stops in succession and but yet you didn't really stretch
out that lead. Was that a kind of an important factor?  
COACH MIKE BREY: Well, I think so. I said to our assistants at half time, what
did we have 28 at half time? That's low for us. We're a team that gets that
thing up to high 70's or '80's. When you're at 28 I said we need one of those
50 point halves. Maybe 45. We weren't really able to get that. And I think
that you got to give their defense overall credit. I thought in the midst of
that run in the first half when we were defending we shot it a little quick.
We were so excited.  
But I wanted us going for it. I didn't want us over thinking it and our
shooters have been guys to kind of let it go and let it rip and play with a
free mind.  
  
Q. You used your bench a lot, was that just because of the foul trouble or
were you looking at something else there?  
COACH MIKE BREY: Well, I've gone to bench therapy, you know, over the last
couple years, I've been in that, use your bench, use your depth. Use your
depth.  
We needed -- yeah, I thought that Harangody tweaked an ankle early in the
game. So I, but Hillesland has been practicing well, and I thought that we
needed him a smaller matchup. Their big guys are out on the perimeter. Zach
gave us good minutes off the bench. Zeller gave us good minutes. I thought
Jonathan gave us good minutes and that's something to build on for next year.
So we played pretty deep this year. That's been an advantage for us. And
certainly in the second half we had to play some different guys.  
  
Q. The full court press got you basically back into this game, you got
within three and you stuck with it. Can you talk about that a little bit why
you stuck with the press?  
COACH MIKE BREY: Well, a game is fragile and it's long and it has many swings.
And that was a great example of it. I think it was 10-3 them, 13-10 us. We're
up. They finish the half. They punch us in the face hard in the second half. I
mean, it's it was a great, it was an entertaining basketball game and at the
time out when we were really down, I said, we got nothing to lose, we're
picking up full court, trapping, and going for it. And we did a good job
reacting to that.  
I've been on the other side of a 20 point lead with 17 minutes to go. That's a
lot of basketball still to play. And sometimes you can't play as free as you
did building it. And that happened a little bit.  
We wanted to put them on the foul line. Because we felt that their percentages
said make them make free throws. We gave ourselves a chance. I'm, you know,
I'm very proud, but I told our guys out there, maybe we'll have to press more
next year. The way that looked.  
  
Q. You talked about playing loosely and freely, was that where you wanted it
today?  
COACH MIKE BREY: Yeah, I mean I think we came out ready to go. We were
running. I liked we were going in transition. Again, I thought we got some
good looks early that didn't go down. And when you're playing loosely and
freely, sometimes you shoot it a little fast. That could help you, that can
hurt you. It bit us a little bit at times in the first half. Especially when
we were up seven. But you can't ratchet it back and you can't have guys with
free minds all of a sudden a little tight. I thought overall it would play its
way back around for us.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.  
COACH MIKE BREY: Thanks.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get an opening statement from Coach Coles
and then we'll have questions for the players today, Tim Pollitz, Michael
Bramos and Nathan Peavy so start us off, coach.  
COACH CHARLIE COLES: Well, we're officially out of the tournament now. I
thought that the game was -- that we played a good ball game. I thought it was
a good ball game.  
We came out on the short end of it, and I thought it was a game that we had a
chance to win at different times. And definitely I thought that the last five,
six minutes of the game we had enough energy, had we made a few more plays,
that maybe we could have came out victorious.  
Brooks made, stepped up to the plate and made some plays for them. Then the
rest of their guys did a real good job. So it was a game that we, I kind of
felt coming into the game that we were going to be okay. I was checking things
out and everybody was -- I timed them in -- I, you couldn't time them in the
hundred, everybody's talking about their great speed, and I got my stop watch
out and I can only time them what, how long is the basketball court? How long
is it? And I didn't see any Jesse Owens' and I thought, boy, if Jesse is not
there, then we ought to be able to keep up with them a little bit.  
And so we did. And so I think that they played more of our game than we played
more of their game. And so when that happens, you got a shot at it. But I give
them credit, good ball club. A good leadership from their players. Great,
great gentlemen on the court. This was one of the better games that I think
I've coached in in terms of ref'ing the opposing player, players, and our
players and their coaches. I mean, it was almost like, hey, guys, how y'all
doing. And so I had no complaints, none whatsoever. I thought that the
officials were phenomenal. They stayed out of the way, they made great calls.
And, hey, we just came up short. And we're -- you but we appreciate the
opportunity to be here. We really, really do.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Nathan, this is your last game, I just wonder how you feel. You guys won
on a shot, a last second shot to hit here and then you hit a shot that could
have taken it to overtime today. Just what are you really feeling right now?  
NATHAN PEAVY: Being the last game as a senior, you know, it hurts. It's bitter
sweet. Knowing that I won't be able to be with my teammates any more. So it's
just a feeling that I thought we had a very good season, happy for that, we
played very well as a team today. And that's what it's best been the case this
whole season and I'm just going to truly miss all my teammates and the program
and everybody that was involved with us. And it's just, I thought we played a
good game and that's all I have to say.  
  
Q. Their coach said that they were nervous and jittery out of the gate, did
you guys get a sense at all that that was going on or did you feel more
frustration from them?  
MICHAEL BRAMOS: Well, I thought they came out man-to-man and I thought we
executed our offense very well. I don't know if they were jittery, but I think
that our execution was just that good in the beginning with the man offense.
And I think after that I don't know if it woke them up, but they went into
their zone and they started playing a little better. So I don't know if --
they might have been a little jittery but I think it has to do with a little
but bit of us on our offensive execution too. So that's all.  
TIM POLLITZ: I don't know if they were jittery, I just think we came out real
strong and from the start, because they started, they played man-to-man at the
start. Then once they put in that zone we kind of, they started to sink down
and kind of get some steals here and there and they started to play their type
of game. But I just thought it was a good game overall. Hats off to the Oregon
because they came down the stretch and in the second half and made a couple
more plays than we did. But that's all right though.  
NATHAN PEAVY: No, I really think they weren't that jittery. We came out to a
good start and I think that them going to the zone kind of slowed us down a
little bit. Then our turnovers kind of got them going. In that first half. But
overall you think that we gave them a good run and we just had to make a
couple more big plays at the end to beat them.  
  
Q. You guys talked yesterday about how you had seen, you had played teams
similar to this but none as fast as these guy, actually playing against them
were they as fast as you thought or not?  
TIM POLLITZ: I don't really know. They were being hyped up as being such a
fast team and I wouldn't -- I'm in the trying to compare them, but like you
compare them to like Toledo or anything, I don't know if they were that much
faster than Toledo. At least tonight I don't think they were that much faster
than like a Toledo ball club. Because they're very fast too.  
But nothing taken away against them. Obviously there's games that they're more
faster on the fast break than other games. So it all depends upon who you're
playing against. And obviously when you play against us, we're trying to get
back on transition defense a lot. So that obviously counteracts what they're
trying to do on offense. So makes it look real slow. So I think that's kind of
how it played out.  
NATHAN PEAVY: I was just going to say they were quick, but I think our
schedule prepared us enough for, there's a lot of quick basketball players out
there in our league and it prepared us for it. I, you wouldn't -- they're a
quick team, but I wouldn't say they were overwhelmingly quick. We were out
there, we got back on defense. I don't think you saw too many fast break
opportunities for them. We just got back and they got back and I think that it
just came down to the they got a couple plays at the end. So I don't think
their speed really blew us away that much.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We'll excuse the players and take questions for the
coach.  
  
Q. Obviously frustrating when they had that 20-0 run. But what goes through
your mind when you can't score and they keep going on and scoring?  
COACH CHARLIE COLES: We'll be back. We'll be back. I mean, we have had more
runs on us this year and one thing I learned as a coach that we'll be back. At
some point we'll meet again.  
That's just kind of the ball club we have. And our kids played enough great
defense over the season that they would, you know, we kind of used to joke
around with them early in the year that, hey, we don't think we're a very
good, we're playing with a freshman guard at point guard who you have seen
shot the ball with six seconds left to go in the half, he shot it, and the
kid's played all year. And he's done pretty good job. But he's had moments
like that. And then we play him with a converted forward at point guard. So we
knew that at some point that that would be a weakness for us. And we
identified it, on, and said, hey, let's, it's like a person with a bad leg,
let's compensate for this bad leg and let's go. And when the score was 20-9
the guys will tell you exactly what I told them. I told them I said, hey,
let's hit a lucky one. That's all we need. Can somebody throw one up? Bank it
or something. Because we try to run four or five sets and couldn't get that
going.  
Tried to keep it light because the one thing we don't want to do -- the one
thing we didn't want to do with our guys, and I learned this about January of
this season, is, hey, these kids have really, this is something we don't do
well, but we do like seven other things well. And they're tough mentally.  
When we had our scoring droughts, if you check our season, when we beat Kent
at home, Ohio at home, Akron at home, we were known for some tremendous
driving. We had a scoring drought in Kentucky, which didn't seem that strange
to me in Rupp Arena, you know what I mean, we played down there early on and
one of the, one of the headlines said, Miami goes into nine minute drought or
whatever. And we still played them well.  
And in the end we had a chance to, that if we hit some shots the last three
minutes we might could have won that ball game.  
So that was something that we didn't do well but we weren't going to highlight
it. 20-9, for our guys, that didn't mean a hell of a lot. Because we felt like
even with a team as good as Oregon, that we're coming back. And we did. We got
some movement going. And we came back.  
  
Q. Are you surprised that they didn't try to make it a full court game with
all the talk about their quickness, that they really kind of played into your
hands with the half court game?  
COACH CHARLIE COLES: No, I hadn't seen them play much of a full court game. So
teams are creatures of habit. And/or people of habit. And I didn't think they
would be very good at a full court game. I was hoping for a full court game.
Because I don't think they do that real well. If you would have said Toledo, I
would of said, whoa, whoa, you know, because that is what they do well. They
pick up three quarter court.  
But I think that Oregon is just fast. They get the rebound and go. And then
they will put a little pressure on you. But I wasn't worried about their
pressure because I thought their pressure would have gave us some open shots,
would have allowed us to pass the ball better. And score would have been a
little bit higher, but we would have been fine had they don't that. So it
didn't surprise me at all that they didn't do that.  
I knew once the game, once I could judge the tempo, I wrote down on the board
before the game, when, with our players, I just said, be in charge of the
game. No matter what. We're in charge of the game.  
We want to establish some rules, boundaries and limitations out there, for
Oregon to understand. And I think we did it. I think we did it.  
We didn't necessarily want it to be a 50 point ball game, but it was. That
didn't hurt us none. So but it didn't surprise me, no. Because I don't think
-- I don't think they would do that real well over a course of a game. That's
just me judging from watching a bunch of tape on Oregon.  
  
Q. Down three there, Mike's shot at the top of the key that's about as good
of a look as you could get there?  
COACH CHARLIE COLES: Mike Bramos? Yeah, it was. But you know, gosh, boy, did I
want that to go in. You know what I mean.  
  
Q. Did you think it was going in?  
COACH CHARLIE COLES: No. I wanted it to go in. You know what I mean. I looked
and said, please go in. Please go in. And it didn't. But, you know how that
goes. I thought they did a decent job on trying to -- I think that they got
that game, when a team doesn't beat another team quite as, by as much as they
want to, I think that there's a tendency for a team to think that, boy, I
don't think we played well. So if that's the case, I think that they kind of
got that game maybe where they know now that they can play that game and then
when they play Winthrop, Winthrop is much faster, they will feel more
comfortable with that. So maybe our game may help them out a game or two from
now. I don't know.  
  
Q. Obviously their talent disparity on the court for an outsider was large.
Did you ever at any point of the game look down the other side and say, man, I
wish I had a couple of those guys?  
COACH CHARLIE COLES: Oh, yeah.  
(Laughter.)  
COACH CHARLIE COLES: I did that before the game.  
(Laughter.)  
COACH CHARLIE COLES: But you know what? I'll take Big Red though. I'll take
Tim Pollitz. And I'll take Mike Bramos. And then I'm wishing for some of their
guys, see. My two guys, a friend of mine told me early in the year, he said,
you're two, three, and four men can play, should be able to play with most
people in the country. And I feel that way. Michael Bramos kind of we played
him on the outside this year, but he's six-five, and he presents a physical
presence there. That, boy, in those kind of games, when you play the Kentucky
and Oregons, he looks pretty good. And then Tim Pollitz, you know, it's hard
to figure out how he looks, except God, how, you know, you don't know kind of
how to -- I think people don't guard him very well because they don't know how
to get him, you know. Got kind of a big butt and he reminds me of two players
who played in the past, not as good, but he reminds me of Adrian Dantley and
Mark Aguirre. Two guys that were undersized, that could post you and they
could post six-eight guys. And so, but, after those two, there was a lot of,
oh, I wish I had him, now I'll take him, I'll take one of their centers. I
don't even need to have Taylor and those guys, I'll take one of those centers,
big strong kids. Can get him to chopping some wood, find some trees and stuff
in Ohio like they got in Oregon, keep him working hard, and if we had
something like that, we would really be out of sight. Yeah. Yeah, I did. Yes,
I did. Thank you so much.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Marshall and
then we'll go to questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH MARSHALL: First of all, it's a great day to be a Eagle. It's a wonderful
occasion for these players, this program, this university. And the community
that we represent.  
It's been a long time coming. It looked very good about midway through the
second half. And then it all of a sudden we just, there was a leprechaun that
was closing that rim, couldn't hit a free throw. But we made the plays. Once
we got down one, these guys made the plays like they did all year long and for
that matter for the last three years for Mike and the last four years for the
other two. I'm very proud to coach these players.  
  
Q. Can you guys just talk about what it means to fine finally get over the
hump.  
TORRELL MARTIN: I just want to give honor to God first off. Because without
him we couldn't even made it this far.  
It was just a blessing. It feels great to be up here. Knowing we got the
victory. We played a great ND team and they played great. All we can do is
prepare the best that we can and that's what we did and it got us the victory
but it feels great. It was an unbelievable feeling that I'm feeling right now
and I'm sure my teammates feel the same.  
MIKE JENKINS: I second that. It feels great to finally get over the hump. We
have been working so hard this year. That was a goal after the Tennessee game
last year from the moment we got back to the locker room for our team meeting
at the end of the season and we knew we could get here, but we wanted to get,
we wanted to advance. We knew we would be a strong squad and that was always
on our mind throughout the season to get here and show the world what kind of
basketball we could play.  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: Like Torrell this is my senior year, it's just a special
moment for me. I've been trying to get this one for the last four years and to
finally get it is a great feeling and hopefully we can keep on going.  
  
Q. Looking from the other perspective, you had a 20 point lead and all of a
sudden that's gone. What were your feelings then and what did you think you
had to do at that point?  
TORRELL MARTIN: Any great team has a good run in them. So I knew at one point
they were going to make their run and come back. I knew it was going to be how
we responded to their run which ultimately determined the outcome of the game.
We handled it well. They came back, they took the lead, but we went on another
run and that ultimately propelled us to the victory  
MIKE JENKINS: We were expecting them to do that. We knew they were a good
basketball team. The coach would have them ready to make a run. But I know I
didn't expect them to make a 20 point run. But they did. And we didn't make
some plays for that while. But we in the end a veteran squad made the plays in
the end and the 20 point comeback didn't mean anything.  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: Last couple years we have been in some scoring droughts late
in the second half. I was telling the team we can't let that happen.  
We knew they would come back. They did. Just credit to our guys for being
poised and confident down the stretch.  
  
Q. Craig, speaking of that 20 point lead and the comeback, did you guys
maybe subconsciously become a little bit flat with the lead and stop doing
what you had been doing?  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: I don't think so. We had a good run there. Straight out the
bat of the second half. It's a they made some good shots and we just had to
lock them down and keep doing our thing. Keep going inside out and get easy
baskets.  
  
Q. Michael, talk a little about the job you did on Colin and it seemed like
you were pretty much everywhere he was?  
MIKE JENKINS: Yeah, that was in my mind the whole time. Coach got it in my
mind. Stay on him and no open looks. Because he's a great shooter. And that
was just in my mind to stay on him, stay on him, don't let him get the ball.
If he do get the ball pressure him as much as I can and make it hard for him
to make any shots.  
  
Q. Craig, can you talk about what it was like underneath the basket with all
their big guys and could Michael and Torrell address Craig's play especially
in that last run that you guys made to put it away.  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: I think the first half -- I played them good inside out. I
think in the first half I got a little itchy and didn't see their triple team,
double team where I should have kicked it out. And I just had to relax in the
second half. I think that happened. My teammates gave me the ball, and we made
easy baskets.  
TORRELL MARTIN: Every time we come out we usually look inside that's usually
our goal. A lot of times we end up shooting a lot of threes, but as a veteran
squad we learned that tonight was not the night for that. So we continued to
look inside to our monster down low and let him go to work. We'll take one out
of every two baskets for him or every two. It just doesn't really matter. As
long as we get the ball inside Craig is going to get his.  
MIKE JENKINS: Craig came to me, he was like, Michael, get the ball inside,
inside out and I took that to heart second half and came out, I mean first
half, we came out second half ready to get my big man the ball because I know
he was ready. I could see in his eyes that he was ready to make plays. And I
did that.  
  
Q. Craig, you've played in some big stages before, World Championships and
Olympics, can you kind of talk about this atmosphere that you have seen in
this tournament this year and how this kind of compares to what you've seen on
the world stage?  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: It's a great feeling. Can't say which one is better. The
Olympics or whatever. I just coming from New Zealand we don't really follow
the sports that well and over here that's the biggest thing. And being
involved with the NCAA tournament is a great feeling for me, knowing that a
lot of players pack home won't get this chance. And it's an honor for me and
my family.  
  
Q. You guys had a little trouble at the line in the second half shooting
free throws. How did you feel when Chris hit that three. That give you a
little breathing space?  
TORRELL MARTIN: I believe Mike passed that to him.  
MIKE JENKINS: Yeah.  
TORRELL MARTIN: I was just like, I remember looking in Mike's eyes and telling
him that's what you do. Because he made a lot of great plays of distributing
the basketball tonight and I told him that's your role tonight, you keep doing
it. And he did. He got Chris gain a wide open shot and that was like a point
of relief because it was kind of ended the little drought. We make shots when
it's time and that's what we did tonight.  
MIKE JENKINS: Yeah, I know I'm a great shooter and I saw that I wasn't
shooting the ball well tonight so once I got the ball and Colin Falls went for
the steal I was wide open, but somewhere in my mind it was like you haven't
made anything really this whole game. So when I saw Chris, I went ahead and
passed it to him and Chris being the clutch player that he is knocked down
that big shot there.  
  
Q. Can you gays talk about the whole Junkyard Dog thing? It may seem corny
to some people, but how have you guys kind of embodied that?  
TORRELL MARTIN: It's giving us some inner squad competition. I personally try
to get it every game. If I have to fall, I'm trying to scrape my knee to get
it. But it's just something else to add, it's a good coaching tactic from
Coach Marshall is to give you something else to motivate you to play hard. And
whether we had it or not we still played hard but it definitely give you
something else to look forward to.  
MIKE JENKINS: Oh, yeah, Junkyard Dog, I got it a couple times, but we go out
there coach engrains in us in practice, man, you always go got to play hard,
get on the floor every loose ball. Being a mid major we got to come up with
the intangibles. We came up with the lunch pails and hard hats stats. We got
to dive on the floor and get the loose balls. That's what coach wants us to do
and we went ahead and did that today and got most of the loose balls I believe
and came out with the victory.  
THE MODERATOR: While the Winthrop student-athletes are leaving the stage we'll
take questions now for the coach.  
  
Q. We'll just follow-up, who got the Junkyard Dog today?  
COACH MARSHALL: I would have to go back and I will look at the video. I know
that other than the run that Notre Dame got, we were able to come up with more
loose balls, I know that for a fact. We out rebounded them. And I think that
was the key to getting us the 20 point lead to begin with. I thought our guys
were a little quicker to the ball and we were very relentless on the glass.
And that's that was a key to the game. I'll determine that I think right now
we're going to give it to the whole team. Just going to keep it right in that
locker room and hope to be able to take it to St. Louis.  
  
Q. Can you kind of put this victory into perspective historically speaking
for Winthrop?  
COACH MARSHALL: It's huge. It's huge for me personally. It's huge for these
players right here. It's huge for our team. Our program. It's huge for our
league. Being the first time a Big South team has ever won a game. It's huge
for the State of South Carolina, I don't know when the last time they won a
game in the tournament. It's really big and it means a lot. It's been, it's
been nine years. Nine years of pouring your heart and soul into something and
being close in the past but knowing that everything that we have done in the
past 12 months from the time that shot went in against Tennessee last year,
we've been dedicated to this moment. And that's a lot to invest in something.  
And if that 20 point lead had evaporated and we had lost that game, boy, I was
going to be the dumbest coach in America. But right now I look at least like I
have some sense, and quite honestly, it just is very, very important. We have
put a lot into it. We took the team overseas in May. I had a job offer and
rescinded it within 24 hours and then you've got to just coach that same group
that has meant so much to this school. They represent this school very, very
well. And they're just wonderful people. It means a lot to all of us.  
  
Q. Is it safe to say that the Eagle has landed?  
COACH MARSHALL: The Eagle has landed. A small step for the Eagle, but a large
step for our university. It's just -- it's great.  
Coaches are a little looney to begin with and I got my four leaf clover.
Tomorrow's Saint Patrick's Day, we're playing the Irish, lucky number seven,
all of those things. And there's a guy in Rock Hill and we're having a dinner
at Thursday's Too restaurant on Monday with one of our board of trustee
members, Cathy Bigham was generous to take care of the team. And as the this
guy is walking out of the restaurant he just comes over to me, and he says,
Kit Myers and he says, coach, I want you to have my tie and please wear it in
the NCAA tournament. And it was like are you kidding? And I got some nice
ties. But I'm wearing this guy's tie and today. So we're all a little bit
nervous and Tom Webb gave me three four leave clovers. We talked to him the
day before we left and he put that in my mailbox the day we left. So it's just
all these things have come together and it's culminated in this big victory.  
  
Q. Notre Dame was up seven in the first half and got possession of the ball
and they can stretch the lead can you talk about what it took to turn that
around for you maybe X's and O's wise?  
COACH MARSHALL: It took some good defense. If you look at it, we held them --
and they are a great scoring team. We watched video where they score 80 and 80
and 80. We held them to 64 points. Now they did miss some free throws, but we
held them to 64 points. We held them to 42 percent shooting. And 18 percent
from the 3-point line. So that's a key. If we can hold people like Notre Dame
to 64 points, we have a chance to win. And our defense buckled down, I think
from that point forward they didn't score too many points in the rest of the
half. And even into the first five minutes of the second half.  
  
Q. I know you always prepare with a lot of confidence. Did you kind of feel
today was your day? Did you kind of maybe some good omens that you might be
willing to share early in the day or just kind of talk about the feelings
going in.  
COACH MARSHALL: Well, I knew that we were a capable team. I thought our seed
should have been a little higher and I'm not going to complain about the seed.
We won, we got the matchup, not that we wanted, he we -- once we started
watching film we said this team is really good. I had not watched Coach Brey's
team. I have in the past. I remember Quinn and before that the other point
guard Chris Thomas, but I hadn't seen this Colin Falls, Russell Carter. So
once I got into it I went, oh, geez, this is not a good matchup.  
But then right before the game I met this Notre Dame gentleman I'm out just
wandering or looking for where people are going to sit and meeting media
people and I meet this Notre Dame gentleman who was so nice, he acted like he
was in my way and he jumped out of his seat to get out of the way and I said,
no, you're fine, go ahead and sit down. He goes, well I just need to stretch
my legs, I'm a little nervous about this game. And he had a Notre Dame sweat
shirt. And I said, why are you nervous? I just don't like this draw. This team
is really good. Have you seen this team? They're like a bunch of gazelles and
the next thing you know, I said, yeah, I seen them, I coach them. And goes,
no, you don't. At that at that point I felt like, hey, we got a chance because
this guy is really nervous. But he was a wonderful, wonderfully nice man and
maybe his thoughts were good.  
I always underestimate my team because we're scratching and clawing and we're
supposedly a mid major, we're in a low major league, all of that stuff. But we
got some high major players. And right now we feel like we're at least a mid
major program. Today.  
  
Q. You talk about what you have seen or kind of scouted on the potential two
opponents and I know particular Oregon you were there and played them a couple
years ago, maybe start with them and just kind of what you've seen on them and
the possibility of Miami.  
COACH MARSHALL: Well, one of the benefits to being in this profession for some
years which I have now been in this business for a number of years, is I've
coached against all of these coaches in this little pod, if you will, I was in
the MAC for one year and coached against Coach Coles. I know what Miami of
Ohio does. We went out and played Oregon, like you said, in Eugene a couple
years ago. It was a great ball game. I know that they have got, they like to
get up and down and really shoot it and talking about a bunch of gazelles,
that's what they are. And I remember Brooks as a young kid he was a freshman
then so, what is he a junior now? And he's tremendous.  
And I also coached as an assistant coach against Coach Brey when he was a head
coach at Delaware. So you know, it's interesting we have already started
breaking down film of Miami of Ohio and Oregon. We have not done that in the
past to be quite honest with you. But we have already done that. One of my
assistant coaches, Earl Grant has Oregon, Coach Molinari has Miami and as soon
as I get out of here I'm going to go watch the game myself. So hopefully we
can get a good feel for the winner of this next game.  
  
Q. I was lucky enough to be with you guys during this whole week of practice
and I was really impressed with how physical and rough you guys practiced.
There was some concussions, some blood on the court. Do you anticipate going
like that tomorrow?  
COACH MARSHALL: Not tomorrow. Tomorrow will be a day where we got to really
rest our legs and work our minds. It will be a physical -- we'll shoot some
free throws, I can guarantee you that. But we will work on Oregon, or Miami
and just try to in a quick turn around get prepared mentally, because I
thought we had Notre Dame down. I thought that Randy Peele and my staff did a
wonderful job in preparing our team for Notre Dame. I thought that and that's
part of the reason that those shooting percentages are there. Most of the
times that they took a shot, there was a big time hand in the face and there
was a quite a bit of contesting of the shot. So we got a turnaround, I don't
foresee any concussions or blood on the floor tomorrow.  
  
Q. I know you had the four leaf clovers and the lucky tie and all that
stuff, and whatever that is, what about having Craig Bradshaw?  
COACH MARSHALL: This guy right here. Yeah. I think he's a little more valuable
than any of those other three items that I mentioned. And we're trying to find
someone from Oregon, Craig Bradshaw was just dominant. I didn't think they
could guard him inside then he steps out and hits a couple threes. He made his
free throws, he ran the court and got a did you think when we really needed
it. He did a great job defensively with all of their guy, just causing them
problems. The guy is a great player and you think he can play at the highest
level. And I'm not a NBA executive, but I would like to see him and Torrell
get that opportunity. So, yeah, that's the most valuable thing is this, these
quality players that we were able to bring to the dance.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and have an opening statement by Coach Barnes
and then take questions from the student-athletes, A.J. Abrams and Kevin
Durant. Coach?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Hard fought game. We felt coming in that if we could really
try to -- we wanted to pack our defense back in there as much as we could and
force as many perimeter shots and I thought for the most part that with we got
great play from a lot of different guys tonight.  
Connor Atchley and Justin Mason were great for what we needed. And at the end
these three guys they took over for us on the offensive end, made some plays
and found a way. It was hard fought. I thought we were a little bit jumpy to
start with, which you kind of expect that this time of year. But once we
settled in about 10 minutes I thought that the way we ended the half
offensively I thought the second half we would come out and continue that. And
I thought we did a pretty good job with it.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it to questions for text student-athletes and we'll
ask you to raise your hand.  
  
Q. Question for Kevin, please. How did they defend you differently in the
second half and how did you adjust?  
KEVIN DURANT: They did a great job of denying me the ball. When I got the ball
in the post they sent two or three guys at me. But I gave the ball up to my
teammates and they made plays as well and I got to the free throw line and hit
my free throws.  
  
Q. Kevin, there were a lot of times that you didn't touch the ball at all.
When you got the ball was your mentality just that you need to score and you
need to get to the line? Because it was such a close game?  
KEVIN DURANT: I just wanted to keep being aggressive. My teammates did a great
job of getting to the basket and making big time plays. I really don't have to
have the ball every possession, my teammates do a great job.  
  
Q. Kevin, D.J. this was your first NCAA tournament experience. What was the
difference at this level? Did you notice the difference tonight?  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: Not really. It kind of felt the same. Even though we know that
this is a big time game and the winner stays, loser goes home. So we played
like we were playing any other game and we played like it was your last game.  
  
Q. Kevin, when they teams defend you like that, inside, double or triple,
are you better off popping out and trying to get the ball away from the basket
and making a move?  
KEVIN DURANT: When teams double, triple me, I just pass it to the wide open
man. And they hit the shots. Really, I really like getting double and triple
teamed because my teammates do a great job of hitting shots and going to the
basket and the free throw line.  
  
Q. D.J. talk about the problems you had against their press. Even though you
got some good layups off of it second half.  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: Yeah, we didn't take care of the ball a couple of times. And we
got some turnovers. But we made a good adjustment and we started playing from
there and we kept control of the ball and the game.  
  
Q. For all the guys, is this the kind of game you expected?  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: Yeah, we knew they was going to press the whole game and trap.
So we was prepared for that. Coach got us ready for that. We knew we had to
box out and rebound. That was the biggest thing. That's why where the game was
won.  
A.J. ABRAMS: Yeah, it was pretty much what we expected. They're a good team,
an older team. So they were going to come in and try to impose their will on
us. That was the biggest adjustment that we were going to have to make. So I
think we came in with the right mindset that we had to block out and run. I
think we did a good job of that.  
KEVIN DURANT: Yeah, this team was very experienced. They are a great
rebounding team so all we had to do was box out and make shots. But they did a
great job today and it was a hard fought game for us.  
  
Q. You guys were talking about a defending Justin Hawkins yesterday. But
they brought some other weapons out there. Can you talk about that a little
bit?  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: They had a great team. Everybody could play. It wasn't like one
guy was going to do all the work. We knew we had to play everybody with a
different strategy and we had to box out and rebound.  
  
Q. Kevin, can you talk about with how difficult it was to get points down
low, can you talk about your mindset at the free throw line? You talked all
season about how there are games where you know you're going to need them?  
KEVIN DURANT: Well, like coach said, we was down a couple points and if I was
getting to the line I just wanted to hit them for my team. So every time I got
to the line I just had the mindset that I want to go up a couple points, five
or six points and hit them.  
  
Q. Kevin, what was the deal with the free throws? You missed one tonight.
Anybody give you a hard time?  
KEVIN DURANT: Man, I didn't follow through all the way. So Coach Matt gave me
a hard time. But I only missed one, so it was all good.  
  
Q. What would you say is the key to your victory tonight?  
KEVIN DURANT: We rebounded well at the end of the game. We got some key stops.
We hit our free throws.  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: Like Kevin said, rebounding, that was the key thing. We just
played hard. We defended well. Like I said, rebounding was the biggest part.  
  
Q. D.J. did you guys feel jittery at the beginning?  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: Not really. We just came out like we usually do and we played.
We just tried to try to run our offense and do what we do best and run in
transition.  
  
Q. Rick, can you talk about Connor, Connor's performance?  
THE MODERATOR: Let's do athletes first. Student-athletes first.  
COACH RICK BARNES: I can answer if you want to do athletes.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. I was wondering if any of the guys could talk about Damion James game. He
got those early fouls and missed a couple layups and speak to his
frustration.  
KEVIN DURANT: Everybody missed some easy tip-ins, but Damion, we just had to
keep encouraging him like you said and when we needed him he got some big time
rebounds and got some stops and he played well and defense and on offense. But
everybody missed a few. So we just tried to tell him, don't worry about it.  
  
Q. A.J. can you talk about Connor and what he brought?  
A.J. ABRAMS: He played great tonight. He came in and got some key rebounds for
us. He played his role to the T. He came in set screens, got other guys open,
and he rebounded and got some offensive put backs and I think that's what we
need from him.  
  
Q. I was wondering if all three of you or two of you at least, did you feel
like you played at a level or a standard where you could advance deep in this
tournament maybe win it? Did you play lake that tonight?  
A.J. ABRAMS: Like coach said, we came out a little jittery. I thought that was
an expected from us. But once we settled in I think that we showed at times
that we could compete with anybody in the country and make a deep run.  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: A.J. said we can compete with anybody in the country. We just
come out and play hard, play defense and rebound. That's what we do. We can
play with anybody.  
  
Q. Question for D.J., A.J., and Kevin. Outside of the game it looks like you
guys are going to be here for a couple days. Anything that you may have wanted
to do down time wise in the next couple days?  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: Really I think that everybody is probably going to get some
rest. Get off their feet. Just get some rest. That's the best thing to do.
Prepare for the next game.  
A.J. ABRAMS: Yeah, I probably will be sleeping most of the time. They pretty
much know if we're not playing basketball right now or school, I'm asleep. So
that's what I'll be doing.  
KEVIN DURANT: Yeah, just like A.J. just said, man, go to sleep. We don't get
that much sleep as it is. Just resting and getting prepared for our next game.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thanks, gentlemen. Let's take questions now for Coach
Barnes.  
  
Q. Connor, just talk about his performance inside the blocks and the key
plays.  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, this time of year it's never going to be easy. Going
into a game and I told the team before the game I said now look I don't know
how we're going to play on the offensive end we never know that. But if we
will defend and rebound we'll find a way to generate enough points.  
It wasn't a, by any means as fluid as we would like it to be on the offensive
end but in a game like that it's not going to be because of the pressure and
all that. But the fact is that Connor when Damion got in foul trouble came in
and did a great job and did a great job screening, what he and Justin I mean
both of them and we knew going in what they were going to try to do and they
did exactly what we thought. They were going to try to put the ball on the
blocks and challenge us there all night long. And when you think about it,
they shoot 40 percent and some of those came late there, but when and Connor
was down there most of the time doing it. But he got help. But Justin was
great. He was really good on the defensive end. About we needed more guys to
handle the ball. And Connor actually he did a pretty good job considering he
hasn't handled it very much against the pressure. But he and Justin were great
tonight. Both of them.  
  
Q. You said when Damion is good you guys are really good so for you to
overcome him getting in foul trouble, no 3-pointers from Kevin, that's not bad
with a bunch of freshman your first round?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Again I didn't think it was going to be easy. One, they're
a hard group of guys for us to play, because they're long, athletic, they
obviously have experience, maybe, I don't know if any, either one of the teams
had any quote unquote NCAA experience, but once the game gets going and you
get going, and you settle in and play and I thought our team showed a lot when
we got the lead and then when they dropped a couple bombs there now that they
were great shots and then but once they took the lead we came back and got
control of the game. And finished it out really well.  
It's not going, it's not supposed to be easy. And we knew it would be a tough
matchup. And but the one thing that we felt coming in we would have to get
play from not just one guy and that was kind of our theme coming in here too
that they had said we were a one man team and Justin I thought stepped up to
that and Connor and again Damion got off to a tough start missing some shots
and then the foul trouble. But we were able to work through it.  
  
Q. When Kevin gets as much attention as he does, how do you keep him from
getting frustrated, as good as he is a freshman in his first NCAA
tournament?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well again I thought that he was a little jumpy. Again they
do a good job with their length pressuring, going out there playing him. But
tonight I only talked to him more about I told him to let it come to him, I
said, you don't have to force anything, just be strong on the ball. If they're
going to keep doing it you're going to get to the foul line which he did. I
said whatever you do don't just settle for 3-pointers and I said keep driving
the ball and you'll get the calls because officiating did a great job with it.
And he stayed with that and I just told him on the defensive end he needed to
help us a little bit more and he was good defensively because we backed him
off and kept him kind of in the middle of the lane and he's a presence when he
does that.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit how D.J. and A.J. controlled the tempo and got
their points offensively?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, again, we wanted, I still want A.J., when people are
working, you guys are asking questions about how they played Kevin, they
really went after D.J. more than they went after Kevin in terms of always
coming down the floor trying to get the ball out of his hand and when that
happens A.J. has got to really come up and handle the ball. But then we don't
have a probably throwing the ball back to Kevin Durant in the open court. But
D.J. and I do believe this, when D.J. and A.J. are really playing and working
together, I do think it's a back court that's hard to deal with because of the
fact they can both shoot it. They both obviously can make plays with the ball
in their hand.  
D.J., again he's played more minutes than anybody. And he had to really work
to just to be involved because they were trying to take him out. But he stayed
with it and at the end of the game again he controlled it for us.  
  
Q. Rick, you mentioned the press and you knew they were going to press you,
do you feel like that was kind of a Washington, had some problem with it, got
some easy layups off of it and do you think Sunday you'll see more of that?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I don't know. Again they do press and again there's -- we
turned it over some. We got something out of it too. I'm not sure whether it
was one way or the other. I still look at it we had 15 turnovers and Kevin had
five, but all that wasn't against the press, some of it was when he had the
ball and in the scoring area and he turned and so you think about it we were
pressed all night long and I can tell you right now three of those turnovers
didn't occur against a press so 12 turnovers and I'm not sure where the other
ones came right off the top of my head, but again what the press does too
sometimes it keeps you from getting into a flow which we early we weren't
flowing, we were coming down and I thought we should have attacked early and
we were stop stopped and let them settle in and then we would have to get
going again where I wish we would just flow more. I kept talking to them just
flow into our offense and but overall again, we shoot 49 percent, they shoot
40, and we don't have a great day from behind the arc, but again, I just think
that it was going to be a heart fought game and it played pretty much like we
thought it would play.  
  
Q. The free throws is kind of a luxury for y'all. Y'all are very good from
the line. Did you get on Kevin for missing that one?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, we expect him to make them all. You know. But you
think about it, and you look at it, I mean the guys that shoot them are guys
that at one point in time this year knock on wood all those guys were over 85
percent. I don't know what they ended up doing, but we want the guys -- I was
proud of Justin stepping up there too. I thought his two were big at that
time. He did that. But again we some nights we have had nights where we made
it like this other nights we have had games where we just it goes the other
way. But that's how it all works out I guess but again overall I think that
coming into this situation with this guy, or this group of guys, I think that
again because we knew it was going to be a hard fought physical game and it
was. Thought we responded to it pretty well.  
  
Q. Talk about a little bit more about how Justin contributed defensively.  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, you know, after Craig played so well in the Big-12
tournament and I actually sit down with Justin after that and just he and I
and watched the game tape of him. And I told him I said you know you're not
the player, you're not playing the player that you can be. I said I'm not sure
why you're deferring right here. And we talked for a long time. I guess we
spent a couple hours together.  
Then we talked about a lot of different things. But I told him today coming in
that we thought obviously that Justin hawk was a big key and we said hey, you
we want you just to stay in front of him, make him work for everything he
gets. We're going to let him shoot jump shots. Let him shoot anything outside
of 15 feet. Just get a hand up but try to keep him from getting to the rim.
But Justin came back and he's been terrific after that. He's great in
practice, and I do think he was banged up a little bit and the time off helped
him. You go back early in the year Justin was one of the guys and I told you
guys many times that followed us, that he made us go early. And I thought what
he did tonight was huge. Especially with Damion getting into foul trouble that
he did.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, coach.  
COACH RICK BARNES: Thank you.
